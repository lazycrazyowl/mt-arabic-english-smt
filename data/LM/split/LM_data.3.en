Asia 2000: Top of Group Two Between Kuwait and Korea and China Flexes Muscles Against Indonesia  by Michel Al-Haj
The two ties might be of benefit to all four teams but could also be detrimental to some like South Korea which aspires to lead the group and move comfortably into the quarter-final on its way to compete for the title which it took in the first two copies of the championship.
The Chinese team is supervised by veteran Yugoslav Bora Milotenovic, who is well-known in the World Cup where he has recently turned up four times in a row, each time with a different team. Before they signed him, the Chinese studied him carefully in the hope that he would lead them to the World Cup finals.
The Indonesian coach came out completely satisfied with the performance of his players against Kuwait and promised a good performance in the match against China, whereas the team's manager Mohamed Zayn did not consider the result as important as the players performing well in demonstration of their readiness to meet the major teams.
The match is considered the climax of the second group but preference after the teams' performance last Friday goes to the Koreans in terms of preparation, speed and exploiting opportunities. But in soccer, each match has its own circumstance and calculations so it is difficult to anticipate what might happen tomorrow as the Kuwaiti and Korean greats both have all the ingredients needed for a win.
The Kuwaiti team faced the problem of not scoring against Indonesia which the other teams in the group regarded as a bridge to reach the quarter-finals. Its four goal scorers, Jassim al-Huwaidi, Bashaar Abdullah, Faraj Luhaib and Khalaf Salama tried their luck but recklessness in front of the opponent's goal was a characteristic feature of their game.
The Korean team showed in its first match that it is not possible to slip up nor is it possible to confront it with a pre-planned attack as it has effective weapons for such occurrences, especially in the highly technical ability of its players and their fabled speed.

As for Saudi newspaper al-Riyadh, it called on Clinton to "understand that he is dealing with geographical facts and an Arab nation that can no longer control its feelings and has buried diplomatic issues at the sight of the killing of an innocent child."
It added "no one doubts for a moment that the aim of the pressure exerted by the Americans and the West is to stop the intifada and abort this Arab and Muslim unity," expressing its fear that "these pressures might move into the corridors of the meetings in Sharm el-Sheikh so that Ehud Barak will go back to lying and Washington will go back to selling these lies [...] and the Palestinian Authority will once again believe these lies and promises."

Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi paid a surprise visit to Damascus, Tehran's main strategic ally in the region, on October 11 where he met with President Bashar al-Assad.
In Beirut, Kharazi met with President Emile Lahud and Hizbollah leaders, as well as with the United Nations' secretary-general Anan Kofi and Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
However, it echoed Lebanese and Palestinian demands for the release of "all captives" held by Israel and at the same time insisted on the release of the four Iranians kidnapped in Lebanon in 1982 who may be held by Israel.
Kharazi demonstrated Tehran's good intentions, reiterating to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein Tehran's desire to implement the border agreements signed in Algeria in 1975 between the Shah of Iran and Saddam Hussein, who was vice-president at the time but who denounced the agreements on September 17 1980, five days before the Iraq-Iran war broke out, as soon as he became president of the Republic.
However, he reminded Baghdad robustly of the need to stop supporting the Mujahideen Khalq organization, the armed opposition to Tehran's regime, and to release all prisoners of war.
The title-holding Saudi team suffered a bitter defeat (1-4) against its Japanese counterpart in its first match in the championship yesterday Saturday.

"The Storm," a political Egyptian film about reinstating respect for the principles that have been ignored in the same way the citizen has been ignored     by Riyadh Abu Awad
This introduction is followed by an illustration of the breakdown which prevailed over the Arab nation during the Gulf War through the life of an ordinary Egyptian family whose economic horizons are limited because the salaries of the mother (Yusra), who works as a teacher, and the father (Mahmoud Abdullah), combatant who lost his leg in the October 1973 war, are insufficient to build a future for the family.

Unlike previous years, the Fair's organizers reported a great slump in sales volume despite the discounts, which were sometimes as high as 40 percent.
But, the supervisor of Dar Al-Arqam, Hassan Al-Fann, indicated that "those who are interested in this type are now following them up through the Internet and laser discs," which "enable them, for example, to read Sahih Al-Bukhari for less than 100 Syrian pounds."
Islamabad ? "An-Nahar"
Based on the questions and inquiries we have received, and our opinion on the events of the past five days, we say that the Crusader campaign led by Bush and Blair - the Crusaders - is still going on in the Islamic Afghanistan lands, and on its people who prove day after day their sacrifices, steadfastness and insistence on supporting their religion and faith.
Second: The Al Qaeda Network declares that Bush the father and Bush the son, and among them Clinton and Sharon, are at the top of the criminal's list of Zionists and Crusaders who committed the ugliest practices and most vicious atrocities against the Islamic nation, including murder, torture, and expulsion. Millions of Muslim men, women and children were killed for no guilt of their own.
What mistake is repeated three times?
What will they say when they stand before God Almighty for judgment, and what will they say, "when the female infant buried alive is questioned"?
In this regard, we praise the struggling youth who know their role and the way to strike back at the oppressors, and consequently killed them. We also praise the Muslims in the East and West of the world who went out on angry demonstrations against this criminal attack, oppression and injustice in the East and West of the world.
And Powell and others in the US Administration know that when Al Qaeda Network threatens, it follows-up, God willing.
May peace and the blessings of God be upon you.

Deputy Minister of Defense, in separatist Abkhazia Gari Kobalia, stated that 15 Georgian and Chechen fighters were killed yesterday in confrontations with Abkhazian troops in the Kodor Mountain passes, where the battles were intensified.  This was after approximately 400 fighters, who were besieged by Abkhazian troops, were able to penetrate towards the north in the direction of the Russian borders.
It is noted that Abkhazia, located west of Georgia on the Black Sea coast, unilaterally declared its independence in August 1992, and defended it in a conflict that lasted one year and resulted in the killing of thousands and the fleeing of more than 250 thousand Georgians.
In Geneva, Robinson said in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation the BBC, "It is a problem similar to the Rwandan one." She pointed out that she does not want "innocent civilians in Afghanistan to become victims of what happened on September 11th" in the United States.
She added: "I would be elated if the war stopped for a while, as that will allow the arrival of intensive urgent aid (¡¦) very difficult for humanitarian convoys to enter the country in the midst of a military attack."
Last week trucks were able to deliver one thousand tons of food to these areas.
He pointed out that the aid program to the Afghani people is considered to be "one of the largest in the history" (of the program) "in view of the size of the needs and the logistical difficulties."
Tajikistan, which shares a 1,340 kilometer border with Afghanistan, was torn apart by a violent civil war between the years 1992 and 1997.
It said that the Iranian authorities set up two new camps at a distance of five kilometers inside Afghani territories to receive refugees fleeing the American raids.
Beijing Embassy in Riyadh Denies Banning Arabs from Travel to China
An employee of a Chinese travel agency said that the Chinese Civil Aviation Authority issued directives on the 17th calling for travel agencies to stop selling airline tickets to citizens from a number of Islamic and Arab countries.

In the midst of fears of a recurrence of the September 11th attacks, three Arab passengers were forced to disembark a Swedish chartered aircraft before leaving Stockholm en route to the Canary Islands on Saturday.
But the pilot insisted on his position, and forced all passengers to disembark to have their bags checked. The plane took off three hours after its scheduled time.

People stopped going to church, and Kano became more like a ghost town."
But the Chief of Police, Yakobo Bilo Oba, reiterated that the number of those killed did not exceed 13, among them five trouble-makers who were killed by police officers, and police arrested a hundred others.
The spokesperson for the local government, Ibrahim Guawargua, said that a group of "trouble-makers" was responsible for the violence, and that they targeted stores of "both Muslims and Christians" and that "there is no religious basis for what happened," despite the fact that a number of attackers were heard shouting "God is Great."
It is noted that Nigeria has a population of 120 million people, and that Christians are spread in the southern states, while Muslims live in the northern states.

6. The immediate halt of punishment campaigns against the population.
10. Opposing policies of backwardness and the impoverishment of the Algerian people.
14. Allocating unemployment allowances at 50 percent of the minimum wage for job seekers.
Yesterday, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami simultaneously condemned the religious extremism of the ruling Islamic "Taliban" movement in Afghanistan, and the US strikes "against an innocent and unarmed people" in this country.
He added, "The innocent and unarmed people of Afghanistan are also the victims of an attack by a major power that is striking them with arms and missiles to revenge a criminal act."
It noted "All the attacks for an entire week did not weaken the Taliban, but targeted innocent civilians."
According to police, 15 thousand protestors gathered in Berlin, and according to the organizers, there were 30 thousand in front of city hall where they held the slogan "No to War! Yes to Peace!" and demanded "Justice Instead of War and Terror," before heading to the "Gandermanmarkt" east of the capital.
Thousands of people, including members of Islamic and Christian groups, participated in a demonstration in the center of London to protest the striking of Afghanistan.
A Muslim woman, crying, said: "They will be asked about this on judgment day."
In Nice, 350 people demonstrated in front of the US Consulate.
In Ankara, eyewitnesses reported that approximately 200 people organized a demonstration outside Incirlik air base, chanting anti-Washington slogans, and calling for closing the base.
The Indian Director Mrinal Sen said: "We must all unite against terrorism and imperialism.

The victory of our brave resistance in our south was the fruit of grave sacrifices and many heroic acts, embodied by the fighters, day after day, in the field of resistance against the unjust occupation of our land. In the years of resistance, the mounting and continued losses among the occupation forces led to a deep division in the Zionist society regarding the feasibility of the continued presence of occupation forces in southern Lebanon. The occupation's defeat, its army's escape, and the flight of its agents from our land caused a shock in the Zionist community, especially after the media covered with pictures and words the immense positive moral effect on our people and nation after watching the Israeli Zionist army escape in panic, the army that was considered unbeatable, and the unmatched power in the region.

Annual Celebration of the Union of the Southern Matn Industrialists Afram: No Halt in Immigration as Long as We Do Not Develop Sectors Sarraf: Enhancement of Industrial Competition Needed Sarraf Afram
At the beginning, the president of the Southern Matn Industrialists Union Raja Dagher spoke, and called for "Working seriously to keep up with the implementation of the value added tax law on the facilities and deductions for industrialists, so that it does not come at their expense."
He believed that the enhancement of the competitive abilities of national industries requires a quick handling of the cost of production, "and we have started to see the positive aspects of implementing the quick program launched by the Minister of Industry in preparation for the industrial development plan, which started with handling the cost of production, funding, procedures at ports, specifications, industrial zones, industrial classification, industrial storage and social security."
He declared that the Ministry is seeking to accomplish three priorities that are:
He considered the open markets an opportunity for Lebanese industries, calling on the state to do what will facilitate the work of industrialists, create the appropriate environment and provide the conditions that will ensure balanced competition.
Feeding with 21/24 Current After Repairing emergency Breakdown
It is known that the production factories in all of Lebanon are working at their full capacity, after activating the two Tyre groups, the two Baalbek groups, the five Al Jeeh groups, the three Al Zahrani groups, and the three Al Zouq groups. It must be pointed out that the third group of Al Zouq, out of service since approximately a year and a half due to general maintenance, could go back to production in one month, with repair work undertaken by technical teams in Lebanon Electrical Company, in cooperation with technicians from "General Electric" and "Ansaldo" almost completed.
The Electric Company has declared in a statement it issued on Saturday the return of the current to the 21/24 hours daily program, saying that it was affected for only two hours (the night of 12/10/2001) in a part of administrative Beirut and some areas, due to the disconnection of the "neutral line" (the lightening line), and its touching of the 150 kilovolt Al Jeeh - Al Jamhour line (numbers 3 and 4), which caused the disconnection of these two lines.

It must be said that the government marketing gave results despite the fact that the new policy for the Prime Minister was the object of suspicion in some pessimistic or perhaps realistic circles. They considered the government's talk political and not able to be interpreted into clearly defined economic figures, whether in making Lebanon reclaim its regional position in view of international escalation due to the continued international war on terrorism, and the expectations of it lasting a long time, or in attracting foreign capitol and investments whose course is hard to estimate in view of the state of alert of market trends, whose attraction needs more time and internal measures, enhanced by a climate of trust and investment.
The volume of Central Bank purchases in the last period was estimated at approximately one hundred million dollars.
This increase is not the result of new subscriptions of banks, but the result of barter procedures (Al Sawab), which allowed banks to replace long-term bonds with two-year bonds with a higher interest rate of 2% in the secondary market.
These sources believe it is not unlikely that this reservation will be at the heart of the awaited final report of the IMF, due in the middle of this week.
While the IMF is still holding its position on the structural economic and financial reforms of the government and subject to its commitment to implementation, it is believed that the challenge for advancement in the proposed procedures is still present, in view of the continuous weakness of the Lebanese economy.
3. The Fund's wagering on the government's ability to deal with its problems and lack of need for the "Paris 2" conference of the IMF, on the basis that the solution will only come from within, and its wagering on the fact that foreign aid is not sufficient framework for a solution.
These signs point to a growing spirit of cooperation - seeking wide response to international problems.
General Manager of the Lebanon Electric Company George Mu'awwad told "An-Nahar" yesterday that the current program has become the normal status of the current, "unless there are breakdowns, similar to what happened at the Al Jamhour Station last Friday night, when the 'neutral line' (lightening line) was disconnected due to the factor of time."
Afram hosted the day before yesterday (Saturday evening) the annual dinner of the Southern Matn Industrialists at the Regency Palace Hotel in Edma, in the presence of Minister of State Pierre Hilo, Members of Parliament Akram Shuheib, Salah Hanin, Antoine
Then came the publishing of lists of names of suspected groups or/and individuals.
After criticizing not taking the opinion of the Association with regard to the affairs of the workers and employees, he called for opening the doors of discussion and dialogue, and expressed the readiness of the Association to present solutions in keeping with the interests of the communications sector and the interests of the employees.
The committees, after a joint meeting at the end of the week, called on administrations and competent public authorities, especially the Ministries of Economy, Trade, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Transportation, to seek the reduction of fees and airport and sea port allowances imposed on Lebanese companies and agencies, "provided that the government undertakes to make the additional required coverage when necessary, similar to most other governments."
The head of the Federation of Printers Joseph Sader warned of the negative repercussions for any raise in wages for the time being, and considered "that the printing sector, including publishers and bookshops, is unable to continue work with its administrative structure and its financial and productive capabilities."
International Communications to Solve the Palestinian Cause Arise from the Issue of Refugees America Wants Victory in the Region in Keeping with its War on Terrorism Solution and Terrorism Emil Khoury
It was noted that the Israeli response to Bush's talk was not negative this time, after the previous response to that by Ariel Sharon angered the White House because he said that Israel does not accept Bush's placation of Arabs at its expense in the campaign against terrorism.
In another interview with an Arab magazine in July 1999, he said "Israelis will not enjoy peace unless the Palestinians enjoy it," and that he still believes in the vision in his book "A New Middle East."
So why should the Middle East remain bound in restraints and poverty?
To deal with this poverty, all the economies of the region must be made open and transparent.
And what is the basis of this initiative?
There are other differences between Israelis and Palestinians over settlements and the right of return of the refugees, which necessitates agreeing first to the creation of the Palestinian State in the current situation, with negotiations on the hanging issues to come later, unless the US Administration has a plan for a permanent settlement it is careful not to reveal for the time being.
Whether this information on the presence of such a US plan is correct or not, what is certain is that the efforts are concentrated on finding a solution for the Middle East problem, and that the US Administration is concerned with ending this problem more than ever, because finding a solution for it will end the excuses of those accused of being terrorists, and those who consider the United States unjust and unfair in dealing with Palestinians and Arabs and biased with Israel.
Only the "Al Wahah" strayed from this concept and relatively still is, despite the dangerous strikes aimed at their privacy in the past years.
Until now, these regimes still prevent their streets from going with the instinctive religious current sympathetic  "symbol of terrorism" Osama bin Laden, similar to that witnessed in the streets of Islamic countries in central Asia.
When bin Laden confronted the first direct enemy, these regimes were in double trouble, between the need for striking terrorism and fear from the street which is not at all experienced in democratic expression, until it became that any expression is a nightmare for the regimes from the parties opposed to them.
Only there are demonstrations organized by true democratic minds, immune to brain washing, even that practiced by democratic regimes.
The spokesman for the White House confirmed the same sense, insinuating that there is no change in the American conviction in the mechanism that must be used to calm this conflict.
These sources do not deny the importance being given to the return of the US Administration's interest in the Palestinian-Israeli problem, which constitutes an important part of Arab hopes, considering the American indifference after the arrival of President George Bush, which resulted in great distress for the Arabs.
And are there secret efforts being prepared in the dark to resume bilateral negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis?
This serious decision was taken several months before the terrorist attacks that took place last September 11th in Washington and New York."
While Alterman denies knowledge of any current secret efforts to revive the bilateral Palestinian - Israeli negotiations, he expressed his belief that "both concerned parties, meaning the Palestinians and Israelis, are avoiding serious negotiations for the time being."
That is why the concerned diplomatic sources believe that exaggeration in the rumors of optimistic climates might be inappropriate unless the Arabs actually do receive a plan or specific guarantees on this initiative, even if they wanted to corner the United States to focus on its declared commitment voiced by its President.
The civilization of the picture, this is what was said of the twentieth century, until we believed that the picture, whether it is photographic, cinematic or television, became stronger than the reality it reflects, or seeks inspiration from, or incites, or preserves in cans.
But the picture of what followed that moment disappeared.
It is wrong because what has been happening in the United States for a month now indicates that national mobilization, even nationalism, is capable of reaching a climax without being fed by scenes of the event that caused it.
This ethical trade rule is not the only factor behind the absence of pictures of the "World Trade Center" victims.
Because no one can follow this rule without withholding all the pictures, according to a number of journalists and European network officials.
No civilization and no picture.
It is a phenomenon that changes televisions into mere radios.
The chaos of news justifies the writing that is piling up on the screen?
The pictures are few and there is plenty of talk.
It agrees with it.
And so is the "Arab street" available for everybody.

Moulin Rouge Between Two Eras A Refuge for those Fleeing Defeat Colette Kissed the Marchioness and Got Banned
The matter was made worse by the policy of repression, which forbade every new innovation.
One night, August Renoir noticed the clamor made by a beautiful and fat girl, whose show name was La Goulue, as she was passing between customers.
As for Yvette Guilbert, who played a secondary role after La Goulue's success, she was a wonderful voice and performed a strange, distinguished and magical blend of songs. She wore a same pale-yellow dress, and put on the two dirty gloves, with her long arms like those of a grasshopper, and the collar of her dress revealing a skinny chest.
But the sexual liberation vanquished the cabaret and the Moulin Rouge was transformed into one of the French archeological sites, like the Olympiade, to return once again to rekindle the ashes and restore its splendor, grandeur and dances to the magical tunes.
He is capable, with ease, of defeating his enemies, especially the communists.
America was and remains a pioneer in everything. Can we imagine Jacque Chirac boarding a 747 Boeing aircraft kidnapped by a terrorist to beyond the Caucacus, like Harrison Ford in the movie "Air Force One", or Georges Pompidou chasing after Annette Benning in the middle of an official reception, like Michael Douglas in the Movie "American President" by Rob Reiner.
The movie "Dave" by Ivan Rightman also dealt with President Kennedy, who is played by Kevin Kline, a look alike that people sympathize with and like more than the real president. That proves that John Kennedy was a popular model for the cinema, and so was President Clinton, who seemed, like John Travolta, to be attractive, playful and a womanizer.
The president himself turns into a thief in the movie "Major Power" by Clint Eastwood and is surrounded by wicked and criminal advisors in "Crime at 1600".
As for television, it handled American presidents in two series, the first "In the White House", which shows the movements of flattering advisors and confidantes in the wilderness of Washington.
The strange thing in Hollywood cinema is that it shows the American presidency either as a closed fortress or a lunatic asylum.

Officials spoke of the White House planning for a government to succeed the "Taliban" regime.
Land anti-missile launchers started shooting after the electricity was cut, while planes were heard flying in the skies of the capitol.
It explained that the planes dropped three bombs near Pagram, the airbase controlled by the opposition.
Jalalabad Governor Mawlana Abdul Kabir told reporters that the "Taliban" regime is ready to think about handing bin Laden over to a third country "not subject to the authority of the United States, and not close to the "Taliban" if Washington hands the movement evidence of bin Laden's involvement in the September 11th attacks. He said the "Taliban" is renewing its offer to look in bin Laden's situation during direct negotiations with the United States.
Bush, on his return to the White House from Camp David Resort yesterday afternoon, rejected the "Taliban's" offer to hand over bin Laden to a third country after the movement receives evidence proving his involvement in the September 11th attacks.
He stressed that "When I said no to negotiations, I meant no negotiations (...) we know he is guilty (...) hand him over."
Experts had believed that the United States must be a major part in forming a government in Afghanistan, to avoid a dangerous authority vacuum in the country and in Central Asia in case the "Taliban" regime is overthrown.
Powell's Visit Today Puts Pakistan to the Test Only Quick Success of War Can Save Musharaf from Internal Storms
Between this and that, his rule seems at its most difficult moment.
One leader of these groups said, "American soldiers will be sent back to their families in plastic bags," and threatened to "destroy American aircraft parked there."
When security forces prevented demonstrators from entering the city, conflicts ensued.
As dangerous as this may be, it is only one aspect of the challenges facing Musharaf.
The leaders of the religious parties declared their insistence on the call for a general strike today in all parts of Pakistan, to coincide with the visit of US Sectary of State Colin Powell to Islamabad, where he will discuss with Musharaf the future of Afghanistan after the fall of the "Taliban" government, stress the need for not escalating with India, which he will visit as well, and halt support to "jihad" parties waging attacks on the Indian troops in the disputed Kashmir region.
In this context, Pakistani Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar said yesterday: "I believe that the longer this operation lasts the more the damage, and the more the numbers of Afghan refugees entering Pakistan increase, the more the irritation and anxiety will become in Pakistan."
But the internal situation is becoming more turbulent. Musharaf had already put his armed forces on alert, and deployed thousands of armed soldiers, for the first time since assuming power two years ago, in all the major cities, to face the fundamentalist's threats of the resorting to violence.
And this alone can save his regime from grave danger.
His grandfather was Abbas Effendi Hamiyyeh Al Qanouni (1856-1920)

So, Jiryes Baz respected his oath and was faithful to the Prince in peace and war, according to what the late Doctor Fuad Afran Al-Bustani wrote.
A Druze man delivered the message to him, who handed him a small piece of paper, pleading with him to read it before entering to the Prince.
After a fight between the four men and Jiryes Baz that lasted for half an hour, the great leader was killed.
Jiryes Baz was thirty nines years old.
Because that was difficult for you in his capacity as the highest spiritual authority in the country, he decided to abdicate the Patriarchal chair.
There still remains one headline that dominates the Christian situation in particular, and that is the continuation of the floundering in agreements of conciliation and the floundering in drawing a vision that leads to differentiating going up from the abyss.
Upon the ruins of the temple, the architects of the Ta'if Constitution came out to announce to the world the birth of an accordant regime, whose basis is "stripping" the Presidency of the Republic of fundamental authorities it once had and pumping selected forces into a political structure that did not take into consideration the balances of old powers, which lost the war and are seeking today for a new appearance, taking advantage of the success of the polarizing axis of Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri with his ally Waleed Junblat.
* The second obstacle is represented by the disapproval of the Karami family of the President of the Republic issuing a special amnesty for Ja'ja'. They are not in the process of thinking of dropping their personal charges against him as an arrangement that opens the door for reconciliation.
* Then comes the case of Elias Al-Zayek, in addition to ramified military hatreds that have not healed yet. Not to mention that former President Elias Hrawi is still affected by the plot to assassinate him by wiring the ear piece of his telephone.

Dr. Nizar Dandash and his colleague (Harmel Municipality Member) Mifleh Alweh (written thus, but pronounced Allao) surprised me as they were under a shady tree at Harmel Bridge waiting my arrival for the poetic evening, organized for me there by the "League of Tomorrow's Youth" in the Abdeen Forum.
A (24-year-old) mother of two children, afflicted with lung cancer, is in dire need of chemical therapy sessions. Her husband is sick in hospital and she needs four million Lebanese pounds. She seeks help to enter Mount Lebanon Hospital's Radiology section.
Nizar Al-Amin delivered a speech on behalf of "Insan", in which he introduced the Foundation and its activities. And then, Michel Suleiman welcomed the audience on behalf of the school.
He considered the conference as "a very complicated political moment at the international level, during which international politics have witnessed a paroxysm between America and its close allies and followers and the other peoples of the World, as the concept of globalization, presented in accordance with the American logic, has called for identifying absolute hegemony in the economy and politics and the obliteration of the identity of third world peoples."
He talked about the psychological aspect of the illness and attributed its cause to "the ignorance of the individual of the meaning of life and the meaning of the human being and God.
He defined the racist element as "a set of specificitions and elements found in a human being or a group that discovers that it is different from the set of elements found in others, thus leading to the emergence of a process of accepting or rejecting others. In the other case, racism emerges."
The second means is "comprehensive secularism, which respects all religions and is a catalyst for establishing faith because it liberates it from all pressures."

He continued: "The meeting today is not an ordinary meeting because the stage is not ordinary. Therefore, it is necessary to record some remarks as we live today significant events, which have doubtless left a reflection and will leave great reflections at the level of the World.
We have emphasized and still emphasize that we are against terrorism in all its forms and that we have denounced what has happened in the United States of America, because any act that targets innocent people in the size of this dangerous terrorist act, with all the meanings that the word carries, is objectionable. Lebanon has paid a dear price and the Arabs and Muslims also have paid high prices at the hand of Israel with its pursuit of continuous organized terrorism.
Even those who have supported the war, warned against the danger of its expansion and the danger of slipping into operations that would lead to human losses in the ranks of civilians.
Today, the voices have started to resound, from demonstrations, denunciations, warnings and security reflections in a number of States, which eventually are expected."
Despite of what has happened in this country, Lebanon is still a unique, distinguished civilized model in the World. Here, the big responsibility falls on us, whatever our political, spiritual, information and social positions, in order to maintain this distinction, this variety, this model and to safeguard this unique experience.
The Chairman of the Education and Culture Committee, Deputy Bahiyyeh Al-Hariri, held a ceremony in honor of the prince of the Asir Province, Khaled Al-Faisal Bin Abdul Azeez on the occasion of the launching of the Arab Thought Foundation from Beirut.
The Arab Thought Foundation is a distinctive sign among the signs for the future."

This is a rejected matter and it cannot be allowable to discuss such matters at this critical stage after Lebanon has healed from the terrorist war which was led by Israel and whomever stands behind it."
Baqardouni: We Are Determined with regard to the Modernization and Unification Project in the Party and the Homeland.
The Falange Party fought the French mandate and its army in the street for the sake of independence and has defended the system of freedoms since the fifties, when the Middle East was swarmed by communist ideas and waves of military coups d'etat. It finally was compassionate with the living and social needs and problems of the people, especially that the Falange Party is the party of the middle class and the poor families.
Nabatiyyeh ? "An-Nahar":
He considered that "everything said in this framework is merely talk in talk.
The resistance and its martyrs constitute a project of justice so that truth may prevail."
He said: "The behaviors of Hitler and the leaders of terrorism in the States do not change the Christian religion, which is a religion of love.
He said: "Had justice been established in the Palestine, the Golan and the Arab region, not much would have happened because the terrorism of the state surely leads in the end to the germination of terrorism of individuals, and not vice versa. Israel's record is full and can accommodate encyclopedias of examples of the terrorism of the state from Palestine to Syria and Lebanon."
Sa'ad said: "The meeting dealt with the given facts and changes worldwide and what is happening in Asia and the American escalation there, as well as the escalation in the region in confronting demands.
He questioned "why this insistence on punishing the city, its surroundings and its inhabitants? Does pleasing the Americans come at the expense of Sidon City and its economic interests, which are paralyzed in the first place by the general economic- social situation?"
Gheith spoke first. He said: "Lebanon gave clear proof when it defeated Zionist tyranny; gave the indicator of its approaching defeat and eviction from the Golan Heights, Palestine and Jerusalem; decided the battle by proving the truth and killing falsehood; and refuted the illusions and the dreams despite all the aspects of power that we see today bombing, destroying, repressing, and killing in Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq and Chechnya under the slogan of fighting terrorism and responding to it with uglier and wider terrorism (...). It is on the oppressor that the disasters fall and everything happens as the Exalted and Omnipotent wants,  not as America and her allies want, including all the forces and regimes that are fused into the circle of globalization and its hidden meaning, which is holding the world by the throat with international Zionist fingers."
This Administration, which complains today of terrorism and recruits the world politically, militarily and financially to eliminate it, after it had paid the price dearly with lives and property.
Qabbani considered that "what is happening today in Afghanistan is not different from what happened yesterday in New York and Washington, it is even more terrifying and horrific.
The elimination of terrorism must urge world leaders and international institutions to search for its reasons, and work on dealing with these reasons, because continuing to declare war against the world and dragging it to extremist stands through threats and intimidation may drag the whole world into a something whose results are not commendable."
What world are they calling for?
Lebanon's message was always a message of dialogue and living together, not just among its Muslim and Christian sons, but also in the world. Hence, Lebanon was always and still is the living model for civilized living in the world."
Hamdan considered that "(American President) George Bush, while declaring war on Islam, is not a follower of Jesus, the son of Mary. Bush is not a Christian when he declares war on Islam because Jesus and Moses are the brothers of our Prophet."
* Former Deputy Fathi Yakan described the United States as a "the school for terrorism in the world."

The attendees moved to the center's courtyard and sat in their assigned seats. The Battalion Commander, Colonel Timo Eikdal gave a speech in which he said: "This past period included difficult times for you and we saw the missiles pouring down on the villages and their surroundings.
Today we see school buses driving on the public road in safety (...). Your help and support for us, and your cooperation with us, are unmatched.
I respect these principles, especially in these days when international instability prevails in the world."
A present was sent to Mr. Ali Al Amin, who could not attend for health reasons.
Deputy Muhsen Dalloul considered that "everything being said about American messages and lists of names of Lebanese was meant for diverting attention only and that there is no value to this question and it should not cause any concern at all. A confrontation between us and the Americans took place in the past, and those who confronted the Americans in Lebanon were defending themselves. The Americans were not in Washington when the operations against them took place, but in Lebanon.
In answer to a question, he said, "Terrorism is when a man kills for the sake of killing destruction, and not for the sake of a cause.
He said: "America must understand an important fact, which is the necessity of solving this problem from its roots. But to strike in a hateful manner will turn against them. Even if they eliminate Osama bin Laden, ten thousand bin Ladens will be hatched and a hundred thousand Mulla Mohammad Omars will be hatched."
It "scattered" all matters and led to endless problems and negativities."
Then there was a speech by Hamadeh, in which he regretted the absence of foreign lecturers, considering it "unjustified". He said that "At this time, and more than at any other time, pharmacists, physicians and all workers in the medical field are waging the battle of the ethics of their profession, just as we fought it together to shut down illegal pharmacies, pass the new pharmaceutical law, and rationalize the use of medications.
The Ninth Pharmacists Conference, entitled "The Irrational Use of Drugs", which was organized by the Pharmacists Syndicate, was concluded yesterday.
It prohibited "opening up the territories and skies to American armies and their allies."
"The scholars condemn the American aggression on Afghanistan and consider it an unjust aggression, especially as it assails an impoverished people. The international community should have thought of how to save it from the difficult economic situation it is going through, instead of holding it accountable for a crime it did not commit.
The participating scholars, based on their shariite mandate, stipulated in the Statement of Shari'ah Verdicts, confirm the inadmissibility of opening the skies and lands of Muslims to the American aggressor. They also confirm that the Afghani people must be defended in this unjust war they are being subjected to.
Hizbollah and the movements of Hamas and Islamic Jihad are movements of liberation and, consequently, they are legitimate movements and it is not right to brand them as terrorist, as Israel is trying to promote.
Al Nabatiyyah - "Al Nahar":
He considered that "all that is being said in this regard is just talk.

And he is in need of Yasser Arafat, who is considered the key to complete cooperation with Egypt, Jordan, and maybe Syria.
The writer concluded his article by mocking the threats of the Israeli right that refuses the American initiative, and which considers itself "more important than Bush and the European countries combined."

The General Coordinator for the "Coalition of Popular Committees and Leagues", Maan Bashour, commented on the military operations in Afghanistan and asked "Why is the killing of the innocent and civilians in New York and Washington considered to be terrorism that merits launching a world war and mobilizing armies and fleets, while the daily killing of the innocent in Kabul, Jalalabad and Qandahar, and in Jerusalem, Gaza, Nablus, and Bireh not considered terrorism that at least deserves condemnation and denunciation?

The General Secretariat of the Federation of Arab Journalists held last Saturday morning a meeting at the Union's headquarters in Cairo, which was attended by representatives of 17 Arab unions.

In the end, in a city that elevates this resistance fighter to a level of the worthiness of the State and the Homeland, liberated of enmity, working on love and safe living.
After September 11th, we found ourselves faced with this question: In the first world war in the twenty first century, will America introvert on itself as it did after the 1914-1918 war, or will it work on waiting for her success after the 1939-1945 war?
To be innocent of looking at civilizations with one eye.

And that is what makes "Hizbullah" direct its anti-aircraft missiles against Israeli aircraft.
They reported that the only party that can stop Israel from violating Lebanese airspace in this provocative manner is the United States, and not the United Nations or the representative of its Secretary General in the south. This is so because if Washington was careful in the war it started to fight against terrorism, it must seek reasons for violence in any place in the world, especially explosive places, so that it may finish its mission successfully without any obstacles that may hinder it.

He demanded that the government and its institutions:
2- We ask the government, secondly, to be present for the people, for the citizens, all citizens, even if they are not of the same religion.

The Governor of the Bank of Lebanon reassured the meeting of the soundness of the financial situation. He believed it was unlikely the events would impact it and stressed the importance of internal cohesiveness, "as there is a chance for Lebanon to take advantage of them."
The table today is only to increase the love and bonds of this nobility that draws us to the mountain, and to the true return for all those who have not yet returned to their villages. Mr. Walid's presence today in this town is very important to confirm that this town remains in geography and history.
And if it was not like that, we would have also invited the officials in this town and others, to come to us today, and we would have gone to them first, whether with regard to Mr. Walid or the religious leaders. Welcome, everyone. We hope this will be the start of a faster return (of the displaced) at all levels in the mountain."

The Communist: American Military Actions Will Include Countries in Various Forms

He said: "Even if America is victorious now - and it might win by toppling the Taliban and dismantling the "Al Qaeda" network - its victory will not be without repercussions and effects that will occur within the United States and outside it."

He pointed out three projects where work will begin soon, which are the tunnel that connects Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Karami Plaza and the Two Hundred Street; the circular highway over Tripoli's ring-road, and the continuation of the Mina-Central- Badawi highway.
We, with our condemnation of the biased policy of the United states in dealing with the Middle East crisis in favor of the Jewish State, are concerned here with setting aside the international position from the political point of view in order to join the almost international consensus which was formed around fighting terrorism in all its forms and colors, whoever its perpetrators and whatever religion they belong to.
It remains that we add our voice to those who demand of the United States of America two basic matters:
Crime is not eradicated by crime, but with wisdom and reason so that it is eliminated all over the world.
Situation of the "Forces" Not Mature Enough to Restore License Hubaiqa and Malek Compete to Win Legal Claim
What is certain is that Malek is serious in his request and in his vision for the future of the party, which is not opposed to the government in Lebanon, and is serious in holding on to Dr. Samir Ja'ja's position as the leader of the "Forces" and demanding his release.
And these internal pulling forces are not less important than those external ones.
And there remains another group of external Forces members with no judicial files against them and who can go back, but they express in turn a series of comments on the new blend of the party.
To him "The Forces today are four sections: a section that wants to move only with Samir Ja'ja' and consider the Forces legitimacy his and no one else's; a section that wants to move without Ja'ja', without giving him up, but whose Forces' legitimacy was taken away between one moment and the next by Ja'ja's group; and a section that wants to move without Ja'ja' based on its legitimacy that did not start with the latter because he was a part of the Forces like Fouad Abi Nader, Hubaiqa and others.
The underling factor of the caution is that time would not serve Malek, if the pulling forces continue in the team with which he is cooperating.
The discussion also dealt with a number of internal subjects related to the work of some of the administrations and public institutions, especially the Lebanese University.
They said the attempt to reach agreement, which preceded the last Council of Ministers session, was not successful and proved that the destiny of appointments to the vacant positions in the different administrations might become similar to the destiny of appointing Lebanese University deans. Thus freezing them would become the best of choices in the face of the possible aggravation of differences among the pillars of governance and their exposures at a time that does not stand this type of differences.  Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the matter will be put before the Council of Ministers during its coming session and before an understanding is crystallized on the appointments, especially between President of the Republic Emile Lahoud and the Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri, who have not been able to so far to agree on this subject.

But he added, "from the reality of the evidence available so far, it is likely that he was one of Ben Laden's people or that he was an Islamic fundamentalist."
He added that there is also no evidence that the plane crash was a result of the engines sucking in birds, which is a possibility raised by experts and spoken about by the media.
The second black box related to the flight data was found in the region where the body of the plane fell, and was sent to Washington for examination.
The spokesperson for British Prime Minister Tony Blair said it is directed at "a diminishing number of people all over the world who believe that Osama Bin Laden and the Qaeda are not responsible "for the September 11th attacks in New York and Washington.

Some of what he said in it was: "If avenging the killing of our people is terrorism, let history witness that we are terrorists."

He was asked about what the Organization would do if the other non-member states did not decrease their production, he answered: "We will cross that river when we get to it."
And he said: "Without serious cooperation from the non-member states, the Organization cannot control prices."

A spokesperson for the former Afghani king Mohammad Thaher Shah reported that the latter, who is living in exile in Italy, will direct a call to the Afghani people asking them to "avoid revenge" and declare his return very soon to serve his country "not as king but as servant to Afghanistan."
The Saudi "Arab News" newspaper published in English believed that Thaher Shah must immediately go back to establishing peace in his country.
He added that work is under way to put the final touches on the details related to the participants and the specific dates to conduct these talks.
The Northern Alliance and the other Afghani factions were asked to "cooperate actively" with the special representative of the United Nations to Afghanistan Al-Akhdar Al- Ibrahimi to establish this "temporary multi-ethnic administration".

Washington Approves Establishing Military Court to Try Alleged Foreign Terrorists 5,000 People
It said that people like those must be stopped and referred to military court so that the United States is able to guarantee the security of its citizens or the citizens of the countries that stood by her in her war against terrorism.
Lawyer Davy B. Revkin stated in Washington that the military court laws might give the government a free hand in presenting evidence that might have been excluded in ordinary felony courts, and enables military judges to vote more easily for death sentences.

This feeling was enhanced with the reassurances that are rarely issued by the Federal Reserve President Alan Greenspan who declared that the data available to him indicates an improvement in the American economy and that its components have become very encouraging on the medium range.
All these components combined to ease the pressure off the dollar in order to gain profits, which grew after the marked increase it recorded day before yesterday, to close firm in London as follows:

Minister of Justice Samir Jisr wanted to define the word "justice" and its relationship with the business society and its growth, and so he found no better way than to say "If justice is wanted in the stability of business and its growth, it is also a necessity in the fields of investment, especially the foreign ones, which ask first about justice and its execution (...) in addition to non-discrimination between citizens and foreigners."
Patel gave a speech first, in which he stressed "the depth of the relationship between Lebanon and the United States" pointing out that "this aid is part of the American Department of Agriculture program that allocated for Lebanon a quantity of wheat, which will be implemented."
On his part, Kabbara said that "the population will double in the middle of the century to reach 12 billion people, which will lead to the exhausting of water, mineral and oil natural resources", and listed the accomplishments of the geographic information system on the international level including "identifying gas locations, studying effects of water pollution, presenting negative effects of desertification and drawing a map of natural resources."

In Dialogue Luncheon with International Chamber of Commerce, Jisr: Justice Needed in Business Stability and Investment Growth
At the beginning, Deputy President of the Chamber Ass'ad Sawaya spoke of the link between justice and businessmen, and pointed out that investment in the country, whether it was Lebanese, Arab or foreign, "does not grow or prosper unless judicial and justice guarantees were provided to safeguard people's rights, and do not expose capitals to storms."
He explained that these problems are the result of a shortage in the number of judges, as well as judicial assistants, in addition to the lack of implementation of civil trial procedures in terms of exchanging lists, holding back cases and delaying verdicts.
He talked about the problem of businessmen "who import for small traders goods within a credit line that does not exceed at the most the 10 million liras ceiling.
There remains the accumulated load, whose accomplishment within 4 or 5 years will benefit from the growth in resolving and the increase in the number of judges."
Patel first gave a speech in which he stressed "the depth of the relationship between Lebanon and the United States" pointing out that "this aid is part of the American Department of Agriculture program that allocated for Lebanon a quantity of wheat, which will be implemented by the "Mercy Corps" Association, by selling these quantities to the private sector and employing its revenues in implementing rural social development projects in the underprivileged areas, consequently activating the economy of local villages by providing their basic needs."
He thanked the American people and its government for this aid.
The Foundation will implement this important program, under supervision of the American Agency for International Development and in cooperation with a number of other non-governmental organizations."
Mikati: 40 Million Dollars from European Bank to Complete Rehabilitation of Tripoli Port
This meeting was scheduled for the 26th of last September, but after the events of September 11th the delegation postponed its visit.
In this way, after two years of the start of activities to develop it, the Tripoli port will enjoy all the international port specification with regard to depth, docks, surf breakers and docks.
He was asked for his opinion of Prime Minister Omar Karami's criticism of the method of developing the port, especially in terms of the depth of the docks, and he said: "What is currently being done in the port of Tripoli is according to international technical standards undertaken by specialized offices.
What is hoped for is much more.
Additionally, the Tripoli port board of directors is currently preparing a final study of the port tariffs in Tripoli, and reducing them below the tariff used in the remaining areas to guarantee competition.

Tarabay, Baseel, Sfeir Nominate themselves for Presidency Research into Coalition List for New Board of Directors of Banking Association
According to the internal system of the Association, elections are held for one session to elect 12 members for the board of directors.

While most news agencies point to a Lebanese-German conflict on the issue of categorizing "Hizbollah" as a terrorist organization on the latest American list, "Al Nahar" insists on a different reading based on its presentation of the question related to "Hizbollah" and its knowledge of the phrases used, aside from following the answer of German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and dividing into two parts.
This evaluation of ours is based on several important indications, the first of which is that the discussion session that took place between Hariri and the German Foreign Affairs Committee raised the issue of the south and the deployment of troops there, but according to informed German diplomatic sources did not broach categorizing "Hizbollah" as terrorist, even though the German converser party consisted of the president of the committee and some members belonging to the three main parties.
It is well known that it is impossible to separate economy from politics.
In the diplomat's opinion, the United Nations and its resolutions remain the ideal authority to define the identity of terrorism.
The second is blocking the Israeli campaign with a European position that is distinctive and closer to balance at this stage enveloped in violence from every direction.
Ali Hamadeh
And based on what he heard from French President Jacques Chirac and from American officials.
The French President believes that considering a party or an organization terrorist and taking measures against them must be done in consultation with the capitols of the countries participating in the international alliance, that criteria for terrorism must be set so that its categorization cannot be selective or discretionary, and that the war on Afghanistan cannot be expanded in the direction of the region to settle scores with Iraq and others.
It is worth mentioning that France had advised to refrain from straining the situation with Israel and to maintain calm on the borders, and that the tone of contact with the United States with officials and non-officials be moderate and calm because there is no room for escalation from any side while it is waging a delicate war in Afghanistan and against terrorism, so that it does not reply to the escalation with raising the ceiling of its demands and condensing its pressure.  Therefore, Lebanon has no interest in criticizing the American position or exaggerating matters related to those she considers terrorists as long as the American administration has no plans to expand the circle of its war outside Afghanistan.
Going overboard in desperate talk does not only scare the Arab investor, but the Lebanese investor himself.
Emil Khoury
There is no better than Afghanistan as a legendary background for misery, poverty, blood, dust and backwardness, where those who were victorious and those who were defeated stand in the middle it and with a measure of exciting equality, perhaps for everyone to be equal as defeated or as a handful of the dust of the harsh and savage topographic relief whether in geography or politics.
And if "McCarthyism" represented an ugly era in the American political history a century and a half ago, where a terrorizing operation was practiced on a wide scale against the American society on the pretext of fighting the communists, the "new McCarthyism" will represent an ugly era in the American and the new world's political history, where currently the biggest terrorizing operation is carried out against the American values and concepts internally and against the other countries and established values, namely the human rights charter.
The law signed by George Bush and passed by Congress with a majority of 98 votes built a reasoning that is closer to dictatorship and perhaps fundamentalism, when it put the values of freedom in the fist of security justifications, for the security forces were given almost the same authorities of the "investigation courts" of the Middle Ages, and the KGB in the days of the Soviets: spying on individuals and institutions.
Monitoring the internet.
Maybe for everyone to be equal in view of the effects of September 11th in Afghanistan and the world.
For this meeting coincided with the appearance of National Security Advisor to the American President, Condoleezza Rice, on one of the American television stations warning Lebanon of the results of the methods of its reply to the American demand to freeze the accounts of "Hizbullah".
But many waited for Lebanon to act at least according to Syria's actions, whose foreign minister linked heading to New York with a group of meetings to be held with officials there, among them meeting with Powell.
And even though Lebanon limited its initial reply to the American demand by holding on to discerning between resistance and terrorism, there are questions in diplomatic circles on whether the United States gave evidence to Lebanon on the matter of what it considers involvement and responsibility of "Hizbullah" in the attacks in the Latin American countries. "CNN", the American television network transmitted days ago a theme about this topic that spoke of "Hizbullah's" involvement in matters the United States considers terrorism in a triangle that lies between Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.
Considering that "Hizbullah" never was under Lebanese care (even if it did enjoy official legitimate coverage in the last years) as much as it was under the Syrian and Iranian care.
Turkey expressed vast interest in the Islamic republics in middle Asia especially after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the late eighties of the last century.
Third, the Turkish regime's keenness on convincing its people first and then the region and the world that the collapse of the Soviet Union did not reduce the role of Turkey and its weight (the United States and NATO depended on it as it was the frontline in facing the Soviet-Communist danger) and convincing them too that it and its country still need stability and peace in the region.
And will this war put an end to Turkish ambitions in middle Asia and especially in its republics that speak Turkish, even if it was "amended", or pave the way for it?
For Turkey did not need to send a hundred of its troops to the fighting area to help the United States or show its responsiveness and harmony with its decisions.
And finally it is actually contributing to the efforts aimed at completely defeating the extremist fundamentalists in the region because that will reflect negatively on Turkey's Muslims who have significantly popularly grown in the last decade.
And therefore its seems prepared to do everything that pleases America or comforts it, as well as what the Jewish Americans who are very influential in the American political life believe benefits them and benefits their protégé Israel.
In conclusion the same informed Western diplomatic sources believe based on the referred to information that Turkey's positions and moves, namely sending 100 soldiers to the fighting arena was aimed at sending three message to whom it may concern.
The presence of sculpting started in a limited manner at the "Lebanese Art" Exhibition at the Sursuq Museum, despite its good representation of its reality in the city, and showed through the relatively humble works in features of the experience and in the details of the meaning, despite the presence of the three historic plastic artists, who were distinguished in the second half of the last century in establishing trends in sculpting - in the modern context of the word - grew with them and entrenched in Lebanon and the Arab World: the return to the roots with Salwa Rawdah Shukayr, and action inside the current of globalization with Michel Basbous, and images with a concentration on the human body as a location of the complete recitational expressive event.
"The War of the Third Millennium" presents questions realizing that the questions to them are postponed "perhaps ten years" according to author Habib Ghanem in the introduction of his book published by "Lebanese Manhal Home", which makes it journalistic material full of actual events and analysis that aids in a broader understanding of the happenings and the details that accompany the first wars of the century.
He deals, in the last chapter, with the positions of Tehran, Damascus and Beirut regarding the proceedings of the current events, and allocates space for the considerations that led to the strong bias of some countries to the side of the United States (like Turkey for example).
While Washington is searching for "Al Qaeda" Network fundamentalist leader Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan, the Northern Alliance was busy consolidating its authority in Kabul from which "Taliban" fighters withdrew Tuesday, and controlled the main centers and ministries despite pledging to support a transitional government with a wide base that includes all races that the Afghani people consist of.
Afghani sources in Pakistan said that the airport of Kandahar City, the main stronghold of the "Taliban" is controlled by approximately 200 fighters of the supporters of Aref Khan's who belongs to Atnieh Pashton.
American Minister of Defense Donald Rumsfeld admitted that the situation in Kandahar is still fluid, and pointed out that if one side controls an area it loses it to the other party and "I wish and I expect that there will be significant activity by the southern tribes that did not support the Taliban and will certainly confirm their position and handle matters."
The pro-Taliban Afghani "Islamic News Agency" said that forces of the movement killed Tuesday at the Bangi sector between Qandaz and Talikan in the north 50 people among them 20 Americans and Britons who were among a convoy of Afghani opposition.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke over the radio to the Afghani people, reminding them that there is a reward of a few million dollars to anyone who turns in Osama bin Laden.
British Defense Minister Geoffrey Hoon, who is visiting Uzbekistan, stated that it could not be easy to convince Bin Laden to go out of hiding, but he expressed his belief that elements of  the "Taliban" will turn him in eventually.
Editor in Chief of the Pakistani "Awsaf" newspaper that is published in Urdu, Hamdmeer, who conducted an interview with Bin Laden last week inside Afghanistan, said that the fundamental leader vowed never to surrender.
British representative at the United Nations, Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, said at the close of the session: "We the Britons, along with France and many other countries at the Security Council would like to pass this resolution today."
He recommended deploying a multi-national force to guarantee security in Kabul and the major cities, and believe it unlikely that an international peacekeeping force would be sent.
Ambiguity surrounded the German position regarding the latest American list that categorized "Hizbullah" as a terrorist organization.
This reading concludes that Schroeder in his reference to "the presence of different points of view" meant the United States and not Lebanon, especially that Germany has been for a while conducting mediations and talks with "Hizbullah" over the issue of the Israeli prisoners, and it has an advanced and intensive role in the attempt to calm and reach a ceasefire in the Palestinian territories.
On their part, sources at the delegation accompanying Hariri said he reiterated to the German officials he met with in Lebanon, similar to the other Arab countries, that he believes in peace and that he has recognized all resolutions issued by the United Nations related to peace, and he is demanding achieving peace in the region based on international law and respect of United Nations resolutions 242, 338 and 425, and consequently wises that the United States and Europe practice all forms of pressure on Israel to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories in the Palestine, Syria and Lebanon.
Hariri repeated to the German officials Lebanon's final and absolute rejection of settling Palestinian refugees on its lands, reiterating their right of return to their lands.
The White House and the European Commission quickly welcomed the agreement that the Americans considered "distinguished progress", while the Europeans believed it "balanced between several and varied interests."
As for the agricultural portfolio that was one of the most prominent hung issues in Seattle, the Americans and the Europeans reached a settlement that enjoyed the approval of the developing countries as well.
He said: "We are now in need of negotiation to reach a conclusive result to achieve real progress in sustainable development."
It is planned that French President Jacque Chirac will send, within days, letters to the Lebanese President Emil Lahhoud and Syrian President Bashar Assad, and to the Jordanian monarch King Abdullah II bin Al Hussein on the recent circumstances on the diplomatic level to revive the peace process between the Palestinians and Israelis, and inform them of the consultations between the United States, Russia, the European Union, Egypt and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to find an "appropriate exit" in the diplomatic sense of the word that will prompt the Israeli government to agree to participate in the "negotiations table".
They said that efforts were exerted in more than one capitol to urge Washington to go forward in giving the political indications that will respond, if partially, to the calls of the Arab and European officials, especially the Arab public opinion that has started to threaten the international alliance against terrorism, as the Arab countries directly concerned feel increasing pressure from their public opinions which leads to instability in this area.
In fact the written letter sent days ago by the Egyptian President Husni Mubarak to the American President express the content of the consultations that are taking place outside the spotlight.
A French source explained that this "move" improves the situation of the Palestinians in the negotiations process as it puts them on an equal level from the legal and legislative point of view with the Israelis so the negotiations are launched from their new location representing the prospective Palestinian state and not the Autonomy Authority as is currently happening, or launched from the fact they represent a national liberation movement.
Bush informed a number of European officials that the priority in his current policy is for the war in Afghanistan and removing terrorism and drying its sources, and is not ready today to push in the direction of fundamental solutions for the Arab-Israeli conflict.
These three reasons are what led in fact to finding the phrasing of the "appropriate exit" based on various European, Arab and Russian advice in the "American lost time".
The defendant wanted to buy a motorcycle and urged his grandmother to give him an amount between one thousand and one thousand five hundred dollars to pay for it.
It was plain that the defendant denied the charge attributed to him.
He also stated that he sometimes cursed and swore at his murdered grandmother, he told the investigator that he owned two hand grenades and a military machine gun, and told the accusatory committee that he no longer remembered the kind of shrapnel he was inured with but he remembered that the shrapnel of a "bomb" was extracted from his left ear and from the thumb of his right foot.
It also had, over the entrance door, a stairway leading to the roof, and the staircase was tiled with zinc boards.

Ma'moun Al Humsi The Messiah in the Quran
So on what charge is he imprisoned, as long as this principle expresses a human act in every sense of the word?
For the Messiah, Peace Be Upon Him, is the Truth in the Holy Quran. That is what came to Surat Mariam, Peace Be Upon Her, in the Quran "So, peace is upon me, from the day that I was born to the day that I die and the day that I shall be resurrected to life. Such was Jesus, the son of Mary: a statement of truth."
It was said in Surat Al-Maida "The disciples said, O Jesus, Son of Mary! Is your Lord able to send down for us a table spread with food from heaven? He said: Observe your duty to Allah, if you are true believers."
Obey God if you are believers so that you are not tortured painfully by God for your deeds.
And Islam disowns those killers.
The Penal Court of Cassation, in a verdict passed yesterday under the chairmanship of Justice Ralph Riyashy and the membership of Counselors Khader Zanhour and Burkan Sa'd, turned down a request submitted by the Military Public Prosecutor appealing a verdict by the Military Examining Magistrate, which refused to hear two new witnesses in the case, for which the former political advisor to the commander of the "Lebanese Forces," Dr. Tawfiq Al-Hindi and information specialist Antoine Baseel have been detained for the crime of contacting the Israeli enemy on the grounds of non-relevance.
"The Court of Cassation, Sixth Penal Chamber, after verification and consultation,
It has been established that the Public Prosecutor subsequently approached the Military Examining Magistrate with an ancillary submission dated on 10/31/2001, by virtue of which the Public Prosecutor adduced that the defendant, Tawfiq Al-Hindi, in the affidavit he gave in the course of the present case, which names him as defendant, contends that he deliberated with Uri Lubrani the matter of nominating Deputy Faris Buweiz for the Presidency of the Republic on the basis of the latter's approval of presenting the subject before Israeli officials with a view to influencing the United States of America in this matter.  Furthermore, Deputy Buweiz paid him in cash the amount of two thousand and five hundred dollars as reimbursement for expenses and travel, of which Al-Hindi paid the amount of five hundred dollars to the defendant, Antoine Baseel, in exchange for making a trip to Cyprus to arrange for an appointment in Paris between Al-Hindi and the Israelis in order to discuss the subject. Defendant Antoine Baseel also testified that in 1998, and during his meeting with the Israeli Zarai in Cyprus, found that Zarai was meeting with Henry Sfeir at the request of the latter. Zarai told him that he had agreed with Sfeir to secure his mediation with the Jewish lobby in America to promote the name of the latter as a prelude to his assumption of an important political position in Lebanon, in exchange for eight thousand dollars to be paid monthly to one Douglas Blumfield, who owns a foundation concerned with the affairs of the Jewish lobby. The ancillary submission concluded by requesting the Examining Magistrate to summon both Buweiz and Sfeir, as witnesses, but not under oath, in order to obtain clarifications for information purposes only about what was said in the two affidavits mentioned above regarding each of them, upon which he would subsequently build his case.
Whereas even if Article 139 of the previous Penal Procedural Law or Article 135 of the current Penal Procedural Law, in force since 11/8/2001, has given the Public Prosecutor the absolute right to appeal all verdicts, passed by the Examining Magistrate contrary to the Public Prosecutor's request, including administrative and investigative verdicts. But, this enactment does not find a place for implementation in relation to the appeal submitted by the Government's Commissioner in accordance with Article 78 of Law No. 24/68 (Military Judiciary) because the stipulation in Article 78 is an exceptional provision included in a special law that specifically limits the appealable cases designated for the Government's Commissioner that deal with verdicts passed by military examining magistrates. Hence, there is no room for applying the general stipulation of the Penal Procedural Law and replacing it with the special stipulation of the Military judiciary as determined by virtue of Article 78 thereof, or elaborating on the interpretation of this latter text.
Whereas the petition, in view of the aforementioned argument, deserves to be dismissed in form, but without any need to proceed to its subject matter.
Third: To file the papers with the Appeals Public Prosecutor for serrated referral to the competent body.
Our politicians are still mixing up between the "small state" that they represent and the "not small homeland," whose history fills the pages of history, which the sons of Lebanon have made and are still making on its land and in the world of the diaspora.
From here comes our insistence that "Lebanon the state" (in terms of larger and smaller) is small. Yes, there is nothing shameful in a state that is small in area. Is there anywhere in the world a smaller state than the State of the Vatican? But, (in terms of quality and excellence), what can be said about its radiance?
How many among them know Victor Berard's attitude when a group of Lebanese went to the reconciliation conference (Paris 1920) and were referred by officials to Berard only to suggest, when they met him, to annex Lebanon to France, just like the Island of Corsica, which France had bought from the Genoa Republic.
Berard is the one to whom the famous saying is attributed (in his book: "The Phoenicians and Europe"): "Phoenicia was the motherland of an overseas continent called Europe."
Our politicians, who talk about Lebanon in the form of "some" not "all," do not deserve to speak in the name of Lebanon, because they speak in the logic of "quantity," not "quality," meaning the reasoning of "larger and smaller."
Regarding autographs, the pavilions of publishing houses were overcrowded by seekers of new books.
All of a sudden, we are in front of an initial sketch, taken directly from life. All of a sudden, the finished painting, long exposed "under the light" of an enlightened professional, recalls the living memory (...).
The tendency is strong, because of her dual Lebanese-Egyptian cultural origin, to consider the artist as having a suppressed tendency to writing.
The writer discusses the situation of a woman called Helen, who lives as a prisoner of matrimony with a man, who lives on an island, where fabricated gossip conflicts as to the way he died.
I liken man to the wind, whose rumbling is heard, but it roams many places without landing in any specific area."
The book is based on two messages, through which he wanted to call upon the inhabitants of Mount Lebanon, especially the Maronites, to desist from mistakes.
About her book, Al-Khouri Odeh said: "I study at the Jesuit University and specialize in visual and audio sciences. By chance, I read about the competition.

In light of the principle of transparency and clarity adopted by the Council, we are prepared to provide you with all the information you deem necessary to reveal the facts that the complaining students tried to forge or cover up for purposes, which we do not know:
25 selected students were chosen and their bearers were granted the scholarships according to the scientific conditions and criteria, unanimously by the Board of Directors.
However, it was found that Mr. Al Rassi had earned the grade 61.69 out of 100 on the license and 10 out of 20 in his advanced studies for the diploma. Mr. Kurdi earned the grade 64.72 out of 100 in his license and 12.75 out of 20 in his advanced studies for the diploma.

After an introduction by Nada Hamzeh, the President of the Foundation Makhzoumi, May Makhzoumi delivered a speech. Following that, the Director General of the Foundation, Major General Omar Makhzoumi, spoke and said, "As usual, the committee entrusted with the 'Lebanon Prize for Creativity,' after concentrating on many works by Lebanese in Lebanon and abroad, selected this year five of them, who have raised the name of their homeland high in various fields.
Al Hajj thanked in her speech the Makhzoumi Foundation, which encouraged her to return to Lebanon after 28 years. She also thanked the Lebanese University, which amended its law to grant her the degree with distinction, as well as all those who helped her in her scientific career.
The Lecture Hall at the Beirut Arab International Book Exhibition witnessed a meeting to discuss the book "Television in Lebanon and the Arab World, What Role for Tomorrow's Technologies" by Dr. May Al-Abdullah Sinno, in which colleague Rafiq Nasrallah, Doctors George Sadaqah, Ghassan Sinno and Mahmoud Tarbay, as well as a group of personalities, professors and students participated.
Here in my opinion is the crux of the problem.
He added, "In Dr. May's book, there is a discovery that leads to knowledge of the elements of power needed by our media at both the information and Arab levels. It is important here for our information institutions and the faculties of information to cope with current developments to enable us to transform our information instruction from theory to experimentation, to continued openness to development that competes with canned curricula."
In the competition organized by the club for students who visit the exhibition, the following won: Aqeel Aqeel, Mohammad Kassab, Zakaria Khalil, Batoul Al Rida, Hawraa Dakik, and Ali Dia from Al Sadeq School in Al Amiliyyah; Sa'ad Al Miqdad (Ali Bin Abi Taleb - Al Maqassed); Mohammad Abdullah (Khalil Shihab); Bilal Doughan (Omar Bin Al Khattab); Muhammad Qasem (Al Kawthar Secondary School); Farah Awadah, Mahdi Tleis and Sheima' Younis (Sab'at Aqmar); Ali Bitar (Al Duha); Fatimah Ya'qoub, Ihsan Mansour, Zeinab Darwish and Zeinab Salameh (Imam Al Khumeini); Abdul Karim Suleiman (Khalid Bin Al Waleed - Al Harj) and Khuloud Al Fadel (Dr. Mohammad Khaled's Social Institutions).

Under the title "Scenarios of Terrorism and War: Implications of New York and Afghanistan," a seminar was held yesterday at the American University in Beirut Alumni Club. It was organized by the "Development Studies Forum." The participants included Dr. Ahmad Mouselli, who dealt with the civilizational effects of the subject, followed by colleague Rajeh Al Khoury, who dealt with the political effects. In conclusion, Dr. Marwan Iskandar reviewed the economic effects.
He touched on American studies, conducted before September 11th that spoke of "the green danger after the removal of the red danger."
Colleague Rajeh Al Khouri dealt with the political aspects of the latest events and said, "In view of these unbelievable developments, certainly including rejection of the idea of discussion, mere discussion to differentiate between condemned and ugly terrorism and legitimate resistance approved by the Declaration of Human Rights, unilateral oppressive and intransigent features have became apparent, taking for themselves the holier-than- thou position vis-à-vis others. This matter prompted the American National Security Advisor, Condaleeza Rice to give Lebanon a choice between the head of resistance and "Hizbullah" and between the head of the economy and dying of bankruptcy."
Finally, Dr. Marwan Iskandar spoke of the economic effects of the September 11th attacks and said, "that they caused legislative and organizational changes that are opposed to globalization, which the US was advocating and pushing ahead.
He continued, "The United States started investigative measures that delayed the movement of goods and individuals into it and allowed the FBI to review the accounts of any company or individual it suspects of having relations with organizations that are considered terrorist. FBI investigators can now confiscate the records and documents of companies and banks with the aim of investigating any operations that took place.
He saw that "the situation in the region will be effected to a great extent by the prevailing omnipotent environment and by the rallying together of the industrial states.
Members of the judging panel of the "Five Continents Francophonic Award for the year 2001," who are now present in Lebanon in the framework of the activities of the French book fair, entitled 'read in French and Music'  have launched the Francophonic Young Writer Award" (    ) from the French-Lebanese Grand Lycee school at Ashrafiyyeh.
Or by electronic mail .... @.
He stressed that the "Lycee students participate in the competition in an effective manner and our student George Faghali has earned an award for his novel "A Wound of Live" (    )."
During his reception yesterday of the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee at the French National Assembly, Francois Loncle at Baabda Palace, called on the international community to "reevaluate what is happening, following the recent developments in Afghanistan, and to work towards addressing the real reasons that have led to the rapid growth of the phenomenon of extremism and terrorism," and said: "The achievement of justice is the only solution to the problems and difficulties to which the World is exposed. This can be achieved only through dialogue, as force only brings force and violence only generates hatred in the souls that leads to extremist, and sometimes terrorist positions."
He said "French President Jacques Chirac has expressed on more than one occasion his standing always to the side of Lebanon, his keenness on its sovereignty and independence, and his support of its right to liberate its land from Israeli occupation."
At the end of the meeting, Loncle present to Lahoud the medallion of the French National Assembly as a token of appreciation and gratitude.
"The opinions of the President of the Republic and the speaker of Parliament were congruent on the necessity of moving the economic and social situations with a series of measures, including commissioning the Engineering corps of the Army with conducting a real estate survey of Lebanese territories, as well as distributing the share of municipalities in the independent fund, especially the recently-established municipalities as a result of elections in the south.
They extended an invitation to attend the reception, which the party will hold on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of its foundation.
He also received the Appeals public Prosecutor Adnan Addoum, and than the Director General of State Security, Major General Edward Mansour, and then the director of the Intelligence Department, Brigadier Raymond Azar.
The Committee's Chairman, Mikhael Dhaher said: "The project stipulates that the Council of Ministers may decide to license the Casino du Liban Company to open branches, but the last word rests with the Casino du Liban Company whether it wants to open this branch or not.
Nor have we forgotten the cultural aspect, contributed by the Casino du Liban, as well as the branches, whose opening the Council of Ministers licenses. As you know, the Casino used to host the most famous artists, musical and cultural troupes. So it is not only a place for gambling, but also an open gateway to encourage culture in Lebanon."
There was a clause in the Law, by virtue of which the Casino du Liban was established, which stipulated the establishment of a hotel. But, also there is another clause that stipulates that if the hotel is not established, then the Government shall be compensated. Following that, there was an agreement between the State and the Casino du Liban Company, which paid the compensation because it had not built the hotel."
- The important thing is that no branch will be established except by a decision taken by the Casino Company Room. The opportunity has been opened up for the privatization of the Casino. If the possibility for branching exists, this will be in the interest of the Company. Then, the price will improve more and more. Therefore, the State appreciates all these considerations. But, again, the final decision as to whether to accept the branching or not rests with the Company.
The State owns 51 percent. So, if grants the license, it will be licensing itself. Therefore, they should not try to hide behind the shadow of their finger.
And again, controlling visits to the branches by Lebanese will be nil.
The 70th anniversary celebration of the establishment of the Syrian Nationalist Socialist Party was held at the Commodore Hotel yesterday evening. It was attended by Minister Bishara Mirhej, representing the President of the Republic, Emile Lahoud; Minister Mohammad Abdul Hameed Beidoun, representing Speaker of the House of Parliament Nabih Berri; Minister Nazih Beidoun, representing Prime Minister Rafiq Al Hariri, Prim Ministers Saleem Al Hoss and Rashid Al-Sulh; Deputy Speaker of the House of Parliament, Elie Al-Farzali; Minister Ali Qansou; Deputies: Marwan Faris, Ghassan Al Ashqar, and Asa'ad Hardan; the President of the Party, Jibran Areiji, Brigadier Zakaria Ni'meh, representing the Army Commander, General Michel Suleiman; Brigadier Mohammad Matar, representing General Director of the Civil Security Department, Staff Major General, Jamil Al Sayyed, and political, diplomatic, partisan, social, and religious personalities.
Seventy years against national division, and still is.
It was at the spur of the moment that we said that the alternative to political parties is sects, the way they spread and their political legions. It is the legacies of monopolistic families. It is the sharing of the spoils, escaping from penalties. It is also being content with the least amount of belief, nationalistically, if it is not abandonment of the basics of absolute faith in the nationalistic causes, in the forefront of which is the Palestine cause.
The parties and factions held a meeting in support of the Intifada at the Commodore Hotel in Al Hamra. It was attended by Prime Minister Salim Al Hoss; Members of Parliament Ammar Al Mousawi, Mohammad Birjawi, Qasem Hashim, and Faisal Al Daoud; former Members of Parliament Najah Wakim, Zaher Al Khatib, and Adnan Trabulsi; and representatives of political parties, factions and groups.
The United States has appointed itself as the sole reference to categorizing countries, organizations and individuals in the world.
We are without doubt fighting terrorism, but under the umbrella of the United Nations and through it and on the basis of a clear and explicit definition of terrorism adopted by the United Nations. The definition must differentiate between terrorism and resisting occupation, and must include the terrorism of state practiced by Israel in its ugliest form in the Palestine (...).  If Arab leaders lag behind peoples in supporting the Palestinian cause, they will have to catch up sooner or later, because history does not have mercy."
He said: "All possibilities are open in view of a reality in which America gave itself the role of policeman around the world.
The participants rejected "American lists in principle, because they are the beginning of declaring war on Arabs and Muslims and all the other repressed nations, and came to please the Zionist entity at the expense of the rights of our nation. The United States before September 11th did not object to the Lebanese government's consideration that "Hizbullah" is an organization resisting the Zionist occupation. The United States recognized, when it approved the April Understand, the right to resistance in confronting Zionist occupation, which was confirmed by the participating countries in the April Agreement, with France at the forefront. The meeting, with this stand, expresses the official Lebanese and popular position, which confirmed its support of the resistance and the Intifada in Palestine.
He called, during his meeting yesterday with President of the Foreign Affairs Committee at the French National Organization Francois L'Oncle at the Ba'abda palace, on the international community to "re-evaluate what is going on."
Berlin - "Al Nahar":
Japan's Ambassador Naoto Amaki held a reception yesterday at noon at his residence in Al Yazreh on the occasion of the birthday of Japan's Emperor Akihito.
Opinions vary inside the international alliance on whether the multi-national power to be sent to Afghanistan should be led by the United States or be part of the United Nations and led by it.
By Khalil Fleihan
It was also not convinced with the Syrian position that defended "Hizballah" and its right to resistance, and not classifying it as a terrorist organization, and was not convinced with the justifications for harboring Palestinian organizations' offices. The evidence is that the meeting between the foreign ministers of the two countries, Colin Powell and Farouq Al Shar'a, in New York on the sidelines of the General Assembly of the United Nations in its 56th session, was a failure, according to a senior official at the US State Department.
That is what several French officials warned of.
If it is not available voting is done again, and at a later stage the subject will be presented to be Security Council to be discussed.
He was quoted by deputies, who met him in the framework of the Wednesday Meeting, that "The surplus of employees, who have been referred to the Civil Service Council, can be assimilated in the public administrations or the municipalities."
Berri had received before noon the President of the Lebanese University, Ibrahim Qubeissi, at the head of a delegation of university deans, as well as Ministers Siboh Hofnanian, Suleiman Franjieh, Michel Mousa and Bishara Mirhej.
Those attending the meeting discussed the subject of terrorism and the necessity of distinguishing between it and the legitimate resistance of peoples for the sake of liberating their land and denounced what the United States was subjected to on the eleventh of September.
Then he reviewed with Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri the regional and international development and the two positions of Lebanon and Iraq thereon.
Basically, it is strange that the "Taliban" had accended to power in Afghanistan while we were concluding a century of scientific discoveries, but sometimes-political games are stranger than the imagination.
Is it rational that these people would appoint themselves Caliphs on a people, who are poor to the level of starvation, then become distracted by trivial matters instead of searching for that which will alleviate their people's hunger?
And based on what book, or Sunna, or religious or pagan teachings?
Ruling is no longer with instincts and backwardness, nor is it permitted with whips, not anywhere in the world; not in the jungles of the Amazon, nor in the caves of Afghanistan.
The Socialist Progressive Party called on the Lebanese to "stand firmly by the side of Hizbullah and all nationalists who have contributed to resistance and liberation."
Second: What the Israeli government did, including lifting the immunity of, and throwing accusations at struggler Azmi Bishara, underlines without any ambiguity the suspicious and racist democracy practiced by Israel and some sponsors of the Democratic and of human rights sing its praises.

International officers inspected the reservoir, which the South Council is building in Wata Al-Khiyam and which will supply a number of towns with drinking water from Al-Wazzani spring.
In his weekly briefing, he was asked about the background to the new American threats to Lebanon, to which he said: undobtedly, the new American threats to Lebanon are an attempt to move the economic file, one way or another, and this is something the Americans have repeatedly done before, especially shortly after the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, all according to the rule that they had planned for and made a headline for their policy in Lebanon, which is that Lebanon will never reach the stage of economic growth without Israel feeling that its security conditions in the south have been met, most supremely is the army deployment in the South and the disarming of the resistance.
The "Ashrafiyyeh Development Council" met last Friday night at the "Jibran Khalil Jibran Hall" in Al-Hikmeh Club ?

Many are asking whether the drought, which has swept over Lebanon, is unnatural at this time of year and what will happen if the rain continues to be withheld.
According to the register of the Nicola Shahin meteorological station, the amount of rain for this year comes to 67 millimeters as compared with 74 millimeters on this date last year, and with an overall average on this date of 103 millimeters.
The correct form of what al-Marr said is: "If, after my having raised the topic in 'al-Nahar', I received a single written idea bearing the signatures of Beirut's parliamentary representatives, both Muslim and Christian, saying: This is the version of coexistence which suits us, then I would adopt it and move forward with it, since they are the inhabitants of Beirut and I am subject to their decision within this context.
Participants in the meeting examined the proceedings of the sub-committee charged with preparing a detailed study of the implications of the ongoing violation of the provisions of the national harmony document, and the persistent violations of the provisions of the constitution, on stability in the country.
Al-Nasiri stated that "the Iraqi delegation will spell out its country's policy in order to produce formulations for joint Arab action and to establish an Arab market, as well as Iraq's willingness to develop economic ties with Lebanon based on the model of what was agreed upon with Egypt, Syria, Yemen, Tunisia, Algeria, and the Emirates", in a reference to the free trade agreements.
"It is only natural for us to say that the draft law has an advantage for which no one can take credit, namely, the fact that it liberates the Beirut municipality and its elected council from captivity to the city's governor, a situation which continued for a long time, such that executive authority will be restored to the Beirut municipality just as it belongs to all of Lebanon's municipalities.  As a consequence, the draft law does away with the exception and restores rights to their owners.
As for the matter of the Sunnite faction's losing a position in the first category in return for liberating the Beirut municipality and enabling it to reclaim its executive authority, we would have preferred that the exception which once existed be abolished and that the administrative situation remain as it is, although we regret in this connection to say that the country has suffered ruin and division whenever this topic has been raised."
Minister of Forced Immigrants Marwan Hamadeh patronized at the ministry building in Starco yesterday the signing of the agreement of reconciliation and return to Ghaboon town in the Aley district, in the presence of the two ministers Fu'ad al-Sa'd and Pierre Helou, the two parliamentarians Akram Shuhayb and Antoine Andrawus, the president of the Central Fund for Forced Emigrants Shadi Mas'ad, the director general of the ministry Khalid Abd al-Samad, the commander of the forced immigrants affairs company at the gendarmerie unit Colonel Ghassan Barakat, head of the ministry's technical division Ahmad Mahmud, the interior deputy for the Progressive Socialist Party in the Second Aley region Sami Marroush, the members of the Residents' and Returnees' Committees, the town's mukhtar Sa'id Jabir and a gathering of town residents.
Consequently, the state places the greatest importance today on confirming the common denominators in which all Lebanese believe, from supporting the resistance in the south and the uprising in Palestine to opposing terrorism and all forms of injustice and oppression through solidarity with sister Syria, the Arab states, and other friendly states throughout the world.  All of this, of course, is inseparable from the financial and economic well-being which constitutes a fundamental part of the country's economic and social immunity, which in turn enables us to carry on with our struggle."
He also explained that the reparations for al-Ghaboon might be completed within two months.
The peace treaty and return agreement was then signed by Hamadeh, Mas'ad, 'Abd al-Samad, Mahmud, the Returnees' and Residents' Committees, and the town mayor.
I simply want to reassure you of the fact that this social fabric which exists among us is, before being political, a guarantee of Lebanon's survival, of the permanent restoration of Mount Lebanon's unity, and the permanence of Lebanon's autonomy. When Patriarch Sfeir visited al-Shuf beginning from al-Na'imah and al-Damur, al- Damur being, in fact, his first main stopover, we received him along with you.  We felt as though a black page had been closed forever and which, God willing, will never again be visited upon your families, your towns, your mountain, or your Lebanon.
A question that has been preoccupying Israeli politicians and commentators since the beginning of the uprising in light of the difference of opinion between the intelligence organs which hold that Arafat's presence is necessary, a position which is shared by Shimon Perez, and numerous voices within the rightist camp, including Ariel Sharon, according to whom there is a possibility of replacing Arafat with other Palestinian leadership.
Nevertheless, when Ariel Sharon was Minister of Defense, he wanted to assassinate Arafat, and did not succeed.
Sharon prefers to expel him from the Palestinian territories or forbid him to enter them.
On the Palestinian side, there is a debate going on behind Arafat's back, as young leaders are emerging whose names are known, and among whom there are some whom Israel does not like.
This depends on the manner in which Arafat goes.

In the United Arab Emirates, Information Minister Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahayan said that "this confession" proves that those who opposed the American strikes against the "Al Qaeda" network during the month of Ramadan were mistaken because "those terrorists" have nothing to do with Islam."

He said his client "believes seriously that he is innocent (...). For this reason, he has nothing to say to investigators.
The indictment, passed against him on Tuesday, said that he collaborated with 23 conspirators, including the leader of the "Al Qaeda" network Osama bin Laden, to kill thousands of civilians in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania.

What happened to the issue of the quarries, which is a dangerous headline in the reality of our environment, which itself is also threatened with everything that is dangerous?
And the green remained a wonderful coat that drapes the slopes and peaks of our mountains.
No doubt that the most prominent headline in the chapter of civil peace, which is a moot point today, is the headline of environmental peace.
The list is long and talks about complaints are longer and we are trying to hold on to hope so that we do not suffocate again.
In this context, it is noticed that this slaughterhouse causes the disposal of the bones, skins and innards of animals into the Beirut River course or incinerating them and then burying them without taking into consideration all the environmental or general health provisions.
This region is also considered among the most polluted areas in the Middle East region and around the Mediterranean basin.
On the final solutions that the conference came out with, he said: "It is necessary that we transfer the garbage plants, return Beirut's slaughterhouse to its previous location, organize the popular markets, and the fish and skins market, in a manner that will restore to the region its glory and environmental cleanliness.
That is how Professor Na'eim Oweini summarized the project in which he cooperated with his colleague Samir Mudawwar, and a group of doctors from the Lebanese and Holy Spirit Universities and a number of students to complete, and which is expected to find the final treatment for olive by-products, including jift and zeibar, instead of haphazardly throwing them in fields and rivers and causing severe damage to the ground water.
In addition to Beirut's temporary-permanent slaughterhouse, and its non- adherence to international environmental standards."
The primary section students also planted, in the presence of ACD President, Arthur Charles, his deputy Meishka Morani, and sections heads, a sapling in the green region on the beach road opposite the school.
And more than that, we have demanded that a major role be given to the army in protecting these forests. We directed memorandums to the governor and other officials and demanded declaring these forests natural reserves for their biological diversity and beautiful trees, shrubs and flowers, starting with the Qamou'ah Forest, Karm Shbat, Al Qilleh, Wadi Jahannam, Ain Al Beida, Jurd Harabeen, Karm Al Muhr and Akroum."
In the shadow of escalation of assaults on tree resources in the country and on the bases of the principle that every citizen is a sentry, the Ministry of the Environment would like to remind that "Any assault on trees can be reported to the environmental public prosecutors in the governorates, Judges Nadeem Abdul Malik - Jabal, Lebanon, Wa'el Al Hassan - the North, Jihad Al Wadi - Beirut, Jamal Al Hilo - the South and Nabatiyyeh, Sameeh Al Hajj - the Beqaa, as well as the Ministry of Environment, forest rangers, and the stations of the internal security forces.
He said, "We aim, through this project, to increase the green areas, perhaps we contribute to purifying the Lebanese environment, in dressing our mountains with a cover that pleases the eye, and in developing the environment sense in our male and female students and implanting it in their consciousness and their daily practices, so that they may transfer it to our students in all Lebanon's schools."
The area of land planted with olive trees in all the Lebanese territories is estimated at about 65 thousand hectares that annually produce about 94 thousand tons of olives, of which about 16 thousand tons are pressed, while Lebanon annually imports about 5 thousand tons of olives.
What continuously happens in the northern region, specifically in Zgharta, Al Koura and Tripoli, is the most prominent example of what we are saying.
Additionally, olive industrial water contains 30 percent of the fibers that help animals in the digestion process.
We worked after that on laying the scientific bases for selecting the best fermentation process that will turn peat into animal fodder and decompose it with the suitable chemical process to get the best quality of animal fodder."
There is also cooperation with the international organizations that support scientific research projects, like UNESCO, FAO, the European Common Market and governmental and non-governmental organizations.
Yes all of us, in varying degrees of course, except you.

Where is the responsible gentleman, who selects officials and gives them the five weights and the two weights, and the one weight and then calls them to account?
And he tells the second, who traded the two weights and gained two others: "What a good and trustworthy citizen you are.
Wrest the weight from him and give it to the one with the ten weights, because the haves are given and given more and the have-nots are taken from, even what is theirs. And, for the idle citizen, take his and fling him in the external darkness, where there is crying and the grating of teeth."
He went ahead with his decision until the end, and took the events of September 11 as a pretext for enhancing his idea that deploying the missile shield is an urgent matter to protect American territories from the possibility of being attacked by missiles from countries Washington lists as "renegade countries".
But if the ABM Treaty is one of the byproducts of the cold war that must be disposed of, what can be said of NATO?
And Russia is contributing to the campaign politically and with information.
But Bush, who considers that his country must alone lead the world after the cold war, does not take into consideration the similarity of Russian positions with American positions in international issues when it comes to a strategic issue like disposing of the ABM Treaty.
And because the Americans realize more than others that the economic situation of Russia does not allow it to go into an arms race with the United States, they are reassured that the missile shield will paralyze the Russian nuclear ability and make it useless.
Bush goes on, benefiting from the internal and external support he is receiving in his war against terrorism in Afghanistan. He goes on building the world according to his vision.
And this is the right time for Bush to entrench America's leadership of the world.
The attempt to deny the wide popularity of "Taliban" and Bin Laden is a type of burying heads in the sand. This actual reality reflects a crisis caused, in fact, by the divide that can hardly be seen with the naked eye, which separates drifting behind "Taliban" and "Al Qaeda" and animosity towards the arrogant American policies that rendered all accepted practices useless and expropriated international sanctities.
The huge paintings represent one face with multiple expressions, with the image of its subject changing from various angles.
Bearing in mind that the nationalist wing in the "Duma" Council accused him of succumbing to Bush's will and submitting to America's desire, which moved its fleets and planes to the Russian borders.
That is why there were differences between political parties according to differences in systems of States and to the circumstances under whose influence parties like these are formed.

That is why there were differences between political parties according to the differences in state regimes, and to the circumstances under whose influence parties like these are formed.
By mobilizing the people, political parties provide the national basis for solidarity against any outside aggression.
Claus Van Beiman, however, follows the historical sociological approach in forming the ideology for groups as a basis for the existence of parties. He says there are three theories that explain the presence of the party system:
Van Beiman believes that party interaction between pressure groups, through elections and bureaucracy, represents a communications network among them that makes the party a central force for these groups on one hand, and a subsidiary structure for the political regime in the state on the other hand.
Political parties provide, in this framework, stability and peaceful exchange of power through the presence of State political institutions.
But these parties do not have an important role in the political process, whether by activating the people, or their participation.
The failure of the party system in Lebanon is due to a structural problem in the Lebanese system, and its effect on society.
That is what made many political leaders in every sect take the place of parties and perform the role of actual mediator between the citizen and the State.
It is also a very old law that goes back to the days of the Ottomans, i.e., before the establishment of most of the current Lebanese parties, if not all of them.

Then the report of the Board of Directors, and the name change were endorsed."

While he referred to the three months grace period that the President of the Republic gave to the newly-appointed to prove their competence and sense the results of their efforts, he wished "that this grace period be given to everyone in their various locations and responsibilities so that they show their ability to perform their duties, or else they leave.
Was the first batch of appointments made from among those competent and trustworthy individuals, and would that positively affect the national economy? Hubaiqa said: "We want visible results on the ground. For example, at the Lebanon Electric Company, will all the bills be collected from everyone?
But, the mere appointments, as they occurred, do not positively affect the economy.
Economy and Trade Minister Basil Fleihan considered that the "Shopping month for the year 2002 contributes to marketing Lebanon all year round as the festival aims at focusing on the image of Lebanon, especially in light of procedures adopted by the government on the economic and legal fronts in order to return to being a hospital, a university and tourism for Arabs." He pointed out that it is "possible to attract more tourists, students and shoppers after the events of September 11th in the United States."
They noticed a special friendly welcome given to arrivals, especially those from the Arab States and Gulf States, who come to spend the holidays.
He added, "The implementation of the said tax in the short period announced will lead to the escape of investments and capitals, and consequently the transfer of projects to other countries.
The dollar ended the week in supply in the currency market in Beirut, exceeding demand, which allowed the Bank of Lebanon to buy it at the current rates whenever it had the chance, keeping its expanded interference margin between 1,501.00 and 1,514.00 liras.
It seemed from trading that investors have become fearful that the American currency authorities will lose all the weapons they have with regard to decreasing credit restrictions, in case economic policies in the United States continued in their weakness as is happening in Japan.

The Wall Street and Nasdaq bourses were able to limit their losses yesterday, as a result of buying back stock whose prices declined unjustifiably during the morning session, after investors rectified a lot of economic information that had been issued in the last two days, as well as the alarm raised by several companies regarding their quarterly results.
Yesterday, the President of the General Workers Union, Ghassan Ghusn, visited the Headquarters of the Federation of Workers and Employees Unions in the North.  He met with its president Muhammad Jamal Shihab and congratulated him on his recent election to this position.
He said: "We are all responsible in waging this multi-faceted battle (...) A government that does not want to reach an understanding with us on a program of action that safeguards the status of the worker as a major national asset and one of the main pillars of production; employers who are motivated by narrow beneficial interests on the pretext of pressing economic conditions and their receding profits; and external forces that work on exporting their economic system to us and seek, in the crux of their measures, to lower the size of the forces working in institutions and factories in the name of remedying the deficit, under the burdens of which the successive governmental policies have put themselves.
Sabine Oweiss wrote:
The tug of war between the Prime Minister and the Minister of Labor or the Speaker of the Parliament over the Shi'ite candidate for the position goes beyond the "authoritarian" framework of the matter to dive into the depth of the problem suffered by the Fund, which is the most moneyed and richest establishment among all the establishments of the State against the backdrop of the program that all the proposed candidates can carry.
This decision has led to receding Fund revenues in light of the humble increase in the number of new establishments subscribing to it.
There is apprehension in some circles that the objective of these steps is to push the Fund into losing its financial balance (among the existing funds) and, consequently, depriving it of the ability to continue. This at a time, during which both employers and workers equally call for invigorating its coverage because it represents a valve of social security for the different strata of the Lebanese society.
This time, the exhibition will be divided into two main events, namely: "The Levant Trade Show of Hospitality and Food Service Industries" and the "International Food and Drink Exhibition."

Finance Ministry Director Tells Hagazian Students: Budget Deficit 21% of Product and Value Added Tax Reduces It
Following an introduction by the Dean of the Business Management Faculty, Fadi Asrawi, Dr. Beefani talked about and considered the fact that: "The tax on added value has advantages and disadvantages. We do not work in an ideal economy, but in an economy that has two concerns: the first is economic growth, market movement, investment and creating job opportunities, and the other is financial, monetary, and taxational pertaining to the General Budget of the State.
He indicated that "the tax on added value is among the intelligent taxes.
He explained that "in Lebanon there are 72 indirect taxes, and their number has decreased. The tax on added value will replace them because it has the capability for self-control and, consequently, it prevents income tax evasion."
Yesterday, the Association held its weekly meeting under the chairmanship of Edward Qurdahi and in the presence of the members and discussed the agenda.
The Association appealed to the Minister of Public Works and Transport to carry out implementation procedures in order to launch the containers' station at Beirut Port in light of the completion of the technical study, prepared by the "Hamburg Sud" Foundation to purchase the station's equipment, which will be delivered to the Port's Administration within days.
General Finance Situation in November: Total Treasury Payments Reduced, Decreased Revenues, Budget Deficit
With regard to implementing the budget, the deficit at the end of November of the current year totaled 3348 billion, or a deficit percentage of 46.79% compared with an achieved deficit for the same period last year that totaled 3453 billion, or 47%.
As for the achieved treasury deficit with the beginning of December of the current year, the deficit totaled approximately 559 billion, a percentage of 36.77% of the total treasury operations compared with the achieved deficit for the same period last year that totaled 1186 billion, a percentage of 70.95% of the total treasury operations for the same period last year".
As for "Hizbollah" Lebanon, it only views itself within the framework of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and beyond the "Blue Line", "Shabaa Farms", "1923 border", and possibly the Kufur Shuba hills and others if the farmlands issue is resolved.  Who knows?
More than that, we ask how can this large difference in political and military presence, and in the role and its borders between "Hizbollah" Lebanon and Lebanon the state, be understood?
It was a message to the Lebanese interior that never stopped demanding "Hizbollah" is Lebanonized, and limits its activities and political and military duties to Lebanese targets within Lebanese interests, and not the transformation of the "Jerusalem Day" march into a compensation for Iranian misconceptions in the "war on Afghanistan".
And from here it is difficult to understand Lebanon the state: its role and duties.
Ali Hamadeh
Despite the fact that Burns did not carry, and is not expected to carry, anything except what his administration is expressing in public on a sensitive matter related to Lebanon and Syria, which is the issue of "Hizbollah", the meetings he held with Lebanese and Syrian officials allowed him the chance to reiterate the American capitol's concern for maintaining their positions, similar to the remaining concerned Arab countries, on the Palestinian - Israeli matter, sensitive to all countries of the region, and continuing the dialogue that Washington said through its ambassador in Beirut Vincent Patel it is conducting with the Lebanese and Syrian governments on "Hizbollah" and all other fundamental organizations like "Hamas" and "Islamic Jihad".
It was noticed that with Burns' concentration on the issue of "Hizbollah" and the continuation of American anxiety over it, he did not drop the delicate economic matter in Lebanon from his talks, in an indication some explain as ruling out pressures on it, even concern that Lebanon overcomes the difficulties it is facing in this field primarily with its private efforts.
Therefore, parallel to Burns' mission originally dedicated with the mission of American Secretary of State Special Envoy General Anthony Zini in the occupied Palestinian territories to show Washington's interest in cooperation in the issue of terrorism with the concerned countries on one hand, and staying in touch with regard to the opinions of these countries with regard to the Arab - Israeli conflict on the other hand, their concern for delivering specific letters in the latter issue shows, namely:
But it is careful to remind again that there is no alterative to the political process as neither extremism nor violence can lead to any result.
Which is what makes matters more difficult for the Americans, despite reiterating the commitments of President Bush and his administration to the Palestinian state project, which was lost in the midst of the violence in the Palestinian territories.
Eight times in the same session according to the tape.
Then bin Laden himself tells of two dreams, but more importantly after the "Abu Daoud" dream he feared that the operation would be revealed if people started to see it like that in their dreams, and so he asked him not to tell anyone if he saw another dream.
It is one of the most important television series that fastens a large Arab audience in front of the screen the entire month of Ramadan to follow it.  Television stations airing it conducted competitions on it.
The most important thing is that the fate of the big issues, namely the Palestinian cause, is not subject to this culture of invisibles, and that the few people who seek to determine its course do not rely on visions and dreams, away from the calculations of the mind and the requirements of interest.
They were more surprised with the accusations that considered it responsible in one way or another for the terrorist acts on the United States on the 11th of last September, Taliban terrorism and bin Laden terrorism in particular.
It pushed the said peoples to wonder if the mutual Iranian-American animosity launched by revolution of the late Imam Al Khomeini before approximately 22 years will be removed by the United State's war on "Taliban's" terrorism in Afghanistan and the Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden and his "Al Qaeda" network, who did not fall short of showing in practice animosity to Iran, its regime, and its practices, especially when they invaded the city of Mazar Al Sharif in 1998.
The flaw, referred to above, increased after the events of last September 11th in America, especially when the role of a number of Saudi citizens in them emerged.
And the latter's need for denying any responsibility for it or its citizens for what happened last September 11th.
This need was enhanced with information of readiness expressed by some groups to take advantage of the September 11th attacks to strike the regime.
But what could delay the continued development or hinder it is American information of communications between Tehran and bin Laden when he was in Sudan.

No American envoy or Secretary of Defense or Secretary of State or Minister of Court or even an Ambassador sir, no one from the Bani Murrah of the Bani Fazarah has asked Beirut just once about what is happening with it?
The essence of the constant American movement, since the events of September 11th, is terrorism.
Just for general information, and for the information of the White House and the CIA and the Pentagon and Congress, because things remind of other things, no country has suffered from terrorism and endured terrorists like Lebanon has suffered and endured.
When President Bush threatens, after his ambassador and within the hearing of Condoleezza, Lebanon and Syrian that their fate will be similar to the fate of the Taliban, it will be like the wolf that accuses the lamb of muddying the waters.
Lebanese novelist Rashid Al Daeef could be one of the most popular and widespread novelists, as he knows how to draw both Arab readers and foreign translators.
Contrary to what we have been familiar with in terms of novelists choosing exceptional heroes for their novels, Ruba Al-Sulh chose for her first novel "We All Fall Together" (*) an ordinary heroine, who has identified her regional and religious allegiance, but who represents, in her characteristics and life, an important category of Lebanese girls however their religious sects may differ.
There is the widowed and bereaved mother, the detained prisoner of war, the young man who exploits the war to extort money and get rich, and the enemy brothers. There are also those who have moved from the position of "struggle" to venerating the people of fortune, in order to achieve social positions and consequently prominent political positions, the old Nasserites, and those who rushed to share with Iraq its war against Iran and their news disappeared.

Her words are calamitous and confrontational that interact with the meanings that surpass the feelings to sharpened thoughts.
She prepares for her poem the most elevated of the French language, washed from the straw of the earth to elevated dimensions.
Why all this suffering?
I walk in the wound that the earth has become /

The obvious intervention between authorities, the increase in the "Troika" phenomena, fighting among leaders, public conflicts, impudent leaks, comic push for the forefront, and rushing towards shares, all that is irrefutable evidence on tampering with the principle of division of authorities, and insistence on violating the constitution.

The president of the government is put, in many cases, under the status quo, he only complains or heads towards isolation, and possibility knocking on external doors as a grievant or a strongman to return his role, and put someone else under the status quo.

In a letter on the General Accounting Office website and passed on to Bush and his vice-president Dick Cheney, the director of the General Accounting Office David Walker said "all our efforts to reach a fair and reasonable agreement have been rejected. We have exhausted legal means to find a solution to our request... this is why our only possible course is to file a lawsuit with the Federal Court in Columbia or to give up on our right to examine the documents."
This prospective lawsuit is expected to be the first in the history of the General Accounting Office, set up 80 years ago, against a government official or federal agency filed to obtain information wanted by Congress.

Even if there is no direct or assumed link between the new American campaign, warning of repercussions throughout the region, and the political and economic disturbances in Lebanon, which suddenly intensified in parallel with the assembly session, the logical conclusion suggested by the week's events points to two interconnected dangers approaching Lebanon or toward which it is likely to slide.
No less edgy than this step is the overt maneuver which shows a prime minister and ministers disinterested in power and ready to surrender this to the representatives.
It probably means that Lebanon is left to the consequences of American-Syrian negotiations which may be over half way on the path to obstacles and confrontation or toward agreement and understanding.
Nabil Boumansif
Since the United States came into existence, the traditional annual presidential address has never concerned foreign affairs as much as this time, and although its usual title is the "State of the Union," it seemed like a description of the state of "imperial hegemony."
Although a sense of humor and wit is not a trait of the Russians, recently emerged from the severe and fixed Marxist mold, the best comment on the American president's speech came from the president of the Russian Doma council, Ginadi Seliezniov, who told our journalist colleagues in Beirut that Bush was behaving as though he had appointed himself as the universe's attorney-general without anyone giving him the right or authority of a world attorney-general.
We have to stop and think carefully when we hear Bush say "there are countries that will stand like cowards before terrorism [...] but even if they don't act, America will act"... Such talk requires a definition by those of us in Lebanon, a search for a new and sophisticated language to ensure we do not waste resistance, on the one hand, and to avoid exposing Lebanon to the American war, on the other, because the slogan calling for a separation between legitimate resistance and condemned terrorism now needs to be developed to help communication with Washington go beyond a "dialogue of the deaf."
The most prominent position in it may be Sharon's acknowledgment of the inevitability of the creation of an independent Palestinian state, without weapons but with a police force to defend internal security.
He stated that he did not agree to the agenda arrived at between Shimon Peres and Abu Ala' but expressed his conviction of the possibility of reaching a common political agenda with Peres, accompanied by a ceasefire agreement with the Palestinian Authority.
In another article published by the magazine on Israeli Mossad, witnesses noted that reserve colonel Maeir Dighin disappeared for three months to reappear just one day after Habiqa was killed and asked: could Dighin be linked to the assassination?
It added that the foreign ministry is preparing a "black book" on the dangers of Iran which it will present to other countries.
American President George Bush renewed his warning to countries he described as rogue states against the consequences of trying to acquire weapons of mass destruction and called on the world's nations to stand behind him in this campaign. Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld accused Iran of playing a negative role in Iran and sending what he described as terrorists to the Bakaa valley in Lebanon via Damascus to carry out operations against other countries in the region and internationally.
He considered that "by standing by our coalition and our and allies and friends, these countries prove they have chosen the path of peace and reject terrorism."
This description met with criticism from various countries in the world.
On being asked about the possibility of Iran providing tribes in western Afghanistan with weapons, he replied: "We do not think the presence of neighboring or other countries that provide groups in Afghanistan with assistance is a good thing."
At the same time, an American official who did not wish to give his name said American intelligence services issued a warning last week about a possible attack against a nuclear reactor or installation in the United States.
He spoke about information concerning possible attacks against America obtained as a result of interrogating al-Qaida prisoners and from documents and video tapes seized by American forces in Afghanistan or other places in the world.
Under the banner of "Leadership in delicate times: a vision for a shared future," over three thousand people took part in the World Economic Forum whose work started in New York yesterday.
Four thousand police, security officers and investigators were deployed in the center of the busy and renowned island of Manhattan, turning the area around the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, where the conference is being held, into an excluded area and set up a security perimeter to prevent disruption and anti-globalization demonstrations which might hinder the Forum's proceedings as happened in the American city of Seattle two years ago.
The banner of "Leadership in delicate times: a vision for a shared future" covers six themes: improving security and dealing with areas of vulnerability and weakness, reappointing challenges in the world of business, reducing poverty, improving social equality, relaunching long-term economic growth and finally, shared values and respecting differences.
It will be attended by Bahrain's Heir to the Throne Sheikh Salman Ben Hamed Al Khalifa and the secretary-general of the Arab League Amru Moussa, as well as Prince Turki al-faisal, head of the American Foreign Planning Bureau at the State Department Richard Hass, the permanent American representative to the United Nations Ambassador John Negropointe and American congressmen Howard Berman and John Carey.
Something like the boom of an explosion, but a long boom. Some described it as a cackling which emanated out of the security cordon around the Venizia Hotel and meandered over Beirut.
Where did it come from?
The source explained that in the first few minutes of the experiment, there was an atmosphere of silent astonishment if not of speechlessness, adding that the explosion only happened after one of the Lebanese delegation stopped and pointed to the television screen using a long ruler and launched into an explanation of the meaning of the experiment.
The source went quiet and smiled but quickly suppressed his smile when he realized what he was doing.
The obstacles which occurred with our investigation appeared again: the informed source was getting ready for another round of chuckling but we were concerned that he might choke and worried that we might become depressed.
It saves television companies production costs and removes odious competition so that they all come together to broadcast the parliamentary session, in spite of the difficulty they faced this time because of the need for a balance between broadcasting and covering the Arab council of ministers' work.
The third section, after the sections criticizing the government and vilifying the politicians, was about the call for the government's resignation.
Customs reductions to absorb new tax violent campaigns against government and institutions and Monday government response day
This cover will be translated in terms of the size of the vote on the budget next Monday, the government's day at the chamber of representatives after 61 representatives, who carried on talking for four days, dissected the budget analytically and critically. Some of them did not spare other government policies and organizations, especially the security apparatus.
The sources said the session was normal apart from a heated discussion between Finance Minister Fuad Alsinyoura and Industry Minister George Ephram who opposed the reduction on industrial materials such as leathers without his prior consultation on a matter under his authority. This caused the president of the republic to intervene and to ask the two ministers to discuss the issue together.
While the interjections during the day were characterized by a clear call by the majority of western sector representatives, whose spokesman was representative Sami al-Khatib, for a government change and criticism by representative Mohamed Raad speaking on behalf of Hizbollah about the lack of application of government pledges, the evening interjections were characterized by two caustic attacks by representatives Boutrus Harb and Naila Muawadh against the security services and a lengthy, two-part interjection by the chair Hussein al-Husseini, one on the authority's approach and the other on taxation and economic policy.
On the issue of the budget, he accused the government of "deceiving parliamentary committees and disengaging from the system."
The attendees will examine "the content of a number of studies to decide what can be achieved and to set up a series of decisions to act as a starting point for a party workshop to begin its implementation phases when the new leadership takes up its task next May 1st."
He presented the current state of affairs with Phalangists following recent party elections which took place in a manner in breach of the party's rules, traditions and interests which "has further increased the nonsense, divisions and breakdowns."
The second paper covered national affairs and dealt with "the situation the country finds itself in, in terms of loss of sovereignty, confiscation of the free Lebanese right to decide and the breakdown in the role of national parties by every means.
First "responsible" reading of Bush's speech: serious warning and breach of resolution 1373
They added that according to reliable information that not a single official heard any direct threat or warning from any American official against Lebanon that because of Hizbollah, that if it does not end its activities, this will result in a military campaign.
When president of the republic Emile Lahud asked them to provide evidence that the operations were carried out by party elements outside Lebanon, the American response was: "the information is available but we can't disclose it because it would reveal our sources."
They pointed out that the danger also resides in the fact that Bush took no notice of the positions of some of his partners in fighting terrorism, such as the European Union in general, and France in particular whose Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrun fiercely criticized the American president for his speech, considering that he "wants to abridge all the world's problems to fighting terrorism." Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindt also described it as "foolish."
They considered that Bush has placed Hizbollah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad on the list of anti-terrorist targets.
It also strove to remove a number of moral and financial obstacles by endorsing reductions on customs tariffs for certain basic goods with the aim of maintaining prices.
Lahud met former representative Michel Sassin and reviewed the country's state of affairs with him, especially the economic and social situations, as well as regional developments.
In an exceptional session held just before the house of representatives was convened to complete its examination of the draft law for the general budget and subsequent budgets for the year 2002, and after the council of ministers tried to take in threats to the government's present and future existence, Prime Minister Rafiq al-Haririr is preparing to respond next Monday to the representatives' interventions.
President Lahud presented information showing corruption in most ministries, public services and institutions and called for monitoring committees to play their role more actively.
"The Association of Captives Liberated from Israeli Prisons" yesterday directed a message to the President of the Republic, demanding that he act to ratify the implementation decree for compensation of liberated captives, which has been held back by the General Secretariat of the Council of Ministers since 23/11/2001.

The Prince considers that these changes and advances require reforms to move toward democracy and the adoption of Islamic laws which are much more in keeping with international human rights treaties than many other laws.
Violet al-Balaa writes:
The head of the delegation saw no difference between Lebanon and Hong Kong in spite of the geographical distance between them "because there are many common features: in their natural geography and in the type of open economy based on services and in the dynamics which our two nations enjoy."
The meetings held by Tzak F. Ang. in Beirut with economic, trade and banking officials might help correct this trade imbalance in Lebanon's favor especially as "the local market looks promising and resembles, with the growth of the services sector over other sectors, the Hong Kong market where services account for 85% of the gross national product," with clear reservations about the large gap in official figures.
The first step forward could be through participation in a series of trade fairs organized by the Center and accompanied by concessions for this purpose.

Every young novelist now looks for an erotic idea in his novel.
How can we claim that there is still censorship?
The July 16, 1949 law on Publications for Young People, which was revived in 1958 and 1967, is still in force and the censorship board at the Ministry of Interior can prevent not only the sale of any publication to minors but also censure photo exhibitions and advertisements.
Very pertinent is the report presented recently to the state secretary for women's rights concerning "perversion" of the female image in advertisements, which is expected to add the principle of "non-sexism" to Article 15 of the July 29, 1881 law, even though this law covers all types of publications and not only advertisements! Today, we understand why Bouvier is asking for a big advance for his hot project, even though the Marquis de Sade appears in Folio and even though much more explicit films costing less then fifty francs can be found on the internet, and even though we hear a fifteen-year-old boy on a "Youth" radio station asking, night after night, if he can jump on his girlfriend's breasts... understand it if you will! What an absurd, arbitrary and contradictory matter!

We feel ourselves to be in the presence of an experienced writer who wishes to develop the poetic prose and its limits.
The poet sees the world through the dream of one exiled from his country or through the exile's internal torment.
"And I repent and return with the madness of exile to a time which runs out like a knife plunged into a stomach filled with water, a time in whose features we carry dried-up pens.
"We count the joys, our mothers' trills of joy on giving birth, we count the births, another year lines up with the scarecrows, our faces embalmed, we watch the galaxies, we watch for a black hole to let us in."

The sentence report stated "the Palestinian defendant was born in Jordan and held Jordanian nationality.

Those with malicious intentions have never once been slow in their plans to push us down the slippery slope of silly and cheap disputes, leading to divisions among us.

"Fourth: The Authority sees that the tax policy on the limited income categories; insistence on the existence of a yield economy based on deals and speculations; opening of our markets to smuggling and without competitive ability in our products; striking the sectors of education, industry, agriculture, and commerce under the aggravation of unemployment and migration; and not controlling the competition of non-Lebanese labor-all of that aggravates the crisis and does not solve it."

Kanaan said that Malik's introduction is about a philosophical climate and is not philosophy. Concurring with her was Seif, considering that it contains an obvious philosophical position.
At the end of the seminar Nassar commented on the contributions, and part of what he said was: "I felt in Seif and Kanaan some cruelty against Charles Malik."
"I tried to clarify that the theme around which the introduction revolves is but the concept of the classes of existence."
He also saw in what was said by Saab that the other writings of Malik do not advance or hinder from the viewpoint that his method of philosophical thinking is obvious in the introduction, that scientific prudence is imperative as acquaintance with Malik's writings might reinforce our view of some matters or change that view, and as such, it is necessary not to risk generalizing statements about what was written by Malik.
It added that Havelange sent a message to the East African Federation, promising it an amount of 50,000 dollars for its secretariat-general in return for supporting Blatter's nomination.

"Time" magazine has published in today's issue that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi showed his willingness to pay financial indemnification to the families of the victims of the American plane explosion over Lockerbie that took the life of 270 people in 1988.
But the magazine talked about 3.5 billion dollars.
The Saudis denied press reports about which officials in Canada, Britain, and Belgium talked, indicating that it issued covert sentences in this case.

King Abd Allah Met Members of Senate and to Washington after Two Weeks: Israel Tried to Replace Arafat and the American View of the Palestinian State is Insufficient
He said, "The aim of the Israeli attack on Palestinian people is through shattering its will, destroying the infrastructure of its institutions, isolating its leadership or replacing it with another, and picturing the situation in the area as if it is a security problem."
He described the initiative of Saudi Crown Prince-Premier Deputy Prime Minister- President of the National Guard Prince Abd-Allah ibn abd El-Aziz that was approved by the Arab leaders in the Beirut summit last March as being "a basic foundation to achieving comprehensive and permanent peace in the area."
He mentioned that Jordan was, during the last weeks, "the sole access through which entered all Jordanian and Arab aid to the Palestinians, and the Jordanian hospitals in Ram-Allah, Nablus, Jenin, and Al-Khalil continued to work toward helping our folks in their ordeal."
The Jordanian news agency Petra reported that the Jordanian monarch received yesterday a call from the Saudi crown price "in the context of coordination and consultation before the king's visit to Washington," and the prince informed the king of his recent talks with the American administration, which focused on ending the Israeli occupation and finding an exit for the crisis that resulted from Israel's invasion of the Palestinian territories.
The site of combat hints at the truth of the reports saying that many of the combatants of the Taliban Islamic movement and the Al-Qaeda fundamentalist organization that is led by Osama bin Laden, the main suspect in the attacks to which the United States was exposed on September 11, fled to Pakistani border areas.
He said to reporters, "We have a reconnaissance team of special forces; those people fired at it, the special forces responded likewise more accurately, and most probably killed two of them."
He said to reporters in Bagram, "We were aware of their reaction after the first engagement, we were ready for them, and we killed two of them."
More than 115 people were killed or injured last weekend when the supporters of warlord Basha Khan attacked the regional capital Gardiz with missiles in an attempt to overthrow its ruler Taj Muhammad Wirdak.

After depletion of their ammunition, Palestinian activists opened holes in the walls to creep from house to house to escape from the bulldozers of the Israeli army, then they hid for days under the debris to avoid being arrested after the battles that took place in Jenin.
But the Palestinians repeated that a much larger number were buried under the debris of houses that were destroyed by the tanks and the bulldozers, which led to making homeless 5000 people, inhabitants of the camp whose number amounts to 13,000.
He was armed with a gun.
Muhammad (25 years old), a member of the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas, explained that all units of fighters were hiding and preparing for the battle when the Israeli forces invaded the camp on the third of April.
Israel says that the bulldozers did not enter the camp except after the activists ignored repetitive calls across loudspeakers to surrender.
"We felt extremely weak," and there were bruises on his nose and neck, and two black rings appeared under his eyes.
Mahmoud (39 years old), who is a Palestinian security man, reported that he fought for two days and hid in the basement of a house for eight days.

"It is impossible to defeat people who are struggling for their freedom."
She added, "Our problem with Iran lies in its international policy that supports terrorism across the world and in the Middle East," and also in the resistance "of a small number of people who were not elected" to the regime's reformist policy.
He said in a statement to the Iranian Islamic Republic News Agency IRNA that imposing "an embargo on Israel and the states that support it will be a symbolic and effective effort to stop the criminal operations of the Zionist regime against the Palestinian people.... It is necessary that the Islamic states work homogeneously" with respect to Israel.
But Iraq applied alone an embargo as of the eighth of April.
He added: "I support the idea saying that regional interests concern only the states of the area."

One of the diplomats hoped to "reach an agreement by tomorrow (today), but it is not sure that this will happen."
After holding talks on the seventh of last March that continued for three hours in New York, Al-Hadithi and Anan will meet anew to discuss the return of weapons inspectors, which is the condition for lifting the sanctions.
The Iraqi embassy in Moscow accused the United States of "continuing to follow its traditional policy of provocation" by waiting until the last minute to give entry visas to the Iraqi delegation accompanying Al-Hadithi to New York.
He said to the reporters on the eve of launching an exhibition in Baghdad: "That is not true."
Boucher said: "We have not found until now any credible evidence that Kulshoga systems have been moved to Iraq," and "the Ukrainian government announced that moving such radar systems did not occur, and we await from Ukraine confirmation that it will not happen."
It explained that Manassra and his Iraqi counterpart Ahmad Murtada Ahmad expressed during the meeting "the common desire to further fraternal relations and develop them toward future horizons in various fields."
Yesterday, I was ashamed of myself twice: once because I am still a voracious reader, and once because I am still a consumer of American tobacco, amid growth of the wave of popular boycotting of all its types.
If the boycotting extends from tobacco to all American commodities having European substitutes (from cars to electrical appliances to clothes to types of food...) it will be a painful matter to their owners.
From Genoa to Seattle to Puerto Alegri, demonstrations, meetings, and alternative programs stormed, and a new concern started to form among the civil society organizations having aspirations and programs.
And without being qualified to become people that are sublime, educated, productive, reconciling with technology and its thought, not consumers of debauched movies and foul books, and having modern and productive religious awareness.
Disaster.
Ten years ago, President Rafeek Al-Hareeri had just formed the first of his governments following the "revolution of tires" on May 6, 1992, that unseated the government of president Omar Karami, and the new prime minister chose for himself the central school in Junia as a theater for his first look at the plot opposed to the state of Al-Taif.
The first of May takes for reality this sole meaning toward a political class that announces daily its inability to change policies and solve crises and possesses nothing but professional inability, with everything and everyone included in this club.
As to the three million Lebanese, they can only adapt to the fire of gasoline and the fires of the other crises, and no one moves a still, and no one even adopts dervishism to hear what is in the homes of traces of the "white hands" consecutive with the rulers, the governments, and parliaments during a decade.
Nabeel Bumunsif
There is no need, in fact, for arguing the importance of the emergence of Yasser Arafat from the military isolation that was imposed on him by the Israeli government, because his emergence forms a great victory over Sharon, who does not want to assassinate the Palestinian president politically through destruction of the authority and its infrastructure only, but rather wants to assassinate him physically and has not hesitated to announce that explicitly more than once.
But it is necessary that we all remember now, specifically, that many things and more meanings will remain incarcerated within the "walls of boycott" that Sharon transformed into a cell for Arafat in the last four weeks.
Likely if it is true that the arrangements paper that organized the exit of Arafat included an American commitment to the Israelis that their agreement to let him out will be met from Washington with a valuable reward represented in the abortion of the tasks of the fact-finding committee in Jenin, then that means, consequently, that Arafat comes out to be replaced by international law and the Security Council through Resolution 1405 specifically, and also the international legitimacy represented in the United Nations.
Syria Has Not Used Its Influence to Restrain Hezbollah and "Ha'arts" Demands a Quick Solution For Church Of Nativity
Meanwhile, Israeli newspapers reflected reactions to the decision that was taken by the small ministerial council not to cooperate with the fact-finding committee in the Jenin camp.
He added: "From the instant in which the government agreed last week to receive the committee and cooperate with it, it could no longer close the doors in its face."
In this regard was written: "With the end of the siege of Yasser Arafat in the heart of Ram-Allah, a quick solution must be found for the continuous crisis in Bethlehem."
"The prime minister must learn from that that the public prefers brave political decisions and serious political operations to the policy of power and crushing."

When days passed without him being detained, speculation started in the Iranian political and press circles.
From the discussions of the Iranian inside, it seems to the observer that the controversy about opening a dialogue with Washington has entered a new stage that can be considered advanced.
What is noticeable is that some who are classified in the square of conservatives have started to talk about the absence of impediments for dialogue with Washington and about the importance to Iran of the relationship with Washington.
In his address to a gathering of representatives recently, Rafsinjani said that "no one opposes establishing ties between unofficial circles in Iran and the United States including the representatives of the people, but what is refused is using this matter as a tool in political rivalry."
From  the collection of Iranian positions, the theoretical and the practical, since the incidents of September 11, starting with Khatami's condolences for the victims of the World Trade Center and his condemnation of terrorism, passing by the practical position in Afghanistan, and reaching the call for "self-control" in southern Lebanon, the Iranian-American relations that have been tense since February 1979 seem to be heading for a new phase. Perhaps it will be a step along a track followed by the Iranians with their eyes on the model of Chinese-American relations.
He said that these powers, among whom was the United States, were able to put their vows into action, "but what happened actually is a sudden change in the course of the war against terrorism that I fear has come to threaten their credibility and the faith of people in them in our Arab and Islamic world.... What happened in  reality contradicted all the promises and the assurances as these international powers focused on the security aspects on the ground and ignored the pivotal role of political negotiations in developing the atmosphere appropriate to reduce the severity of the resistance."
But Mubarak said that the aim of the Israeli military operations is "terrorizing the Palestinian people and suppressing their resistance to the occupation," emphasizing that the Palestinian resistance will continue as long as the occupation continues.
He considered that this approval "clearly proves the importance of the American role in the endeavor to reach compromise through direct negotiations between the two sides and emphasizes at the same time that the intervention of the United States with strength... can lead to a true political relief that will lead in turn to accomplishing security and warranting stability in the area."
"Our channels are used to seed dissension and hatred between Arab states and affect no one other than the Arab nation."
A person with close connections to the Egyptian presidency had announced on Monday that Mubarak is studying "ways out of the current crisis in the area and the efforts that the Arab states ought to make."
Mystery Surrounds Fate of Chechen Leader; Russian Army Announces Killing of Basaiev Lebed
The official Russian agency Itar-Tass had quoted Kafashnen as saying that "Shamel Basaiev was killed, but his body was not found."
He said that he contacted a number of Chechen officials who assured him that the news was untrue.
It said that he died, poisoned by a message that was delivered to him by a person he knew, and that the latter appeared to be a Russian agent.
His leg was amputated in February 2000 after a mine detonated under him as he was leading the escape of the fighters from Groznyy at night.
Russian President Vladimir Putin and other officials viewed the body.
Al-Hareeri's call to Lahud came after the approval by the joint parliamentary committees of the new draft telecommunications law.
But Al-Hareeri repeated in front of his visitors that the issue "is with all simplicity that there are 300 million dollars annually being received by the state from the two companies, and the figure will reach 400 million in the year 2003."
He said that talk about disagreements in generalities is not permissible but rather the points of disagreement must be clarified.
Also, the meeting of the Chairman of Parliament Nabeeh Berri with Al-Hareeri on the margin of the session of the committees did not witness any admonition from the parliament chairman to the Prime Minister on the background of the talk in Washington about delay by the parliament in finalizing the telecommunications law and proceeding accordingly to privatization of the telephone.
In this item, "License is not granted to provide public telecommunications except to Lebanese natural persons or to person companies and limited liability companies in which natural Lebanese partners or pure Lebanese companies own shares not less in percentage than 20 percent, the company system prohibits relinquishing from it for non-Lebanese, for ignored companies, or for equity share companies in which natural Lebanese persons or pure Lebanese companies own nominal shares not less than 20 percent the company system prohibits relinquishing from it for non-Lebanese."
As to what is related to Article 50, the chapter of employees, it remained pending to a session to be held by a branch committee comprised of Berri, Al-Hareeri, the Minister of Telecommunications Jean Louis Qirdahi, the Minister of Finance Fuad Al-Senyora, and the Chairman of the Administration and Justice Committee Makhayel Dhaher after the committee receives the statistical information that it requested from Qirdahi.
The circles of Krami asserted that the visit was scheduled for last week but Krami preferred to postpone it somewhat so that it is not misinterpreted, particularly under the dispute that was fervent between the presidents of the republic and the government.
Batel's visit was met with objections, protest signs, and positions emphasizing the right of the resistance to work toward elimination of the occupation and deploring  American support for Israel.
The National Media Agency reported Batel's confirmation of United States determination to support the area of Al-Arkoub developmentally and particularly Sheba and Kafrshuba, stressing that the aim of his tour is "seeing the situations of the area and its developmental, economic, and educational needs."
Several organizations raised signs deploring the visit.
The Islamic Resistance, on its part, announced the confrontation of its air units at a quarter to one in the afternoon with "the hostile Israeli military aircraft that violated the Lebanese skies above Bint Jubail and its area in the Lebanese south."
President of the Battalions party Kareem Baqradawani sent a message to President Ameen Al-Jimayel without naming him and said: "Let this message reach who should receive it: In the Phalanges there is one president, one political office, and one Phalanges legitimacy."
He said: "I insisted on making the first visit to this area, the area of 160 martyrs, and in the name of those martyrs, and on top of them the late comrade Faraj Ebeid whom we will not forget, in their name I salute three: the late Faraj Ebeid, the martyr of Al-Remeil; President Basheer Al-Jimayel, the martyr of martyrs; and Sheikh Bayar Al-Jimayel, the father of the martyrs."
"We in the Phalanges are the history of Lebanon, and it is long, but I summarize it in three. The first is that the Phalanges party is an independence movement. The second is that the Phalanges were the ones who carried the weapons to prevent solving all the crises of the area at the expense of Lebanon. And the third is that the strong Phalanges indicates the strength of Lebanon, and the weak Phalanges indicates the weakness of Lebanon.... And I tell you with all simplicity, the Phalanges if returning and present is capable of gaining strength and will gain strength, and with us Lebanon grows and gains strength. I tell you in all calmness and let the message reach who should receive it: In the Phalanges there is one president, one political office, and one Phalanges legitimacy, for there are no Phalanges beyond that legitimacy, and anyone who claims it is not a Phalanges party member, for everything that is illegitimate harms the party, the Christians, and the homeland, for the house, like all Phalanges houses, is open to everyone under legitimacy."
some of them have become silent because he has collapsed and no longer has strength to talk,
and the official did not ask about the reason for the people's silence,
They took advantage of the preoccupation of the world, the whole world, with the catastrophes and calamities happening in Ram-Allah, Jenin, and Bethlehem to whet their most effective weapons in preparation for destroying each other.
The explosion of the accused of the incidents of Al-Daniyya in front of the highest judiciary authority in this country did not happen before and created an untold crisis.

They said that the two ministers Hammoud and Tubbara meet on the eighth day of issuing the council decision, to study the possibilities of winning the suit or losing it and preservation of Lebanon's rights from the Hebrew state in case the result of the suit is not in its favor. This is what is being stressed by Hammoud, who made many contacts with international officials seeking guidance regarding what awaits Lebanon's suit, which will take to prepare its text in Tubbara's estimation a month as a maximum period from the team of attorneys who will take care of filing it and who have experience and international fame in international law, such as the international attorney Michal Tweini who previously prepared a study in which he estimated an indemnification for Lebanon reaching a value of fifty billion dollars.
They tried to inquire about the reason for its timing in this circumstance, as Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has not responded to more than one request addressed to him by American President George W. Bush publicly to stop his continuous butcheries against the Palestinian people, except for the request to lift the siege off the Authority President Yasser Arafat, knowing that he until now has not met his promise that led to divisions within the Israeli cabinet last Sunday, and to divisions between the Israeli parties.
They expressed their hopes that they will not be misunderstood in their recalling of Sharon's history and what was known about him of butcheries, atrocities, and mass crimes. Tubarra is one of the notable attorneys who recognizes that, but the purpose is to refer to the danger of achieving success of the suit that will be raised against Israel.
He said: "His aim was to obstruct the session."
"There was one minister, who was the late Joseph Skaff."
"Does his objection yesterday match what happened with him when we were in the temporary parliament facility?"
"In the absence of President Saleem Al-Huss who was assigned by the forgiven President Rene Muawwad, a fierce battle took place at that time between the Awnis and the Qawatis on one of the bridges in Beirut. I was obliged as President of the Republic to assign the deputy prime minister at that time, Michal Sasseen, to convene the cabinet to discuss this issue to refer what happened to the Justice Council."
About the aim of the position that was taken by President Al-Husseini, he said: "His aim is obstructing the session."
An hour of architectural and engineering "exploration," and of course historical and archaeological, spent by a delegation from the Beirut municipality council, led by the director of the municipality Abd El-Munim Al-Arees, all over the Cathedral of Saint Georgios for orthodox Romans-Star Plaza yesterday afternoon, where the hundred laborers work actively day and night, putting the final touches on the walls of the cathedral, its pillars, and its floor, in preparation for its grand inauguration on May 6 on the festival of its patron Saint Georgios and Easter Monday (according to the Eastern calendar).
Also, what was the history of the cathedral, the information that indicates that it goes back to the fourth century, the archaeological discoveries that prove this after being extracted from its interior, and what is the plan to establish the underground archaeological museum below it.
The guests emerged with a positive impression that was expressed by director Al-Arees to "Al-Nahar" as he said, "The work we saw today and the precision with which the restoration is being accomplished make us all proud of this city and this homeland for what they contain of archaeological features that we should all be proud of."
For after the surprise of hoisting the half-ton bell, the fixation and preparation of which were completed yesterday, the new part of the edifice was an old olive tree, 270 years old. Its height is three meters and its diameter is more than a meter. Its source is the neighborhood of Qana. It was planted in the front hall and has become one of the corners of the place.
Lahud's call came upon congratulating the laborers of Lebanon on the anniversary of the First of May, which coincides with today, as he referred to "what is symbolized by labor in terms of meanings and values, the most prominent of which are giving, production, and objectivity."
"As to a weak state that is deprived of its rights and encumbered with debts, it will be unable to perform its responsibilities, and the foundations of its immunity will evanesce."
He had received, in succession, representatives Jubran Touq, Muhammad Yahia, Robert Ghanem, Sameer Azir, Nazim Al-Khuri, Jihad Al-Samad, Marwan Faris, Asaas Hirdan, and Faisal Al-Dawud.
"As we thanked him for what has been accomplished in achievements, we emphasized the necessity of accomplishing all the requests mentioned in it, and they are the minimal requests, recognizing the difficult situations through which the country is passing."
The Foreign and Expatriates Minister Mahmoud Hammoud called on the Secretary-General of the United Nations Koffi Anan and the Security Council to "make necessary decisions to make the 'fact-finding committee' that was formed by the Security Council to investigate the crimes that were committed by Israel in the Jenin camp and to put the resolutions made by the Council into action, opposing Israel's challenge to the international community."
Al-Saeed stated at the end: "Consultation is daily between us and Minister Hammoud. The Arab concerns of His Excellency are many, and he carries them in his heart and on his shoulder. We are very happy to see Lebanon presiding over the Arab summit, and in its light he moves to implement the decisions of the Beirut summit."
And is the exit that was presented during the Beirut summit for the state between Kuwait and Iraq witnessing practical implementation?
"If there are any Arab efforts and the efforts of the Arab summit that can convince the Iraqi side of the necessity of cooperation, then we welcome such efforts."
Saudi businessman Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal announced his objection to the Arab boycott of American products, calling for moving toward public opinion in the United States to influence the decision-makers there.
He emphasized that the Arab states are capable of influencing decision-makers in the United States "in case they unite with their economic interests and not the political."
He responded: "When I talked in the press conference about the issue of the Lebanese economy, I meant the economy, and I depended in my criticism on figures I requested from the World Bank."
Then he was asked: Tell me frankly, do you aspire to head the government of Lebanon?
The candidate for the orthodox seat for the Al-Matn Al-Shamali constituency Ghassan Mikhyeer emphasized that "the battle has become between the opposition and the opposition over the seat of Dr. Albert Mikhyeer and not over the seat of the Almer family, present currently in the parliament in the person of representative Michal Almer."
He was asked: From what position will you go through these elections-is that from the position of the implicit alliance with representative Michal Almer or from the position of the declared alliance with him? He responded: "We are going through them from the position of loyalty to the principles of Dr. Albert Mikhyeer and his approach. That is the most important promise I make to the Matnis. Naturally there was elective cooperation, and everyone knows that the deceased went into the parliament and said his word and continued to say it. I want here to explain that we had barely finished burying the deceased when we heard of the nomination of Mr. Gabriel Almer. We had barely finished accepting condolences when he came upon us with the press conference that he held."
"Everyone has the right of candidacy. We consider that this matter is hostile to the opposition, and we are in confrontation of that direction and of anyone who supports that nomination."
Did you receive support other than the support of Jubran Tweini from Qornat Shahwan Meeting?
"This equation no longer fools the Matni voter nor the Lebanese, and candidate Mikhyeer must work hard to identify his political color."
There exists now a new union for the planters of tobacco nominated to enter the executive board, which raises the number of unions to 37.
The second recent episode of the contribution of Sheikh Abd El-Ameer Qublan in the twelfth Islamic Research Academy conference (Cairo-The Honored Azhar) was under the title "This Is Islam."
The Holy Quran and the Prophetic tradition are the two major sources for providing Muslims with the culture in its various branches, for culture addresses the entire entity of man, with values and moral concepts. It influences his conduct and refines his behavior, because it is a must that work be done by those responsible for the cultural affair-governments and regional and international organizations-to establish an international cultural charter that would constrict the area of cultural illiteracy and make available the opportunities for positive interaction with the thoughts and adapts the circumstances to exercise them. This required purification of the knowledge and intellectual space of the impurities that came onto it coercively, through a process of renewal.
An expanded meeting was held at the Association of Attorneys in Beirut, gathering the association presidents and representatives of free professions in Beirut and the north. It was dedicated to discussing the amendment of the law for adjusting the situations of income-tax payers.
He mentioned that the two previous meetings that were held in this framework in the associations of attorneys and physicians in Beirut "crystallized the complete view and the unified bill of amendment, which we believe that is the best, the most just, and the most appropriate for the people of free professions."
"What we endeavored and endeavor with the diligence of our colleagues, the respectable representatives affiliated with the free professions who sense the feelings of us all and live it and suffer from it, is an amendment for this law that takes into consideration what we presented, several factors among which are:"
"- The factor of comprehensiveness of the adjustment and closing its door finally, such that it includes the years noted in the law, in addition to the two years 2000 and 2001 inclusively, provided that the general law is applied as of the business of the year 2002, which saves everyone futile complications."
"We are all confident that the concerned authorities will take into consideration this request of ours. We are all unanimous about it because it is a just and rightful demand, and our course to achieving it is democratic and legitimate in a country that we aspire will be on the standard dreamed of by its sincere subjects."

What is in Lebanon?
It occupies the screens and the newspaper pages where the smell of curses, hatred, and grudges flows from every side and direction.
Not far from the "Al Matin madhouse," as it is described by sages of politics and state, there must be some political remarks on its margin indicating that the magnitude of loss in it is greater than the magnitude of gain of any winning group.
4- It is shown by the battle and the rejection of mediation and accord that the spiritual leader of the opposition, the Marunite patriarch, senses that his desires for accord remain words not stopped at by the "sons of the parish."
And in all cases the clearing is realized.
These are some of the remarks 24 hours before the time of the Al-Matin secondary elections.
Always Hoarse.... But!
And if the three have struggled for long to enhance the terms of the privatization law and to place the largest amount possible of restrictions and texts that guarantee concern for the public interest and the availability of transparency, then how can we understand their presentation of a request to withdraw the proposition of the prime minister and which has actually happened, and on the pretext that the proposition is unconstitutional and that the authority abuse is handled by the applicable laws.
Is it because we have the penal law that is full of articles and texts, which if applied can ensure transparency and guarantee fairness among subjects?
Yet we know that many of the folks of authority and politics give it no regard, but in spite of that the "guards of the law" did not hesitate to deprive Lebanon of a new text that tries to block the road of the hands of relatives to the "yield of the state!"
Or perhaps because they rely on the "manipulated" legal texts to the extent that the three of them are hoarse from protest and in a permanent manner!
"The estimation that crystallized after the withdrawal is that Israel's staying in that area will be used by Hezbollah as a pretext to continue its activity."
"But in spite of that, discussing the possibility of withdrawal from Shiba farms is not something 'illegitimate.'"
The writer continued: "It is probable that the estimations of the Ministry of Defense regarding the attempt by Hezbollah to find a pretext to continue its military operations have found confirmation for them in the recent days when the party and Syrian parties organized last week a protest demonstration in which hundreds of people participated in the village of Al Abbassia adjacent to Shiba farms in their western edge."
"After that, Nasr-Allah mentioned that Hezbollah is committed to the liberation of the Lebanese captives detained in Israel."
"For the Lebanese government has been forced to draw a line in coordination with Syria, by which it permitted the party's operations in the farms."
The Confidence in Elections
The intention is Algeria in its second parliamentary elections since the intervention of the army in January 1992 to cancel the results of the Islamists and prevent their reaching to the authority that led to opening a gruesome chapter in the history of the country that no one can claim that has ended yet, although the rate of violence has constricted in last three years.
But neither this nor that presents the depth of the problem that was expressed by the majority of the voters by not voting.
The Arabs who abstained expressed in the best of cases their displeasure at the lack of improvement in the security and economic situations, in particular, and worse, their despair of the possibility of true change only by voting.
And many also believe that the fist of the military on the rule is still the same even if rulers change.
If this confidence crisis expresses itself today in Algeria, it is a comprehensive Arab phenomenon that threatens the stability of countries, because it threatens the communities as much as it threatens the regimes. Its danger increases with every election process that is nothing but escape away from problems that require difficult treatments or that raise hollow democratic slogans.
And 48 hours before the Al Matin event in which Ghassan Mikhyeer, Mirna Almer, and Gabriel Almer are competing, the rivalry was at its fiercest at the background of what was released by Minister of Interior Elias Almer in positions and threats in his televised talk that he delivered, which gave an opportunity to those he targeted to respond.
In the Patriarchal edifice, the chairman of the Free Patriots Party Douri Shamoun called after his meeting with Patriarch Sfeer on the Minister of Interior to "read the law of elections properly."
Meanwhile, Minister of National Defense Khaleel Al Herawi announced that his colleague Minister Almer "gave necessary reassurances, and we are comfortable."
Meanwhile, the internal security forces explained in a statement the circumstances around what happened in front of the television station that is owned by the candidate Gabriel Almer and said that "information was available this morning (yesterday) about the potential gathering of some persons in front of the station in preparation for launching a demonstration. Subsequently, orders were given to internal security forces men to move toward the location to maintain order... and when it appeared to the administration that there was no need to take these measures, orders were given to all personnel to return to their stations."
General, the Armenian citizens are shocked, injured at heart.
Because we are far away from bickering and rumors, because we ascend above absurdities, but the cup is overfull!
Who is the dealing category?
Does the General mean by the devil, that one who boycotted the elections with the aim of destroying what was left of the homeland at that time?
Who is holding us indebted for our identity, and was he the one who was going to destroy this identity as a result of his Don Quixote wars and his rancorous speeches?
Why didn't General Oun and the representative of Al Matn Naseeb Lahud protest against keeping the mountain of wastes in the area of Borj Hammoud?
But we are rectifying the aim and reminding that our political line is clear and explicit with no room for impurities and false arguments: The Tashnaq party believes in the unity of Lebanon and its sovereignty regardless of the ruling authority in it, and the party also is not one of the censor carriers.
We ask and we suffice to this extent: Did not the Armenians at that time form an isolated cell or a ghetto?
Where have the inflammatory anti-rule positions gone?
Liberals Party: The Presidential Abatements Most Resemble a Truce to Rearrange His Lines
"We see in the facts that were mentioned by the report a little of many practices of those in authority who will not be affected by it, but will rather respond to it with absolute denial in spite of all the clues, testimonies, and axioms."
"This 'Russian Roulette' game takes as its means booby-trapping the files and timing them, even those pertinent to the livelihood of the citizen, and transforming them on demand, sometimes on the background of share-splitting and sometimes according to the signal of the beat master, a subject of debate, brawl, and strife."
"Is it not yet time for the authorities to stop their double-standard policy and deal with the citizens on the basis of a distinct class of the first degree and classes of lower degrees?"
In them a man is either honored or insulted.
The opposition has challenged the voter in his logic because it expected from him not to measure its promises against its pledges and past, so it lost its credibility.
The opposition challenged the voter in his dignity because it exploited him by way of revenge and creation of dissension even within the same family and the same household, considering that the people comprise a flock that it forces and herds to the pastures of its grudges and selfishness.
This is an aggression against freedom and a provocation, for the limits of freedom stop at respecting others, not by mentioning them with curses.
If Dr. Mikhyeer was destined to say his word, he would have said: Go away from me, you brokers of slogans and traders of maneuvers, Allah will curse you, the earth will repel you, and the people will stone you because you slaughtered democracy by exclusivity in decision without referring to the political allies and the popular grassroots.
They rejected Al Taif, and they refused to recognize the state with all its institutions as they rejected the law of elections and boycotted, so we understood, respected, and appreciated the people of principles.
Where is their credibility?
What was the result?
It challenged the voter in his concern for his area and the future of his children because it expected him to expect a prosperous future for his area and for his children through those who secured nothing for him or for the area.
The folks of Al Matin are proud mutineers with the power of the truth, dignity, loyalty, and pride.
Here are the Society's remarks:
"Those are acts that are subject to the Lebanese penal law and particularly its two articles 331 and 332, considering them crimes of authority abuse."
"The provisions of the aforementioned Article 49 mean that using the isolator is obligatory, and that the explicitness of the text leaves no room for interpretation or construal about this issue."
The "University of Expatriates-The Spreading" promised the President of the Republic Emil Lahud to contribute to "rebuilding every foot of land that is liberated from foreign occupation" and directed to him a salutation on the second anniversary of the liberation.
"For the assassination of the martyr Ramzi Eirani after abducting him and torturing him is a matter of extreme gravity."
"And we call for referring this crime to the Justice Council for its seriousness and for its effect on the national and societal security."
"We want Lebanon to be an oasis of security and safety because the deterioration of situations within it will lead to regional deterioration."
"We call on the Lebanese to be aware of the danger of naturalization to their future."
The drums of war started to beat in Al Matin under the title of the Orthodox seat.
Allow us, leaders (and may the candidates excuse us because they are only a ride for this very special war):
- There is no fool in Lebanon who does not know that if you want to be a Christian leader you have to curse Syria and demand its exit publicly, as to secretly, the mediations are in full force.
We oppose insanely in hope of registering a victory of the type of triple alliance victories, and everyone aspires to be the candidate qualified for the Presidency of the Republic.
Who told you that you are the protectors of freedom, sovereignty, and free decision, and we are mere mercenaries in this country?
And finally to the three candidates Mrs. Mirna Almer, Ghassan Mikhyeer, and Gabriel Almer: You have blessings, and no one can maneuver with you in ethics, experience, and patriotism.
Wisdom calls on you, and Lebanon senses good in your bravery. All of us have bigger and more hopes in you, so stand firm for you are the senior voters.
He added "that the Higher Expatriates Committee at the Party made great progress towards political, spiritual and party groups with the aim of reunifying the League, as Lebanon regained its unity, outside sectarian and religious facts, because the National Party and its expatriates still finds itself the favorite tool to work towards that."
The President of the Republic stressed "the importance of interaction between Arab doctors because, in that, lies one of the aspects of Arab solidarity in the scientific and medical fields, to face the technical advance witnessed in Israel, which it uses to achieve its suspects goals and objectives.
President of the Republic received the pastor of the Maronite Serba Parish, Bishop Guy Boulus Najim, followed by the President of the Solidarity Party, Emil Rahmah, and followed by the President of the Board of Directors, Executive Director of the "Lebanon Electric" Corporation Kamal Al Hayek, and was presented with the phases completed by the action plan of the Institution in light of the resolutions issued lately by the Minister's Council.
A statement read by Secretary General of the Party Farouq Dahrouj at a press conference stated: "We are not surprised by the appearance of Minister of Interior Mr. Elias Al Murr" on the LBC only two days before ballot day of the side elections in Al Matn.
He added: "We had hoped that the ideas of the Minister would remain on the political level, without stooping to the level of gestures of gratitude for several political elements and all the people of Al Matn, on whose side the "family" stood, while the reply was little loyalty. Is this ignorance of the political nature of the ongoing side elections battle  coincidence, and does the Minister of Interior believe that the responsibilities imposed by his official position are in harmony with his repeated persistence to revive past conflicts and disputes forgotten by time, and from which all parties deduced, in various degrees, the necessary lessons to prevent their repetition?
It is rude and explicit interference in the elections, even though he knows that his threats do not frighten the Party, nor its symbols, or any member in it.
The political and even legal flaw that he endures is embodied in the way of terrorizing and the pressure he put on the citizens of Al Matn. It is therefore strange that a responsible minister would dare to override the law that obligates balloting behind curtains, by resorting to an interpretation of the constitutional council, issued before the passing of the election law that provides for obligatory secret rooms.
Diplomatic sources said that the High Commissioner of the Foreign Policy and Joint Security at the European Union, Xavier Solana, promised the officials to inform them by telephone at the conclusion of his tour of the true Israeli position with regard to convening an international conference or meeting initially at the end of the coming July.
The Lebanese position was clear and uniformly said it is with the need for using the Arab peace initiative without any amendments, censorship or fragmentation, because it is a complete whole, and President of the Republic Emil Lahhoud warned of the dangers of delaying any conference, because it will not be in the interest of peace in the region.
They pointed out that some officials say Solana did not carry any ideas, but the European official may have told one official, and no other, that he has some ideas to progress the files and give a political push to the frozen peace process, like setting an initial date for the conference next July.
He could arrive there next Thursday most likely, keeping in mind the final date is still being discussed.
A source from the European delegation accompanying Solana reported that the latter heard Lebanese support from some officials for refraining from distraction and delaying the setting of the date for convening the conference.
The American and Russian Presidents also want the world to be certain that the Cold War has been put behind and warmer and closer relations have been established between Washington and Moscow.
At the forefront of that, the daily Palestinian-Israeli war.
And when he does not find a subject to make a statement about, he only sees Arafat and the Palestinian Authority as daily material in front of him to blame, despite the fact that his deputy Dick Cheney recently granted Arafat some extenuating reasons when he said: We cannot blame the Palestinian President alone as there are countries in the region that are supplying the Palestinian factions with money and arms.
While the Palestinian ambition focused on declaring statehood, the subject regressed to the point of speaking about custodianship or a return to mandating Palestinian work under the slogan that Arafat's Authority failed to provide self-rule for Palestinians.
And speaking of reforms, there are several "offers" for reforming Palestinian security systems and reducing them to only four.
The Palestinian struggle must renew itself so it is not outside the age and outside the facts of the new regional and international reality, and the interactions that have been occurring strongly since September 11th 2001.
Is this the "new role" of the Authority in the new reality?
The Military Appeals Court released prisoner Salameh Suleiman, accused of dealing with Israel, in return of one million liras in bail due to his deteriorating health condition. He had belonged to "Lebanon's Southern Army" in 1976 where he was a lieutenant.
And penalizing Jawad Milhem, Ahmad Idris, Ziyad Al Zeibaq, Jan Al Zeibaq and Tony Absi 70 thousand liras, and imprisoning Tony Absi five days for violently handling elements from the army.

Moreover, it is planned to place mosaic around the passages inside the building, and it will be an imitation of the original portrait discovered on the grounds of the Cathedral.
The Palestinian Popular Unions organized a sit-in outside ESCWA in support of Israeli Knesset members Ahmad Al Tibia and Zamia Bishara, and the detained member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, Marwan Barghouti.
Al Tibi gave a speech over the phone where he was convening a meeting in the city of Nazareth, and greeted the Lebanese and Palestinian peoples, thanking their positions, and stressing that "the Palestinian people draw their strength from our people in Lebanon and Palestine".
Rashayya - "An Nahar"
Under the patronage of the Minister of Environment, Michel Mousa, the first Cedar forest was inaugurated at Tomat Jizzeen at a height of approximately 1800 meters, in a celebration held at the Municipal Palace yesterday afternoon. It was attended by Deputies Samir Azar, Antoine Khoury, George Nijim, District Commissioner of Jizzeen Nabih Hammoud representing the South Governor, a group of Municipality heads, the region's tribal chiefs, and groups and representatives of companies that participated in completing the project.
Then, the "Coca Cola" Company's Director of Public Affairs, Antoine Al Tayyar, spoke about the establishment of the first cedar forest in southern Lebanon, considering it "an expression of our interest in supporting the environment in general, participating in the efforts of the Ministry of Environment to return trees to several areas in Lebanon, and to participate in developing southern Lebanon that belongs to our homeland, especially since cedar has been missing from the south for a long time. We hope our programs and projects will be an incentive for other companies."
Caring for the environment is everyone's responsibility: the state's first, then society's, local authorities', schools' and homes'.
On invitation from the "Vision Organization for Rehabilitation, Development and Care" in Rashayya, a forum was organized yesterday on the dismantling of mines and caring for those injured by them. It was attended by Minister of National Defense Cahill Al Hrawi, President of the South Council Qablan Qablan, President of the National Office for Mine Dismantling Brigadier George Mis'ed, UNICEF Organization representative Ali Al Zein, International Health Organization representative Caroline Al Rayyes, United Nations Office representative Mohammad Muqallad and former Ambassador Cahill Makkawi.
As for in Rashayya or the Western Biqa'a, the army is charged with the mission in cooperation with the Syrian Arab army.
Most of these mines are close to the Blue Line and south of the Litani, where there are 435 thousand mines.
As for Qablan, he pointed out that: "The issue of mines is thorny and sensitive, and it is  a source of continuous depletion in the long run.
In short, and more clearly: the initial treatment of every mine victim is initially assumed by the South Council, in cooperation with the Ministry of Health in hospitals?
We have cooperated with the Vision Organization on dozens of cases in this field (...)
A tradition was revived yesterday at the Bar Association in Beirut to honor the Bar Association President, launched by lawyer Jaclyn Masabki, the first woman who won membership in the Association's Council in the year 1965.
She praised Masabki, "the first lawyer who won the trust of her lawyer colleagues to become the first woman in the Association's Council".
Zain reminded eveyone of Masabki's initiative to honor the working Association President three decades ago when the number of female lawyers then did not exceed sixty or seventy, "and in the seventies the number of colleagues increased, Jaclyn's house became too small, and the events erupted".
Association Council member Mohammad Shihab considered in his speech that the honored "bearer of the message" deserved honoring by the lawyers and the Bar Association.
I received my fees of 25 liras".
She is no longer Abul Ala'a's woman, whom he wanted for spinning and weaving only because women are for leadership, writing and reading.
He called on the female lawyers to agree on "nominating a female lawyer so that your representation at the Council continues".
And then toasts were exchanged.
In one of the weekly meetings held by the two publishers Hisham and Mohammad Ali Hafiz, I raised the issue of the mistakes made by Egyptian writers. Their answer was: "The Egyptians have their own style in writing, so do not try to impose the Lebanese style, and do not forget that we, in Saudi Arabia and in other Gulf countries, have learned at the hands of the Egyptians".
You'd better ask 'Al-Azhar' for it may have the true tiding."
Residents of the Mar Taqla Al Hazimyyah region, specifically those from the street that extends from the former Libyan Embassy crossroads to the French Consulate, passing through Ad-Diyar Building, Region 6, Street 73, complained of the bad condition of the roads and the potholes that are spread throughout the streets. They said they felt as if they were in the unknown regions of Africa.
A subscriber into one of the two cellular telephone companies in Lebanon received bills with very high amounts that made him suspicious because their value exceeded the services and the calls he made.
And to verify that he has to come in person
- From colleague Ghazi Miqati:
It is, in the first place, directed towards the United States to convince it of the many dangers threatening Israel and the American influence in the region in case Iran continues to develop its long-range missile program, consequently, convincing it to adopt the hostile Israeli point of view towards Iran, which Ariel Sharon tried hard to convince the American administration of during his next to the last visit to Washington to discuss the international war against terrorism.
Everyone is convinced that the Iranians alone, without the help of the Russians, cannot achieve their dream of obtaining weapons that led, in the weakest scenario, to developing the systems of their traditional weapons.
Shmuel Gordon, commentator in the newspaper "Yediot Achronot" sees that the danger of the Iranian "Shihab 3" missile is not bigger than the danger of a military aircraft capable of carrying a larger number of missile heads and can hit targets with a greater accuracy.
The Russians are wise enough to realize that. The Iranian threat will not be limited to Russia; it will also include the American troops in the Middle East.
But despite all that, the entry of nuclear weapons into the region cannot but change the current prevailing balance of power, and reflect negatively on Israel.
The issue of the mediator (Ombudsman) is fundamental today in Lebanon for the following three reasons:
And it has been a postponed problem since the fifties.
There seems to be chaos in the legal method of privatizing the cellular phone. In this quick report I try to shed light on some of its aspects. Perhaps it may be of use for the general good, or else good for the law.
1- General services are the projects with public benefit that are controlled by general authorities to meet the needs of citizens.
The latest Israeli noise in the matter of banning Iran's development of its nuclear abilities might be exaggerated, but it has a point and specific goals.
Even though it has been two months since Iran started to conduct its successful experiment on the "Shihab-3"missile, it was noticed that the Israeli "fears" from this step only appeared after the visit of American President George Bush to Russia, and the latter's rejection of its guest's  request to stop nuclear cooperation with Iran in building the Bousshahr Reactor.
Salameh's speech came during an open dialogue organized by the Business Administration College at the: Lebanese - American University", as part of the 4th Annual International Conference on "The Economy of the Middle East and North Africa", held at the University campus for the past two days and under the patronage of the Governor of the Central Bank.
While the following are competing for the other four positions (Sunni, Shiite, Christian and Druze):
While Al Yafi seems most likely to reach the Union Leader position, especially that he enjoys the support of a large movement representing the electoral base at the Union, in addition to the public support from the accountants working in the banking sector (they are considered, according to the union system, non-practicing) and the Accountant's Organization at the Arab League. Candidate Elie Rizqallah enjoys the support of Union Leader George Abu Mansour, who blames Al Yafi for his going alone in the formation of his list, contrary to what was agreed between them.
The latest merger, which is the 23rd in the history of the modern banking mergers (since the year 1992), enjoys the blessing of the Bank of Lebanon and its direct encouragement, as it comes as part of the incentive policy adopted by the Central Bank in  the last decade. It targeted purifying the banking sector from difficulty gaps that expanded at the end of the eighties, and almost led to the collapse of the entire sector under the weight of the consecutive financial and currency crises.
Coordination was conducted to set a joint agenda and plan between the two organizations to push them in the direction of their goals, aimed at developing Lebanese-Russian relations in the various political, economic and social fields".
Minister of Finance Fouad Siniora discussed yesterday with a delegation from the Private Hospitals Union Council, headed by Dr. Fawzi Edemi, mechanisms of paying the dues to hospitals accumulated by government guarantor institutions.
The Training and Rehabilitation Directorate at the Banking Organization organized a training course on "Telephone Conversation Skills with Clients", last Thursday and Friday at the Organization's training center - Beirut.
A delegation from the Kuwaiti Development Fund will arrive in Beirut today, headed by its Director General Bader Al Humeidi, to participate in the inauguration ceremony of the Kuwait grant, totaling 20 million dollars to reconstruct the liberated southern regions. It included implementing infrastructure work in the completely destroyed villages, and reconstructing approximately 850 houses in Haneen, Sajad, Ein Arab, Rashaf, Yarin-Al Zalloutiyyeh, Marwahin, Um Al Tout and Wadi Al Khansa villages.
Governor of the Bank of Lebanon, Riyad Salameh, renewed his affirmation that the stability of currency is a basic choice for the Central Bank to achieve social growth and stability, stressing that Lebanon has the capabilities and human resources that qualify it to come out of its current crisis. He set the condition of the presence of the political decision to achieve that.
He reiterated that "the positive environment that prevailed last week in the currency market confirms that trust still exists. The evidence is the public's demand for buying dollar bonds", pointing out that "this indicates the odds of coming out of the deficit and debt are possible if there is a political decision. The trend today seems to be towards making some moves that could constitute a start of the necessary reform. The processes of imminent privatization and bonding will provide money prepared for reducing the debt, and allow the state through the private account to have income in foreign currency.
A conversation ensued between Salameh and the participants in which he presented the mechanism of liquefying the Eurobond issue. He also presented his vision regarding depreciating the debt service as he presented it to official authorities, represented by working on the percentage of debt reduction to the product, pointing out that this is accomplished through privatization returns and bonding that constitute a positive shock that leads to the reduction of interests by 3%.
* Salameh announced that the Bank of Lebanon sold international Lebanese bonds whose value exceeds approximately 950 million dollars, from the billion dollars bonds that were the subject of a trade between the Bank and the Ministry of Finance last march, explaining that the sale procedures target improving liquidity at the Central Bank in foreign currency "whose holdings in the dollar did not change as a result of that".
Industrial Delegation to Iraq to Activate Trade Agreement; Abboud: Discrimination is between Foreign Goods and their Locally Manufactured Counterparts
It also discussed the establishment of a Deans Council, and its establishment was approved to consist of former presidents of the Association, their deputies and former secretary generals. The former president of the Association, Jack Sarraf, was charged with convening the first meeting to set up the structure of the Council's work and present it to the Board of Directors to approve the acceptance of industrial leaders.
We must realize that the institutions manufacturing these goods are Lebanese, and that their owners and workers are Lebanese, and consequently the source of income of thousands of Lebanese families comes from these institutions, especially when we know that 99% of the profits of those companies return to our people.
Spanish artist Clara Amado exhibits several small size paintings at the Spanish Cultural Center (central Beirut) entitled "Light and Color in the Middle East".
The presence of Christians in this East is the presence of a message and a testimony. Christians have lived in it since ancient times and it is part of their deep identity just like they are a part of its identity and entity. Therefore Christians do not have the right to stay in the East while all their interest is focused on the possibility of continuing to stay, which could lead to isolation, fear and the fatal minority complex.
Another book of Al Balmand University publications was recently published entitled "The Archives of the Antioch and the Rest of the Orient Patriarchate for Roman Orthodox" (Part Two). Its preparation was done by the Antioch Documentation and Studies Department at the Al Balmand University. The classification of the archives was accomplished by Dr. Joseph Zeitoun, Secretary General of the Patriarchal Archives.
The heart was, in the ancient Greek culture, the subject of the spirit or the self.
Little by little the naivety of this muscle became known after it became clear that its role does not exceed the role of a pump or dynamo, and that if it moved faster as a result of the excitement of love or religious existence, it moves in the same degree if it is subjected to feeling cold, subjected to a bee sting or the surprising sound of a car horn.
But the heart has a strong negotiation position, it blackmails the rest of the body by stopping if it stops giving blood. These weapons of blackmail are represented by a cannon named attack, a bomb named stroke, or a knife called angina.
The brains of sheep are good to eat, so are their livers. They are grilled, fried or boiled...
So are the names of foods like maqloubeh, and the names of assorted nuts like almonds. It is also said the "overturning of truths", i.e. changing them. The source of this use is the pretense of the heart itself to prevent others from remembering its only profession, carrying.
Similarly the liver is accused of negativity, defeatism and weakness, so what did it gain for its toil, other than cirrhosis and death, far from its place and position?!
At the beginning, the educational faculty and graduates procession entered, followed by the National Anthem and then the speech of the master of ceremonies Assistant Dean Dr. Sami Sanjad. It was followed by the speech of Vice President, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and the Medical Center, Dr. Nadim Kurtas, in which he said: "We are amazed by the accelerated discoveries. We believe man is at the verge of owning the secret of life and controlling its course.
Faced with this great challenge and our internal feelings of moral, spiritual and aesthetic responsibility, we must employ our scientific energies to control matters and head towards what is good for man, his happiness and redemption."
Today, parents feel the joy of a lifetime and your mothers, graduates, remember life moment by moment, and the mother forgets the trouble of life to wait for the results of the future and the father stands contemplating that child who has become a man entering the gates of the future armed with science and faith.
Here is your role, as distinguished doctors, to return to Lebanon its position as hospital of the East, and to raise the level of this profession that now knows many troubles.
Syrian Researcher Mohammad Qujjeh Lectured at Heritage of Center - Experience of 78 Years in Preserving Aleppo's Archeology
Qujjeh started his lecture with speaking about voluntary work for general service that has no trade or economic motives, wondering: "Is general work a phenomena that we learned from the West or does it have roots in our history?" He concluded that we "witnessed in our history and heritage examples that indicate forms of general work, among them the waqf system", explaining that Aleppo is called City of Waqf due to the numerous
Antiquities is a word that means "heritage items entrenched in ancient times."
He spoke about the UNESCO Organization selecting Aleppo as one of the most important historical archeological cities in the Islamic World, and listing it on the list of the international humanitarian heritage.
One of the oldest charity organizations in the world is sovereign Malta Organization that has been serving people for over nine decades with the giving and serving of the poor and sick from all races and religions.
As for the issue of the international public right, Malta Organization has the right of authorization and the ability to enter agreements and treaties, and also has the right to issue passports.
The Malta Organization has been in Lebanon for about 50 years.
The Organization's Ministers Council will meet with all heads of Malta Organizations in the world early next June in Beirut, to evaluate the situation of the Organization and discuss its future and projects.
It was established in the twelfth century in Jerusalem to serve the poor and the sick. It developed to ensure its continuation, but the principle of treating the sick remained basic.
Sahnawi added: "I think it a great event for Lebanon. For the first time senior Malta officials will meet in our country and that is like recognition of Lebanon's uniqueness and distinction as a model of coexistence. We will work on introducing them to the spirituality of this country, its beauty, and the beauty of its people."
General Director of the WIPO Organization, which supervises, organizes and coordinates international treaties, and urges countries to join them, participated in this conference.
First: The respect the Iranians have for the Lebanese people in the field of intellect and culture. It is enough to mention they addressed me on the basis that I come from the capital of authoring and publication Beirut, and their appreciation of the content of the Lebanese law issued in 1999, related to the protection of intellectual rights. They were glad to receive a copy of it that I was carrying.
Green expanses and trees surround all of it.
Each visitor of Iran must discover the role the Iranian woman plays in Iranian life and society: she greets you as a host when you board the plan, handles the paperwork of your passport at the airport, receives you again at the reception in the hotel, in addition to work teams that handle the organization of the conference. It must be noted that thirty percent of those who drive cars are women.
The ceremony in the conference hall was attended by the Archbishop Roland Abu Judah Hospital, representing the Maronite Patriarch, Director of Care at the Ministry of Health, Dr. Riad Abu Khalifeh, representing the Minister of Health, Director General of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Ni'mat Kan'an, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the Saint George University, Professor Jean Farah, General Director of Mother Rita Rohana Hospital, and a group of specialists from several countries including France, Canada, Belgium and Lebanon.
The hospital did not hesitate to improve its services. The organization of this conference is part of keeping up with the development. On its sidelines we are conducting training workshops with specialists from abroad to provide communication between people of experience and those interested."
He added: "Our organization is trying to build friendship and love bridges with our colleagues in Lebanon. At the beginning of this month, we participated with the Lebanese Surgical Organization in its conference in Beirut, and we were with the Surgical Organization and the Northern Lebanese Doctors Union in Tripoli."
I do not hide from you that Lebanon was always the distinctive point in the dialogue of cultures, especially on the medical and humanitarian levels, for what it offers in development in its programs. We are here to discuss with the doctors the medical advancements and developments with regard to psychology and psychological medicine.
Two days ago, Lebanon celebrated the second anniversary of the liberation of the south from Israeli occupation; all of that was the result of the will of its people and their attachment to their land."

I was a witness to the same moment with Nizar Qabbani when he called me one day saying: "I am in Beirut, imprisoned at the Summerland, and I will not leave my room until I finish correcting the proofs of my whole collection so it will be published soon under my supervision."
Those who know George Skaf's precision and euphuism in the word (written, read and spoken), realizes his happiness today (how happy he is with it and how happy we are for him with it) with the publication of eight elegant volumes that contain his political, literary and aesthetic writings throughout half a century of his professional life, which is rich with experience: writer, journalist, administrative official, minister, unionist, and intellectual, knowledgeable in the affairs of Lebanon.
Since I started work on collecting our Lebanese product (by "Lebanese Heritage Center" at the Lebanese-American University) and obtaining documents, transcripts, writings, letters, books and papers by our literary figures, poets, and artists that were forgotten and discarded, left in the care of their children, grandchildren, parents or friends, my fear of the loss of our heritage has increased. So has my concern for the necessity of collecting, preserving and documenting it (at the "Lebanese Heritage Center") so that our memory is not lost in the mazes of history that do not have mercy on those too lazy to gather their heritage before it falls in the corners of forgetfulness, neglected by its fast march, the time that "eats the calcification of the walls" ("Zenobia" by the Rahabani Brothers).

The returnee to Beirut from Europe is shocked, on the road to the airport, that "Hizbullah" (from what he knows? From what he wants? And with which logic? ..) has transformed itself, even for a moment, from its unique role as a national resistance that defeated the Israeli army to a guard for what was called, in the stage of preparing for the Lebanese ominous wars, "desperation belt" (then "fire belt") which encircled the capitol.
Yesterday, Brazil did what no one else ever did: Won the World Football Cup for the fifth time at the expense of Germany with two goals. They were scored by its offence, Ronaldo, crowed Championship Footballer, who equaled the number of famous star Pele by collecting 12 goals in all World Cup Championships.
The weekend witnessed a slackening of the heated rivalry that escalated three days ago between Hariri and "Hizbullah" over the Awzai Bridge Project. More than one party close to both sides expressed a desire to turn the page on this rivalry and grant the opportunity to the reconciliatory efforts that seek to reach an agreement on a resolution to the Bridge Project that pleases both sides, after Hariri said that this project is part of a comprehensive development project for the southern suburb region.

He will be received today by President Jacque Chirac at the Elysee Palace at a work lunch attended by Prime Minister Jean Pierre Raffarin and Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin.
In as much as it seemed, in form at least, this gap could decrease in the coming hours between Hariri and "Hizbullah" by extending the length of the treaty. A new outside front has opened on the party through what the "Washington Post" newspaper said yesterday, Sunday, that "Hizbullah" and the "Al Qaeda" network, who are considered by Washington as "terrorist organizations", are expanding their cooperation in the logistics and training field, and that they are planning the implementation of future attacks.
It added, "This new partnership represents the development of cooperation forms among terrorist organizations that share the same target, which is to force the United States to withdraw from the Middle East, and Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories. Additionally, American officials believe that after Al Qaeda left Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden allowed his soldiers to create alliances with other Islamic groups."
In Cairo President of the Intelligence Committee at the US Senate, Bob Graham, stated after talks with Egyptian President Husni Mubarak that he expects Syria will continue to support "Hizbullah" even "if it was supporting the war the United States is waging on terrorism."

He is on the Council of Development of Al Chouf District and the development of all of Lebanon, and developing love, harmony, and return, especially in regions that suffered terribly.
What we accepted in Al Ta'ef was an entrance into harmony, and it is enough to see the distance we have come since the blood bath that prevailed in Lebanon in the seventies and eighties (...)
International Quartet Meeting Tomorrow American Recognition of its Role ... To Push Bush's Ideas
They explained that the London meeting is the second of its kind for them, after the Washington meeting, at the conclusion of the inspection tours they conducted approximately two weeks before the speech of Bush, because the gathering of these is easier due to the busy schedules of the ministers.
They mentioned that the selection of London as a setting for the Committee meeting is due to the fact that it agrees with Burns, who is heading to a number of countries in the region, including Egypt, Jordan and Israel. It has not been confirmed whether he will visit leader Yasser Arafat, who welcomed the speech despite demanding he relinquish the Presidency of the Palestinian Authority, on charges that he is falling short in stopping the Palestinian suicide operations.

Ceremony host Al Biqaa Governor, Judge Antoine Suleiman, said in his speech: "In the honoring of Internal Security Forces, there is gratitude to this homeland that has given us so much but we were stingy with very little. This initiative has a larger meaning for an institution born with the setting of the first stone of Lebanon. On this occasion, you are honoring those who gave, offered and fought evil, believing in a state of law and institutions, whose pillars President Emil Lahoud is trying to entrench, as the first soldier in the frontline."
Danger Indications

That was accompanied by a clear Israeli campaign against the Party in an attempt to draw it to the circle of the American and international war currently being waged against terrorism.
In fact Israel's attempts to involve "Hizbollah" in close cooperation with "Al Qaeda" are one of several elements the Israeli military command started to weave in preparation for an operation against the armed military presence of the Party on its borders, and ending the serious risks this deployment constitutes on the Israeli settlements adjacent to the borders.
And, although America did not list Syria as one of the countries in "the axis of evil", the Israelis are trying, in various ways, to show the extent of the close cooperation arising between Iran and Syria in their support of the fundamental movements categorized among terrorist organizations.
He described this agreement as "giving Lebanon the possibility of becoming a regional trade and economic power".
The focus was on the main roads that link the city with the castle and the park.
The discussion turned to the business trip conducted by Prime Minister Rafic Hariri to France, over a week after Lebanon's name was crossed from the "black list" of non-cooperative countries with the international "Gafi" group for fighting money laundering, and more than two weeks after it joined the Euro-Mediterranean partnership agreement. Moreover, on the goals of this visit that be will focused on, and the convention of a meeting for Arabs and Europeans who want to give Lebanon a loan of 5 billion dollars as part of what is referred to as "Paris 2", to add some optimism to the market, as much as this matter constitutes, in case it takes place simultaneously with the launch of privatization operations at the end of this summer, a large step in the direction of lowering the cost of the general debt, which significantly reduces the burdens of the budget that are pressuring financial stability in the country with its weight.

This requires establishing a social protection system, where no party dominates, especially the men of the Ali Baba Cave."
Some members of the academic and administrative boards followed in succession to read the names of the graduates.

The Afghan security departments are continuing their investigations with the driver of the booby-trapped car that was caught in Kabul on Monday, at a distance of 300 meters from the American Embassy.
He added that the detained also revealed to investigators the names of those who "move him" and the names of other individuals.
Those detained in Guantanamo, whose number exceeds 500, were captured in the war led by the United States on the "Al Qaeda" and the "Taliban" movement that provided him with shelter.
Reports are conflicting regarding the fate of Bin Laden, after he recently stopped appearing on video tapes aired on television during the American bombing.
Cairo Declares Opposition to Division of Sudan and Mohammad Taha Traveled Without Meeting Mubarak; Waging Attack Denied
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmad Maher stated Tuesday that his government cannot comment on this agreement due to the lack of "complete" information, stressing the importance of the unity of the territories of Sudan.
Cairo is expressing its concern that the establishment of a new state in southern Sudan will lead to increasing the competition on the oil resources and doubling the dominance of Islamists in the north, which could constitute a threat to the government in Egypt.
The skirmishes revolve mainly between fighting tribes and militias.
President of the Organization Dean Hirsch said in a statement that this non-government Organization "will continue consultations with officials in the United Nations, the German Foreign Ministry and other concerned parties for their quick return without risks".
It confirmed that the two Germans were led to Yiwai, which is a few hours away on foot from Wat, where the "World Vision" camp that was attacked Monday by armed men is located.
In a celebration that combined Indian and European traditions, Pope John Paul the Second canonized yesterday the first Indian saint at the Catholic Church, describing Juan Carlos as a catalyst for the guidance of Americans into Christianity.
Speech therapist Irene Gozman (25 years old) of San Gabrielle City in the American state of California said: "I felt a chill up to my head."
The Pope repeated three times through the amplifier: "Mexico that is always loyal".
Friars read the Bible in the Spanish language and the Aztec Náhuatl language.
For the second day in a row, John Paul the Second called for better treatment of Indians in the Americas.
He will return today to the same Basilica, this time to canonize two other Mexican Indians, Juan Batista and Jacinto Do Los Angels.
Spontaneous Meeting between the American and North Korean Foreign Ministers; ASEAN - Pacific Ocean Forum Advocates Plan to Fight Financing Terrorist Networks; Pakistan Powell and Pike - Nam-Sun
"ASEAN" ministers drafted the document during a meeting in Brunei early this week, then it was approved by the foreign ministers at the largest security gathering in the region.
He added: "We have adopted a declaration that confirms our determination to work individually and together to prevent terrorists and their partners from accessing financial systems or using them."
The representatives of the participating countries took knowledge of the commitment of Pakistan, which does not belong to the Regional Forum and is not represented at the meeting, to fight terrorism and urged it to "take other measures to fulfill it".
On the sidelines of the Forum, Powell met with his North Korean counterpart Paek Nam-Sun.
There was no information available about a new private meeting between the two men in Brunei.
The Japanese News Agency "Kyodo" reported that the two sides agreed to arrange a high level meeting between the two countries, to be held in August, to discuss the issue of establishing normal times and a number of other issues of mutual interest."
In an emergency session of the House, 449 Deputies supported early elections, compared with 62 deputies, out of the 514 who attended the session.
Deputy Prime Minister, leader of the Mother Homeland Party Masoud Yelmaz, said that the political fluctuation regarding main reforms could hinder the country's old dreams of joining the European Union.
The European Union wants Turkey to improve the rights of the Kurdish minority after separatist violence has almost concluded.
Yelmaz, who is supervising the file of relations with Brussels, supports conducting early elections, but he expressed fears that the political maneuvers before the elections campaign will marginalize reform efforts.
The fragile government that joins the left and the right started to sway in May when Ecivit (77 years old) became ill, which subjected the coalition to tensions regarding the method of approaching the European Union.
The court sentenced 16 of the defendants to 15 years, seven to 12 years, two to ten years, 4 to seven years and two to five years.
The charges against them include embezzling public funds and obtaining - through fraud - loans from banks for approximately 892 million pounds, or about 200 million dollars.
It is noteworthy that Egypt is currently witnessing a "clean hands" campaign to fight corruption, and a number of public figures are being prosecuted.
In May former governor of Giza Maher Al Gundi was sentenced to seven years in prison for receiving bribes, and former Finance Minister Muhiddin Al Ghareeb eight years for embezzling public funds.

Palestinian Minister of Finance, Salam Fayyad, explained in a statement distributed by the Palestinian Media Center that the Authority "received today (yesterday) the first installment of its due funds, held by Israel for two years."
The Palestinian Authority did not pay any attention to the Israeli request. It answered to the calls for financial transparency that coincided with American pressures on the leadership of Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and attempts to exclude him, which have failed so far and have been replaced with a wide variety of pressures to strip him of his powers or a fundamental part of them, especially powers in the security and financial fields, with more judicial, security and financial reform.
President Arafat indicated the possibility of receiving a blow on the way to Iraq, or on the way back from Iraq.
The company did not specify in a statement it issued the practices that the Department of Justice investigation will deal with, while the Securities and Exchange Commission is focusing on trade transactions that caused larger revenues to the "America On Line" branch of that the company.
It was also not commented on by officials at the Justice Department, nor did they explain whether the investigation had actually started. The newspaper "USA Today" was the first to refer to it.
But the questions about the financial status of the company are raised at a time major companies are facing accusations of manipulating their accounts which raise the concerns of investors and markets.
Of the practices it attacked was selling advertisements to a British entertainment company in return for a financial settlement in a court dispute.
Investors were also concerned with the continued changes in the administrative system of the company.
Those who heard the "explanations" of witnesses away from the limelight, monitored the initial reactions from some citizens, of a certain orientation, and followed the coverage in the visual media, must have noticed a rise in the "levels" of sectarian sensitivity towards this crime. This "sensitivity" coincides, unfortunately, with a noticeable spread of nationalist posters that rose in the streets of cities and villages on Army Day, sealed with the signatures of its owners (trade organizations, clubs and the live youth organizations). They were blind to the reality of this evil-seeking sectarian and religious state, to an extent where this case almost dominated the work of the judicial system (the crime), which seemed as if it was begging people for a "responsible" unified national stand.
May we remember what was said two months ago, following the kidnapping and then murder of Ramzi Ayrani, and the results of that incident on the ballot boxes in the Matn elections and afterwards?
It is the truth that the sectarian and religious machination, which is receiving special "care" inside and outside the state, wants to keep the Lebanese hostage too.
In return, for the families and of the perpetrator and his environment to stop at the atrocity of this action instead of searching for mitigating reasons in the easy corners of politics and blame.
Yesterday, a few hours before the "Edge" agreement on the crisis of privatizing of the cellular telephone, matters had exceeded excitement and stimulation.
It is enough to read newspaper headlines and listen to news bulletin introductions, for they have not spoken about any case for about two months except that "fateful conflict". For two weeks, they have not hesitated to speak about the "zero hour" on the "fiery Thursday" (meaning today).
Therefore the crash was inevitable and the explosion unavoidable, and the people of the "doomed station", meaning the Lebanese, are in a state of panic. Some of them are escaping to the far mountains and some are leaving the country. As for the "Syrian Technical Administration", that usually supervises the arrangement of the "lines", organizing "directions" and controlling "speeds", this time it has been absent and left the matter to a team of "adventurous Lebanese" led by the hero of the movie, House Speaker Nabih Berry, assisted by three:
The matter seemed an "impossible mission" and many Lebanese wore "bullet proof vests", on the backdrop that even if five o'clock of Thursday afternoon passed with an agreement between Lahoud and Hariri preventing the explosion of the Minister's Council or the postponement of the meeting to avoid an explosion, it seems there is no escaping the collision, and the inevitable date is the 31st of August, the date the Lebanese state regains the cellular sector from the two companies.

It is true that the assassination incident encouraged the Palestinian "terrorist" organizations to undertake the attacks, but there is not necessarily a direct link between the two matters.
The newspaper concluded: "At this stage the military retaliation to the attack will not be beneficial, because the West Bank is under the control of the Israeli army. As for Gaza, there is no intention to occupy it.
The newspaper added that president of the Israeli negotiations committee, Elan Beirn, conducted a series of meetings in Israel and outside to resolve the issue.
The following is some of what appeared in it: "The American plans to topple Saddam Hussein are still being studied, despite that, perhaps we should propose to the administration a better and easier target for the war on terrorism."
These ambitions that are far from the borders of Iran must be eliminated."
There could be the chance that such a battle would lead to the awakening of the Lebanese, including the Shiites in "Amal", and pushing them to cooperate to confront "Hizbollah" that will cause the destruction of the state."
The details that continued coming from witnesses, officials and the parents of the murderer and his relatives, could not provide justification for the crime that has been categorized as one of the bloodiest mass killing crimes in Lebanon.
The security story of the crime mentioned "at 9:30, Ahmad Mansour arrived at the Fund's building where he had worked for 24 years, carrying a bag in which he had put two military machine guns and a revolver.
It was said that the perpetrator suffers from mental disturbances and is taking sedatives, while investigation sources said that the reasons are that he was in deep debt. He had obtained a loan from the Fund for 19 million liras, and his car was impounded.
Fed up with the postponement, he threatened to do something, if the Fund's officials did not approve his loan application.
He said: "They killed me financially so I was determined to kill them".
President of the Republic Emil Lahoud followed the details of the ongoing investigations in the crime, and reviewed all the reports presented to him by the security departments regarding its details.
The Executive Board of the Teacher's Union, the Official Secondary Teacher's Assembly, the Central Council of the Teachers in Official Primary and Intermediary Schools Assembly and the heads of the Union Project Councils in the governorates condemned this crime and called for stopping work today in all educational institutions, including the grading of the official exams.
He said that the conviction "is issued by an unspecialized exceptional court and it is nullified by the permanent constitution. It does not have the guarantees of a fair trial such as the right to defend and contest".
Al Bunni did not show any reaction when the verdict was read to him. He just said: "Such a court issues such rulings."
Dalilah was sentenced in a first phase to 16 years in prison, then he decreased the punishment to ten years.
In June, communist leader Riyadh Al Turk was sentenced to two and a half years in prison, and opposition businessmen Habeeb Saleh to three years in prison.
He said: "He is an economic intellectual who pointed to the flawed areas. He is only a mouthpiece for reform through peaceful and constitutional methods, and setting successful solutions for it."
In initial reactions, President of the Committee for Defending Human Rights in Syria, Aktham Na'isah, said that the verdicts raised concerns on the future of human rights in the country.
Yesterday afternoon, the following statement was issued on the issue of privatization of the cellular phone by Speaker Hussein Al Husseini and (former) Prime Minister Omar Karami, and Deputies Na'ela Mu'awwad, Mohammad Al Safady, Butros Harb, Mohammad Kabbarah, Maurice Fadel, Faris Bweiz, Farid Al Khazen, Nicola Fattoush, Abbas Hashem, George Qasarji and Nazem Al Khoury:
Due to the importance of the cellular sector and the resulting political, economic, social and even security repercussions, we believe that it is our national and parliamentary duty to present the Lebanese public opinion with the following facts:
In reality, the annulment decision caused the two companies to avoid legal prosecution because it was not based on the report of the Audit Bureau issued in 1999 that found 24 financial and administrative violations.
All this presents many questions on the true intentions of the Prime Minister and the reasons that make him insist, at any cost, to reject the reverting of the cellular sector to the state, and consequently shrouding its true returns and the actual profits of the companies, while noting that without knowing the true figures the state cannot estimate the value of the sector to present on that basis the re-privatization for a duration of 20 years.
The second to the "Qurnet Shahwan Meeting", stressing that the Party agrees with it in the goals and disagrees with it in the methods and performance "with regard to internal charging, quarreling with the rule and hostility to Syria".
There are no brigades outside the Brigades, and no brigades outside the legitimate institutions, whatever the variety of attributes they give themselves. They are outside the Party, and they no longer have any relation with it.
Third: Charging the General Secretariat with issuing generalizations and taking measures to remind every brigade of the fact that he is not allowed to belong to any other movement with the punishment of striking his name off the record of the brigades."
And if we decide we implement.
Your goals you took from the Kataeb party's goals of sovereignty, independence, freedom, defense of democracy, Lebanese distinctiveness, and resistance to settling (of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon).
To the government we say: We agree with you in the choices and we disagree with the government in performance.
The reform of the state in the interest of all Lebanese, and correcting the flaw affecting the Christians."
An American official visiting Beirut recently warned a number of officials he met with against the danger of the Israeli allegation in Washington that the Jewish state is vigilant in fighting terrorism in the Middle East.
Lebanese sources who met with the American official said that a dialogue conducted with him, in an atmosphere of reason, focused on calling on Washington to be aware of the danger of what Israel, and specifically Sharon wants, because Lebanon, like the rest of the Arab countries, was committed to the international legitimacy decisions on fighting terrorism.
They indicated that the American official urged their Lebanese counterparts not to slow down in organizing a diplomatic and information campaign in which professional ministers, deputies and diplomats participate, with the support of the Lebanese Embassy in Washington, in an attempt to bury the goals of the Israel proposal to fight terrorism especially because Lebanon, the current president of the Arab Summit, has an Arab responsibility in that regard. It must coordinate with the Arab countries to confront what  Israel is planning to remain the police state, and not the state that wants a just, permanent and comprehensive peace.
They called for expediting the handling of the new Sharon "ambition", but in a studied manner and with qualified personalities capable of delivering the message to the Americans.
The "An Nahar" newspaper reporter in Sidon said that the southern military command conducted a celebration at the Mohammad Zugheib Barracks in Saidon in which Minister of Environment Michel Mousa, Deputies Abdul Latif Al Zein, Ali Al Khalil, George Nijim, Qasem Hasheim, Sa'eed Azar, Antoine Khoury, Shafiq Al Hariri representing Deputy Bahiyyeh Al Hariri, the South and Al Nabatiyyeh Governors Faisal Al Sayegh and Mahmoud Al Mawla, security departments and forces command in the region, and a delegation of the international force command working in the south also participated.
The celebration included placing wreaths of flowers on the memorial of the unknown soldier, and a reading of "Order of the Day".
Military delegations placed wreaths of flowers on behalf of the Army Command on the former army command tombs in Ghazir - Kafarti, Raas Al Nabi' and Harat Sakher, and the tombs of the military martyrs in the region and barracks command.
The follow-up committee that emerged from the Forum convened its first meeting yesterday at the "Islamic Coalition Movement" Center at New Road headed by Prime Minister Rashid Al Sulh. Deputies Naser Qandil, Basim Yamout, Tripoli and the North Mufti Sheikh Taha Al Sabunji representing Dar Al Fatwa (house of Muslim edicts), Sheikh Hani Al Aseili representing the Higher Islamic Shiite Council, colleague Salah Salam and President of the "Islamic Assembly Movement" Sa'adeddine Hamidi Saker attended.
- The Forum warns of the danger in leniency with the dominance and aggression plans that surround the region after the continued American threats against the Palestinian people, which requires working to awaken the Arab popular and official position to frustrate this direct aggression against the Arab national security.
"It stresses its concern for following-up national dialogue with all the parties who believe in the Arab identity of Lebanon and the experience of coexistence, to confront the extremist sectarian wave, to be a framework for comprehensive national work in order to deepen the march of civil peace and political stability in the country."
He added: "We regret that some Islamic leaders still live with the inferiority complex since of a century ago, and accept to sit like school students (...)."
We are here as moderate voices in the National Islamic Forum to absorb the charging and the stiffening in the Islamic street and preventing taking advantage of it by some extremist Islamic movements on the street through absorbing it as part of a moderate forum.
Felicitations on Army Day; Traffic Arrangements on Army Day; Norwegian Ambassador Visits Qabbani; Israeli Air Force Confronted with Resistance Anti-Craft Missiles: 43 Violations
* President of  the Lebanese Olympic Committee Staff General Suheil Khoury sent two telegrams to President Lahoud and Army Command on behalf of the members of the Olympic Committee and the sports unions.
The Republic's Mufti Sheikh Mohammad Rashid Qabbani received the Ambassador of Norway accredited in Syria and Lebanon Sven Sveig on the occasion of assuming his new duties.
The resistance launched in their direction rounds of anti-aircraft weapons.
The "Islamic Resistance" counted 43 Israeli violations of Lebanese sovereignty, by air, sea and land, in the week between the 23rd to the 29th of last July.
Only months had passed after Sukarno's decision when the number of parties amounted to over one thousand parties licensed and unlicensed, and all these were formed on
If this introduction indicated anything, it is the state of sectarian parties in Lebanon.
It was the government of the militias, the one from which the homeland is still suffering from the effects of some of its elements in the government, because the mentality of parties with sectarian aspects did not leave the furnace of fanaticism, extremism and the mentality of the civil war. To me, it is as if they believed they were building barricades for a new sectarian war.
He wanted to achieve social justice and remove extreme poverty from all the regions of the homeland without being confined to a specific geographic region.
It is the tragedy of the Lebanese in their party experience.
The hope for the coming conference of the Movement is that "Amal" returns to its political essence to achieve the vision of Imam Al Sader, and return glory and prosperity to Lebanon. When the darkness fades, then the light of hope glows anew.
An expanded development meeting was held in Al-Baqiah, in the area of Wadi Khalid, at the home of Deputy Muhammad Yahya. It was attended by retired Brigadier William Majli, who represented Deputy Prime Minister Isam Faris, Minister of Public Works Najib Miqati, Deputies Wajih Al-Burini, Abd Al-Rahman Abd Al-Rahman and Karim Al-Rasi, Deputy in the Syrian People's Assembly Isam Al-Masri, municipal leaders, and drivers of cars and vans operating on gas oil from among the people of Wadi Khalid.

Minister of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants Mahmud Hamud has expressed his appreciation of Security Council Resolution 1428, which was passed in the middle of Tuesday night/Wednesday in New York and gave the international force in southern Lebanon an extension of a further six months, to run from today until the 31st of next January.
We appreciate these efforts.
This is the first time such praise has been given.
3. It reiterated its confirmation of strong support for the regional integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within internationally acknowledged borders.
It encouraged the increase in assistance offered by the international organization to the government of Lebanon, and praised the donor states.
8. It referred in more than one paragraph to the importance of consulting with the government of Lebanon in connection with the re-formation of the force, whilst always taking into account the situation on the ground.
Meanwhile, Hamud received a call from his Libyan counterpart, Ali Abd Al-Salam Al-Triki, during which they discussed the conditions prevailing in the region and the agenda for the 118th meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers of Arab States, which is to be held on the 4th of next September.
Lebanese Military Delegation Congratulates Syrian Leadership; Ukkar Municipalities and Organizations Celebrate 1 August.
In Ukkar ("Al-Nahar"), the Ukkar municipalities and educational and youth organizations held a speech festival on the occasion of 1 August, the National Day of the Syrian and Lebanese armies, in the courtyard of the National Institute in Halaba/Ukkar. It was attended by retired Brigadier William Majli, who represented Deputy Prime Minister Isam Faris; Deputies Wajih Al-Burini, Abd Al-Rahman Abd Al-Rahman, Muhammad Yahya and Jamal Ismail; former Deputies Talal Al-Muraabi, Hasan Izz Al-Din, Fawzi Habish and Khalid Dahir; Governor of the North Nasif Qalush; the administrative head of Ukkar, Tony Mukhaibar; Brigadier Ramzi Abu Hamzah, Commander of the Northern Military Area, representing Army Commander Brigadier Michel Sulaiman; Colonel (Staff) Nabil Hamishah, in charge of the Syrian Security Organization in Ukkar, representing Major General (Staff) Ghazi Kanaan; Head of the Northern Branch of Military Intelligence Col. Khidr Shuqair; Director General of the Ministry of Education George Nimah; Lt. Col. Bassam Al-Ayyubi, Commander of the Ukkar Regional Police Detachment; Lt. Col. Antoine Makari, in charge of the State Security Apparatus in Ukkar; Head of the Judicial Detachment in the North, Col. Muhammad Qadurrah; First Lieutenant Yusif Abdallah, in charge of public security in Halaba; Archbishop Bulus Bandali, head of the Orthodox diocese of Ukkar; Sheikh Abd Al-Qadir Al-Zubai and Sheikh Hasan Hamid; Taha Naji, head of the Northern Branch of the "Islamic Charitable Projects Association"; Samir Sharkas, head of the "National Nasiri Organization"; Ukkar coordinator for the "Future Current" Mustafa Hashim; Secretary of the Al-Baath branch in Ukkar, Shahadah Al-Illi; Ukkar Executive General for the Syrian National Social Progressive Party, Riyadh Nasim; and representatives from popular Palestinian groups and committees in the north, heads of municipalities and social, educational, political, religious,  and sports and youth club figures.
Commander of the Northern Military Area Brigadier Ramzi Abu Hamzah then spoke on behalf of the Army Command, in which he said, "The commemoration of 1 August returns when the region is far from the peace desired, this comprehensive and just peace formed the firm principles of supreme national policy in Lebanon and Syria, which he summarized as three:
If the road to peace has taken a diplomatic path in one of its aspects, this does not mean that the other tract, namely to be always ready and prepared to confront any aggression, should be ignored as long as the Israeli practices continue to be characterized by blood and massacres, the last of which was in Gaza."
The Roman Orthodox Metropolitan of Beirut, Archbishop Ilyas Awdah, yesterday received at the diocesan headquarters Minister of Tourism Karam Karam, who said: "I had the honor to visit His Eminence Metropolitan Ilyas Awdah, with whom I am connected by an old friendship, in addition to the fact that I belong to his church. I had the honor to visit him today and we discussed numerous matters of concern to citizens and the people in light of the conditions experienced by Lebanon and the region.
Our expectations at the Ministry of Tourism were very realistic.
But there are security incidents that take place all over the world, in all the cities and regions of the world. We would wish that these incidents did not take place, but the fact that they do does not effect the course of daily life and the progress that we are endeavoring to achieve in our society, especially in regard to the tourist industry and the tourists seasons in Lebanon given that, in Lebanon, we believe the tourist seasons run all through the year: there is no one tourist season.
Archbishop Awdah received the President of the Beirut Traders Association, Nadim Asi.
"The matter of the cell phone constitutes a worrying model of the malice of those who mass around benefits, those who are driven to establish their positions. The concern of one of their number is to eliminate the other, far removed from the spirit of honesty that guarantees the public interest.
The Forum is concerned to address the national forces, in their various affiliations and different sectors, calling on them to a principled stand of solidarity, to make a fundamental change on the basis of the National Accord Charter and the provisions of the Lebanese Constitution.
The Forum, in virtue of its on-going responsibility towards the Accord Charter and the Constitution, believes it a national duty to describe the reality frankly, no matter how distressing, because unless one acknowledges the illness, it cannot be cured and this delays the opportunities for a recovery; and because silence and camouflage are the worst forms of collusion."

Shaikh Yasin, spiritual leader of the Islamic Resistance Movement "Hamas", said during an interview we conducted with him in Gaza that the Movement would respond to the Gaza massacre, that it had not taken a decision to stop operations and that there were no understandings between it and any party in the world to end martyrdom operations within Israel.
This massacre also coincided with an increase in the pressures brought to bear on the Palestinian people to stop martyrdom operations. Sharon should have respected the feelings of the countries striving to ensure security for and protecting the Zionist entity. But he wanted only revenge, control and hegemony. He does not want peace and will not bring about peace.
This is the title of a book awaiting publication and represents the final phases of an autobiography begun in 1961 in an article published in the now defunct "Works and Days" magazine, as I give a lecture to the "Lebanese Symposium" in the "Lebanese Reflections" series, and neither the problem of sectarianism nor the problem of Lebanon as an Islamic-Christian project has left me since that time.
I now present three routes, which I believe imposes on those who would tread them an interior, spiritual process that will lead them, if they are sincere, to "overcome sectarianism" and reach "all of Lebanon".
- This was a horrific massacre and a crime against humanity. It is a clear breach of all international laws because it targeted a residential complex swarming with civilians and did not distinguish between them.
We say that there must be a response to this aggression and this crime. As regards how this response is effected, this is for the military wing of the Hamas Movement to decide.
- No, we did not give any agreement to stop the operations. We imposed a condition that the enemy first agree to the items I set out.
At present there are no understandings between us and any other party in the world to stop the operations. The Israeli aggression continues and our people have the right to defend themselves. We cannot jump from the blood of our leaders, our martyrs, our children and our women who died in this massacre to peace with the Zionist enemy.
- All contacts with the Zionist enemy must stop and action must be taken to support, develop and fortify the Palestinian resistance against the occupation, until it is brought to heel and submits to the demands of the Palestinian people, because the enemy wants to impose full surrender on our people, bring it to heel and continue the occupation of our land. But the truth is that no one can break the will and resistance of the Palestinian people, no matter how great the sacrifices.
* What is required from the Arab states to support the struggle of the Palestinian people?
- I salute all the Arab peoples, who stood beside our people in its resistance during the first and second Intifada. I firmly grasp their hands and call on them to stand more beside our people and not to submit to the regimes, because the regimes are under pressure from the American administration and may not be able to do what is necessary in respect of our people. Thus we always rely on the Arab peoples, who possess the will, strength and great reserve to support the Palestinian people.
But, in return, it is giving all the indications to suggest that there has been no actual preparation for this.
But, despite this, on the American front, matters are making no progress.
A resolution from the United Nations is a necessary condition for all forms of European support.
Outside the United Nations the consensus was clear on the basis that it was the right of the United States to pursue "Al-Qaeda" to its base. But where is the consensus on Iraq today?
The leaked American military plans are no less perplexing than the diplomatic ones.
The American Minister of Defense himself says that air strikes alone are not enough to overthrow the regime nor to end weapons of mass destruction, which means that the Yugoslavian model is set aside.
And these Iraqi oppositions, which the United States regularly calls on to fight, will they, even with the Kurds, be able to make up for direct and intensive American intervention.
And it would not require anything more than a mix between a serious plan to lift the sanctions and another, no less serious, plan to reject monitoring of weapons of mass destruction.
Yesterday afternoon Minister of Finance Fuad Al-Sinyurah played patron to a discussion and debate seminar on the topic of "Combating Money Laundering".  It was organized by the Financial Training Institute as part of the efforts of the Ministry of Finance to update the knowledge of its staff and strengthen the principles of transparency and accountability in its administration.
These efforts were successful and Lebanon, through the cooperation of its people in the government, Chamber of Deputies, the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, the Association of Banks and the Joint Authority, was able to realize this success, which clearly reflects the extent of the cooperation and Lebanon's credibility in international circles as a country providing a refuge for capital and a safe location where the depositor can relax, because he is dealing with parties that respect the laws.
He also presented the work conducted by the Special Investigation Authority, which is headed by the Governor of the Bank of Lebanon. He explained "the benefits of removing Lebanon's name from the black list, at the forefront of which is cooperation with the international community in the field of combating money laundering and tackling some of the factors that drive away capital and investments from among the macro-economic imbalances." He stressed "the importance of cooperating with the monetary authorities and institutions, banking experts and the relevant parts of the private sector, which cooperation has produced appropriate legislation and regulation that takes into account Lebanese characteristics and meets the demands of the international community."

Sergio Bukhaazi: Launching Into the Ambiance of Blues and Jazz.
Despite the professionalism of the song, music remains his hobby and the engineering is the parasol that protects him from the light of the poem and the blaze of its fire.
To the second song, "We're all suffering from the Blues", where the blues has grown bored or excited by this musical form. With his guitar we hear Sergio with his sweet voice and the saxophone of Isa Gharib, Tom Horning and Fuad Zaka.
Sergio learnt the guitar in 1993 with Samir Atiyyah.
His disc today is an event in the life of an artist who has brought together engineering specialization with musical professionalism and continued to regard music as a hobby.
His voice remains adorned by a warm, deep veil that is suddenly torn apart in the ambience of a jazz free from all restriction.
He only stopped his deadly bullets when he saw that he had killed them all without exception.
Ughait Faghali, one victim among eight, died yesterday at the hands of crime whilst following up the demands of teachers and reviewing their problems, at the Compensation Fund administration in an "educational site", or so it should be at the UNESCO location in Beirut!

Ahdan - "Al-Nahar":
But the extreme heat prevented them that evening from sitting at the same site.
Minister of Public Health Sulaiman Faranjiyyah has asked all government and private hospitals to take all those wounded in the Teachers Compensation Fund incident at the expense of the Ministry of Health. The Ministry will bear the costs 100% in full with the legal procedures to be completed later.
A patrol of the Internal Security Forces was attacked on the Abu Ali river promenade by armed men, who appeared suddenly at the Al-Baraniyyah and Al-Tabannah stopping points, when members of the patrol attempted to arrest Mahmoud Fuad Al-Bahri, who was intoxicated. Tens of people gathered around the members of the patrol, which was accompanied by three vehicles, and threw stones and sticks at them. Sergeant Tony Finyunus was struck in the head, which bled, and was then transferred unconscious to the "Al-Nini Hospital" in Tripoli.
Security men in Sidon arrested Ali Hussein Muhammad H. (aged 50) and his wife Najwa Abbas Z. (aged 43) for committing crimes of fraud amounting to 44 thousand American dollars after they assumed the title of prince in the Saudi royal family and seized, by fraud, money from a large number of people.
Its Not Poverty But the Availability of Weapons.
We are late in resolving it and must not be delayed further". He stressed that he was basing his view on what the colleague interviewing him, Shadha Umar, had said, namely that the person who had perpetrated the crime, Ahmad Ali Mansur, had killed his colleagues at work because they had refused, or rather because the Private Schools Teachers Compensation Fund had refused, to grant him a loan of 19 million Lebanese lira.
Despite this, it did not occur to anyone that the reason for the crime was poverty, for otherwise every car owner whose car has been seized -  and how many there are given the evidence that we read numerous advertisements for the sale of such cars by auction following their seizure - would suffer a rush of anger or madness.
Which means that he went to the place intent on killing.
Who is the killer?
What happened has happened, and there is no use crying. Nor is punishment much use, because the crimes that are committed with the consequences taken into account are rare.
A father of four children aged 46 conducted a massacre over two floors occupied and managed by the Ministry of Education. He is one of the employees in the Private Teaching Fund for Teachers.
By coincidence, the White Sand squadron of the Internal Security Forces was close to the scene of the crime. Its members rushed to the site when they heard the gunfire and ringed the area as those present left the building one by one. The patrol succeeded in detaining him when he tried to open fire on its members whilst he was in a state of confusion.
In these circumstances did yesterday's crime take place, according to the summary provided by sources close to the investigation.
The same sources mentioned that Mansur had planned his crime five or six days earlier and had drawn up a list in his mind of the people he wanted to get rid of. By coincidence two of the people on this list were not present at their offices and one of them had not come to work.
Following the confessions repeated by the person held, the Appeals Public Prosecutor in Beirut, Joseph Maamari, accused him, and anyone brought to light in the investigation, of deliberately and willfully undertaking with prior thought and intent to kill eight people and attempt to kill five others by opening fire on them using unlicensed military weapons, and of transporting an unlicensed hand grenade, crimes provided for in Articles 548 and 549 of the Weapons Law, the penalty stipulated for which is execution.
About the crime, he said, "The person held borrowed money from the Teachers' Fund, which the Director asked to be returned, but which he did not.
Their statements will be heard when their health conditions permit.
In support of the Intifada, in solidarity with the children of Palestine and in condemnation of Israeli massacres against the Palestinian people, at the invitation of the "Social Aid" Association more than a 150 Palestinian children in the Al-Bass Camp, Sidon, mounted a protest outside the UNRWA office in the camp.
Saif Al-Nasr expressed her appreciation to the Lebanese people and her admiration for the social activities carried out by Lahud.
The Association of Islamic Charitable Aid met at Beirut International Airport their students returning from the 11th summer camp held in Iran at the invitation of the Imam Al-Khomeini Aid Committee - Iran.
The Scouting Association of the Lycée National closed its ninth summer camp at Sahrah Nar, which was attended by a number of people invited and families of the scouts.
The Knights and Vanguards of the Virgin in Ain Ibl have organized their annual summer camp in the pine forests of the town. It will last one week and about 150 boys, whose ages range from 5 to 14 years, will take part, in addition to volunteers.
Following the National Anthem, the Al-Kafaat anthem was played with lyrics by Said Aql and music by Zaki Nasif. The ceremony was introduced by Michel Maiki, who hoped that "Lebanon would remain a beacon of thought, love, knowledge and the university of Arab students because reality and knowledge mean that one must respond to the spirit of truth."
Henry Zughib then spoke, calling on students to "stay away from politics and politicians because for us politics is a ruse and factional and only looks after personal interests".
He said, "Since Al-Kafaat began its social journey on the morning of 14 August, 1957, until today, it has believed that the most effective, useful and sound social service that it could perform in its environment was in developing the concept of care and refuge to the principle of education, the philosophy thereof and its numerous contributions for the benefit of dignity, sufficiency, the money of those charged and the higher national interest.
It is based on principles of faith, preparation and science.
Faith builds human beings. Sectarianism builds a human with the desires of an animal.
On this basis, every competition implies quality. If we do not see this, we slump into inactivity and poor work.
As regards the educational system in Lebanon, I am not taking higher education in isolation. In fact, I am discussing education as a whole, as an educational system, from the nursery to the university.
There are rules and principles that must be followed. Let licenses be given to those who want them and let those who want to compete.
He concluded, "What we hope is that you will be better than us, because there is a difference between politics and those who are engaged in it, between religion and those who are preoccupied with it, and between the teacher and one who teaches.

A number of Arab and international judges and experts who are presenting their studies in this area are participating.
Al-Natur gave the speech of Minister Al-Jisr and said, "Protection, including the symbolic arrangements on the criminal and civil levels, is a deterrent not to commit crimes of copying and the rape of intellectual rights, which will encourage intellectual production on the day of the crime."

Tens of members of the People's National Conference have been detained in the last few days in Khartoum and other cities, after the authorities accused them of working to sabotage the peace talks taking place between the Government and rebels of the "Sudanese People's Liberation Army". Newspapers talk of the security forces confiscating weapons and explosives and CD tapes revealing the residences of some ministers and officials in the ruling National Party, which were to have been bomb targets.
It quoted a spokesman for the army, who said the "Sudanese People's Liberation Army" had reiterated "its hostile nature" and shelled locations of the Armed Forces in Labolo and Torit situated in centers of civilian population.

He thought it probable that the small explosions witnessed by the Afghan capital recently, one of which took place outside the United Nations hotel, aimed to create an atmosphere of fear.
He said that they constituted a threat to the new government and that it was expected that they would be freed once their weapons had been taken away from them and they had been questioned.

In connection with Iraq, Muller said, "We remain concerned in respect of Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction."
He noted that none of the Ministers had asked the European Union to send a "warning" to Baghdad, which refutes contradictory information published by the Danish press.
He stressed, "The route of the United Nations under the command of the Security Council must be taken."
One of the diplomats reported that the German Minister believed that the idea of sending "a warning" to Baghdad was "dangerous because if the Iraqis do not comply, we will be forced to go to war".
British Foreign Minister Jack Straw, whose country is considered closest to Washington on the Iraqi issue, in opposition to German and France, was cautious and avoided mentioning the possibility of a warning being given or an attack made on Iraq.

He stressed, "The readiness of the Ministry to begin study despite these difficult and harsh conditions, with one million male and female pupils heading for study seats in 2300 schools in the Bank and Strip, some of which have been destroyed by raids and incursion operations."
He believed that the solution lay in "sending teachers to the homes of injured and disabled pupils".
The Ministry of Education and Higher Education says that the number of pupils this year has increased by 6% with about 75 thousand new pupils entering a total of 2029 schools, 59 of them new.
And the delegation of banks that went to discuss with Rafiq Al-Hariri the items of the budget only needed to invite him in turn to this "celebration", irrespective of whether the sections, articles and schedules of the budget, both those that are apparent and those that have been "camouflaged", call for joy or thanks.
This matter may appear strange and interesting to other countries.
They receive their salaries, in addition to allowances under the heading "additional fees" and "transport and movement allowance" on occasion. There is no one among their number who has ever entered the place in which he was "appointed", or even knows where it is!
Of course Rafiq Al-Hariri cannot deny the unbelievable state of the public sector. He has already been repeatedly burned by the attempts to purify and reform, which stirred up unbelievable sectarian and factionalist winds.
If the "leadership agreement" to publish the draft budget deserved all this praise, what do we say if the miracle of political agreement to purify and reform actually happens?
Two American tourists said that they were close to the Eiffel Tower when they saw a gathering and bouquets of flowers, and so approached the place.

On the other, a queen maintaining silence and protecting herself with her family in the Scottish Balmoral Castle, where she was on holiday as if unaware of the scale of grief experienced by her people.
Heir to the throne Prince Charles in particular is making great efforts to storm the hearts of the British under the supervision of a talented communications advisor after being continuously criticized for his coldness and failed marriage to Diana.
Perhaps Charles has recovered some of the popularity he had lost, but he is still a long way from the enthusiasm that his dead wife, who embodied the personality of a modern princess who was also able to sympathize with the deprived at the same time, provoked.
It is odd that by her death Lady Diana helped make this family, which faced fierce battles  with her over the last years and made her suffer by its cruelty and distaste, more human and more popular.

Birri Warns Lebanese Against "Betraying Syria"; Lahud's Movement Expands; "Al-Qarnat" in Al-Diman Tomorrow.
In this context we note that a meeting described as "important" is to be held tomorrow in Al-Diman between Safir and a delegation from the "Qarnat Shahwan Forum", in which all the phases of this previous stage and the matter of dialogue will be reviewed amidst the preparations of the "Al-Qarnat Forum" to hold a meeting on the 19th of next September, on the eve of the second anniversary of the Maronite Episcopal Council issuing its statement in September 2000. It is also rumored that the Maronite Episcopal Council will also issue a statement of this occasion.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri yesterday visited Saudi Arabia where he met Crown Prince Abdallah bin Abd Al-Aziz in Jedda.

He addressed a "a greeting of appreciation to Minister of Health Sulaiman Faranjiyyah, to whom the virtue of closing this case is due, for demonstrating once more a major human and national stance and practical translation of the slogan of God's forgiveness for the past, which he has raised on more than one occasion, rising above the significant wound caused by this case."
He said that there were two types of assassination, one physical and one political, and that both lead to the same result, namely to remove us from the arena". He spoke about the correlation between his information and the information mentioned by Ambassador Johnnie Abdu in a television interview about the danger confronting him, accusing "official agencies of involvement in the incidents to which he is exposed".
He added, "To date we only feel the presence of a monologue, not a "dialogue", meaning that the political exchange process is unidirectional."
The expression special relations was first used in my era.
He confirmed that the invitation he had received to meet with American Defense Minister Donald Rumsfeld and his Deputy "was with the knowledge of the Lebanese State and agencies.
Until We Meet Again; Ibrahim Mashurb.
Forty-two Deputies gathered together by the catastrophe, the catastrophe that masquerades under the name of the Qarnat Shahwan Forum, the catastrophe that instills neither fear nor horror. Nor does it plan to take its own life or even perpetrate crimes against decency. It comprises hot heads that need to cool down and cold heads that need to warm up, and heads the temperature of which lies somewhere in the middle. And there are even heads there that have no heads.
But the young men of Al-Qarnat continued to be excel, for Al-Qarnat is high above sea level and the brothers therein pay for the food and drink out of their own pockets. Their number includes literate thinkers and politicians. They also include war leaders, who have waged into the battles to defend against crimes. But what really singles out the Qarnat Forum from the Consultative Forum is the presence of an innocent, human, female voice, one that is mild, kind and well received.
They said that calming diplomatic contacts conducted with Beirut demonstrated that matters were still under control and that there was no fear of any escalation, at least from the Lebanese side, "after the military operation achieved its objective".
They noted that the leaking of what took place in meeting between Ben Eliazer and Satterfield to some Israeli newspaper to the effect that "Hizbollah" and Syria would attack northern Israel during the American strike against Iraq was a familiar plot, the aim of which was to force the Americans to give the Hebrew State a green light to mount a broad attack including the Lebanese and Syrian interior.
They examined the contents of the threats made in the media, but believed that they would not see the light of day in the foreseeable future unless they were repeated and led to major losses.
The positions of the Israeli Chief of Staff Moshe Ya'alon should be included under the heading of military theories, in other words a military analysis that did not include a military decision to attack.
He said, "The North has always been at the forefront of life in common and adopting the unifying national message."
The discussion covered the mechanisms to be adopted by the Forum and it is believed that between now and 10 September, the working mechanism may be ready and ideas crystallized more."
Regarding the objections of some to the meeting of the "Consultative Forum" in the Chamber of Deputies, he said: "The importance of our meeting is that we have acknowledged the importance of the Chamber of Deputies, which is the main cover above us, as is the cover of the constitutional institutions. There is no scope for dialogue outside the constitutional institutions. In fact, we must return to the institutions to establish what has been agreed upon among the Lebanese."
This is the right of the State and it must use it. The capital will not run away because it is here and because there is reassurance (...)".

Miqati took part in a popular meeting organized by the "Charitable Care Association", which focuses on health and social care in the common districts of Tripoli.
During the election battle we heard much skeptical talk, to which we did not respond.
We congratulate such a forum and we support them and all that serves Tripoli's interest. Once more, we stretch out our hands to serve the town. We see no harm in the forum, unless it aims to monopolize Tripoli's decision and bring about the saying that in this arena it is either us or no one else.
Meanwhile, Miqati played the role of patron at the graduation ceremony for students of the Quran course at the invitation of the "Makarim Islamic Ethics Association" at the port, in the presence of the Mufti of Tripoli and the North, Taha Al-Sabunji, and the representative of Deputy Muhammad Al-Safdi.
A dialogue between whom and whom?
Dialogue can only take place between those who are divided and attack the constitution, between those who defy Syria and harbor resentment against Arabism, between those who abuse security and manipulate the State, between those who attack the judiciary and cast doubts on the future, and between wise nationalists who believe in one nation, one society and one dignity and future."
Leader of the Progressive Socialist Party Deputy Walid Junbalat criticized the draft budget, in particular the privatization of the water and electricity sectors. He noted that "maritime property holders are stronger than the State".
The representative of the University Chancellor Dr George Tamah then spoke. He believed that the University was today in the greatest need of the support of all sincere people. He announced, "The University has obtained the acceptance of the Inspection Authority and has become qualified for furthering studies and will in about two years obtain certification of competence in the world of education and medical services.
But if you want to get into privatization, then the time for buying shares in the Lebanon Electricity Company is right, before they are sold or come into the ownership of Dr Barudi or Dr Khuri or anyone else.
As for the maritime property, as set out in the draft submitted by one of them, that the violations must be dealt with and that they are crimes against the 1926 Law, namely that those in breach must be imprisoned and the violations removed, but, in Lebanon, the holders of maritime property are stronger than the State."
Visitors to Al-Mukhtarah included a delegation from Al-Fawarah led by Municipal Head Yusif Ilya, which invited him to the occasion to be held on the 15th of this month, in addition to lawyer Eli Nakhlah, who headed a delegation from the people of Al-Baruk and Al-Firdis, followed by the Head of Aliyah Municipality Wajdi Murad.
Before leaving in the evening for Beirut, the Prime Minister met at his home in Jedda Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs Prince Saud Al-Faisal.
Regarding the establishment of joint committees between the "Consultative Forum" and the "Qarnat Shahwan Forum" and other forces, he said: "The move is to form a monitoring committee the task of which is to engage in dialogue with political forces."
He stressed, "The interests of all requires that the dialogue be between everyone and with everyone, on clear, explicit and unchanging bases."
He and the delegation discussed how to develop relations between the parliaments of the two countries. It was agreed to continue discussion of this topic during Jabir's next scheduled visit to Japan at the invitation of the Japanese government.
The statement issued by the Ministry read as follows: "Pursuant to Article 35 of Law 171, dated 06/01/2000, concerning the election of members of the Chamber of Deputies, the deadline for the submission of permits for candidacy in the deputies by-elections for the vacant seat of the Sunni sect in the city of Sidon as part of the single constituency for the south expired at midnight on Friday, 30/08/2002.
Al-Rifai later said that the delegation communicated to Al-Hariri "our concern and that of our Palestinian people for the security and stability of Ain Al-Halwah Camp and its environs," in addition to "the suffering of the Palestinian people from deprivation at all levels, especially the economic and social".
During the Israeli occupation, these forests were the subject of a major maltreatment operation, especially in terms of the fires that broke out in them, in addition to the incendiary shells. The fire swept through great expanses leaving the land empty and arid.
The Al-Rihan Stretch, which overlooks the town from the West and which contains thick oak trees, and which stood as a stronghold for resistance fighters attacking Israeli bases, was no less unfortunate: the Israeli forces, adopting a scorched-earth policy, burnt it.
The largest fires to have affected the area of Jazin and continued for three days in succession broke out in the forests of Qituli, Al-Humusiyyah, Al-Qabaa and Rum. This took place on 30 July.
There is another reason: the presence of just three observers in the Jazin Forestry Center who are unable to monitor and cover this expanse of forest.
Availability: usually shipped with 24 hours.
Publisher: Dar Al-Nahar.
Reliable reports from five years ago report that the fires were limited to areas the most prominent of which were Al-Aishiya, Al-Rihan, Armati, Qituli, Hiturah and Saidun, etc. where the fires started by the shells spread quickly as the forests could not be cleared and kept down.
Since liberation until today fires are up 40%. The reason for this, it is said, is those who picnic in the forests and leave inflammable materials behind them, including rubbish, glass bottles, etc. These represent a new enemy, one that we have introduced by our own hands into our forests.
To extinguish it, army forces and helicopters, in addition to the civil defense, which sought the aid of its stations in Al-Shuf and the south, not to mention the fire brigade, municipalities and people of the area, intervened.
There is yet another reason, one that many have dealt with for a long time: The belief that there is a plan to burn Lebanon's forestry resources.

After a war lasting fifteen years, despite the shells, missiles and heavy artillery, this wall has remained firm, apart from the Al-Taif gap caused by a sniper in error. He apologized and began to restore it so that the wall would be stronger than previously.
The result of this situation is that, despite the limited size of the nation, every sect has come to have its borders and geographical location, to the extent that the youth feel that they are in a prison from which they can only escape to the civilized world by emigrating.
This article came as a necessary reaction by society to that futile war, into which the Lebanese plunged for fifteen years, in a genuine desire to prevent any future return to it.

When the wolf is about to eat her, she says that she needs to go to relieve herself. The wolf allows her to leave the house for this purpose, and then asks her, "Are you relieving yourself?" But the girl succeeds in escaping.
This distinguished book extols the wide-ranging narration of the story by presenting its background, causes and origins.
Even after Tex Avery portrayed the wolf in an animated film in 1943 as having fallen in love with a buxom Little Red Riding Hood, and even after the wolf was castrated in the lesbian tale of Olga Broumas, the story has not completely lost its corrupt roots.
Haven't we always asked how Little Red Riding Hood was so stupid as not to notice that the wolf was in bed?
Why a wolf?
The question remains: Has the writer read too much into what is just a story of the imagination?
When its spokesman Francois Rifaso was asked about press information to the effect that the Yemeni authorities were detaining a large number of foreign subjects, including some French, in connection with the 11 September attacks on the United States, he responded, "Yes, there are four French people being detained in Yemen at present to our knowledge."
Some days earlier, Yemeni Deputy Sultan Azzam said that the intelligence services had affirmed that 104 persons suspected of being involved in terrorist activities were detained in Yemen, including 15 suspected of involvement in the attack on the destroyer "USS Cole" in Aden port in October 2000. Others were detained following the 11 September attacks in the US.
The Yemeni Minister of the Interior confirmed in a statement that the incident resulted only in a number of wounded.
Baghdad and Washington Try to Win Ankara In Preparation for Possible Military Confrontation Between Them.
Following her meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Shukri Sina Gurel, Jones stated that the United States was working with Turkey and other states to agree on a Security Council resolution in respect of Iraq.
She explained that the talks dealt with the conditions of the Turkish economy, which is supported by the United States, the evidence for which is provided by the Pako-Jihan crude oil pipeline from the Caspian Sea to Europe via Turkey.
He said, "These threats not only represent a danger to Iraq, but to the whole region, especially Turkey."
It aims to improve its diplomatic and trade relations with Iraq despite the fact that it hosts the American aircraft that guard this area.
Whilst the Managing Director of the Fund, Horst Kohler, confirmed that the meeting was "constructive and successful" and expressed his confidence in the "continuation of the international economic recovery", poor states received no more than verbal promises.
African Ministers urged the wealthy states to fulfill their promises as their region is facing major challenges in combating poverty.
The Ministers, including American Secretary of Treasury Paul O'Neill, agreed that the world would be better without any support or customs tariffs at all.
With regard to education, there was also no tangible commitment.
Government Forces Gain Control of Zadran's Base near Gardez; Qarzai Concludes "Very Successful" Gulf Tour in Doha, Accuses Foreign Forces and Terrorists of Involvement in Explosions; Baktia Clashes.
Afghan Foreign Minister Abdallah Abdallah was quoted as saying that Doha had decided to send a mission to Kabul to study cooperation, ways of investments and reopening the Qatari Embassy "before the end of the present year".
Saudi Arabia and the Emirates severed relations with Kabul following the 11 September 2001 attacks and the start of the campaign against the "Taliban" regime.
He was asked about an article published by a newspaper speaking for the "Islamic Association", which spoke of a dispute between Qarzai and Minister of Defense General Muhammad Fahim, who belongs to this group. He answered that the article "was published without any censorship or editing on account of what seems to be an internal problem".
He added, "We also lost some of our fighters (...) our attack began late on Sunday evening. We gained control of the Sayyid Karam base in its entirety by seven am (...) The commander of the Zadran forces, Rad Muhammad, was killed and some of the fighters were captured."
The shelling left 30 dead.
A spokesman for the American forces at the Bagram air base north of Kabul said that American soldiers wounded an armed man who fired at the base after managing to come within five meters of one of the guard sites.
In his first cabinet reshuffle since assuming his position more than a year ago, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has dismissed Minister of Financial Affairs Hakuo Yanagisawa, with whom he was in disagreement, in addition to the Ministers of Defense and Agriculture, who are embroiled in scandals. He confirmed his determination to bring his country out of the economic slack it has experienced for over a decade. This impacted positively on the financial markets with the yen recording its highest level against the dollar in over two weeks.
The Prime Minister attributed the cabinet reshuffle to his determination to speed up the clean up of the banking swamp in Japan, which he said was weighing down the economy.
In addition Shigeru Ishiba was appointed Director of the Defense Agency and Sadakazu Tanigaki Chairman of the National Public Safety Commission.
Since assuming his position in April 2001 he pledged to sort out the debt, which is exhausting the banking sector and to reform the insurance savings and postal sectors.
"I did not imagine that I would come out alive." With these words Adib Shamasnah, aged 30, one of the members of the Palestinian Leadership Security Force summed up what he felt on night of the Friday before last, as the recent Israeli attack on the headquarters of Chairman Yasir Arafat in Ramallah reached its peak.
The group did cross the bridge, in spite of the heavy fire and the Israeli soldiers continuing to shoot bullets that came through the windows in order to stop those trying to cross to the other side, where Arafat and the others accompanying him were situated.
About 23 security men failed to make it after Israeli army bulldozers destroyed the bridge completely.
The others, who had been gathered around Chairman Arafat in the opposite building, were no better off.
Seselj Results Exceed Expectations; Kostunica Heads Serbian Elections, Labus Confronts Him in Second Round.
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic, who supports Labus, stated, "The bloc supporting democracy in Serbia has been split in two, which has given Seselj the opportunity to emerge after Milosovic was overthrown."
He added, "The encouraging thing is that the candidates supporting democracy will enter the return round (...) the frustrating thing is that some of the votes that helped overthrow Milosovic have now moved to Seselj."
I have assembled one million votes," in a reference to this being his first candidacy in the Presidential Elections.
Kostunica is searching for a new position as the date for the disbanding of Federal Yugoslavia draws near, later this year, to be replaced by a loose union between the Republics of Serbia and Montenegro, who remain from the previous Federation.
The nation-wide curfew was extended from 20:00 to 06:00 hours local time and GMT, and from 18:00 to 08:00 in the two cities of Bouake and Korhogo in the center and north of the country.
Western military sources noted confrontations in Tipiso, 40 km from the administrative capital Yamoussoukro.
In Accra the exceptional summit of the Economic Community of West African States ended with agreement to send peacekeeping forces to the Ivory Coast.
South African President Thabo Mbeki will join it in his capacity as President of the African Union.
The Senegalese President commented on this by saying, "The problem is elsewhere." He described the events witnessed by the Ivory Coast as "neither a revolution nor a rebellion, but the resorting by some military figures to weapons in order to achieve some of their demands".
American government documents reinvestigated recently in light of increasing talk of waging war against Iraq have demonstrated that the Iraqi biological weapons program began with the help of the US 20 years ago.
Iraq also obtained other deadly samples, including the West Nile germ.
Former United Nations weapons inspector Jonathan Taker said, "I do not believe that it would be accurate to say that the government of the United States deliberately provided a store of samples for the Iraqi nuclear program (...) but they did hand over samples, which Iraq said were for medical purposes. I believe it was naïve to believe this, even at this time.
The "Associated Press" Agency said that the list of requests looked like a shopping list.
In 1986 the Center for Disease Control and Protection also sent consignments to the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission, including the botulinum toxin.
The Borders of the State...and the Resistance.
It is now time to draw the connecting borders between the State and the resistance using the methods and theories of political repulsion.
Like connected veins, the State embraces the resistance and the resistance firmly establishes the opposition of the State.
His enthusiastic speech about the "Great Satan" and his statement that "our resounding slogan will remain: Death to America" are thus the "foundation columns of the house" for "Hizbollah", which is not only ranked "number 1" on America's list of "terrorism" but has become a target for daily threats, the last of which was pronounced by Richard Armitage, Deputy Secretary of State, who appears to have been behind the pressures brought to bear in Congress, which led to the suspension of aid to Lebanon.
"Israel wants to put the Arabs in confrontation with America. The interests of the Arabs lie in achieving the opposite to this."
The Prime Minister is opposed to confrontation by force because of the imbalance, and also against prostration. He calls for us to enter the existing system, to influence it and not to remain on its margins...but two matters prevent this involvement: unity of stance and clarity of conception. This is the extreme difficulty in Lebanon, and in most Arab states.
The Haaretz correspondent, who is among the delegation accompanying the Prime Minister, said, "Israel is very anxious, especially at the possibility that Syria will be supplied as part of an arms deal with advanced anti-aircraft shoulder-borne "SA-18" missiles.
In Haaretz Dani Rubenstein wrote that, despite the passing of two years, there did not seem to be any evidence to indicate that the end of the Intifada was near.
The Palestinians invested about three billion dollars in the three years preceding the Intifada just in tourism projects.
The clear evidence for this is that 300 thousand foreign workers work in Israel today. They have taken the place of thousands of Palestinian workers who were working in Israel.
The road from Quraitam to the southern district is not wide enough for more mines and ambushes set up by the fervent, the last of which was the tale of the "gap" on the margins of American intervention along the Al-Wazzani "track" as witness.
And ultimately, at least for this stormy phase, it is essential that it be clear both at home and abroad that Lebanon does not want to withdraw from its stance and slogans on the resistance and that "Hizbollah" cannot and should not be allowed to withdraw from its stance and slogans on Lebanon.
Since the story of the "mistimed operation" in the Shabaa Farms, and the subsequent debate about the background of Hong Kong and Hanoi, through to last week, the borders between the State and the resistance have not been proficiently drawn, despite the fact that the interests of both parties require this.
Why?
If such talk holds a signal to the enthusiasm of Nasrallah, which appears much more developed than the message of the traditional "enthusiasts" in the region, who have cloaked their message in velvet since 11 September, Al-Hariri has tried to sketch out a difficult third way between two easy paths within Arab reach.
It is rare for earthquakes, floods and storms to be thought of as positive factors for investors. But understanding how they work may bring rich rewards. And if the natural phenomena taking place on the earth do not help increase returns on shares, investors can always work out where fortune lies from the stars.
He said, "If fortune is on our side, then whatever the news, one must look to the part of the cup that is half-full, which means that dealers will buy and prices will rise.
It is a sixth sense that I possess.
Jan Francois Richard, a French astrologist also confirms the capabilities of astrology, saying that his monthly bulletin predicted precisely the movement of the French stock exchange "CAC" index 11 times out of 12 last year.
He says, "We have seen a good increase in share prices in April", referring to their rise from the lowest levels in five years recorded in July, "which was due to the position of Saturn in relation to Uranus."
The application of scientific models to the market does not help investors who are looking for news about a specific share, but it may help traders dealing in complex voluntary contracts to prepare a better evaluation of the risks.
Rebecca Harrison.
The two Presidents discussed recent developments to the situation in the region on the basis of the concern of the two fraternal countries and the remaining fraternal Arab states to protect their strategic interests and effectively confront the dangers to which they are exposed, which thereby demand the formulation of an integrated and unified vision to crystallize around clear collective Arab commitment as to how to deal with the situation in its facets and dimensions.
The will of the two Presidents concurred on the necessity of exhausting all means to deal with the situation by peaceful means, thereby avoiding the peoples of the region the terrors to which they may be exposed.
She said, "We are working to avoid a resolution being issued to strike Iraq." She noted, "The Russian, French and Chinese position is careful and cautious."
With the return of President of the Republic Emil Lahud yesterday afternoon to Beirut from his two official visits to Yemen and the Sultanate of Oman, political circles waited to see whether he would issue a specific stance in the coming hours on the recent domestic developments, the final direction of which is still difficult to predict.
The surprise of Public Prosecutor for Cassation Adnan Adum at "the clamor surrounding the procedures" he had recently taken, including his request for the "Al-Buma" file, was apparent yesterday.
With regard to the results of Lahud's two visits to Sanaa and Salalah, the most prominent impressions stated by the circles of the Lebanese delegation were to establish the fears of an American strike against Iraq despite the diplomatic efforts being made to avoid such a strike, in addition to the fears of the possibility that this strike may be followed by strikes against other Arab countries.
In relation to the political tract, the source said that President Lahud stressed in his talks the importance of Arab solidarity and eliminate the differences between Arab states for that led to their being easily isolated and when one state was adversely affected another may, in turn, suffer a similar fate.
The source said that the three leaders agreed that if the strike against Iraq took place then it would be followed by other strikes and would, with different probabilities, include other Arab and regional states.
The decision lies in the hands of President Saddam Hussein alone.
And if Baghdad warns that it will respond to any attack against it, then that is natural for a state living the nightmare of a potential strike at any moment.
Notwithstanding the difficulty and complexity of the circumstances, the only option available today is for a rational Iraqi decision to cooperate fully with the United Nations.
Baghdad, moreover, succeeded in dividing the Security Council, which remains divided on the new resolution to be issued.
The rational decision is clear.
From A Very Long Time.
Every day honors us and beneath its pits is that distinctive odour, sometimes of the kind that belly dances.
Suddenly a fistful of dollars fly out of our hands in a moment of inattentiveness, on which we were relying to get out of our chronic malaise, to restore prosperity and the good nights to where the goat lies.
But its "detention" is reckoned in political parlance to be an unfriendly message to the Lebanese state, for the reasons and causes set out above, below or elsewhere.
Including the old one revived, and the new one that will certainly enter the list where it will be made to grow old.
The Lebanese, with their senior officials, noble pillars, powerful politicians and their guides engrossed in carving out love for each other, handing out robes along the alleys of the undesired, and opening files in preparation for elections following elections, following acts of revenge, following a settling of accounts, following suppression and brigandery.
"Zayyan".
The "France Press Agency" quoted financial sources as saying that Hariri's action "aims to obtain a guarantee for long-term loans from European and Gulf States and Japan, which means that Lebanon can obtain long-term loans at low interest rates".
In the evening Al-Hariri met in Quraitim a delegation from the Burbur Traders Association, headed by Rashid Al-Kibbi, who praised the start of infrastructure and works to make ready Burbur market "following 17 years of neglect".
He gave a reassurance that "the positive effects of the government approach to this problem will begin to appear soon, in the Paris 2 Conference and with the beginning of the privatization and out-sourcing."
The first excess in the next general budget will be 1400 million dollars, i.e. the income of the State will exceed its expenditure by this amount from now.
"Southern Aid Association" Visits Al-Wazzani; Qablan: As Lebanese We Are Required to Preserve Water and Land.
They were accompanied by Deputies Ali Hasan Kahlil, Nazih Mansur, Ali Bizzi, Qaim Hashim, Chairman of the Council of the South Qablan Qablan, Official from the Intelligence Branch in the Al-Nabatiyyah Governorate Captain Ali Nur Al-Din, and project contractor Sharif Wahbi.
They praised the Southern Council, which sponsors these development projects, and pledged to follow in the steps of the concealed Imam Musa Al-Sadr alongside the "Southern Aid Association", which he founded in the 1970s.
We do not want more than our right, which is established in international norms and observed laws. The others, however, pursue the most abhorrent practices in order to strike against us and put us under siege.
We must take hold of each other's hands, open hearts and forget the dark past, and move to ensure victory for the south, the people of the south and its water, to support national unity in all Lebanon."
Sharon's threats are a storm in a teacup. He must solve his domestic problems.
Today we have come to announce from here the rebirth of this Association along with the patron of this Patriarchate, Archbishop Ilyas Kafuri.
Ahmad Fawaz spoke on behalf of the Preparatory Committee, followed by Deputy Saad in the name of the Central Monitoring Committee, who called for "the activation of the popular movement to confront the challenges".
3. Call on Municipal Councils to free themselves from political tutelage, and focus their role on concern for the development of the towns and villages and preservation of the general interest of the citizens.
7. Encourage and protect from unfair foreign competition the fishing sector, by protecting the marine environment, provide fishing equipment at supported prices, draw up a calendar for imports, in addition to assisting fishermen and their families through benefit from the National Social Security Fund at least.
Receives New Iranian Ambassador; Birri Discusses Conditions with Al-Hariri; Concerned About Circumstances of Communities in Africa.
The policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran towards fraternal Lebanon is principled and unwavering.
Birri met with Liberia's special envoy to Lebanon and the Middle East and the head of its mission in Lebanon, Fuad Ghandur.
He added, "Speaker Birri has demonstrated the requisite concern and prepared the appropriate conditions to ensure the success of the Francophone summit to be held in Beirut, and to work to ensure the success of the preparations necessary to receive the delegations, in particular the delegations of African states that include Lebanese communities and are linked by strong relations to Lebanon."
Written by Khalil Falihan:
Well-informed sources reported that the surprise of officials stemmed from the fact that if the decision was true then it meant that the United States was not concerned with Lebanon and takes a decision without officially informing the relevant authorities.
They believed that "America's calling to account" of Lebanon on account of its policy on a number of issues is "delicate" and that the solution must lie with the State Department which had taken the decision because the problem lay there, and from there one could deal with the increase in objections by Congress in respect of Lebanese policy on a number of issues, including the failure to deploy the Lebanese army on the border. This led Tom Lantos, known for his strong support of Israel, to persuade the pillars of the Congress to freeze the sum of 10 million dollars from the total aid allocated to Lebanon until it complies.
Al-Qarnah "Adheres to the Political Stance" in Confronting Pressure; Bikirki Opts for "Dialogue"; Basharah May Be Tasked to Carry Out Contacts.
The Forum, which was fully prepared to take decisive steps more than a week ago, but deemed it sufficient to suspend the deputy activity of its Deputy members for a period of one month, appeared to be bending under the pressure of what it termed "media browbeating" and the sending of messages, even the naming of its members targeted one after the other.
However, the fact that Patriarch Safir has reiterated his patronage of the "Al-Qarnat" does not deny the fact that both are pursuing a new strategy developed from the experiences of the past weeks.
But these two stances do not revoke Bikirki's support for internal dialogue, especially with the President of the Republic.
In line with the "Al-Qarnah" approach, the fundamental direction will remain as it was and will not change "one bit" according to its circles.
The Thursday meeting will thus not shout for steps to be taken in the field to escalate the matter. The mini-meeting aims to limit the circle of debate, work out the results and study ways and means to confront, in order to render the decisions effective and thought-through, even if the "weapon of confrontation is via dialogue and adherence to the Bikirki principles and maxims".
Leader of the Phalanges Party Karim Baqraduni has demanded that justice be allowed to take its course in the Al-Buma file.
With regard to the Al-Buma file, he believed that it "fell within the framework of files having a financial characteristic, and that there was no interest for anyone, including President Amin Gemayel, in having this file suspended without investigation and trial.
He called on "the Lebanese and all parties and forces to hold fast by means of durable national forums. We call on government to provide political cohesion by means of the formation of the government of national federation and to maintain the security situation to prevent Lebanon falling into the scales of regional instability."
They referred to contacts that had taken place between Muarbas and the Phalangist leaders, from which they understood that Gemayel intended to use the text of the expulsion decision to bring a case against the Party to revoke the decision.
I informed him that I feel a deep sadness and fear, which my heart has not known before, and a bitterness that I have also not tasted before.
The behavior of a number of members of Qarnat Shahwan, or the bullet of salvation fired from the Lebanese parliament due to the presence of a Christian bloc (the Consultative Forum), thereby splitting the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies in two, does not concern me under any slogan, as the members of the bloc have been categorized into Christians and Muslims. We thank Divine Providence and leader Antoine Saadah that there are no Muslim Deputies in his party; otherwise his secular party would also have been split into Christians and Muslims.
Saad Demands Intervention of Judiciary; Al-Farzali: Cancellation of Inflated Electricity Bills After They Become Annihilation of Citizens Right.
Consequently, this situation cannot continue as it is, under the slogan that the state needs money, so let the citizen pay up irrespective of his economic situation, irrespective of the economic "suffocation" controlling him, when we are at the beginning of winter and schools."
We announce, indeed we have previously announced, our demand to the state, the government, the Lebanon Electricity Organization and the Council of Ministers to take the appropriate decision to cancel these very suspicious bills, which are no longer appropriate documents by which the citizen is demanded to pay the sums due thereunder."
It should be noted that the Chairman of the Public Works, Transport, Energy and Water Committee, Deputy Muhammad Qabbani, announced the postponement of the committee's tour of the Lebanon Electricity Organization, which was set for yesterday until next Monday (7 October) in response to the wish of the Chairman of the Board of the Organization "to clear the way before us to repair the faults befalling the network and tackle their causes".
Those assembled discussed new members joining the Forum and charged a sub-committee to meet with Deputy George Najm and invite him to the Forum for the purpose of attending its meetings.
Article 2: The General Board: The Consultative Forum shall comprise the Deputies presently members thereof and those who subsequently join it, and who, collectively, form the General Board.
- Coordinate the dates for meetings of the General Board and the invitations thereto.
- In general terms, perform any other consultative, representative or administrative function with which the General Board charges it.
Article 7: Committees: The Board may decide to form specialist permanent or temporary committees and determine the functions thereof.
Article 7: Quorum and Decisions: The General Board shall be quorate with the attendance of at least two thirds of its members; otherwise the meeting shall not be deemed quorate and not convened.
The "Francophone University Agency", one of the executive bodies of the International Francophone Organization, is helping to strengthen university education in the French language in Lebanon.
- At Saint Joseph University: an in-depth studies diploma in political sciences.
Michel Pensar, Director of the Middle East Office of the Agency, the headquarters of which is in Beirut, explains that the first of these branches was launched in 1995 and the last in 2001.
The certificate received by the student "bears as a minimum the name of the relevant university in Lebanon and is recognized by a large number of universities, in particular the members of the "consortium", and hundreds of Lebanese students have benefited from these branches over the last five years", according to Pensar.
The annual budget for each of the agency's activities in Lebanon is about one million Euro, which includes only the programs and not the expenses arising from salaries, etc.
Birhalin - Bishri, "Al-Nahar":
Priest Shawqi Karam gave a speech in which he praised the efforts made and the donations collected to complete the Mar Antonius Al-Badwani Complex in Birhaliyun.
You wanted the large hall in this building to be a place for meeting and assembly for weddings and funerals, in addition to a school equipped to receive your children and educate them so that they can grow in the principles of religion and morality, in addition to science and culture.
He confirmed "The love of his church for Lebanon and its people".
The complex includes halls on three floors equipped for pastoral and cultural work, in addition to a school building.
Joseph Al-Tawil contacted me and asked me: When will there be salvation from this suffering? I answered him: When we are liberated from subservience, delusions and reliance on others. More important than all of this is that we be liberated from the fear that controls our tongues and leaves us as chatterboxes not knowing what we say!
He asked whether this decision had the effect of extending to all outstanding students, and to those who are still studying at the Lebanese University?
In view of this conviction, a program of grants was launched this year for outstanding students in four specializations in the General Secondary Certificate: general sciences, life, economy and social sciences, literatures and humanities.
September ended yesterday, and with it the last administrative deadline for the diggers and bulldozers.
Following the national anthem, Attorney Khalil Abu Saad gave a speech on behalf of the Association. He believed, "The impact of environmental problems experienced by the individual in his society, goes beyond the geographical limits of his area, and even his country, because environmental concern is no longer a domestic issue affecting a specific society or country; it is international, crossing borders and policies."
Edition number: 3.
Perhaps the most prominent facet of this long environmental day is the considerable participation of environmental and social associations, from most Lebanese regions, which has provided an optimistic outlook for the issue of the environment against the shadow of the limited concern for this vital matter.
As if Tripoli does not have enough digging, which remains uncovered despite the danger, by contractors, that the catastrophe of pollution continues not to be monitored and subject to the mood of anyone who feels the urge to burn refuse in the squares and streets.
The program included speeches by Minister of Environment Michel Musa, Mrs. Miriam Picar, representative of the Ambassador of the European Mission in Lebanon, Patrick Renault, and Project Director Wolfgang Hager.
Head of Rashiya Municipality Faris Fayiq urged concern for the environmental issue.
Al-Gharib noted, "The Ministry of the Environment spares no effort in working to deal with other environmental refuse files, and depends on the role played by clubs and environmental associations in the regions."
Nasrallah believed, "We are facing a serious environmental problem in the Al-Laitani channel and in all the Lebanese channels and coasts. There is a fundamental problem of mixing industrial waste with waste water. This must be stopped before it gets worse."
The importance of the contest lay in the capacity to retain a degree of objectivity and neutrality in spite of the bitterness in the hearts of the rivals and the deep psychological wounds, especially on the part of the family of President Allende, whose grandson acknowledge numerous mistakes made by his grandfather's government by implementing a sudden jump in nationalizations and socialist transformations, forgetting the weapons and strong roots in society possessed by the forces of the right and the counter-revolution. This led these forces to band together against the government and paved the way for the success of the military revolution.
Although all parties to the experiment  - Deputies and Government - bear different degrees of responsibility for a solution, what is truly astonishing is how the Deputies were unable to tread with care but moved to an escalation that would kill off the experiment as long as the Government possessed the right to dissolution. In both Chile's and Bahrain's experiments there was a certain amount of gambling with democratic practice and an unsound estimation of the unequal balance of powers between the opposition and the government.
The Palestinians have the right to boast of their victory in the battle of the siege imposed on their leader Yasir Arafat in his headquarters in Ramallah.
Washington's concern since 11 September has been and remains Iraq, following Afghanistan, in preparation for full world domination.
And the Middle East cannot withstand two fires at the same time.
It responded because it expects a price.
Will its ambitions be any less than the transformation of its siege over the West Bank to a more general and comprehensive siege stretching from the banks of the Ocean to the banks of the Gulf?
Only Israel is missing from them all.
But this passageway may also kill off these ambitions, so let's keep it blocked in its face by fortifying and protecting this cause as the people of the Bank and Gaza did last week.
I asked the Bey why there was this attack in the Lebanese press against Brigadier Michel Aun with the State using all of its agencies against him. After having listening to him speak to the "Aljazeera" television channel the week before last, I found that he was irritable, striking his hand against the table if he did not like what was said.

The mentality of Lebanese political performance has remained based on the principle that the representatives of the Christian parties engage in dialogue with the Muslim parties in order to reach a joint policy by which to administer the utilities of the state that safeguards the right of each and in a context by which each of the two sides strives to obtain more gains at the expense of the other.
Amidst the flood of American and international preoccupations with the first anniversary of the American events of 11 September, including learning the lessons, significance, causes, roots and uncovering the secret behind the hatred of a large number of countries and peoples of the world for the United States, including allied European and western states, there are perhaps few who will stop to consider the historical-political significance of another tragic political event that took place on the same day, in 1973, namely the bloody military coup led by General Pinochet against the Government of Legitimate Socialist Popular Unity in Chile. Its parties won in the constitutional multi-party elections in 1980 as a result of joint planning with the American Central Intelligence Agency, and the fact is that no analyst, observer or researcher anywhere in the world, including America, questioned it.
The bank celebrated Saturday's return by distributing certificates to a group of its customers who participated in the computer lessons program which it provides free of charge at its branch in Al-Rabiya.
The meeting was also attended by Chinese Ambassador Lio Shayang.
Among the things he said were:
Edition number: 1
Ukkar - From Michel Hallaq.
The 88 years of his life were characterized by his mission to both his family and country, after he departed this world, leaving behind achievements for the cultural education of many future generations.
His professional life began in 1933 when, with his two brothers, he pioneered telecommunications technology for the radio in Lebanon by means of a firm that is still known today as "Bulus Brothers".
With regards to the Arab facilitating agreements and the opening of the Lebanese market to Arab agricultural products starting in the year 2005, the statement expressed the apprehension of the council of "the inability of the Lebanese agriculture, which suffers from the negative effects of the signed regional agreements, to overcome this unstudied openness, and to compete with Arab products that are produced at a lower cost and with acceptable qualities.
Regarding the emergence of new diseases in a number of agricultures, the Association talked about "the need to activate health quarantine at the entry centers of imported products and issuing directives by the Ministry of Agriculture for establishing strict health specifications and conditions for imported transplants and live plant parts to Lebanon for the purpose of ensuring the non-transmittance of lesions and diseases through them into Lebanon.
All applications filed with Ideal must be finalized within a period not exceeding two weeks."
The Association designated a committee headed by Engineer Antoine Al-Hwaik to follow up on records and make the necessary contacts in this regard."
The annual number of issued checks in lira also declined by 12 thousand checks, at the expense of the decline of those issued in foreign currencies by the amount of 83.5 thousand checks.
As far as the bounced checks are concerned, their number last August reached about 217 thousand and 303, valued at 856 billion liras, versus about 243 thousand and 214 checks, valued at 866 billion liras for the same period of last year, a decline in value of 10 billion liras (1.12 percent), and in number by 25 thousand and 911 checks at a rate of 10.65 percent.
Checks bounced as of the end of August, measured against the total clearing activity, represented a rate of 2.96 percent in number, versus 3.25 percent for the same period of the year 2001, while it reached 2.96 percent in value versus 3.20 percent in the year 2001.
He urged "not to be content with the conservation of consumption to resolve the problems of the environment and depletion of resources, but to come up with a formula that meets the current needs in quantity and quality of life while preserving the elements of sustainability."
Saab called for "instituting technology transfer and development programs in the developing countries themselves to accompany the preservation of the environment and respect of human dignity, as well as coupling the conservation of resources with developing clean production methods that lead to a balanced development of the environment instead of destroying it or keeping it in a bottle."
Following the depletion of ground water, use of water desalination began in some areas for purposes of agriculture.
The 88 years of his life distinguished his mission towards both his family and his country, after he exited this world, leaving behind accomplishments that represent the culture of many emerging generations.
His professional career began in the year 1933 when he explored with his two brothers the cable and wireless radio communications technology in Lebanon, through a corporation that is still known until today under the name "Boulos Brothers."
He was able through his international contacts to secure giant equipment that required active implementation through "Diabold Inc." in Ohio in the United States of America.
Fouad Boulos amazed many through what he introduced into the Lebanese markets, the most exciting of which was the Telefrek Project into Haresa in the year 1964.
As the Telefrek passes through a very high and steep hill today, so were the challenges that Fouad Boulos faced at the same level, in order to make this project see the light.
The Conscience of Time (from a voice trilogy dialogue)
From the most extreme landmarks of civility to the most extreme landmarks of backwardness.
And there are those who sell time in combat, fighting and a bit of madness.
This one with a lewd penny and that one with a fighting penny.
Maknar: It is a flammable matter as a match.
It is a livable matter if we fill the earth with the noise of our words, chanting.
Between a time that passes and is counted on us, and another that passes and is counted for us.
Yakzhan: Maknar said something about the test of time, such talk made me pause.

Perhaps the reason Sigmund Freud's theory has been widely adopted in psychology curricula in Lebanon, instead of Carl Young, is the fact that Freud was classic in his presentation and did not exceed the limit of the worldly human psyche, or that related to earthly affairs, addressing the psychological conditions by correlating them to sexual desires and complexes ingrained in childhood, including psychological complexes and illnesses, making it easier for the worldly and horizontal intellect to understand his presentation.

The Parliamentary Investigation Committee may have in mind, when it releases its report on the Puma record, that the judicial system should investigate people other than President Amin Al-Gemayel, in order for this committee to perhaps have a basis for action by the Parliament's General Commission, which requires two-thirds of the council's vote by law for a prosecution request against a former official, in the event of the availability of the basis.

Life is a stage, actors, effects, script and circumstances that take ideas and transform them into artistic images, whether happy or sad, lights, spectators and critical words, whether hurtful or commending and comforting.
Marriage in life is an acknowledgment by the star to share stardom with another human being, or an acknowledgment by one of them to give up stardom for the other and be content with living in the back alley of his life. Otherwise, there will be secondary roles for both parties, and then, a star must enter the game to influence events positively or negatively; or the two will have the stardom role, and in this case there must be limits to the activities of the characters or else the marriage will end up in tragic disaster.
Life is opportunities.

Democratic Conditions Forecast!
It is a coup that the state will be expected to account for in the first degree for the benefits it offered it and the losses it inflicted, and also for the opposition to the extent of its success in averting itself of the final blow and its failure to pass the unity test.
He said that as he banned the demonstrations anew.
And if America had not seen in the economy and development as a gateway for absorbing Arab and Islamic wrath, She would not have approved of Paris-2 while she was at the height of amassing a quarter of a million troops for the invasion of Iraq.
The state seemed, amid its superiority in picking up the opportune moment abroad, at the height of its weakness and alienation from the people while it was encouraging this practice.
Yet, the opposition is about to fall in the divisiveness taboo when it begins its differentiation by controlling its decisions away from "the spirit of consultation" among its wings.
Paris-2
We do not know why some have chosen to link Paris-2 with the prevailing fashion in Lebanon these days, despite its misery and pettiness. In other words, "the Demonstration" and its prevention by threatening counter-demonstration; we turned into an example before "Paris-2 Demonstration."
It is not clear that the pleas launched by the prime minister the day before yesterday, which is not without a hidden hope, will find their way to the ears and minds while we are involved in divisions and conflicts, despite the general knowledge that it is not possible to help he who declines to help himself, and despite the fact that this simple intuitive logic poses true Lebanese questions stemming from Paris-2, including, for example:
Considering all of this, we are not exaggerating if we say that Al-Hariri seems as the Diogenes of his time but with two lanterns: a lantern for searching for support and backing to the "Paris-2 Demonstration", to try to save the international situation; and a lantern for betting on what's left of sense and sensibility internally in a way that "gives the country a chance" and affirms that we do have trust in ourselves, in our country and in our direction before we ask others to do the same.
He seemed, with a great deal of symbolism that is understood by the Lebanese, like the driver of an ambulance carrying the bleeding injured, which is the financial situation, and is trying to reach the hospital to save him, but it runs around amidst alleys and squares where shelling, sniper fire and ambushes never stop, as has been the case!
"Haarts" expected yesterday that Ariel Sharon will be forced to make a decision to advance the election date in the event of the refusal of the National Unity Bloc -"Israel, Our Home" led by Ivigdor Lieberman to join the narrow government that he intends to form.
In this case, the elections will be held within 90 days.
The unity government gave Sharon national and international legitimacy.
In the beginning, he followed a policy of self-restraint, and waited for his partners from the left patiently after he joined them in re-occupying the territories.
He became like one of the family in Washington.
Then, the authority won, or so it believes.
This talk may be vague in a country that has gotten used to confusing the state and those holding on to it.
And if more than one question is posed on how were they assigned and who assigned them, they were not in any case commissioned to mismanage it.  Otherwise, they would have been suspected of abusing authority, which is a crime punishable by law.
The scenario is inspired directly by the experiences of totalitarianism around us: it starts by declaring martial laws on beliefs, which allows the making of a traitor out of anyone who thinks outside the flock, under the pretext that the region is going through a "critical period".  Then, it makes up non-present dangers, first, by attributing premeditated intentions to members of the opposition, and second, by instigating reactions to these presumed intentions by an outspoken minority for whom all platforms have been opened.
Perhaps then, the protective authority will be content with it as a permanent agent for it, and an easy tool for its wishes.

American Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld expected a quick collapse of the Islamic regime in Iran by way of an overthrow by the people or under the impact of its self-inflicted difficulties and internal divisions.
Rumsfeld was indirectly responding to his Iranian counterpart, Admiral Ali Shamkhani, who said on Wednesday that Iran must be ready to be the next target of an American attack after Iraq.
Despite the discontent that is prevalent among the people, the Iranian regime does not seem threatened because "the security forces easily control dissidents, and it does not seem that people are not ready to take to the streets. Also, no individual who has what it takes in influence, prestige and ability to move a wide cross-section of the people, has emerged."

The Australian Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer, and his British counterpart, Jack Straw, pledged at the end of talks in London to cooperate in exerting maximum efforts to bring those who carried out the Bali attack to justice.

At the Economic-Educational Dialogue conducted with him yesterday at the International College, President Rafiq Al-Hariri was asked for his opinion on not granting a license for demonstration yesterday and for his opinion on the closure of "M.T.V." regardless of the legal system. He responded, "The legal system cannot be disregarded because this issue is judicial, and I never recommend to encourage the executive branch to interfere in judicial affairs, even if it turned out that this matter may have at a certain stage positive implications. If the executive branch gets used to this, that will pose a grave danger on social stability in the country.
This is possible, but it is part of the political action in the country.
There are tens of media outlets, such as newspapers, radio stations and speeches, via which they can express their opinion.
There are some suggestions that question the country as a whole and its future.
Helou: Dividing Christians Dangerous, Balance Missing Internally; Helou
Following the national anthem, there were speeches by Rhonda Al-Awar, the Movement's President Wadi Hanna and the Mayor of Ain Al-Jdida, Elie Matta, on behalf of Al-Noqta mayors.
He bet in the year 1993 on peace, which was then on the table, and on that basis, openness, construction and extravagance began (...). But in the year 1994, it became evident that there was no peace, and my sharp dispute with him began.
There are united factions, which I respect and congratulate them for, but on the other hand, there's the Christian faction, which has never been as divided as it is today and that is the impending danger because there is a missing balance internally. Lets speak frankly; the Sunnis have a leader and they are united. They maybe influenced by the Syrian, but at any rate, they are united on their demands.
Even if we are a political force?
Lahoud Receives Helou, Karam, Al-Jisir; Reviews Lebanese-Syrian Committees' Work
Karam indicated that he also discussed with President Lahoud the results of the on-going contacts following his nomination for the position of Director-General of the World Health Organization, which set the election date for next January, and Arab and world reactions to this nomination. Karam thanked the president of the republic for "the interest shown by the Lebanese state, at his direction, to support his nomination, and for the efforts exerted by the Lebanese officials to enable Lebanon to reach this important position, due to its positive ramifications."
The meeting reviewed a number of subjects that are of interest to judges and the Ministry of Justice and setting in motion the wheel of progress in courts.
Representative Mohammad Qabbani, who presented to him a number of topics relating to the Committee's work, in addition to issues of interest to the City of Beirut.
Finally, I reminded his Excellency, the President, of his promise for needed developmental projects when he graciously visited Akkar.  His Excellency still stands by his promises and hopes for the best with the people of the deprived regions, which are in his Excellency's conscience and in the realm of his interest."
Following the Syrian and Lebanese anthems, the Chairman of the Organizing Committee, Hassan Abdel Raheem Murad, delivered an address in which he said: "We see the activities that push to return the country to the environments of convulsion and division, and which come in line with what the Zionist enemy wants for the weakening of Lebanon, its role and will; we see them as an attempt to tarnish the reputation of Lebanon, its national unity, its demonstration of power and international presence that started after the Francophone Summit, and as an attempt to stagger the economic and financial recovery plans."
He called attention to Israeli actions against the Palestinian people and the assault on Iraq and said that "the Israeli threats complete the American blackmail campaigns launched against Lebanon, Syria and more than one Arab country for the purpose of paralyzing any trend that contradicts with the objectives of such an alliance, which brilliantly practices state terrorism.
In conclusion, Minister Murad spoke and said: "We realize perfectly the American-Zionist reasons behind pressuring Syria. She has been for more than two decades almost alone in the battle of resistance, insisting on a just peace that preserves Arab rights and maintains Arab dignity. She has been employing all of her political and military energies in serving this legitimate objective and stands by Lebanon in all of its decisive junctions, which necessitated a blood sacrifice sometimes (...) Because America and Zionism are working to reformulate the entire Arab reality, states and trends, objectives and priorities, and because Syria says, with a full mouth, no to all of these plans and projects, since the Al-Diffreswar's breach in the year 1973, passing by the Camp David Agreements, the Wadi Araba Accords, the Oslo Accords, and arriving at the sanctions against Iraq, cutting food off of its people and mobilizing all forces to strike it, the Zionist America wants to silence this voice because it is the voice of Arab right, the voice of the Arab homeland and the voice of the Arab Nation, and she does not recognize for all Arabs as a whole any right, homeland or nation.
He was accompanied in his tour by the President of "Caritas Lebanon", Father Ellie Madhi.
In Marjiyoon ("Al-Nahar"), McCarrick visited the Metropolit of the Roman Orthodox, Bishop Elias Al-Kfouri, at the Al-Mutraniyeh House, then visited the Bishop of the Roman Catholic Orthodox, Antoine Hayek; the community Bishop of Sidon and Sour, Johanna Haddad; the Bishop of the Maronites Maroun Sadder; and Priest Fouad Antoine.
A Shiite Council's statement said "that viewpoints were identical in regards to all religions belonging to the one religion of the Prophet Ibrahim which encompasses all factions, sects and religions, and that all must follow the legacy of the father of the prophets, Ibrahim."
From "Al-Nahar" correspondent in Al-Diman and Basharri that the Archbishop of Washington made a pilgrimage visit to the holy sites of Wadi Qanubeen.
Then he wrote in the honor book at the museum the following words: "Prophet Jibran is alive with his works and sayings, and this magnificent site is distinct for reflection and prayers."
The Executive Council of the Maronite League noted that "the general political situation prevailing now indicates that the country is standing at a dead end as a result of growing resentment and charged atmospheres reflected by the media, further exacerbated by what comes out of the official media, including the loose talk from those who are supposed to be speaking on behalf of the government of all of Lebanon."
He contended that what is needed today is to raise the level of the work of the opposition in principle and in political performance, where it acquires an inclusive national character with its structure and demands that embodies the Lebanese entity, and affirmed that the form of opposition has many faces, depending on relevant conditions and circumstances.  What is needed is the use of proper and successful avenues for it, contending that the chances for success for the opposing line will not be available unless the opposition were national.
This resentment touched on dangerous focal points, and these atmospheres approached the red lines through the creation of radical climates and chapters from the past which the Lebanese had agreed to leave behind for good. All of this is going on at inappropriate time for the region.
Committees' Sessions Next Week; Eido Between Praising, Accusing "Al-Qornat"; Andre Lahoud Expresses Satisfaction for Government Decision
* Education, High Education and Culture Committee meets at ten before noon on Tuesday to discuss the decision made by the Director-General of the National Fund for Social Security to discontinue health grants and family compensations for working women's children.
Representative Walid Eido paused at "the wise action by the Qornat Shahwan's Gathering" as far as adhering to the Minister of Interior's decision is concerned.
In a statement yesterday evening, she thought that this decision "comes naturally because it is the right of the woman, who satisfies the conditions, to take advantage of the benefits that had before, especially in the current economic conditions, not to mention that it goes in tandem with the need to respect the principles of not discriminating between a man and a woman."
The situation in the south of Lebanon is troubling and potentially explosive at any moment.
He added: His country's government is closely monitoring Israeli diplomatic activities, and it has information that the Israeli leaks on the advanced missiles that "Hezbollah" owns and their capability to strike deep Israeli civilian targets are intended by the Israeli leadership to justify the aggression Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is preparing for, as he has ordered the command of army's command to make plans to strike vital targets in the Lebanese depth under the cover of striking the party's positions.
He cited, as an example, that Israel did not file any complaint against Lebanon to the United Nations over the Al-Wazzani's waters, and she is awaiting - as is Secretary-General Kofi Anan - the results of the quiet American efforts that are being made with the two countries.
He said that any aggression being planned by Sharon against Lebanon would not be a picnic.
Nisnas' comments came during the convening of the General Commission yesterday afternoon at the council's headquarters to discuss a draft.
He said "that the country went through very tough times, but it continued to move on and endure in the face of the big challenges it confronted.

To expand the knowledge of participants in designing and building a security system for information systems, and fostering their awareness of the importance of installing a coherent system internally for information systems and implementing it with the required efficiency through conducting a practical simulation of oversight and scrutiny at banks, and discussing live examples of the challenges that face banks with the participants for the purpose of giving them the opportunity to exchange experiences among themselves.
Two exhibits of a Lebanese artist and an Italian artist are at two showrooms in Beirut.
Each, in his own style, comes up with innovations that went into the history of modern art, and we do not think that anyone is unaware of the source of such visuals, symbols and signals, whether they were experimental, decorative or technically stylish.
But who cares?
A great opportunity looms when she moves from painting to carving and as she forgets everything that is outside the idea she is putting together through memories, consequences, resemblances and overlaps, achieving the composition with size, color and tools, and building an exceptional site that is outside the control of the mind or the power of feelings, surpassing the familiar and the logical.
Trees, houses, plants, skies, birds and many symbols, spread over poetic areas that carry bright colors, reminding of familiar sceneries and images in our country.
Such things, even the small ones of them, disguise under their insignificant and fast-corrupted surface a vital power that is maintained in the secret of their silence."
The Legal and Judicial Information Center at the Ministry of Justice reported that the legal system resolved 120 thousand and 671 cases in a period of one year and nine months, specifically from 1/1/2001 to 30/9/2002.

However, the highest rate of filed complaint was recorded in the Mount Lebanon Governance, due to its area and number of residents, reaching 51 thousand and 826 complaints, then Beirut at 31 thousand 79 complaints, then the north at 24 thousand 424 complaints, the Al-Bikaa at 18 thousand 496 complaints, the south at 12 thousand 98 complaints, and finally Al-Nabatia at 6 thousand 184 complaints.
In Beirut, Inquiry Judge Shawqi Al-Hajjar contended in a ruling he issued that the action of two Syrian defendants, one of whom has been detained for the crime of stealing and forging two checks, a crime punishable by Article 636 of the Penal Code, in addition to Article 471 of it with regards to the forgery part.
"The plaintiff is a businessman who owns current bank accounts at various banks operating in Lebanon, and he also owns a building of which one section was kept for his office. He was employing the defendant Zahir H. S. for three years as a guard for this building.
They were able via this method to cash a check for the amount of four-hundred American dollars and another for the amount of four-thousand and four hundred American dollars, in addition to stealing a checkbook containing five checks that were signed by forgery and written out for the amount of five-thousand American dollars a check, until the matter was discovered after defendant Baha S. tried to cash a check for the amount of fifteen-thousand and seven hundred American dollars. The defendant's brother was consequently contacted, and he produced a check written out to himself from the account of the plaintiff for the amount of fifteen-thousand and seven hundred American dollars.
The chairman of the session and member of the Executive Committee of the National Action Seminar, Dr. Michel Juha, welcomed the attendees and introduced the book and the author. "The book tackles the Mid-East issue with study and examination of all of its aspects. It is a collection of 34 articles that the book encompassed between its two covers, and which were published in local and Arab newspapers and magazines.
He thought that the worsening of the Arab situation is tied to several factors, the most obvious of which are the absence of democracy and the state of division and scatter.
Is betting on a regional Arab system still valid despite the continuation of Arab infighting?
He praised the call to guide the martyred missions since "no one who is in more need for advice than the resistance and by someone who fundamentally believes in the greatness of resistance and its martyred spirit."
Visiting that compound in the Qobba region is like entering some of Africa's jungles, where civilization has not reached yet.
And if I used to reject the saying that the Lebanese University is the university of the poor, I now have the proof of the truthfulness of that saying since no one, who is materially able, can live in that swamp of water, dirt and humidity, or better put, the molding and the cracked walls.
Yesterday, foreigners were at the College of Sciences looking around at the unbelievable, and one of them did not believe it when he asked to go to the bathroom and was told: You have to walk 500 meters to the administration building and use the professors' bathroom, since the building where the seminar is being held does not have bathrooms.
The President of the University says that there is no money available to work on the restoration, which seems difficult, since ownership belongs to the French state.
Second: How can the university president, the dean of the college and the department chairman accept the excuse of the lack of money in the treasury, and how does the Students League keep silent about humiliating students while its voice rises for any demand of its own?
South American National Championships, Brazil: Botafogo's Captain Stirs Controversy

The Dar Al-Mashreq published "The Spiritual Commandments Collection" by the spiritual Sheikh Johanna Al-Daliati, translated from Syriac and introduced by Jesuit Father Selim Dakkash, after "The Spiritual Messages Collection" was published for Al-Daliati himself, translated into Arabic and introduced by Father Dakkash in the year 1986.
He contends that this gap goes back to the adoption of Christianity by the West, which caused a violent reaction by the other Arab side who was comforted with his reaction by the fact that the Messiah is the son of our heritage and our East, and that his message is our message, affirming that this knowledge must remain a fundamental civil, cultural and human requisite to our existence and being as a unified society, and contending that "the magnificence of the painting is in its harmonious, coordinated and different colors" because the beauty of the universe does not come from the unity of diversity but rather from the diversity in unity.

"The Spiritual Commandments" by Spiritual Sheikh Johanna Al-Daliati
As for the "Al-Mayamer", plural for Maymar, it means a conversation, a study, a sermon, a defensive article or speech, and here it is a collection of spiritual commandments directed at the devout and discusses the satanic experiments a believer endures, and means to overcome them by pious exercise seeking the light of God's face.
"Let these tongues be silent from now on and all activities with unrealized amazement.
Kept silent in every life and my nature started departing.
Let he who covered a nakedness with the coat of his light hurry to your glory; my mind which was revealed and resolved by you to preach everything to me in secret and without cessation: Isn't this enjoyment enough for you in place of everything.
And from Commandment 17, repeated:
Why do you scream at him to come to your aid when you sleep, like someone who does not remember that whoever lives inside him is his keeper?
Emir of Kuwait: Our Youths Are Embezzling From Us; Price May Be Very Heavy

In Moscow, former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev announced that he supports the policy of Russian President Vladimir Putin in Chechnya and that it is impossible to hold a dialogue with the separatist leader, Aslan Maskhadov.
He added: "I used to think in the past that it is possible to negotiate with Maskhadov under some conditions, but now I think that it is not possible to hold a dialogue with him after the hostage crisis," in a reference to the holding of hostages by a group of Chechen kidnappers at the end of October in Moscow.

In the world of communications today, one can follow the events in various parts of the world and progressively get involved with their details without having difficulty in coming up with inferences and lessons.
- The fatwa of the State of Zamfara in northern Nigeria to shed the blood of Isioma Daniel, the author of an article on the Miss World competition which said that the Prophet would have married one of the contestants, led to riots that killed 250 people.

There's a lesson in what researcher Mohammad Arcon said.
When he was yelled at by one of those present, he recited the following two verses:
They will be your ruler, oh Ruler of the Faithful.
We hope this talk will instill some smiling after a thousand years.
Then, there is no purpose for all that is written and said about the United States and her policy.
But who is Bob Woodward?
As part of his preparation for this book, Woodward conducted an interview with Bush last August 20 that depicted a live portrait of the personality of Bush, who sits on the world's throne and is heading to govern for two terms, perhaps because of our "good luck" in this region.
But these confessions take a different form when the conversation reaches the point of saying: "America occupies a unique position.
In comparison with the diminishing French and Russian passions on the issue of Iraq, Bush's theory seems to be on target so far! It is not enough for Bush to contradict his father, who was making fun of the "vision" or "the meaning of vision;" not only he presents himself as a "visionary" but also as a strategic thinker: "I believe that my mission is to be ahead of the moment, and that the president must be a strategic thinker."
But we do not know how can he after that be sure that his post September 11 mission is to maintain America's superiority: "My mission is to make sure that the sword is iron and always sharp!"
A report published recently by the Londoner "Evening Standard" Newspaper revealed that hundreds of British patients who need human part transplants in their bodies travel to India to buy kidneys, corneas and even lungs from live donors, and this trade has flourished despite its illegality and despite the high rate of deaths that follow non-guaranteed surgical procedures that are performed secretly at low-standard hospitals and in the absence of adequate medical care.
The report also recounted that in Villivakkam, the crowded, dirty and infected suburb of the city of Madras, where residents live in utmost poverty and misery, one does not need a long time to find someone who had sold one of his kidneys.
She lifted part of the sari she was wearing to reveal a scar on her body to prove what she said.
Now I cannot work properly as I tire easily and need a lot of rest.
I wish I sold it years ago."
The report also cited a doctor of Indian descent whose name is Jurnael Sing and who lives in the British city of Coventry and who was banned in the middle of the past month to practice the profession of medicine for committing a serious violation of his professional conduct by encouraging this illegal trade, after a sixty-nine year old patient died following a surgical procedure, which was performed illegally in India, to transplant a kidney in his body.
Anti-Israel Committees Banned in Attempt to Tame Societies in Jordan
Political circles in the country are viewing this step as a new measure aimed at convincing the opposition not to impose its viewpoint in opposing normalization with Israel on the entire Jordanian society.
The Moslem Brothers, the main opposition force in Jordan, controls approximately half of them, and they vehemently opposes any normalization with Israel.
The anti-normalization committees published in December 2001 "a black list" with names of persons and companies dealing with the Hebrew State, which led to the arrest of eight society members for "belonging to an illegal organization."
Among the society members who were detained in the year 2001 was Ali Abu Sukkar, the Secretary-General of the Engineering Society, who was detained again in October, together with two other society members for the same charge they faced two years ago, which is the formation of an "illegal" group, hostile to normalization with Israel.
Reactions continued to the format approved by the Council of Ministers last Thursday regarding the cellular case.
He affirmed "that this deferral in collection assumes securing an asset insurance, because the companies will sell their inventories.
From here, securing the required guarantee for the collection bonds is assumed."
There was no need for the relationship with the two companies to have taken this coarse of dealing in the first place, as long as the state's share would have reached 40 or 50 percent of revenue.  It was also possible to have issued the third license for the cellular and we would have done away with the compensations that were allocated to the two companies or done away with arbitration.
And if the subject of arbitration and the issue of compensation were to incur us huge costs, this choice would have been wrong.
He responded: "If the collection of the 600 million dollars is revoked, the state would have committed a grave mistake."
He contended that "this is a step on the road to launch a serious process for the case of privatizing the cellular sector in a manner that serves state interests," indicating that the matter is contingent on the seriousness of implementation."
"Exempts Two Cellular Companies From Their Commitments"; Al-Hoss: Attacking My Government Does Not Shield Shortfalls of Council of Ministers' Decision
And although the above-mentioned government remained in power for eight months after that, the two collection orders were not executed."
The Judiciary Department at the Ministry of Justice responded with the appropriate legal defenses.
At this point, the two companies resorted to arbitration with the International Commerce Chamber in Paris, and the Minister of Communications rushed to consult with the State Consultative Council, demanding that the arbitration clauses in the two companies contracts be revoked, in contradiction with the wording of Legislation 218, dated 13/5/1993, which calls for implementing the cellular telephone project on the basis of self-financing, noting that the legislation did not take note of the arbitration option.
It would have been more useful for the Council of Ministers' sources, which issued the misleading statement, to question the current government's action with regards to the collection of the two bonds revenue, well over a year after the issuance of the State Consultative Council's decision, instead of questioning the former government's actions in the last seven months of its administration, in an period full of momentous events that witnessed the liberation and Parliamentary elections.
That includes the pledge not to issue additional bonds, which means exempting the two companies from their obligations toward the violations they committed during the year 2000, the year 2001, and nine months of the year 2002.
Lahoud Reviews With Al-Hariri Expediting Privatization; Chirac: We Wanted Paris-2 To Support Courageous Reforms; Emirati President; Iranian President; Telegrams
Chirac explained that he wanted through his country's organization of the Paris-2 Conference to "affirm the French support for the economic reforms program that the Lebanese authorities are in the process of implementing courageously."
Lahoud had also received more congratulatory telegrams for the independence anniversary from Arab and foreign countries leaders.
In a telegram on the occasion, the Iranian President, Mohammad Khatami, said:
We ask God Almighty for health and happiness for your Excellency, for the state, and for the honorable Lebanese people more success and achievements."
The gathering issued the following statement yesterday: "In the face of the continuation of the Zionist enemy's criminal practices and its excesses in shedding the blood of our people in Palestine, especially during the month of Ramadan, which is a month of worship when man's will and dignity are supposed to be respected and he is given the opportunity to perform his religious duties toward his God, his community and himself at all levels.  Nevertheless, none of that has happened, and, on the contrary, the criminal enemy escalated the killing, destruction, siege, and imposing hunger on people and curfews.
- Third: On the International Day of Jerusalem, which was celebrated (the day before) yesterday, Friday, throughout the countries of the world, we cannot help but remind the world, as peoples, governments and regimes, that the City of Jerusalem must be liberated from the occupation that is holding it like a nightmare, and therefore, the religious holy shrines cannot under any conditions remain captive and humiliated.
Consequently, everyone must know that as long as Jerusalem is captive and its people are bleeding, no kind of peace will spread, neither in the region nor anywhere else in the world. Considering that Jerusalem represents the symbol for followers of all religions in the Arab World and elsewhere.
Because water is a strategic security in the region, the first two items on the legislative session agenda of the Parliament tomorrow deal with two draft legislations for distributing the waters of the Al-Aassi River between Lebanon and Syria, the first being included in Decree Number 5976 that was signed in Damascus on 20/9/1994, and other in Decree Number 8797, which is an appendix to the first agreement for water distribution, approved by the Supreme

He said in an interview with the "Lebanese Communication Corporation" yesterday:
And instead of the president of the republic being a monitor of the institutions, he started to become a partner.
Rafiq Al-Hariri was repeatedly appointed more than once, as well as Nabih Berri and five to six ministers, to the president of the republic.
If this is a model for privatization, then it is a disaster.
He added: "The demand of the Parliament Speaker, Nabih Berri, for a change in government is on target because that will be in the interest of the Lebanese.
State Minister Bishara Murhij described the Paris-2 Conference as "a big achievement and a golden opportunity for the government to benefit from loans in order to stimulate projects on the one side and maintain currency stability on the other, and to work to lower the interest rate to spur investment and expand the production base."
Therefore, the privatization process has an integrated legal recourse that begins with the minister then the Council of Ministers, accompanied by the Working Council for Privatization and the Parliament, and consequently, there is a legal control in this process."
He also contended that "the purpose of changing the government is merely replacing some names with other names because of some personal issues and settlements," and explained "that the problem of the opposing Christian side is not with Nasser Qandeel, but he ought to resolve his differences with the president of the republic, the disagreement point of which is focused on the Syrian presence in Lebanon, through dialogue."
The Alliance, which includes Representatives Mohammad Al-Safadi, Mohammad Kabbarah and Maurice Fadhel, held a meeting in which it discussed the political situation and Tripoli's affairs, and issued the following statement:

He stressed "the importance of political reform, consolidating the judiciary and keeping it above any blemish."
Al-Safadi was speaking at a ceremony in Tripoli that was organized by the "Independent Academic Alliance."
1- The position of the Minister of Communications on the issue of arbitration is to insist on respecting the decision of the State Consultative Council's decision and the judicial rulings, unlike what the prime minister described the decision as "heresy" in an interview on the "National Communications Network" on August 5, 2001, with reporter Said Ghareeb, and which has weakened the negotiating position of the state.
- The lowering of the classification conditions, laid out at first by the British Bank, to become detailed, as per Liban Ciel's standards.

Zahla - "Al-Nahar":
(...) Our commitment to our program for reform and revival makes us capable of gaining confidence in our selves and gaining the confidence of the world in us, as we had witnessed at the Paris-2 Conference, which was an important junction that contributed and still contributes to finding an unprecedented opportunity that must be capitalized."
The attendees' political positions also reflected a distinct compassion on their part, especially by France and President Jacque Chirac specifically, with our causes and rights, and also by all of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, led by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."
Reviving the country, consolidating stability and development, and taking on the responsibility of the next stage, is the responsibility of all, because it will be a real challenge to the resolve, will, determination and sacrifices of the Lebanese, and which, no matter how great they seem, they are much smaller than the dangers that will result from not taking them on.
The sirens of fire trucks were breaking the tranquility, speeding towards fires that were still burning intently at one of the city's locations.
Clashes had occurred during the demonstrations and the number of victims was not known, but it seems like police casualties were heavy in the afternoon before the army came in.

A salute from those who loved seeing it emanates from the whiteness of the universe that keeps them in a aura of hopes.
Let me see you with the slowness of those enduring tenderness, gazing at the venues of adhering to yearning and those who settled in the core and endlessness of your heart.
Let me reap from the hills crowns that will ease your kneeling jasmines away from its suns with your covers, flowering today with their teary eyes.
Drown me with an hour of happiness of the comers into the night, flourishing the goers; hold me into the sight of the two dawns, what crying is wrapping me whenever I saw the lightning.
Tehran-Washington from the Inside Is Different From It on the Outside
The most important speculation in explaining not detaining Yazdi suggests that the latter returned as part of a "deal" carrying an American message to the authority in Iran related to bilateral relations.
For after the controversy was about establishing dialogue or not, the principle of dialogue and "a sort of relations" has become acceptable.
This is what was said by one of the moderate conservative symbols Muhammad Jawadd Larijani without being objected to by anyone in the circles of conservatives, even those of them who are severe, while former president Hashimi Rafsinjani found his chance to express a position clearer than before about the relationship with Washington, starting with the dialogue with it.
The talk now is about forming a parliamentary committee for dialogue with American parliamentarians who previously showed their willingness for dialogue.

"I read the speech of Mr. Mohammad Amin Tabbara (Wednesday, May 29th), which listed two linked topics by the same writer that included some of the reasons behind the decline of the public transport sector, proposing 'the privatization of this sector, including all of its machines and drivers and all those working in it, because the responsibility does not lie with the state only, but also with those who manage this sector'. I wished that the proposal of Mr. Tabbara would find listening ears with officials, so that they would start to implement it after the derogatory state this official sector has reached. "

Given this reality, a serious plan must be drawn up by the Ministry of Public Works, or any other official organization, to refurbish the buildings in view of the importance of this work on more than one level, bearing in mind that, in light of the deteriorating financial situation of the exchequer, it will save tens of millions of lira as an alternative to the buildings presently occupied by official organizations, and reduce the burden on the citizen, who spends his day moving from one building to another to complete his business.

True, they are many and big, but there is no magic button that will solve Lebanon's economic problems with one click.
In other words, giving the opportunity to "Paris-2 Demonstration" to take place in atmospheres that convince the participants in it that the Lebanese deserve support and help.
And how could it bolster confidence in Lebanon and its economic conditions, which deserve support because they possess the elements of health and prosperity, while it kills the last token of confidence in the possibility of internally arriving at what will restore power to national unity, the only base of health and prosperity.
There is no need to list what he has done so far in preparation for Paris-2 and what preceded it, will accompany and follow it, considering that Al-Hariri, in his recent talk, purposefully contradicted the prevailing talk that Paris-2 is the last chance for a cure, and, if it fails, it means disaster. He said that the above-mentioned conference represents a cornerstone in curing Lebanon's financial problems, but it is not the only corner, in a reference to the deficit-reduction programs, spending curbs and revenue boosting, which provided in two years "useful support for the situation, while he" was practically and technically preparing for making the Paris-2 Conference successful.

No, it is the state that it won over.
The state is my own and yours, but it is certainly not exclusive to those who promote its policy, no matter how high they rise.
For that, it is sufficient to review the published statements and press interviews of government officials and representatives who are loyal (to whom?), not to mention the gossip of "informed sources", which seemed to have been informed just about everything except about what is happening in the world, not to forget the foolish "security sources".

He described what had happen to him, saying that he was alone watching an American football game between the Baltimor Ravens and the Miami Dolphins when "I fell to the floor ...

Those in good health are more likely to suffer from this type of loss of consciousness because they have a lower blood pressure and heart rate than others.

The new government comprises 27 ministers, including the Prime Minister, who has retained the defense portfolio, and seven new ministers only two of whom have previously occupied ministerial positions.
In the new government the Prime Minister has no deputy Prime Ministers, whereas in the previous government he had three. Two remain in the new team: Minister of Justice Faris Al-Nabulsi and Minister of National Economy Mahmoud Al-Hulaiqa. First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior, Awad Khalifat, is out of the government to be succeeded at Ministry by its Secretary - General Qaftan Al-Majali.
Observers believe that the reforming of the government under Abu Al-Ragheb's leadership and its being tasked to conduct the general elections, is intended to contain popular frustrations created by the suffocating living conditions of Jordanians in the absence of the Chamber of Deputies, disbanded since last June and the passing of a collection of temporary laws ridiculed by the opposition, which has accused the government of causing the democratic process to disappear and liquidate its institutions.
The political basis of the coup was to put an end to Nawaz Al-Sharif's concessions in the face of American and Indian pressures at the time.
The rest of the story is not hard to guess: Widespread arrests in the ranks of Kashmiri and Islamist activists and the targeting of Islamic schools along a path that leads, for the first time since Pakistan was founded, to an examination of the curriculum of those schools in the name of unifying the government educational system. It is the logic of the state and its supreme interests that leads us to the point where it is no longer possible for it to coexist with statelets and private armies, no matter how great their popular, historical, political or moral legitimacy.
That is what is important.

Either the state, the logic of the state, the unity of the country and its place in the international community, or a continuation of double standards and pretending to be clever towards an international situation which has clearly tired of the "clever" Lebanese who now exaggerate their own significance.
Paris - Ali Hamada
The question being asked is this: Would reaching an agreement in negotiations conducted on the Syrian and Lebanese tract in isolation from talks undertaken on the Palestinian front complicate the process of arriving at a comprehensive peace? Or would it simplify it, given that negotiations have succeeded in bringing about individual solutions, as was the case with Camp David, which resulted in an agreement between Egypt and Israel, the Israeli-Palestinian talks which produced Oslo and the Israeli-Jordanian talks which led to the Wadi Araba agreement. At the same time negotiations have sometimes stumbled on the Syrian and Lebanese tracts and sometimes stopped altogether, on account of Israel failing to implement the agreements made between it and the Palestinians Authority, thereby failing to reach a peace agreement between them which would allow a move to negotiations on the Syrian and Palestinian fronts and bring about a comprehensive peace in the region?
And then there are those who say that there can be no comprehensive peace in the region unless it is achieved on the Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese tracts and that fragmenting solutions may achieve temporary security or truce on the Lebanese and Syrian borders with Israel, but it cannot achieve a comprehensive peace and permanent and lasting security.
In addition, the problem of Palestinian refugees, should it continue without solution, would make it difficult for Lebanon and Syria to sign a peace agreement with Israel. It is not sufficient for Israeli forces to withdraw from the Shabaa Farms and the Golan or for there to be an exchange of prisoners and detainees to achieve peace unless the refugee problem, which represents a time bomb for Lebanon more so than other host Arab nations, is also solved because their presence in Lebanon has a political aspect: they are permitted to bear arms to defend their cause and their right to return to their homes.

This is how the new Director General of Electricity chose to start his impossible tasks by shedding light on this gloomy situation, so that no-one will later say, "The responsibility lies wholly with the Department." For the Department has just been handed a grounded cow, which the knives are working to bone, or at least those bones that remain.
For, ultimately, they make unjustified payments with the people's money to an institution hemorrhaging, consumed by extravagance, waste, negligence and inadequacy, to the extent that it has not the courage to collect its dues.
We know that corruption, regional strength, personal grip and the long arms that steal, plunder and forge will certainly prevent the introduction of a fair charge. The company does not who steal from its lines and who does not and how can we collect, and on what basis, from a feudal arrangement which has no meters? We are certain that following up the matter of collection to its logical conclusion is tantamount to cutting off someone's livelihood and the consequences thereof. The evidence for this lies in the words of the Chairman of the Public Works and Transport Committee, Deputy Al-Sidiq Muhammad Qabbani, yesterday, about the company being asked to impose a genuine charge by resorting to the security forces, for it was said in the past that these forces tarried and the company was asked to draft a report to demonstrate this but the report never arrived. For all of the above we urge the Minister of Finance not to pay one piastre unless there is a balanced plan to prevent loss and waste.
And what was the result?

This Syrian refusal to enter into a debate about the Shabaa Farms that could be revived does not stem from Damascus renouncing its adherence to the statement on the Lebanese identity of the Shabaa Farms. Nor, indeed, does it stem from a renunciation of its retention of resistance as a vital card until the peace talks resume and conclude, albeit that this card is no longer as effective as it was in the past. In fact, according to diplomatic sources, the Syrian refusal to enter into debate is based on a whole raft of dues and considerations, at the forefront of which are:
The very least that is required of it is to participate in the efforts to combat terrorism, notwithstanding the fact that its understanding of the word may differ from that of the international organization, which it may subsequently attempt to amend, but it is certainly compelled to abide by its rules as long as it remains an active member of the organization.
Former American ambassador to Syria Edward Djerejian did not fail to point out the large number of American congressional delegations visiting Syria at this time, notwithstanding the fact that they are also visiting other Arab states.
Two delegations from the American Congress visited Damascus last week.  Today a delegation headed by the Democratic leader in the House Richard Gephardt, and next Sunday the American ambassador to the United Nations John Negroponte is to visit.
It is as if Lebanon has not suffered enough abuse that it should turn the issue of its hosting the Arab Summit into a point of disagreement requiring the Secretary-General of the Arab League, Amr Musa, to tour several states to resolve the issue and settle, once and for all, the matter of the venue. Even the attempts to put right the mistake appear fragmented, weak and unconvincing.
Whilst the Prime Minister stresses that the Council of Ministers alone formulates Lebanon's political stance.
And this is what is required, especially if the real concern of the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies is the fear of the pressures that Washington might bring to bear on the Arabs to put an end to the resistance, whether in Palestine or in Lebanon.
Such a position could be extracted from the Arab leaders at a summit that brought them together in Lebanon, provided that the Lebanese position was unified, convincing and, above all else, governed by reason.  By contrast, the fragmentation that prevails today makes this almost impossible, no matter where the summit is held.
This has not been easy for Musharraf because fundamentalist Islamic currents have been active in his country for some time and they are capable of stirring up the streets of Pakistan as and when they want, and because Afghanistan's former rulers quickly embraced these currents with the aim of deploying them in the struggle for Kashmir with India and to encourage the Taliban movement, which it conceived and assisted, to take control of Afghanistan with the aim of deploying it in the same struggle.
It would also have created the right conditions for India to settles it complex and long-standing accounts with Pakistan.
And then the preliminary results of the war against the Taliban movement and Al-Qaeda became apparent, the most prominent of which were the removal of Taliban rule and the break up of Al-Qaeda, and confirmed that he had made the right choice.
Many who follow the conditions in this region of the world, the international political conditions in particular, cannot stop themselves from saying in response that a meeting of interests took place between Washington, New Delhi and Islamabad on a number of issues over this last period.
It is also possible by being generous with any aid required by Pakistan.

And this happened after Lebanon, following Speaker Birri's "personal" shock which led to chaos that knew no bounds, appeared to be divided on the matter of the summit, as if it was both in need of the summit and yet have no need for it, until the balance of the scales were tipped one way...
And Amr Musa's smile, which yesterday seemed like the full moon, expressed more than just pride: the Arab determination to confront the bitter, if not sick and mangled, reality.
The new item is that the "Lebanese Council of Ministers is alone responsible for formulating Lebanon's political positions", according to what Mr. Musa heard from President Al-Hariri as he dotted the I's and crossed the T's.
For many years Lebanon received messengers and delegates, including the carrier pigeon.
So we can all breathe a sigh of relief.
Israeli intercepted the vessel at 500 km distance from the Israeli coast on the Red Sea.
First, from where did Israeli obtain the authorization to intercept shipping outside of its regional waters, at a distance of 500 km from its coast?
Secondly, what crazy Arab would try to send a ship loaded with weapons to Palestine when it is known by everyone that all Palestine's coasts fall under direct Israeli control?
Is there anyone who can dismiss the possibility that this tale has been spun from the ideas of Israeli intelligence, Mossad?
Or is America determined not to give to others what it wants for itself?
And no matter how much Palestinian weaponry develops it will never reach the same level as that of Israel.
This presupposes the absolute solidarity of all Arabs with the Intifada, with massive demonstrations, widespread media campaigns and a comprehensive and total pan-Arab embargo against Israel, from the ocean to the Gulf.
If the Arab peoples are currently anaesthetized or suppressed, then day must follow this night.
Doesn't America know that this stance only supports terrorism, the terrorism of the state of Israel, whilst the war on terror spreads all over the globe?
The Pakistani government responded by saying that it was awaiting the withdrawal of Indian forces to reduce tension, but it went on detaining a number of extremists.
He was asked about the dangers of either party using the nuclear bomb in the event of a new deterioration in relations between the two countries. He responded, "No sane person can dare even to think about the use of nuclear weapons." He stressed that the nuclear weapons were "only a means of defense".
Another official in the government denied that extremists had launched an attack, saying only that a solider had opened fire on his colleagues.
He said that Indian forces deployed along the length of the border had forced Pakistan to keep a necessary number of troops along the border between the two countries to ensure its own security, and that their measures had increased tension between the two neighboring countries.
He said that the time had come for an "honorable and lasting solution" to the Kashmir dispute, calling for tripartite negotiations between India, Pakistan and Kashmiris on this issue.
It expressed a desire to commence tripartite negotiations between India, Pakistan and the Kashmiris.

Subhani invited Karam to participate in an Islamic Conference in Tehran from 29 to 30 January under the title "The International Conference for Media in the Islamic World in Support of the Intifada".
On the basis of these considerations, we stress our lasting empathy and cooperation with the Islamic Republic of Iran. I am certain that this conference will continue the previous successes that we have come to expect from the Islamic Republic of Iran."
There can be no doubt that Israel has received a harsh blow from the resistance in Lebanon.
Karam responded, "The words that I have heard, in terms of their content, depth and what they mean for fraternal relations between the two countries, peoples and leaderships and for constructive, courageous and sincere cooperation, confirm the determination to root out oppression and tyranny suffered by Lebanon and the Palestinians as a result of Israeli intransigence.
I thank you for your visit, what you have said and your invitation. I confirm that our cooperation will continue and increase in connection with joint humanitarian and truth and justice issues."
Jan Ghanim, aged 57, was a good friend even to his political opponents. He was the most flexible of his contemporaries in the Kataib and the "Forces", and more recently in the Al-Waad Party, even at the height of the political confusion in 1992 when he stood for election and won on the votes of those other than his own supporters, who boycotted the elections. The same happened during the elections of 1996.
Jan's name was most obvious during the war with the establishment of the four party security committee, in which his name was a permanent fixture as representative of the "Forces". He accompanied the two representatives of "Amal", (Deputy) Ayub Hamid and Ahmad Baalbaki, and the two representatives of the Progressive Socialist Party, (Deputy) Akram Shahib and Said Al-Dawi.
But the tripartite agreement did not continue. A dispute arose between the Director of the Executive Authority of the "Forces" and the Chief of Staff Samir Jaajaa. Jaajaa led the uprising against Habiqah on 15 January 1986, which resulted in his victory and in Habiqah being forced to leave Lebanon for Paris accompanied by Ghanim and a number of the Executive Authority staff, and from there to Damascus and Zahlah until 1990, when he returned to Beirut. His return coincided with the beginning of implementation of the Taif Accord, the removal of the military wing of the "Forces" and the work to found the Al-Waad Party.
* Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Nabih Birri and members of the Chamber lamented the death of former Deputy Ghanim. Prayers will be said for the repose of his soul at 2 pm today in the Al-Mukhallis Church in his hometown of Hamana.
He was one of the Al-Kataib Party leaders and representative of the "Lebanese Forces" in the security committee during the war. His priority was a ceasefire, the liberation of prisoners and tending to the wounds.
He was unsuccessful in reaching the Chamber of Deputies in the last elections.
Official "Frown" at Musa's Attempts to Delay Confirming Summit Venue.
They noted that, during a press conference at the hotel following his meeting with Minister of Culture Ghassan Salamah, he had been careful to refer to the increased number of countries who had informed him orally that "they had no objection to holding the summit in Cairo and not in Beirut".
They noted that Al-Hariri's statement had greater detail than that issued from Baabda and focused on the point that the Lebanese Council of Ministers "alone was responsible for formulating Lebanon's political positions".
They indicated that Al-Hariri's statement had not surprised Musa given that contacts had been held with him as to its contents.
There are no exceptions and the security forces, including the army, the internal security forces, general security and the state security service, will implement these measures with the involvement of land, sea and air forces.
They noted that Musa had increased the number of his statements since arriving. On the first day he had given two statements and a press talk. On the second day he had given four statements, containing some contradictions.
Discussion also dealt with topics requiring decisions from the Council of Ministers to facilitate the work of the Ministry and quicken the pace of privatization.
Salamah said that he had thanked Lahud for the trust he had placed in him and had submitted to him the contacts made by the Lebanese delegation at the conference in preparation for the next Francophone conference.
The President of the Republic sent a telegram of congratulation to the Amir of Kuwait following his return to Kuwait and his recovery from a health indisposition.
In addition, President Lahud received the Canadian Ambassador in Lebanon, Haigh Sarafyan, who explained that he had reviewed with the President of the Republic bilateral relations between Lebanon and Canada and ways of developing them by strengthening contacts between officials of the two countries at the highest level.
President Lahud otherwise received greeting cards for the seasons and the New Year from Tunisian President Zain Al-Abidain bin Ali.
Faris provided Birri with the atmospherics to the visit he will make at the start of next week to Russia. The Speaker hoped that "he would confirm to the leader of the Russian Duma the invitation to visit Lebanon that he had previously made to him when they met".
The invitation was addressed from the Director of Radio and Television Iran in collaboration with the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The American Congressional Delegation led by Gephardt and members of congress believed
On the Arab Summit he said, "My basic comment is that security in Lebanon is excellent, if the pretext is security."
Jan Ghanim remained as he was, without changing. The smile remained on his face for all to see.
The words of Speaker Birri with American Ambassador Vincent Patel in an earlier meeting and the Arab League Secretary General Amr Musa on regional affairs did not correlate.
Asked about the importance of the Agreement, he answered, "The importance of the Agreement is, firstly, that it strengthens economic relations between Europe and Lebanon and opens the European market to Lebanese agricultural, industrial and food industry products. This will take effect on the first day of final signature because the agreement is phased. There is no doubt that Lebanon will, in the sixth year following signature of the agreement, begin gradually to reduce customs duties. What is important in this context is that we will begin to reduce our duties on European products after we have realized and implemented in full the Arab Free Trade Zone Agreement. There will thus be a liberalization of trade with all the Arab states before our duties are reduced in relation to Europe. Thus Lebanon will be capable of confronting the coming challenges from European competition within a framework of the Greater Arab Trade Area."
Leader of the Progressive Socialist Party, Deputy Walid Junbulat expressed his fear at the "major deterioration in the economic and social situations", calling for "the necessity of creating at least a bare minimum of solutions in order for citizens to stand firm in light of the present situation".
Junbulat held meetings with the people of these villages in the presence of the village leaders, notables and chiefs.  He heard the suffering of the people, which centered on the living and economic conditions, the problem of power cuts and "haphazard and often unjust legislation".
Director of Political Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates, Ambassador Naji Abi Asi yesterday began exercising his functions as Secretary-General of the Agency. Former Secretary-General Zuhair Himdan, who has retired on reaching the legal age, continues in his office until the end of this January as part of the handover.
Qablan had contacts with Minister of Social Affairs Asad Diab and discussed with him ways of dealing with the issue of contracting parties.
It was as if these aircraft were "meant" to pass over Lebanese airspace, which remains open whilst the land was closed on 25 May 2000 until further notice, and, at the same time, pass on to the Lebanese and all Arabs the implicit and explicit message that your coming Arab summit is at my mercy. It is not at the mercy of any other threats.
In the face of the disappearance of the central Palestinian issue in this dispute at the hands of "an enemy portrayed" (the expression almost sounds funny), and at the hands of some of those whose cause it is and their brothers, the disappearance of Al-Sadr becomes a secondary issue, even among his own considerations, were he to be asked.
Thus will the Arabs have returned to the logic of resistance, resistance by idea and volition prior to the stones and bullets, its right in life amidst the dominant logic of surrender, surrender even at the first word of threat in the "minutes".
"The Al-Nahar newspaper published on Monday 14 January 2002 acquainted us with a letter from an official in the Press Department at the Iraqi Embassy, Minister Plenipotentiary Khalid Jaafar Shawish entitled: Inaccurate Statements.
Iraq's non-attendance at the official meetings from the end of 1991 to mid-1994 has slowed the search process.
Why does Iraq propose to amend the membership of the tripartite committee, which was agreed upon from the start?
Mr Al-Shuwaish says that Iraq lost the prisoners in Kuwait.
We are the sorrier because our prisoners are people of Kuwait and from among our Arab brothers.
How can Kuwait have prisoners when the Iraqi forces were occupying Kuwaiti territory?
The Iraqi official does not know the correct figure: On 5 October 2001 a statement published by the Al-Nahar newspaper reported that Iraqi has 1124 missing persons, whilst he now says that the number is 1137.
Will Iraq show us its good intent by cooperating with representative of the Secretary-General charged with the Kuwaiti prisoners and other nationals, Ambassador Yuli Foronotsov, and cooperate with the Secretary-General of the Arab League, Amr Musa, who is preparing to visit Iraq as part of an Arab tour to bring about the success of the Arab summit?
President of the Association of Village Leaders of the District of Al-Butrun Joseph Fahim Abu Fadil then spoke, making reference to the role of the village leader and the performance of his functions with fairness, honesty and dedication.
He called for work with Associations of Village Leaders in all areas "in order to improve their circumstances because they have devoted themselves to serve the public interest, by implementing the Cooperative Fund System Project to secure the requirements of village leaders; for example, health costs and to ensure benefit from birth, marriage and death grants, and the senior citizens bond".
The Administrative Office of Al-Butrun gave a speech expressing her delight at the meeting, calling for "the facilitation of citizens' business". She also called for road expansion "which will facilitate the return to the district center".
He asked those responsible for infrastructure works in the city to implement projects as per the specifications in the conditions documents. He noted that the municipality had the right to supervise projects in order to preserve public safety.

On these heights, the Israelis established massive military sites where they erected columns on which reconnaissance equipment was fixed, surrounded by barbed wire and minefields. A state of readiness was apparent among the occupying soldiers within the fortified area, and a military vehicle roamed the area.
Head of the Municipality Osama Rammal said, "We are about to mount a popular movement to restore the land, which the International Committee prevents us from entering, as a minimum for obtaining our land, and we will do this in agreement with the relevant Lebanese authorities."
We are not scared of the mines, about which they speak, even though we do not believe that there are mines in the land, other than in a specific area which we know well."
The winds have been northwesterly or northeasterly over the last three days, and they only bring a little rain to this area. We must wait for change.

No Rest for Remote and Mountain Areas from Effects of Two Snow Storms.
For the third day the cold wave has continued. Temperatures in Aliyyah and Al-Matan reached the highest levels seen by the two areas for a long time.
The amount of salt spread is estimated at about 25 tons. In the early hours, this action helped the ice to interact with the salt and it began to melt at about 10 am, depending on the height of the area and the thickness of the ice from one area to another.
It is expected that government and private schools will reopen today but not before 9:30 am, once the heat of the sun has melted most of the ice.
Pupils of the village, who are studying at the Al-Kafir government secondary school called on the relevant authorities to give the necessary instructions for it to be opened.

Citizens from the area of Duha Aramoun, near the Al-Azhar Mosque, have asked when the area will be equipped with telephones.
In order to prevent those who fish in these muddy waters from continuing their actions, which breach security, in particular those targeting the security of the nation and the citizens of Lebanon, I propose that a special team be formed charged with protecting places of worship from any act of aggression.
Caught Between a Rock and a Hard Place.
Sometimes Israel says that the cargo was to have been offloaded in Egypt to be transported by tunnel to Rafeh, and at other times it claims that the cargo was heading straight for the shores of Gaza to be offloaded there. Contradictory accounts that have failed to convince many, including some Israelis, and annoyed the propaganda experts who specialize in the arts of deceit, spin and cinematic production.
And the statement came on a silver platter, made by the supposedly "rational" member of the American administration, His Highness Secretary of State Colin Powell.
As for Washington, which appears not yet to have given in to Arafat's final removal from the game, its pressure on the Palestinian leader to acknowledge the involvement of members of the Authority in the smuggling of weapons exempts him personally from the immediate Israeli charge and temporarily keeps him away from that rock.
Regimes, from the regional waters of which a vessel is hijacked in what is tantamount to a closed Arab lake, and yet no one dares described what happened as piracy. In fact, they accuse those behind this "attempt" of "foolishness", "conspiracy" or of having been "foisted" on the cause.

to the American dollar. Note that the increase in the price of the dollar, although small at that time, can be attributed to the increase in interest rates for the American dollar and European currencies during the first years of the 1980s, when the interest rate reached for a period of two months 20%  on 24/12/1980 on the American dollar, which encouraged investment in these foreign currencies at the expense of the national currency.

Dollar and Stock Exchanges Remain Under Influence of Greenspan's Speech
Abroad, international discount markets operated in light of the speech given by the President of the American Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, last Friday in San Francisco, in which he expressed the view that the American economy, although sometimes appearing to have overcome its contraction phase, was not able to enter the developmental stage in any clear way, and remained susceptible to all manner of risks in the foreseeable future in view of the weakness of investments in the United States and the deterioration of the labor market in such a way as to reduce consumer spending by American families, which typically constitutes two-thirds of American Gross National Product.
The green bill showed an inclination to fall, especially following the weak opening of the Wall Street and Nasdaq exchanges yesterday, which closed in London as follows:
- 132.00 against the Japanese Yen, compared with 132.20.
This led to pressures on the technology, communications, banking and insurance companies sectors, whilst the flight from Spanish shares continued against the backdrop of the Argentinian crisis.
At the same time, pressures continued on Key Mart Large Warehouses, Ford Motors and Dow Chemical due to the suspension of the pricing of Enron shares, which affected the petroleum sector.
Following signature of two credit line agreements to a value of 27 million dollars, the number of agreements signed by the Arab Trade Funding Program with Lebanon is 42, the credit facility value of which is about 300 million dollars, distributed among 15 banks from among a total of 129 banks or Arab agencies.
He explained that the new line was moveable and unconsolidated, pointing out that the total funding obtained by the bank up to 19/12/2001 was about 57.9 dollars for 124 commercial operations between Lebanon and the Arab states, thereby consolidating the position of the bank as "a national agency for the Arab Trade Funding Program, just as it strengthens its role in support intra-Arab trade exchange".
FranceBank is one of the first banks to deal with the Funding Program and has been encouraged to increase its dealings with Lebanon " since we now have about 15 banks dealing with the Program.
He expressed his satisfaction at dealing with Lebanese banks, "which make repayments on time".
He said that most Arab states had adopted economic reform programs, which focused on liberalization of trade, bearing in mind that most had signed up to international trade agreements or European partnership agreements, such as Lebanon, which confirmed the importance of the trade sector and the desire to deal with markets in order to benefit from opportunities in foreign markets.
He pointed out that the loans were made to the economic sectors, including trade, industry and agriculture.

Director General of the Arab Labor Organization Dr Ibrahim Quwaider believed that "Arab states must provide between 3 and 4 million job opportunities annually until 2010". He noted, "There are countries such as Egypt, which must provide 619,000 job opportunities annually to prevent unemployment rates increasing in the Arab World."
On unemployment in the Gulf states, Quwaider explained, "Unemployment in these countries has its own unique nature in view of the presence of 8.1 million foreign workers, and so local nationals form only 28% of the general labor force." He added, "Unemployment in the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council is 17.8%, which has driven these states to expand the localization of positions policies, replace migrant workers with local nationals, establish strict restrictions on the entry of foreign workers, impose large fees on work and residence permits, provide more facilities to expand the implementation of nationalization polices, establish special funds to support employment of young people and improve the information available about the labor markets."

The President of the Republic expressed his delight at the recovery of the Amir of Kuwait following the health indisposition he suffered some time ago and at his safe return today to the country.
His Excellency expressed to me his greetings to and wishes for the health and well-being of His Highness."
I informed His Excellency of what had happened in respect of the use of Kuwait's grant for the reconstruction of the south following its liberation and, thanks to God, I am delighted to say that the Fund's grant was fully used to rebuild 850 homes liberated from Israeli aggression."
To hold the view that the age ruled by modern technology, in which the language of the computer makes exponential leaps, where there is no place for poetry, a purely innovative and free activity, is to speak too soon and on the basis of a haphazard enthusiasm for the triumph of the language of machines, which is a principled language, over the language of innovation, which is essentially based on the element of surprise, unexpectedness and novelty.

The Weakest Link, the Age of Globalization and the Victim Presenter
But between these two groups of people let us pause as colleagues to observe the detail of what happens via the screen in front of the eyes of the program's presenter in terms of how man treats his fellow human being when it comes down to winning or losing.
There is also cowardly voting, when weaker players seek to eliminate the strongest player whenever one appears, thereby leaving only the weak in the center. The bank does not fill with cash, which is supposed to be won, nor are there successive rounds for a qualitative accumulation of successes. In fact, every person who succeeds becomes a target for everyone else in the competition.
We note that in the program everyone tries to link the chain. Everyone wants to add to the profit store in the bank by saying "Bank" whenever they get a question right. Everyone wants to give the right answer and believes that in eliminating others, they maintain spirit of the team or the chain.
But when we sink into acceptance and participation, this means that we have fused with this new world and the standards of its globalization. But in both cases the presenter of the program reminds us every second that we watch it that we are living under the banner of globalization and must learn to take a stance on what is happening, which, in many cases, is to reject it as a result of our place in the world under globalization. But its nothing personal!
We have decided to move via the Ministry and by coordinating with it. Our move today is to defend the rights of the Ministry and to secure the rights of employees, associations and workers.

The Higher Monitoring Committee for Government Primary education announced yesterday in a press conference convened at the Syndicate of Editors that it will hold a protest demonstration at 11:30 am today outside Al-Saraya Al-Kabira in protest at the failure to meet the demands of teachers.
Rakkan Faqih then read a statement from the Higher Committee, which said, "Our living and professional conditions, as contracted teachers, has deteriorated to such an extent that it can no longer be tolerated under any circumstances, no matter what the pretexts and justifications put forward by the government, which refuses to remedy this social and educational issue in a fair manner, after the collapse has gone beyond the inability to secure the transport allowance which allows us to reach the schools which we ensure operate in remote rural areas and congested areas of the capital and major cities, thereby rendering our lives an unbroken chain of worries and problems arising from the worst conditions of contract, including the failure to pay the sums due for the last academic year, bearing in mind that the hourly rate we are paid has not exceeded 6,000 lira in the last eight years.
- All sums due for the last academic year shall be paid in one payment without delay.
- A transport allowance shall be given, as is the case for all employees and teachers.

Tense relations continued between the administration of Sayyidat Al-Luizah University and pupils who went on strike yesterday in protest at expulsion decisions and warnings addressed to a number of them.
He thought it sufficient to say, "The issues were moving towards a resolution".
A statement was issued in the morning by the Director of Academic Affairs Dr George Eid, which stated that yesterday was a normal working and teaching day.
"In view of the current circumstances and conditions, and the events witnessed by Sayyidat Al-Luizah University, we want to provide you with a clear and frank picture of what is really happening on the ground.
This freedom makes us concerned with the interest of the students. We are fed up with deceit, hypocrisy, exploitation and standing before the Student Affairs office receiving its response of 'No', yesterday, today and tomorrow.
In spite of everything we remain committed to our promise: we will do what we deem appropriate for the interests of the students of the university and not for the interests of its columns and buildings.
If the problem has grown and come to be of broad concern, it is not limited to the expulsion of 4 students for one week and the warning of 4 others, given that it may the administration's right to take such a measure if there has been a breach of internal regulations. The real problem is the breaking off of dialogue with the young generations in institutions that have made upbringing, and not education, their aim.

The New York Times yesterday quoted American officials as saying that the new leader of "terrorist" operation in Al-Qaeda is a Palestinian in his 30s, known as Abu Zubaidah, who is currently reorganizing sleepers in the network in a number of countries in order to restart attacks on American targets.
It said that he traveled using forged passports and many aliases.
It mentioned specifically the attacks targeting the American Embassies in Paris and Sarajevo.
Abu Zubaydah provoked the interest of American counter-terrorism experts for the first time as a leading figure in Al-Qaeda after they received reports suggesting that he had coordinated plans to attack Los Angeles Airport and tourist sites in Jordan in 1999.
The American administration informed Congress on Thursday that it intended to sell Egypt anti-ship Harpoon Block 2 missiles and other weaponry to a value of 255 million dollars.
He added that Egypt needed the anti-ship missiles to protect the Suez Canal.
American Secretary of State Colin Powell said on Wednesday that George Bush's administration is still examining the deal and that the missiles would be modified so that they could not be used against land targets. This is to reassure some members of congress that they would not be used against Israel.
Cairo - WSF- The Egyptian authorities yesterday destroyed a wall surrounding the home which was to have been the residence of the new Israeli ambassador in Cairo, Jidaun bin Ami, in the suburb of Al-Maadi.
The Board of Directors of giant energy company Enron yesterday dismissed two Vice Presidents, Richard Causey, former chief accountant, and Richard Buy, responsible for unsecured capital. At the same time, the Vice President for Development Affairs, Sherren Watkins voluntarily gave evidence before the Transport and Trade Committee in Congress. She said that the former President of the Company, Kenneth Lay, was aware that Enron was moving towards bankruptcy.
Causey and Buy refused last week to speak before the Senate Trade, Sciences and Transport Committee, maintaining their constitutional right to silence.
Chairman of the Committee, Jim Greenwood, said that Watkins had warned Lay and other officials of the "significant tampering with Enron's financial statements, the recording of falsified entries and the covering up of actual losses".
Arif began his 3-day visit to Syria on Wednesday.
The Spanish Minister, whose country holds the presidency of the European Union, explained that the full implementation of the European arrest warrant will begin "in the first three months" of 2003, allowing "a new impetus to be given to European judicial cooperation".

Musharraf Raises Doubts and Bush Hopes for His Safety; Pearl's Kidnapper: He is Dead, I do not Deny it
Policemen prevented him from talking to journalists.
I kidnapped him by my own will...I have no wish to defend myself.
He announced that he had not been arrested, but had voluntarily given himself up on 5 February "after it became known that I was involved in the operation and to prevent my family suffering inconvenience and embarrassment".
He added, "We are bringing all the pressures to bear." He noted that Pakistani intelligence and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were exerting the "utmost efforts" to ensure Pearl's release.
He said, "I cannot trust these statements, because he is not under oath."
Spokesman for the Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs Aziz Ahmad Khan noted that
The European Union and Islamic Conference Organization symposium on civilizations was not just restricted to a debate about the political aspect of civilization, mutual understanding, focus on dialogue and cultural pluralism; it was an opportunity to exchange views on many hot topics, in particular the American threats against Iran and Iraq.
Al-Nahar asked Afghan Foreign Minister Abdallah Abdallah about the veracity of the Israeli accusations that members of Al-Qaeda had sought refuge in southern Lebanon. He answered, "Certainly not. I have no information or news on this matter."
All that I have to say is that there is a genuine opportunity to do this.
- Who knows?
Abdallah was forced to cut the interview because the High Representative of European Union Foreign Policy and Joint Security Javier Solano wished to meet with him.
Tehran has confirmed that it received information from the United States about members of the fundamentalist Al-Qaeda organization led by Osama bin Ladin fleeing from Afghanistan to Iran, but it described this information as "old, incorrect and inaccurate".
Asfi said, "Iran has made many efforts to combat terrorism" and will submit "soon a full report on the matter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations", Kofi Anan.
Based on officials in the Iranian security agencies, it said that these foreigners were from Arab and African countries and had entered Iran illegally from Pakistani territory after covering about 750 km and that among their number were holders of French, British, Dutch or Belgium passports, intimating that these foreigners may have links to Al-Qaeda.
Hikmatyar opposes the presence of foreign forces, including American forces, in Afghanistan, which have followed the flight of Al-Qaeda and the Taliban movement.
Qurei-Perez Document: Palestinian State Responsible for Negotiating Final Settlement.
In an interview published with Le Monde, Perez said, "The Palestinians must be given political horizons or they will have no reason to make a move."
He noted that the recommendations of the International Fact Finding Committee, chaired by former  American senator George Mitchell, and the document produced by the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), George Tenet, represented the "prevailing mentality" of the United States on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, but "whilst these documents provide a train line, the engine and the carriage, the problem is that that does not take us anywhere".
For public opinion does not need this at the present time."
And it showed the condition of giving up on dreams was impossible."
A Palestinian State may give greater responsibility to the Palestinian leaders, who would no longer be able to say that they have no authority.
The mutual acknowledgement between the State of Israel and the State of Palestine would temporarily be based on the areas currently subject to full or partial Palestinian control.
Yemeni Blows Himself Up in Confrontation with Police, In-Law of 11 September Attacker.
The weekly newspaper of the Yemeni Ministry of Defense, 26th September, stated that Al-Hada was born in the village of Al-Mithali 100 km south of Sanaa and was killed on Wednesday as a result of the explosion of a bomb "which he tried to throw at members of the security forces, who were pursuing him in the streets of the Yemeni capital after he had fled from his home in a taxi accompanied by his wife and two other men".
Officials in the Ministry of the Interior said that they had notified the American Embassy in Sanaa of the incident. Sources in the police revealed that FBI investigators and Yemeni officers were studying files confiscated from Al-Hada's home.
Difficult Decisions for Economic Situation, Requires Solidarity of Leaders; Changes Require Lebanon Transform into Competitive Shopping Center; "Political Disturbances".
Value-added tax puts greater burden than they can bear on lower classes and those on low income, and so they unite to reject it. But bear in mind that this tax is a necessary evil, as the former Deputy Prime Minister Michel Al-Murr said.
In this regard Al-Hariri says that he is not looking to see who will benefit and who will be harmed by the economic and financial measures the government is taking; rather, he is looking above all to the interest of the country by defining a role or function for it in light of the changes that are taking place and are expected to take place, by transforming it into a shopping center able to compete, with the merchant no longer thinking about big profits from small sales, but from small profits from big sales.
Those who oppose or criticize the government's measures should not prejudge them and view them as ineffective: they must wait a few months and, should they be proven to be ineffective, they can then call the government to account. And should they prove to be effective then it will be they who are to blame and in the wrong.
Away from the debate and discussion, the question in which the people are interested is this: Will the measures taken by the government and those that the government has yet to take deal with the economic, financial and living conditions and will the liberalization of the economy whilst preserving its freedom reduce prices and combat inflation?
If the equation put forward by Speaker Nabih Birri making the liberalization of the import of petroleum and its derivatives the holding response to the sectarianisation of the abolishment of protection for monopolies, this aspect of the crisis has emerged and spread in an insane way, and is the worst thing to be suffered by all the parties to the crisis.
It has been established that merchants and importers have also been afflicted by the pursuit and targeting complex for sectarian membership. In the simplest of cases this means that everything the Lebanese hears or reads every day about the economic and financial realities cannot just be doubted, but also revoked and set aside.
And when the suspicions grown and draw the elite along with them, then Lebanon in its entirety can be branded a Republic of Doubters or Hallucinators - a consequence of the accumulation of doubt and chronic affliction with conspiracy theories.
Until yesterday no one knew the secret of these measures and why they were suddenly put out in circulation and why all attempts to postpone them for a time were rejected.
For the economy also falls into sects, as does money.
Nabil Bumunsif.
It is not clear to what extent Arafat can respond to the unending series of crippling and harsh demands. But it seems that he must press on and give 100% to end the violence, even to the extent of hanging himself at his own hands.
The rejection is both natural and expected because the decision cannot be implemented in the present context of aggression: it not only asks the people to put an end to their anger as they die in the face of the invasion machinery, but to drown in delight and joy as they do so!
Would Sharon then release his captive and negotiate with him once more?
We do not know what Arafat gains by saying that "Hamas' missiles are a primitive joke and not to be feared in the slightest" because this will irritate Israel, which tries to give the impression that that the Al-Qassam 2 'tubes' are intercontinental missiles. It will also irritate Hamas, who have been accused on not being able to scare a cat. And, ultimately, Washington will not change the daily reminder to give a 100% effort to stop terrorism.
Despite the fact that this document lacked any official status, it received the approval of both parties.
The Gaza Strip would most probably be under full Palestinian control.
The two parties agreed to give priority to refugees returning from Lebanon.
But differences were apparent on control of the Al-Haikal mountains, the tunnel under the Wailing Wall and the land surrounding the Maaliya Adumim Settlement and Ghafaat Zaifi.
He concluded, "In Taba the Palestinian met with a moderate Israeli delegation, of which delegation members Yusi Sarid said that it was perhaps the first time the Palestinians had met a similar Israeli delegation.
Campaign Against Measures an Attempt to Exhaust Lahud's Patience; Haphazard Government Steps Delay Effect Even Before Implementation.
On the one hand, there has been no shortage of evidence of a political spat and a complete lack of agreement between the leaders, which the economic organizations tried to effect in order to put the brakes on the government's drive towards abolishment of monopoly agencies in light of the provisional neutrality and patience attributed to the President of the Republic on this matter and a desire for a deeper and more comprehensive study.
This meeting discussed the possibility of giving the opportunity to a limited number of deputies to express themselves on behalf of their bloc or otherwise, bearing in mind that delegating Deputies to speak on behalf of their colleagues is unconstitutional and has previously led to crises, the least of which was when delegation was given on formation of the government at the beginning of President Lahud's term when Prime Minister Al-Hariri rejected the principle of delegation.
But until it reaps what it has kept secret, whatever it does will be a problem because no one understands where it wants to go in the absence of any, at least moral, guarantees offered in return.
All these indicators, which are linked to the remarks made by the Deputies about the government and its policy in approving the budget, make it difficult for positive reassuring factors to prevail, no matter what efforts or attempts are made.
Nor was he told that we had taken note of his words, which effuse sweetness, affection and culture...from Athena to Granada.
Imagine, imagine, just imagine. And then deduce whatever consequences appeal to you.
Up until now!
Who is the like of you? Show some patience. Never. It is two Ns and not one.
Is it reasonable for three countries such as the above to be forgotten?
In a step that will delay the trial of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in connection with the massacre at Sabra and Shatila in 1982, the International Court of Justice, which is based in the Hague, ruled that Belgium could not try current or former officials of other states because they enjoy diplomatic immunity.
It deferred the case brought against Sharon for committing war crimes and crimes of genocide in the Sabra and Shatila massacre for the Court of Appeal in Brussels had examined whether Belgium had the right to try him.
He noted that the Appeals Court "will certainly take into account today's ruling".
As far as Sabra and Shatila were concerned, no request had been made for any arrest warrant.
She said, "Israel's position from the beginning was the necessity of immediately stopping the measures being taken in the case brought in Belgium against Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon (...) the ruling of the Hague Court strengthens Israel's position.
Storms like these do no harm from time to time.
Perhaps this speed, with which the media/advertising campaign against the proposal was characterized, was in itself evidence of the importance of the commercial clique in the economic structure of the country.
For when the government trips up, all knives are useful.
The most important review is that which should extend to the firm power of the old classes and their ability to deal with changes to the political surface.
Bearing in mind that the enthusiasm of the leader of the Amal movement and the Chamber of Deputies may help us to understand the scale of this demand, albeit that it may also muddle the debate and cast it in sectarian terms.
This should push the Lebanese government to work to drive forward the proposed Greater Arab Trade Area during the Beirut summit.
Al-Hariri Chairs Meeting on His Financial Arrangement; Hamadah: Immigrants File to be Completed Within Two Years.
The construction and renovation files will continue as per the new program, the formulation of which we are now working on with the Fund. Minister Al-Sinyurah informed us about his ability to follow up this file and we were reassured at his great concern in this regard. As the Minister of Finance said whilst chatting to journalists on leaving here: the meeting was  friendly  and warm. We hope that the warmth has spread in the Ministry of Finance as far as the just immigrants file is concerned."
The Prime Minister met Deputies Jubran Tuq and Qublan Isa Al-Khuri, followed by former Minister Asad Hardan and then Father Luis Al-Rahban and his brothers in a visit to thank him for consoling them at the loss of their father.
Yesterday Sadiq stated the following:
In general terms, monopolies are an offence against the whole system of human values.
Then the Lebanese ask whether the new official approach is really part of some new, comprehensive method of government adopted by the Authority for the benefit of all the Lebanese people, which is how things should be if Lebanon were a state of law, institutions and independent national decisions.
There can thus be no way out of the neck of the bottle unless the forces of the democratic opposition in all their forms unite on a common position, from which they can rectify the present government imbalance on all levels and by employing all the means provided by the provisions of the Constitution and called for by the principles of democracy."
It was returned to the Committee following signature by the Minister of Defense and the Ministers of Justice and Finance.
He clarified that the observations concerned the National Guard and the Civil Aviation Security Authority and other observations, and "we recalled the draft submitted by the Ministry of the Interior, which required the establishment of an organization for aviation security, to be called the Air Police, which exists in developed countries. The task of this police would be to monitor vehicles entering and leaving the airport."
Instead of plugging the gaps by contract, we intent to formulate a strategy for the next five years incorporating the needs of schools."
She noted, "The number is as determined by the Minister of Education and Higher Education, in the range of 2600 teachers. We are endeavoring to obtain from the Ministry of Education some information, figures and the specializations in each district."
The Committee focused on the need to maintain product quality and standards, in particular in relation to medicines.
The United Nations Commission for Environment and Development has for 15 years adopted a pioneering approach by putting people at the heart of the development process.
It also constitutes a fundamental factor in economic progress and social development and a key condition for increasing productivity and creating fairer and more effective societies.
Poverty robs hope, sows despair and gives birth to frustration.
Millions die each year and millions of others suffer from easily preventable or treatable diseases because they, or the country in which they live, suffer from degrading poverty
If we add these sums, we find that they show we must spend an additional 66 billion American dollars on health each year until 2015.
Can developing countries absorb this huge sum of money and use it in an effective manner?
Over the last two years we have seen increasing political commitment to health in all areas of the world.
The analysis and results of the report will be included in national, regional and international events.

Minister of Culture Ghassan Salamah yesterday informed president of the Republic Emil Lahud about the latest arrangements for the Arab summit and the logistical and administrative preparations being made for it.
The President of the Republic discussed developments and the needs of the regions with the Chairman of the Deputies Council for Foreign Affairs Ali Al-Khalil, Deputy Qasim Hashim and former Deputy Antwan Hitti.
We should also appreciate His Excellency's efforts in supporting the Government's economic measures so as to lighten the effects of the difficult living conditions and restore some measure of balance between the different sections of Lebanese society.
Lahud met with the new Director General of the National Social Security Fund, Muhammad Karki, on the occasion of his appointment to his new position.
The Council of Ministers has approved a draft law amending the provisions of legislative decree no. 34 (Commercial Representation) as part of a plan aiming to prohibit monopolies, combat goods flooding markets, protect consumers and regulate import and competition. The law will enter into effect three months after the date of its publication.
He noted that the final version of the agenda had not been prepared, describing the situation in the region as "very, very, very bad".
In a statement read to journalists following the meeting, Arif confirmed, "The continued support of the Islamic Republic of Iran for the resistance in Lebanon and the Palestinian Intifada, expressing his hope that the Palestinian people would be able to recover the territory and rights of which they have been raped in the immediate future."
He expressed "his moral and political appreciation for what Iran does for the resistance movement in Lebanon and the Palestinian people".
It has been noticed that one right-wing party has been invited to attend the Islamic Media Conference.
It appears that a number of trees have become desiccated as a result of the spread of the worm. Officials have failed to take any fundamental measures to deal with the problem, with the exception of some municipal councils, which have tried to remove nests from the trees.
* The World Health Organization has announced the opening of the Solid Waste Management Project in the Farhat district - Al-Ghubairi municipality in the presence of the Regional Director of the Organization, Hussein Abd Al-Razzaq Al-Jazairi, with the participation of the Minister of Public Health, Sulaiman Faranjih, Minister of the Environment Michel Musa, Head of Al-Ghubairi municipality, Muhammad Al-Khansa, Director of UNRWA affairs in Lebanon, Alfredo Mitchio, in cooperation with the municipality, non-governmental organizations and private associations in the area.

Residents of Bulus Ilyas Building, Sasin Street, Al-Ashrafiyyah Area have complained of an unlicensed restaurant in the building, the staff of which park their cars along the length of the pavement in front of the restaurant and give their orders to the residents, who have asked for their problem to be resolved.

And did Deputy Walid Junbulat mean when he said a few days ago that "we must all protect ourselves behind the Maronite Patriarch" that the man would be a refuge for the liberated and the opposition to the end of his era, especially following the attack on the Minister of Health Sulaiman Faranjiyyah by those he called "the security dogs" by means of rumors circulated about him and his wife being the subject of a murder attempt by members of his own family and that his wife was wounded by a bullet and had been transferred to a hospital in a serious condition?
This is despite the fact that the period of detention has been an extended one for the State of Truth and Law with which citizens were promised. The fate of Messrs Riyadh Al-Turk, Aarif Dalilah, Habib Isa, Habib Salih, Walid Al-Nabi, Hasan Saadun, Fawaz Tallu and Kamal Al-Labwani  remains obscure, notwithstanding the rumors which sometimes say that they have not yet been brought before the courts because they will be brought to trial as free men, at other times, that they will be given a special pardon by the Presidency, or, alternatively, that they will be brought before a normal, not a special, court and that this will take place as soon as the trial of Deputies Al-Humusi and Saif takes places, etc.
In Response to Abd Al-Razzaq Eid: Between Commemoration and Erasing the Trace.
The fact is that I am not sure that Eid has read this article of mine because I did not quote this expression, by which I mean to say that I did not cite it at all, in any way! What I said was, to the letter, as follows: "Some days ago the Syrian President received a delegation from the American Senate. The discussion dealt with reactions to 11 September and the importance of settling on definitions to define the concept and identity of terrorism and the concept of extremism in its different forms, and ways of combating terrorism.
The logic that Hadidi seeks from the Syrian authorities he himself forsakes, thereby forgetting what he asked of others, if, that is, the attribution of the expression to the President is accurate. He does this when from a different opposition stance he recalls these disasters and tragedies and presents them to pick the wound once more!"
In this context, I will allow myself to quote the last paragraph of my article: "The 20th anniversary of the Hamah massacre deserved consideration from another perspective and some form of call for national reconciliation and closure (so that we do not talk about any insinuation of self-criticism) and not add insult to the deep wound, from which dark blood still pours."
A Syrian writer.
The Customs Department had not received the necessary documents and papers and did not allow it to dock until the morning of Monday, the 11th of this month.
Al-Nahar contacted the Director of Tripoli Port Eng. Marwan Barudi to enquire. He confirmed that the port had no problem with the Greek company owning the Alexis. He had met the request of the vessel's agent and allowed it on Monday morning to dock. The matter was now an issue for Customs and the Ministry of the Economy.
The vessel's agent, Fuad Istafan, said that there was no problem with the cargo but that the failure to offload the sugar would be delayed until the required documents arrived from Lebanon, as there had been a change to the vessel, which is owned by a Greek company.
If the sugar, or any part, is proven to be unfit or contaminated, it must either be destroyed or reshipped to the country of origin.
Nor was it permitted to offload its cargo of 14,000 tones.
Hamdan said, "The state has been unable to implement the bare minimum of the reforms which it promised us after the war."
He enumerated the pros and cons of value-added tax, noting the importance of it being accompanied by "a range of measures and checks to guarantee that matters were proceeding in the right direction".
These people, shareholders and deposit-holders in Lebanon Co-operatives held banners, such as "Only the Government is Responsible for the Tragedy, Suffering and Impoverishment of Shareholders and Deposit-Holders (...) The Contract with the Al-Muttahidah Company is Void and Illegal".
Minister for Social Affairs Asaad Diab, in his capacity as President of the Lebanese Information Assembly, announced that a workshop would be held under the title "Information Technology in the Service of Tourism" in participation with the Joint European Commission.

Sidon - Al-Nahar:
He criticized the high-interest and cash fixing policies pursued by former government, policies which encouraged profit-taking behavior.
He believed that "income tax, which is still low, is fairer than value-added tax".
One of the shareholders in the co-operatives said, "We wanted to hear Prime Minister Al-Hariri in person because he is the only person we believe."
This would be at 9 am tomorrow, Saturday, at the Sea Rock Hotel, Al-Rushah.
Tripoli - Al-Nahar:
He said, "The Saudi market is characterized by being the largest purchasing and consumer power in the region in all areas. Gold is an example, with the Saudi market spending 10 billion dollars per annum in this area. There are others, such as school essentials, female products, and other fields in which the purchasing power of the Saudi market is clear.
Marhaj and Qabbani "Attack" Agencies; Du Friege Calls for "Future Vision"; Du Friege; Medicine Importers.
Should anyone have a different view, then they should turn to public opinion and its various institutions to explain that view and gain supporters for it.
As regards this matter, there have been many complaints at this tax, but we have noticed some advertisements that say 50% discount which "we pay", which means that for many products merchants will deduct it from their profits. The state has benefited from this tax. I believe that these measures are bold and will solve the treasury deficit, provided that they are accompanied by other measures. But there can be no doubt that the recent measures will lead to a reduction in prices and protect quality. This is what the state does and it is its duty."
He also expressed reservations at the manner in which the matter is being dealt in official quarters and by the merchants themselves. Examination of the matter requires a skeptical approach. The matter requires future vision out of a fear that Lebanon could become a market of foreign merchants with nothing left for the Lebanese merchant.
Communications and Internet Economy Conference Calls for Accelerated Privatization and Preparation for Competition.
- Confirm the regulatory environment and conditions appropriate for a competitive environment, but without obstructing the care of government for social conditions. This includes establishment of regulatory authorities that are independent of operators, with administrative and financial independence.
- Monitor the notable progress made in the Arab region, represented by the increased number of fixed and mobile lines and the improvement in level of service, not to mention the successful experiments of a number of companies in the Arab private sector.
- The importance of working to speed up the spread of internet use, taking the measures necessary to expand the consumer base and working to develop e-commerce in all sectors.
It is true that the government's budget is in the red, but the imposition of new direct and indirect taxes will not bring about the desired end.
Health spending in Lebanon exceeds 2 billion dollars, with the cost of medicine reaching 25% of this, i.e. 500 million dollars, which should be measured against the population size of about 3.6 million  people according to official statistics. Individual spending on medicine in Lebanon is therefore 138.8 dollars, compared to 17 dollars in Syria (whose annual health bill is 250 million dollars for 15 million people) and 71 dollars in Jordan (where the annual bill is 300 million dollars for 4.2 million people).
And there are staff there, but, as is the case with other government departments, they do not work.
Is the government strong enough to do this?
However, in light of the development in demand and supply movement for the dollar, it was actually traded at the maximum end of the margin for Central Bank intervention and, occasionally, outside that margin. This took place in a market of weak activity with the total transactions not exceeding six million dollars. Part of this sum was inter-bank sale and purchase trading at 1514.00 lira.
In this context, traders studied the announcement by the Federal Statistics Office in Germany to the effect that retail sales there have fallen by 0.1% over the last year, compared to an expected rise of 0.5% according to previous predictions and an actual rise of 2.2% in 2000. At the same time, new ventures in France fell last month by 1.2%, after having stabilized in November and December 2001.
- 1.6985 Swiss Franc compared to 1.6995.
The same applied to silver, which closed at 4.54 dollars per ounce, compared with 4.5020 dollars the day before yesterday in New York, having been 4.50 dollars at noon.
Wall Street and Nasdaq were unable to hold the gains previously made at the opening, which was supported by good results from Hewlett Packard and encouraging results about the American economy.
This was preceded in the morning by a rise on the Tokyo stock exchange, with the Nikai Index crossing the 10,000 point threshold for the first time since the 29th of last December amidst evidence that the government is intensifying its efforts to boost the Japanese economy and combat the fall in prices. The Index closed up 112.74 points at 10081.09 points.
Diab held a press conference at the same hotel to announce the workshop.
He added, "Following the recommendations of the Barcelona conference, the Information Community Directorate General of the European Union approved funding for projects to establish relations between north and south, in order to activate various economic sectors in the field of information technology.
It is expected that it will be followed by activities and conference for various other sectors, including: medical care, manufacture and management of information technology incubators.
Diab concluded, "This event provides some answers by providing a detailed presentation of advanced practical applications in Lebanon and Europe. It will conclude with a meeting to involve Lebanese and European organizations, the aim of which is to establish and consolidate foundations for cooperation and partnership."
At that time the Arab satellite and media field comprised Intelsat and Arabsat, whilst there were tens of other satellites in the world, which not only stormed the communications markets by their advanced technology, but also by their lease and service prices. The only ones to remain in the field would be those that could deal with the conditions present at the time, which might require worldly-wisdom and responsibility.
The details of the contract signed between the Lebanese Satellite Channel and the Egyptian Satellite Company (Nilesat) have demonstrated that the latter's satellite covers North Africa and, specifically, all of Egypt, and that it attracts almost 10 million viewers.

It was as if the players were running in delight and laughter.
In a brief, sharp expression, abbreviating the genius of its composer, the quintet concluded with Rimski Korsakov's "Bee", the only quintet written for the flute, clarinet, trumpet, bassoon and oboe.

This time begins on the date the accused learnt of the crime attributed to other persons.
Furthermore, defense attorneys Labbas and Shamaun believed that the statements attributed to Samahah and Kairuz before the Intelligence Directorate contravened the old Principles of Minor Cases Law, and on this basis there was a defense to ignore the documents set before the aforementioned authority.
Afifah Karam was the first female journalist and writer from Lebanon and the Arab World to burst forth as an emigrant in the late 19th and early 20th century. But her name would have almost been forgotten were it not for the efforts made over four and a half years by Dr Barbara Badawi investigating in upper rooms and boxes and traveling between the major universities in Lebanon and the United States, searching for the biography of the daughter of her own town, Amshit. All the obstacles that confronted her did not overwhelm her; in fact, she researched more than 100 references, including books, magazines and manuscripts. "Some of the books, which had turned yellow, and were torn and covered in dust, were from the upper rooms of some" senior figures "in Amshit or from university libraries in Lebanon or the United States, and most had suffered the effects of time with both ink and paper affected".
She did not continue for long at the school, marrying her brother-in-law Hanna Salih Karam, who arrived from America in 1896, when she was not yet 13. She settled in Shrepfort in Louisiana.
The first article written by Afifah Karam was published in the Al-Huda newspaper in 1897. She continued to write until her death in 1924.
Her death in 1924 as a result of an illness caused a shock in literary, intellectual and press circles. Naum Makarzal dedicated the front page of his newspaper, Al-Huda, to her for a full month in order to publish all the telegrams of condolence sent to the newspaper to console the "Arab world and Arab women at the death of this dear person".
She also wrote hundreds of articles on literary criticism.
And that you will not sign contracts selling you as slaves with trembling, shaking or obedient hands without knowledge or reflection, for marriage in this form is a "lottery", in which for every winner there are a thousand losers."
The topics she dealt with also included: equality between the sexes, making Arabic language the principal language in schools, and separation from one's homeland.

They also believe that a great artist cannot engage in contemporary, modern and new schools, and be proficient in them, unless he is first proficient in classicism.
This confirms for us once more that classicism does not end with the progress of the age (any age), and nor can it be categorized as "old" with the development of the new (namely scientific or technological progress), because it is evidence of an original capacity given by God to the artist, making him a partner in forming beauty.

And the whispering steps by which the herd was revealed.
You are the palm tree in a jungle of pens.
Amin - where are those who protect poetry from prattle?
Rejoice, Prince of Rhythm, at being in a country.
A nation that has tired of its leaders' weakness.
In Kuwait raise Nakhlah to poetry.
And deliver him safely to the rocking clouds.
The eternal breath comes to me from the unknown.
A silver rope of effervescent beads.
The kingly cloak decorated with pure gold, embroidered.
Its blades are sharpened in these books.
And bring Al-Amin to the land of original kinship.
Leaving behind dry stalks, without mercy for the perpetrators.

The Presidents of Serbia and Montenegro yesterday signed an historic agreement in Belgrade to change fundamentally the form and structure of Yugoslavia, giving the state a new name and granting these two Republics greater self-rule.

The agreement states that "if Montenegro wishes to withdraw from the Federal State, the international documents relating to Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, in particular Resolution 1244 for Kosovo, will apply to Serbia as successor to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia".
He clarified that the agreement would be put before the parliaments of Serbia, Montenegro and the current Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) before becoming "a constitutional document with constitutional legitimacy".
Djukanovic, who is expected to face opposition from supporters of Montenegro's independence, praised the agreement, which allowed for the preservation of "the basic structures of the economic systems and reforms in Montenegro and the important mechanisms for integration of the economic system between Montenegro and the European Union".

He added that the ruling made by the Appeals Court "does not end the sanctions imposed against Libya, but it should push it to move quickly to comply with all United Nations resolutions".

He demanded, "The United States, which put forward the draft resolution, and the European Union, Russia and the United Nations, must take the measures necessary to ensure the transformation of the spirit and letter of this resolution into political action that will allow rapid change to be effected on the ground to protect the Palestinian people and put an end to the practices to which they are being subject."
Morocco, which chairs the Jerusalem Committee, issued a statement through its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which stated that the Security Council resolution represented "notable progress on the road to a solution" to the Arab Israeli conflict by the establishment of a "sustainable recognized Palestinian state within secure borders next to Israel".
The Swiss Ministry of Foreign Affairs praised the resolution and urged Israel to respect the humanitarian obligations that it was under as an occupying force, requiring it to protect civilians and allow ambulances and foreign diplomats and journalists to move freely without impendence "in the occupied Palestinian territories" - a reference to Swiss diplomat Nicolas Lang being prevented on Tuesday from reaching his office in Ramallah.
Liberation expressed pessimism because "a resolution issued by the Security Council is not sufficient to stop the cycle of violence".
The official position of Lebanon, after Syria, did not meet with the reactions that welcomed the last resolution of the Security Council, number 1397.
As a result of this pressure, the Syrian representative on the Security Council, Mikhail Wahbah, withdrew the draft resolution after he confirmed that the resolution put forward by the United States had gained the support of most members of the Security Council and had become the de facto resolution.
3 - The resolution focuses exclusively on the security issue in respect of events in the Palestinian territories, with most of its clauses focusing on providing the security groundwork to coincide with the start of the American envoy to the Middle East, retired General Anthony Zinni's mission in the region. The vote on it and the achievement of major international support for it aims to ensure the success of the mission of the American envoy by imposing a ceasefire on the Palestinian Territories - a priority of his mission - in preparation for forcing the two warring factions back to the negotiating table.
These are the guarantees sought by Al-Asad for conforming to the Saudi plan as a mechanism leading to a comprehensive settlement.
Some Lebanese officials believe that the Security Council resolution aims to achieve a "long-term freeze" of the Israeli-Palestinian war in an attempt to freeze the Intifada without putting forward clear proposals in its political content. They also believe that resolution 1397 is one of those rare resolutions to be issued by the Security Council, which is characterized by complex ambiguities on the one hand, and by unabashed prejudice in its evaluation of events taking place in the Palestinian Territories, even in light of the important historical stance that it has adopted, namely acknowledgement of a Palestinian state neighboring that of Israel.
Anthony Zinni will not only cross scorched earth to reach Yasir Arafat's headquarters in central Ramallah tomorrow - he will also pass over Israeli heads so excited that Ariel Sharon and his Minister of Defense Binyamin Ben Eliezer are competing against each other to claim responsibility for the crime of storming the political capital of the Palestinian Authority.
First, the negotiations option, represented in Sharon implicitly disregarding the talks which started last week between his Minister of Foreign Affairs, Shimon Perez and Chairman of the Palestinian Legislative Chamber, Ahmad Qurei (Abu Ala), which ended in failure due to the Israeli side repeatedly trying to convince the Palestinians to accept the paper previously put forward by Peres, which talks of establishing a Palestinian state over no more than 42% of the total area of the West Bank, in addition to the Gaza Strip.
Thirdly, a geographical option, which can destroy any talks from the outset when they resume, if, that is, the American efforts by means of Zinni or anyone else, succeed in bringing the two parties back to the negotiating table.
On this basis Sharon is weighing up his positions on the basis of his understanding of the imperatives confronting American policy in the Middle East specifically at the present time. These imperatives have required, first of all, that Zinni be returned to the region contrary to everything that was previously said, namely that he would not return before an end to the violence; and secondly, the passing of the surprise 1397 resolution by the Security Council, which descended like a crane working on two lines: that of Zinni and that of Dick Cheney.
The best way for the Arab Summit to start its business would be to send a bouquet of thanks to the international Security Council.
It is true that many resolutions have been issued by the same Security Council and that they have remained ink on paper for a long time.
In brief, the international community has done what duty required of it in respect of the crisis of all crises, albeit belatedly.
The resolution is not free from holes, flaws and gaps.
So tether your camel and put your trust in God...And pray that behind the "positive" resolution of the Security Council there does not lie a "negative" resolution against...Who!?
Shortly after the destruction of the last two tanks, the other tank convoys began to leave Ramallah. Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon had ordered his army to withdraw gradually from the town following American criticisms of the Israeli military operation as the American envoy to the Middle East, General Anthony Zinni, began a new mission to mediate for a ceasefire between the Palestinians and Israelis.
He believed, "This full withdrawal will greatly facilitate the task of General Zinni."
Before Zinni began his talks with Sharon yesterday evening, Apache helicopters killed a prominent Islamic Jihad activist called Muatasim Makhluf and another activist with him in Anbata.
It has been decided that Zinni will meet with Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat in Ramallah on Saturday after holding talks with Israeli officials, including Sharon.
Arafat's spokesman, Nabil Abu Radinah, stated that there would be no contacts or meetings with any Israelis until they stopped their attacks and withdrew from all towns, including Bethlehem, Ramallah and the towns of the Gaza Strip.
Israel yesterday claimed that the armed men who carried out Tuesday's attack near the Shalomi settlement in Upper Galilee, northern Israel, entered from Lebanon and succeeded in crossing the border fence using an arch-shaped ladder.
He added, "There are certain gaps in the technology available to us", adding that four of those who had aided the attackers had concealed the ladders under bushes on the Israeli side of the borders."
Iran Lirman, a former senior office in Israeli military intelligence, believed that the armed men had entered Israel more than one day prior to the attack, which raises the possibility of Israeli Arabs providing a refuge for them.
Israeli Transport Minister Ephraim Sneh pointed out that even were Hizbollah responsible for the attack, Israel had no interest in opening a second front in the north.

It is being convened when there are foreign armies, such as the American army, on Arab territory, and this presence must be reflected in the policies of these states and their political economic and other resolutions.
He asked "Arafat not to leave Palestinian territory, nor the Intifada, because I am certain that Sharon will not allow him to return. What is happening at the moment is that a trap is being laid for Arafat, to isolate him from the domestic Intifada. He cannot take a risk in this matter, especially when his presence at the Arab summit will not change anything in its resolutions.
He called for "this card to be kept in the hands of Syria, Palestine and Lebanon. It should not be played other than in the context of serious negotiations, accompanied by a bare minimum of guarantees".

Minister Al-Jisr had previously demanded that the practice of turning cases that were still before the courts into a media contest be stopped, in order to maintain the independence of the judiciary and keep it far from political attractions.
As the Arab summit is about to get underway, the Lebanese government has a number of hot political, economic, financial and social issues, the treatment of each requiring that much is done. It does not need a new, complex issue that it will not be able to deal with because it does not have many cards. It hopes that it would not give any new pretext for Lebanon to be swamped by a new cycle of pressures, which would increase its sufferings."

Paris - Al-Nahar:
Students in the current have demonstrated their intent and determination to seize independence and overcome all the threats of the security organizations and the Ministry of the Interior, and their acts of suppression and terror and their spreading rumors against the Lebanese people, the cadres of the current and student officials.
It is a lie to say that Brigadier Aun calls for blood to be spilt. I am careful to ensure the well-being of every citizen both in society and in the armed forces.
But it seems that the existing regime in Syria wishes to drown in its past, not to escape it."
At the end of the session, Minister of Information Ghazi Al-Aridi announced the following official decisions:

The conference delegates will issues a closing statement today.
The participation of the official spokesman for the Orthodox Church in Jerusalem, Father Atallah Hanna, at the opening of the workings of the "Arab Conference" in support of the Intifada held in Beirut had a significant impact on the hearts of participants. This was on account of the speech he gave to conference delegates, in which he expressed the pain and daily sufferings of the Palestinians, in addition to the place he occupied as a representative of Christians and Muslims and the fact that he spoke boldly and patriotically.
Charitable organizations have received Lebanese and non-Lebanese financial assistance that is not being spent where it should.
Two days ago he suffered a cold and yesterday morning had a temperature, following which he fell to the ground at his home and suffered a head wound.
Al-Jamil's health is good and there is no cause for worry. He returned to his home in Sinn Al-Fil where he received a number of calls, notably from Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Nabih Al-Birri."
At the time we said that these are the future of Lebanon and that we must establish a dialogue with them, not resort to the means of suppression, pressures and terror. Today we advise our fellow students to look to the higher interest of the country, especially in these delicate circumstances."

The session was preceded by a private meeting between President Lahud and Prime Minister Al-Hariri, which lasted for 20 minutes.
The President criticized Resolution 1397 recently issued by the Security Council because what was required was clear reference to the importance of implementing the relevant international resolutions.
In calling for more cooperation and solidarity, the Prime Minister said, "There is great debate in the country about the draft law and other measures being taken by the government.
If the state finances are difficult, as we say, we should not exaggerate matters, especially negative matters, and spread despair amongst the people.
Patel After Meeting With Hamud: Initiatives Very Positive Indicator; Colombian Ambassador; Diplomats.
He was later asked for his view on the situation in south Lebanon. He avoided replying and took the imitative with journalists, saying, "The discussion with Minister Hamud was general following my return from Washington. I am trying to meet with officials in the Lebanese government.
Asked about what Washington expected from the Beirut summit, he said, "We hope for a solid and coordinated Arab stance, certainly on the issue of peace in the Middle East."
We will continue to maximize our efforts to this effect."
He noted the contributions of the people of the community in the political, artistic and cultural domains and the fact that they have become Columbians of Lebanese origin."
He said, "The issue of terrorism and the drugs trade is not just a Columbian one - it is international, which the world has begun to realize after it thought it to be just Colombian."
Director of International Organizations Ambassador Antwan Shidid discussed bilateral relations with Spanish Ambassador Miguel Angel Carido.
Well-informed sources report that the visit of Vice Chairman of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council Izzat Ibrahim and Foreign Minister Naji Sabri Al-Hadithi to Beirut provoked much curiosity on the part of American Ambassador Vincent Patel, who asked officials as to the aims of the visit of the senior Iraqi delegation. He was told that it formed part of the preparations for the summit.
When he asked about the nature of this agreement, he was told that it came under the Security Council "Oil for Food" resolution and that it had previously been signed by Syria, Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia and Yemen.
They mentioned that Patel also asked about Lebanon's position on Security Council resolution 1397. Lebanon's observations on this resolution included the following:
4 - It made no reference to Palestinian refugees, nor General Assembly resolution 194.
Resolution 425 has not been implemented in full. Lebanese prisoners in Israeli prisoners have not been freed and refugees have not returned to their home. The penetration of the Blue Line by air and land had not stopped and most of the fields of land mines were still intact.
They believed that the import and essence of the resolution were to implement the Tenet plan and the Mitchell report.
In an address given on the occasion of the new Hijri year and the beginning of Ashura he said, "The anniversary of the Prophet's noble Hijra calls to mind the noblest of divine meanings concerning the courageous and heroic stances adopted by the Prophet of God (s) and his refusal to submit to the Quraish, when he said 'By God, if they put the sun in my right and the moon in my left for me to leave this affair, I would not have done so...'."
An examination of the meanings of the Prophet's flight requires us to flee to God as the Prophet of God did. This requires us to leave behind sins and bad deeds, to renew the relationship with God, may He be praised, and to make what pleases Him, may He be glorified, our criteria in our actions, deeds and behavior, so that we flee from our desires and instincts, call ourselves to account and turn in humility and sincerity to the broad mercy of God..."
This blessed Hijri year is the year of the Intifada when our sons flee to God in their fight against the occupation, and, just as God promised victory, the Intifada will bring victory, pride and liberation, if God permits.
...What Remains for the State?
In the context of his defense of the draft law to lift protection from commercial monopoly agencies, one of these incisive minds asked: If the state has decided to abandon its own monopolies, how can we protect the monopolies of the major merchants?
This struggle was crowned by the reclaiming of the concession of the tobacco and Persian tobacco, which became one of the institutions of the public sector. It generates profits just as the Public Telephone Department, which has brought in considerable profit for the Public Exchequer, does.
What kind of legislation is this, and what logic or justice do we read, sea and hear?
Especially in the area of imposing indirect taxes, which affect ordinary people, the rate of which has increased to 50% in a year and some months!?
What have you done to mankind in Lebanon after transforming most of society's institutions into caves for Ali Baba and his myrmidons, temples for money-changes and those after money however and by whatever means they can find?

The third stop was at the house of the Jaafarite Mufti of Baalbak Sheikh Khalil Shuqair who expressed his respect "for France, which had given the world human rights".
He stressed the French role, especially in the Middle East, during the Israeli attacks and the occupation of the south."
He said, "The French Cultural Center, which has been in Baalbak since 1999, represents us as an Embassy. Those working in it are our extension for cultural and educational aims, to give the French language its place in all government and private schools without exception, as was the case previously, and to secure the best means to improve language and education."
In response to Sheikh Shuqair's proposal he said, "I have no knowledge of participation in the Israeli celebration, but as far as the issue of the hijab is concerned, the matter was resolved some time ago. In France, 10% of the population is Sunni Muslim. I do not believe there is a state with the sectarian normalization that we have by means of a balance between all." He said, "France is very comfortable with the Arabs and there are efforts to revive peace in the area via United Nations resolutions and clear resolutions to end the violence and respect the rights of the Arab peoples.
The two security sub-committees in the Governorates of Al-Nabatiyyah and Al-Beqaa met yesterday to examine the measures to be taken on the eve of the commemoration of Ashura.

Similarly, the Governor of the Beqaa Milad Al-Qarih chaired a meeting of the security sub-committee at the Zahlah Saraya to discuss security arrangements for the Ashura anniversary.

The Editors' Syndicate, in announcing his death to his colleague, offers its sincerest consolations to his family and to them, asking God to bring him into His paradise.
The Directorate General consequently asks citizens who have seen him or have information about him and his whereabouts to contact the First Beirut Judiciary detachment in the judicial police unit on one of the following numbers 01/647624, 01/647625 or 01/647626 or the emergency 112 number, for the necessary legal measures to take place.

Pay attention to what we say: This project will be implemented on private land owned by the company, not on public property.
Thank you to the Minister of the Interior and the Municipalities, Ilyas Al-Murr, who revitalized this project by submitting it to the Council of Ministers.
"I was on my way to Beirut, when I was entrusted with a political mission.
The King (Fuad I, father of King Faruq, king of Egypt at that time) preferred to be President of the Republic because at least he knew when his term was up."
This explains his ignoring the economic authorities, in order to stop them delaying his projects, with the links that were broken to be repaired with something better.
An exchange of views is a necessary condition in the life of our conference and is essential if is to have vitality.
Still others are still standing in the middle. They are unable to fight, but nor can they seek a peace that will maintain dignity.

The Board of Directors of the National Social Security Fund is known to have dropped the proposal for the Fund to pay an increase to the educational grant for the private sector in its meeting yesterday.

Tax and Inspection Agency
He cited the French experiment, where the "Ursaf" department undertakes this responsibility for the Social Fund.
"Pursuant to the discussion that took place initially in the Economic Committee and then in the smaller committee to examine the proposed amendments to the Social Security Law, and as part of the attempt to conduct serious reforms of the fundamental issues in the Fund, I have the honor to submit the following proposal for the establishment of "The General Agency for Tax and Inspection", hoping that it will be discussed and ratified by the General Authority.
- Article 4: A special committee, to be proposed by the Board of Directors and approved by the Council of Ministers, shall administer the Agency. This committee shall comprise representatives of the founding partners in the Fund.
It was also agreed to abolish the proposal to incorporate additional custodianship for the Ministry of Finance and to retain custodianship with the Ministry of Work but within the limits of the Fund's independence, in addition to retaining the powers of the Director General and the Board of Directors in a manner that approximates the powers granted to them by the old law.

He confirmed, "The Lebanese banks have a high rate of cover." He added, "The Bal committee has imposed a cover on operating risks, to which the banks must adhere.

"Journey" by the Tunisian "Artis" group is, first of all, a performance for the ear and for speech as a rhythmic state with a swelling, protruding beat that penetrates to the depths of the senses of the "listener", as well as being a filter for feelings outside the traditional dictionary of spectators, even though they are unconventional! One might say that it is a performance capable of interpretation, free from controls on its content,

University Contracted Staff and Faculty of Health Students Protest; Minister of Education: State Serious about University Development.
In response to the speeches of the Head of the Full-time Lecturers Association at the University, Dr Bahij Al-Rahban, and of a number of lecturers, which focused on "the existence of a conspiracy against the Lebanese University, the manner in which it has been singled out and its human teaching recourses hit", he said: "All that is being said about a conspiracy against the university is unreasonable and not true. The state that is building the historic structure in Al-Hadath and working to construct the branches of the university in the governorates is serious about developing this major national university.
We have an appointment with the Minister of Finance next week to discuss this matter."
He confirmed that it was not permissible "to empty the University of its lecturers. I am completely convinced of this point of view and I will put it forward to the Council of Ministers".

In those countries they lived and continue to live. In Lebanon they settled.
In every country they found an economy and an infrastructure. But they did not find humanitarian values such as those they found in Lebanon, whose values were grafted onto their own."
From this point Lebanon has entered globalization with its radiant culture and civilization, making it an active player in globalization, not a neutral receiver.

The launch of the competition was attended by Minister Ghaslan Salamah, who apologized for not participating as he had to attend a meeting of the Council of Ministers, but he promised to attend in the advanced stages and at the final stage next April.
Salamah then spoke and said, "Your presence here today is a source of real joy, for me at least, for two reasons: First, as Minister of Culture, I am delighted to see you sharing in the love of the Arabic language and that you are with me in viewing this language also as one of the victims of the destructive war that swept across out country, and we must revive it.

Murad put forward proposals for study, including the possibility or bringing the preparation, qualification and training centers closer to people living in the regions, in order to benefit from the role of teachers spread out in the governorates and from the direction and guidance of the Ministry. These cadres would be put at the disposal of the Faculty of Education for cooperation with the Educational Research and Development Centers for the purpose of preparing large numbers of teachers using studied programs that would not interrupt the schools, not deprive them of the services of the contractors, nor would it require the administration to draw up new contracts.
He spoke about the graduates from the Faculty who had not found a place in the labor market, and had headed for the private sector and were therefore lost to the government schools.

It has descended upon us with its "good" consequences amidst a regional-Lebanese storm, so perhaps the anniversary will coincided with some of its "derivatives" spread over 27 years - the rope is still on the tug - constituting a real alarm bell to those who continue to underestimate and dabble with great danger, which Lebanon has again seen in the last few weeks.
But the matter is fundamentally different when some people, thinking themselves to be clever, attempt to impose an international fact on the reality of Lebanon, a reality that is critical and filled with factors leading to civil strife, collapse and the war legacies.
All these roads lead to the same end, namely to "prepare" Lebanon once more for explosion and disturbance.
Yesterday there was an attack attributed to the security forces. The demonstrations have become absorbed with something else, other than mere solidarity with the Palestinian people.
Haven't the hotheads read the explicit judicial charge brought against some of those detained, namely that they are subjecting Lebanon to the danger of foreign aggression?

It is true that Arafat would, to a large extent, be free in Gaza, but those close to him say that he does not feel at present that he is under pressure despite the siege imposed on his office.
Arafat and his men are convinced that they will win this battle and so they have no reason to put forward any concessions."

However, this front was completely calm yesterday, for the first time since the artillery and rocket exchange operations began. Hizbollah did not mount any attacks against it as it has been doing over the last two weeks.
The same information indicated that Powell would only issue a written statement after the meeting and would not answer journalists' question.
Information suggested it likely that Powell will meet each of the three heads of state alone for a short time and then travel to Damascus.
Junbalat: Curse of Palestinian Blood on All Who Do Not Answer the Cause; Junbalat; Visitors.
Sheikh Sulaiman Jamal Al-Din Shujaa spoke on behalf of the delegation: "Your historic visit to Al-Mahall and Azhar Al-Sharif Al-Bayyadah, your sympathy with the people of Hasbiya and the surrounding area, and the deep emotional impression that you left cannot be described.
From Bahrain to Morocco there is a unity under the banner of Palestine. The banner of Palestine, the example of Hizbollah and the Intifada were in Morocco and Bahrain and all the areas in between them.
Junbalat received a delegation from the "World Maronite Council" headed by Imad Shamun; the President of the "Lebanese Youth Assembly, Faiz Mahmoud; a delegation of lecturers from Holy Spirit University in Al-Kaslik; "The Lebanese Council for Human Resources Experts", which invited him to attend the European-Mediterranean Conference on Human Resources, to be held at Al-Kaslik University from the 8th to the 10th of next May, in between which there is also a visit to Qasr Al-Mukhtarah.
It should be borne in mind that American Ambassador Vincent Patel had left Beirut on Saturday morning to participate in Al-Hariri's talks in Washington.
They made clear that Powell's visit, his first to Beirut before he travels to Damascus, aims to establish calm and prevent any regional deterioration on the Lebanese-Israeli borders and stop the Arab censure of Washington for its lack of concern at what is taking place in the south, and for failing to listen to the Lebanese view, which stresses that the resistance is mounting its military operations not out of a love of war but to liberate the Shabaa Farms area, as President of the Republic Lahud and Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri will confirm.
They noted that Powell had decided on this visit to Lebanon and Syria after having consulted first with the team that is accompanying him and secondly with the White Hose, which approved it.
Following this, an American delegation arrived from Jerusalem yesterday afternoon. They are concerned with the protocol for the visit and security and are headed by G.B.
The delegation accompanying him will comprise State Department spokesman Richard Boucher and Executive Secretary Greg Kelly. The delegation will be joined, in place of Ambassador Patel, by the charge d'affaires at the embassy Carol Kalin and by political advisor at the embassy Ann Boudin.
Deputy Secretary-General of Hizbollah Sheikh Naim Qasim confirmed, "Despite the Israeli crimes and massacres taking place with clear and explicit American support, the supporting and sinful international silence, and poor Arab indifference, history will record that the resistance fighters and the Palestinian people stood firm and acted out a great epic."
He added, "Have confidence that were the Islamic resistance not ready in the south and prepared to defend and carry out acts to shows its presence, the Israeli enemy would have perpetrated a tragedy in Lebanon. Its aircraft would have come and killed many people in a number of villages and towns and there would have been limited invasions in the name of Israeli security and to protect Israel from potential danger following its departure from Lebanon."
He concluded, "The Intifada has put the Israelis in a political, security, economic, psychological and moral impasse. This is why the Israeli response is barbaric and criminal."
Lebanese and Palestinians flags waved across the Sport City, which was half-filled, alongside the banners of the Progressive Socialist, Communist and National Syrian Social parties, Al-Murabitun and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, in addition to pictures of Che Guevara, Kamal Junbalat and Yasir Arafat, and slogans such as "Jerusalem Is Ours" and "We are all Martyrs".
Darwish began his speech by going back in time 20 years: "It was here that the siege of Beirut began 20 years ago. This is where Palestinian and Lebanese blood was shed in defense of Beirut, which did not surrender."
Now, 20 years on, we find Beirut has recovered its basis, its order and its national unity. We see our collective heart, Palestine, plunging with its flesh and blood into the final bloody installment of this tale of freedom and independence.
Everything has changed, with the exception of the criminal hero who is still the same. He has only been promoted from general to the top of government."
He answered, "Because I love life, I want to leave it laughing (...) a people who love life to this extent will not be deserted by it. They must win."
Darwish continued with a selection of his other revolutionary and combative poems, including "Record that I am an Arab", the conclusion of which was met with loud applause: "I do not hate the people, nor do I attack anyone, but when I am hungry I eat the flesh of the person who rapes me".
The final section of poetry with Darwish included a selection of poem, the most prominent of which was "Passers-by among passing words", which is addressed to the Jews.
You realize this as soon as soon as you step foot in the City environs. But not before, when all you see is an open space rebuilt for the pursuit of sporting activities, the function for which it was originally built before the war in 1975.
On 4 June 1982 Israeli military aircraft shelled it, making it the first site in the capital to be targeted by the fire of the invasion, transforming it almost to rubble.
It is the silent witness to the massacres perpetrated by the Israelis when they invaded Beirut in 1982, in Shatila Camp to be precise, which was separated from the city at that time only by sand dunes.
All were present, those commemorating and those being commemorated.
Perhaps the only difference between today and yesterday is that the place described by the poet Mahmoud Darwish in his effective words when he said, "Palestine has returned home.
The place yesterday was not Sports City.
More than 20 thousand people came yesterday to Sports City from different regions, raising the slogan "Besiege Your Siege" in solidarity with the Palestinian people in one of the forms of solidarity witnessed by Beirut on a daily basis since the bloody events began in Palestine.
Some sang, others read the opening chapter of the Quran in a loud voice.
Yesterday Beirut was the beating heart of Palestine.
Of course it would have been difficult for the Israeli army to have removed the piles of rubble and destruction out of the way of Powell's official retinue as they did when this retinue headed from the office of Chairman Arafat in Ramallah.
Would that the American Secretary of State had read the reports of the Israeli, not the western or Arab, press about the results of these "cleansing" operations when Sharon refused to give him an undertaking to a specific schedule to end the military operations of the army in the Bank, before this army completes its "cleansing" of the area from terror.
The correspondent from the "Yediot Aharonot" newspaper, who has entered Jenin Camp, looks as if it has experienced "an earthquake".
Amidst all of this the meeting took place by the American Secretary of State Colin Powell and Arafat and his aides, after an official Palestinian condemnation had been secured for the operation that took place on Friday.
Geraldine Chaplin Reveals Major Secret About Her Father: My Grandmother Wasn't Jewish, Father Never Denied It.
Chaplin's daughter thought it "a clever idea for us to discuss my mother and father's childhood, their adolescence and the 'love at first sight' that was the beginning of a very romantic story (...) My mother never left him after that.

Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi stated yesterday that Italy could receive between one and three of the 13 Palestinians exiled by Israel to Cyprus last week, when the European Union arrives at a definition of their legal status, but some parties in the government coalition oppose taking any of them.
It mentioned that a law going back to 1956 allows for the organization of special surveillance of persons believed to constitute a danger to public order.

Where Were We...Where Are We Now?
* First, a tripartite Arab summit of pivotal weight concludes with what is almost an "appeasing" declaration condemning the violence in response to American demands.
The acceptance of the "Jewishness" of the Israeli state means that the "right of return" is dropped, which amounts to a free payment, one without recompense, at a time when the tone of political decisions in Tel Aviv shifts towards abrogating any text that speaks of the Palestinian State, towards a continuation of the aggression to establish "Greater Israel".
* Sixthly, the United States of America's share of Arab condemnation, angry statements, accusations and insults parallels that of Israel. But this is one thing and seeking America as sole authority to intervene and impose a solution is something else.
How?
It wrote, "The decision of the Likud central committee contradicts the policy of the Prime Minister to date.
The details of the experimental talks with Syria were revealed by none other than Netanyahu's rival Ariel Sharon, who attacked the Likud government from the right, as is his custom, until he was elected Prime Minister.
But the committee did not support him, with about 60% of its members voting against him."
It quoted a speech that he had made to members of the Likud bloc in the Knesset in which he had said, "I hold the central committee and the bloc in esteem, but responsibility for what happens falls on my shoulders. This is a heavy burden. Two thirds of the public elected me so that I could think and take decisions.
Elsewhere, "Yediot Ahronot" quoted parts of the speech given by Sharon to the Knesset, in which he presented the escalation on the northern borders. He pointed out that Hizbollah in the north were using an advanced weapon that they had not used before.
Today, the 15th of May, coincides with the founding of the State of Israel.
Implicitly this means that it condemns acts of "martyrdom", which have been the backbone of the Intifada. The Israeli response followed quickly during a meeting of the Likud central committee, which voted with a majority of 59% of the vote against the establishment of a "Palestinian State".
* Thirdly, we must certainly recall the decision of the Arab summit in Beirut, which put forward an "Arab peace initiative", which was applauded by many in the world, against the background of relief that the Arab states had acquired a vision for peaceful settlement. But what we must recall more (on the grounds that we are a nation of the forgetful and may, in fact, have forgotten) that Sharon's government responded to this initiative with the "Protective Wall" operation, which is yet to be completed.
How?

We ask the state to reveal immediately the circumstances of this crime and to punish those responsible because it is not just a security issue, but a national, humanitarian one that may affect us all in the absence of law and security.
Despair is unjust advice and should not be followed.
There are explosions some times. The disappearance of Engineer Airani, who must come to light, one week ago is a security setback as we said at the beginning. This must stop, so that people can be reassured in their lives and livelihood.

Even talking about the machines, diggers and sand stores is forbidden. We cannot hear one word speaking about those who pulverize the mountains of Lebanon, turning them into desolate ground, whilst their pockets and bank accounts overflow with dollars.
This does not mean that the men of religion, prior to this, had been far removed from politics and the affairs of government, but their interaction with the political arena had not been united. Some of them had supported some of the kings whilst others kept themselves well away from the government.
Since the Safavid period religious scholars have come to hold great influence in Iran. This class has come to have social status, rights and immunity in comparison with the other classes.
During the Qajarite and Pahlavi periods the first group were active. They represented a minority, one that was opposed by another minority, namely those who wanted government to be established by the scholars. Most continued to exercise the doctrine of dissimulation and did not believe it permissible to intervene in political matters.
But the presence of a cleric in the position of an advisor, guide and demagogue changed him in positions of government and executive positions.
Dollar and Stock Exchanges Rise Further With Support from American Economic Fundamentals.
Abroad, the dollar continued to strengthen its positions against the other major currencies, and especially after the publication of the retail sales index in the United States, which recorded a rise above expectations at 1.2 per cent last month, instead of 0.6 per cent as had been expected. This is the highest since last October, against 0.1 per cent in March, in a development that reflected the level of increase in consumer spending by Americans, which generally forms two thirds of the volume of the economy. This stimulated the demand for shares in the Wall Street and Nasdaq Stock Exchanges, which was paralleled with the dollar.

Following the end of the visit by American Minister of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to India and Pakistan, at the end of which he was reassured that the danger of nuclear confrontation between the two countries had ended and he also called for an end to the exchange of fire and shelling in Kashmir, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee chaired a meeting of the Ministerial Security Committee to discuss the results of his talks with Rumsfeld.
He said that the penetration of Islamists from Pakistani Kashmir had diminished slightly, "but I do not believe it has stopped and we do not know for how long this will continue".
Following a strong Pakistani reaction, Rumsfeld was forced to retreat from his statement. He said that he did not have irrefutable evidence that members from "Al-Qaeda" were present in Kashmir.
The agency said that Musharraf had praised the efforts made by the Minister to improve Pakistan's image in the international community.
"The Council of Jewish Municipalities in Judea and Samaria", which brings together about two hundred thousand West Bank settlements, held an Extraordinary Meeting that lasted several hours on Sunday, during which it discussed security issues, in the wake of two Palestinian attacks targeting two settlements in the north and south of the West Bank, in which three were killed and four wounded.
60 unplanned settlement points have been set up in the past few years.
The settlers held an emergency meeting in Beit Eil, near Ramallah, on Monday after the army decided to withdraw its soldiers from Ghifaat Assaf, an unplanned settlement point several kilometers away from the settlement where five families have lived since the start of 2001 in several prefabricated buildings in response to the killing of settler Assaf Herschkofic at the hands of Palestinians in the area.
A woman who has lived in Beit Eil for ten years asked, "We face problems in protecting ourselves, so why should we undertake to protect some families who have not obtained any permission to live in that place?" She recommended moving the inhabitants of Ghifaat Assaf within the settlement.
Spokesman for the settlers Yashu Mor Yusif said that the debate about the unplanned settlements was inappropriate.
Following the permanent appointment of Hamid Qarzai to the position he has occupied for six months at the head of the interim administration in Afghanistan with the support of the American administration, the Council of Tribal Elders, the Loya Jirga, has entered a decisive stage for the formation of the government, which will determine the opportunities of the Pashtun leader to safeguard the unity of Afghanistan.
He confirmed that he possessed secret information that would force his release.
The two men were talking yesterday before the "International Security and War Against Terror" Conference, organized by the Austrian government in Vienna.

He was appointed at the end of last week as part of the government changes conducted by Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat in the context of the reform plan that the American administration had demanded in order to make progress in the peace steps.
He added, "I will not accept by any means that the name of the Palestinian people should be soiled by terrorism."
Ankara - "Al-Nahar":
Washington - Reuters - An American official confirmed yesterday that President George Bush did not raise with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal the issue of Saudi men keeping custody of their children in the Kingdom despite their having American mothers.
There are 46 disputes by Americans over the custody of children with Saudis, covering 92 children.
In the event that it is approved, the Bishops will seek the approval of the Vatican to the main parts of the proposal, which will make it a binding law for the American Catholic Church.
In their meeting on Thursday, the Bishops began to admit that the mistakes they had made had helped make the crisis worse. In a speech Bishop Wilton Gregory described the crisis as "perhaps the worst we have faced".
There was no information about any arrests.
Belgium television quoted investigators as saying that the stolen goods may have been sent to the "Taliban" movement and that the operation appeared to be linked to Tunisian Nazar Tarabulsi, who was detained on the 13th of September and is suspected of having prepared for an attack on the American Embassy in Paris.
They succeeded in making a get away taking with them five of the seven boxes. The loot was valued at 6.5 million Euros.
One of the military said that he had discovered 52 rebel corpses in the mountainous strip of Salyan, 280 km west of Katmandu, following the ambush prepared by the rebels against a military convoy on Wednesday evening in Damashawar.
He explained that the organisation of this referendum would be subject to the authority of Cuban social organizations, not that of the state.
With these confrontations, the battles that have been ongoing since the end of March between rebels and the government army have shifted from the area surrounding Brazzaville to within the city.
During the day an officer confirmed, "We have gained complete control of the situation", despite the rebels being able to penetrate to Mokudu Mafilo and Labaz, near the Maya Maya Airport on the western side of the Congolese capital.
These elections are taking place against the acceptance by public opinion of the possibility of the "Union for a Presidential Majority" winning 70% of the seats in the National Assembly.
43% hope for a "clear and comfortable" majority for the right whilst 42% hope for balance with the results of the first round in favor of the left.
Leaders from right and left are competing to sweet-talk those refraining from voting, who form the largest "party" in France (35% of voters).
If the predictions are accurate, the political system will restore to President Jacque Chirac his leading role, allowing him to implement his policy after he was long frustrated over five years, following his disbandment of the National Assembly in 1997. Chirac denied he wished to form a "Presidential System" as a number of his political enemies hinted, with close associates quoting him as saying, "The Prime Minister is in charge of the Ministers and not a Director of the President of the Republic's Office".
"Islamic Group": Blood, Blood and Destruction, Destruction; 12 Dead in Two Attacks in Algeria.
However, witnesses said that this attack was mounted "by at least six people".
14 people were injured on Thursday in a bomb explosion in a café in Jalidah, in the state of Ain Al-Dafli, 130 km south west of Algiers.
A leaflet distributed in his name said: "No truce, no dialogue, no conciliation, no security. Only blood, blood, and destruction, destruction (...) We will continue to destroy their crops, plunder their possessions, rape their women, and cut off their heads in the towns, villages and deserts."
Kothari, an Indian engineer, visited Israel and the Palestinian areas in January. In his report of 27 pages he accused Israel of exploiting "the present crisis to consolidate its occupation" of Palestinian areas.
He observed that whilst Israel claimed that settlement expansion was "natural" in view of the population increase, the number of settlers rose by 12% each year, whilst the population increase was no more than 2%.
He quoted Israeli human right groups with whom he is still in contact since his recent visit as saying that thousands of homes had been destroyed and thousands others were threatened.
He noted, "The issue of settlements is political, over which Israel and the Palestinians differ (...) we have submitted detailed proposals to resolve these problems, but the Palestinians severed the talks.
(AP)
He clarified that the incident took place in front of a garage in the settlement, which is located to the west of Nablus.
Eight people, among them seven women, were in a taxi when the Israeli tank opened fire, according to the taxi driver, Isam Samar.
The driver was able to leave the site after the soldiers searched his car.
The unit arrested the Palestinians, Fadi Duwaik and Rabi Shuwaikah and took them away with them.
On the 3rd of last June the Palestinian High Court of Justice ordered the release of Saadat, but the Palestinian leadership decided to keep him in prison following the issue of Israeli threats against him.
The organization says that it is essential to release Saadat because no charge has been made against him and he has not appeared in any court since he was arrested on the 15th of last January.
He said that "it is not allowed" to build a wall on borders other than those of the 4th of June."
The Israeli Ministry of Defense announced on Tuesday that the construction works should begin "at the end of the week or the beginning of the coming week" between the two towns of Kafr Salim and Kafr Qasim.
Following the undertaking given by American President George Bush to deploy the Missile Defense System as soon as possible to protect the United States and its allies, and his confirmation that Washington is cooperating in this area with Moscow by means of finally burying the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty "ABM" on the date his country withdraws from it, Russian Minister of Defense Serge Ivanov clarified that the existence of a missile defense system was "hypothetical" and not a reality and that there could be no justification for speaking of a response from Moscow. The Russian Foreign Ministry has adopted the view that the "START 2" treaty has been revoked.
Now we face threats from terrorists who plan to destroy our civilization using any means available to mercenary states possessing weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles."
In an indication of Bush's determination to proceed with his plan regarding the missile defense system, the American Ministry of Defense, the "Pentagon", is moving to prepare the restricted area of Fort Greeley in Alaska to build six underground missile bunkers.
A statement issued by the Russian Foreign Minister said that Moscow had come to view the "START 2" disarmament treaty signed in January 1993 with the United States as revoked after "Russia had noted the absence of a number of elements preventing implementation of START 2, and no longer considers itself to be bound by it".
The tests showed that a missile guided by a radar system could bring down a medium or long-range missile in specific circumstances.
The only person accused by the United States of involvement in the 11 September attacks, French national of Moroccan origin Zacaria Moussaoui, denied before the court that he had contacted the hijackers of the aircraft that crashed into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York and the American Ministry of Defense building, the "Pentagon", in Washington.
In a broken but singular English accent, the French citizen referred to secret information that might help him in his case.
The American authorities confirmed that they were trying to secure the death sentence for Moussaoui if he is found guilty of the charges brought against him, which are conspiracy to perpetrate a terrorist act, hijack an aircraft, destroy an aircraft, use weapons of mass destruction, kill American government officials and destroy property.
He said that Moussaoui was not behaving rationally.
My life is in danger and I will not gamble."
The Iraqi "Al-Thawrah" newspaper called on the British press to amend its "hostile" policy towards Iraq instead of its vulgar subordination to American policy, which has caused it to be "hated" in the Arab and Islamic world.
Baghdad referred on Thursday to the firing of surface-air missiles against British and American strike aircraft that were mounting raids in the north and south of the country, which had forced them to "flee".
But he did not explain whether his country would join the attack on Baghdad, deeming it sufficient to say that his government would adopt a position "in light of the conditions at the right time".
But we will seek the advice of our friends before any military attack."
It believed, "It is the right of the British peoples to worry at what may happen to its pilots at the hands of the Iraqi resistance to the aggression. But they must ask (Minister of Defense Geoff) Hoon and the head of government (Tony Blair) first: Why do you send your people to aggress against an independent country thousands of miles from the islands of Britain?"
The assistant American representative to the United Nations, Ambassador James Cunningham, told his Syrian counterpart, "We must speak clearly.
He said, "Syria, whose representative currently holds the chairmanship of the Security Council, continues to support acts of violence against Israeli citizens."
Whatever the case, Wahbah dropped the description "noble" when addressing Lankari in favor of the expression "representative of Israel", as he did with all the speakers.

"Maariv" Communicates Strong American Warnings to Damascus: Continued Support for "Hizbollah" Will Lead to Strike.
But the problem is that he has responded to them the opposite of what was expected in fact: He is preparing for the possible Israeli strike instead of trying to prevent it.
The reason: The Iranians have stopped the activities of the observation station on its territory, whose task it was to monitor nuclear experiments and activities.
As for the Americans, in addition to Edward Djirdjian, they sent a few officials from Washington.

Suicide Attack on American Consulate Kills 11, Unknown Group Claims Responsibility; Bush: Karachi Attack Will Not Frighten United States; Washington; New Delhi; Paris.
Karachi Police Commander Tariq Jamil stated, "It was a car bomb ... the explosion was so powerful that the car flew from one side of the road to the other."
The bodies of the dead were torn to shreds, which makes it difficult to know how many there were.
Parts of the "Suzuki" car that was probably carrying the explosives flew in all directions and landed in the Janah Garden in front of the consulate. The remaining parts from the roof of the car fell in the public toilets.

Matters will crystallize from today as far as knowing the preliminary results of the positions adopted during the coordination meeting, which was held in Washington and which included Burns, Fadoufen and Moratinos, who accompanied Solana on his tour, and Rod-Larsen.
They stopped at the variable position shown by Bush according to the officials he meets. With the Israeli Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, he is in favor of staged implementation, that is security first to control the suicide operations completely and then make the required reforms from the Palestinian Authority as a secondary step.
Powell hastened to correct this, after White House Spokesman Ari Fleischer had preceded him, and repeated the correction when he criticized the formation of the new Palestinian government.
The sources had no information on the current Washington meetings. These are, in addition to the meeting of delegates, the meeting of Powell with Al-Faisal, the Palestinian Minister of Planning and International Cooperation, Nabil Shaath, and numerous American meetings supervised by Bush in preparation for the address he will give next week, probably on Tuesday, to announce the position on the prevailing situation and ways of dealing with it.
It is noted that "the international Group of Four" has not responded to Lebanon's request for a meeting to be held with it in the name of a ministerial delegation representing the summit.
They called on officials "not to spare any effort to work to consolidate social security and give maximum care, attention and concern to the new generation, so that Lebanon will not lose out with the emigration of its young people, its foremost and most important resource".
Apologies were received from Archbishop Ghafrail Al-Salibi, Metropolitan of Western Europe, for not attending.

At Baabda Palace yesterday, President of the Republic Emil Lahud received Minister of State for Administrative Development Affairs Fuad Al-Saad, who acquainted him with the results of a seminar held in Beirut to discuss the matter of "The Republic's Intermediary", in which Republican Intermediaries from more than 18 Arab, European and American states took part. He presented him with the initial copy of the annual report about the work of the Ministry of Administrative Development Affairs, which included the most prominent achievements in the administrative field and the courses it had organized, notably those concerning the relationship between the state's departments and citizens.
History, both ancient and modern, has taught us that whenever the Lebanese stance is unified, good is achieved for the country. Whenever the Lebanese are disparate, the role of the conspirators grows and they are able to harm it and its people.
During the meetings a number of topics and the needs of the Bishri area were discussed.
Nasr thanked Lahud for honoring him when he awarded him the National Cedars Honor at rank of Commander and entrusted Minister of Industry George Afram to give it to him at a ceremony in the United States.
He also met with artist Sami Baqlini on the occasion of his visit to Lebanon and of his holding an exhibition at the Goethe Institute in Beirut, following the series of exhibitions held in Canada, and a number of cities of the Lebanese Diaspora.
The delegation accompanying him will include: the Director of Political Affairs, Naji Abi Asi, Director of Economic Affairs, Masud Al-Maaluf, and Director of the Minister's Office, Muhammad Al-Dib.
He enumerated the economic subjects covered by the agreement, which, by way of example but not exhaustively, include the following:
4 - Liberalization of the influx of capital and aspects of financial cooperation.
He added, "The agreement includes a number of agreements: the partnership agreement, the final agreement, and there is a transitional agreement for a period of five years that will enter into effect two months after it is signed on the 17th of June 20002 for Lebanon to export its products without customs duties.
Partnership was agreed in Barcelona in 1995 when Lebanon began talks with the Union, but this stopped in 1997 before resuming in 1998 and stopping again. They resumed in 2000 and continued without stopping until January 2002 until it was initialed on the 10th of last January in Brussels.
The European-Mediterranean Committee exchanged views on the Valencia plan of action, the "road map". Discussion dealt with commercial relations between European-Mediterranean partners.
The response said, "In response to the items included in the question presented by Mr. Nazih Mansur relating to the plan of the Middle East Airline to develop its air fleet, deposited under number 71/S on 24/04/2002, we hereby clarify the following:
Secondly, in connection with the dismissal of employees and restructuring:
As regards finding a strategic partner, the World Bank International Financing Organization has continued its efforts in this area at a time when the international aircraft industry is experiencing a major crisis following the events of 11 September, and at a time when the world economy is experiencing a depression crisis in light of the a number of airlines being offered for sale in the Middle East region. Contacts conducted by the International Financing Organization in this regard indicate that the market conditions will not allow this option in the current year.
The deductions that the company was able to obtain on the account of the conditions of the international aircraft industry as a result of the events of 11 September and the international economic recession were very appropriate for the time of the purchase. Focus was given to not paying any direct or indirect commissions of any type.
The results for the first quarter of 2002 are encouraging, with the company not recording any operating losses, which means that provided bookings and tourism and travel movement continue as present the financial results for this year will be better than expected in the budget (...)."
The following statement was issued after the meeting:
2- We support the decision to stop cars running on gas oil in return for the provision of fair compensation for their owners, in order to lighten their suffering, provided that it covers all cars and trucks.
Not to mention the voices that are raised in protest at the suspicious practices of workers in the Lebanon Electricity Organization in specific areas whilst other areas enjoy special treatment.
We also point out that the conditions and circumstances for the official examinations on the basis of this curriculum have been dropped after the great facilitation and numerous chances given to candidates, which has allowed the vast majority to pass when there are among their number many who fall below the minimum level required.
Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir, Patriarch of the Maronite Church, welcomed MP Butrus Harb to Bakraki yesterday. Harb described the visit saying, "The visit aimed at discussing recent political developments with His Holiness, including the al Matn election, its atmosphere, which could have led to tension, which could have damaged the major constitutional achievement-the defeat of the government candidate by the opposition candidate."
The service was held by Father Ostfan Franjieh, assisted by a number of priests and monks.
Following the requiem, Minister Franjieh and the family received condolences.
My granddaughter Nadine asked me, "What have you gained from working half a century in journalism, particularly since you started your career when you were 16?"
Nadine was not convinced by my point of view. Immediately she said, "But many of your colleagues in the press are living luxurious lives and have plenty of money in their bank accounts. Grandfather, do you consider richness a sin?"
Nadine's tears emerged, and she said, "Thank you, Grandfather, thanks to you I realize that satisfaction is truly an 'everlasting treasure.'"
I was also surprised to find out that all applications related to civil servants are pending until they employ someone to replace the retired Council official, who reached the legal age on 2/16/2002.
Adel Wahba wondered why the Ministry of Interior stopped publishing lists of license plates of cars that are subject to mechanic charges, especially after license plates have been replaced.

Will Drivers of Public Transport Vehicles Stop Driving Their Cars if the Government Manages to Enforce its Decision?
We asked driver Ilias Assaf whether he has concerns about his health from inhaling the poisonous fumes of diesel fuels.
"I am sure that we drivers will go to the homes of President Lahoud and President Berri to have our meals with them."
Walid Ali said, "I drive 300 kilometers a day and earn around 40,000 liras."
Ali Rammal, who has been a taxi driver for 15 years and has been using a diesel engine for five years, thinks the solution lies in one of two things: "Either providing clean diesel fuel, or reducing the price of gasoline to 10,000 liras per gallon for public vehicle drivers; that means selling gasoline at cost price. We support maintaining the environment, but if the government stops diesel-operated cars and vans, then what will they do about their own diesel-operated large buses?"
He raised the issue of illegal competition practiced by some without being punished, such as cases of using a single license plate for several cars, and private cars that operate in crowded areas or along the coast line when policemen are off duty.
Members of archeological expeditions excavating in the Middle East region and participating in the International Conference on the History of the Bronze Age held in Lebanon on the 10th-17th of the current month, have spent three days in the most important Middle Eastern archeological site of Tal Irqa. The site is considered a record of peoples who lived around 2500 years B.C.
Professor Jean-Paul Talman, the head of the French archeological expedition excavating in Tal Irqa welcomed the participating expeditions. He escorted them to the site that the French expedition has been excavating for 30 years, notably a Bronze Age excavation.
Dr Jean-Paul Talman has tracked the remains of the fourth ancient and first intermediary Bronze Ages in Irqa, suggesting a link between the remains of Irqa and the historical city of Jubayl. He focused on the third Bronze Age when Jubayl cut its ties with Egypt and was affiliated with the northern ancient east, which includes northern Lebanon, Syria, and a part of Turkey. Indications of such an approach could be found in the presence of pottery pieces and iron spears in Jubayl.
Apparently, U.S. President George Bush's administration is incapable of full confrontation with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. Therefore, in order to avoid embarrassment, it chose a temporary Palestinian state formula in the vision that Bush will announce soon. Bush will present his ideas that he believes could work as grounds for settlement between the Palestinians and the Israelis.
This explains the change in Bush's position, that negotiations should not start unless violence has totally "ceased," according to American terminology.
In his recent visit to the Washington, Sharon managed to convince Bush to slow down the process of setting a date and venue for the international conference, which was originally suggested by the Israeli Prime Minister himself during the peak of Israel's military operations in the West Bank last April.
Another troubling issue to the Israeli Prime Minister is the presentation approach of Bush's vision, which includes further U.S. recognition of the Palestinians' right to establish an independent state.
The temporary state, or the state that will be established among barriers installed by Sharon in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, does not represent a fair political price for the Palestinians. As such, Bush's vision will not be the desired solution if it is not based on a balanced position. That means putting pressure on Israel to withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the borders of June 4, 1967, which is a minimum requirement for establishing any viable Palestinian state.
Between requiring Palestinian internal reform and the suggestion of a temporary state that is to serve as an experimental state, Washington is agreeing to Sharon's request and is not opening a true political horizon for which the Palestinians may take the risk of stopping resistance.
Hence, Mubarak concentrated on gathering Arab support for an interim settlement, starting with a Palestinian state in accordance with Security Council Resolution 1397 issued last March 13. He also suggested that statehood would be declared in early 2003. Its borders are to be finalized after timed negotiations that would cover all issues of dispute. Negotiations should not last more than three years.
What happened to Archbishop Haddad drives us to urge Lebanese officials, particularly clerical and secular officials of the Church, not to underestimate this incident, as we used to do in our country. On the contrary, we have to search in what is known as the Christian community for its background, causes, and the predominant atmosphere that led to it.  In this regard we need to make the following remarks:
Therefore, we are reprinting the paragraphs in their proper form:
The regrettable attack on Archbishop Gregoire Haddad took place after his appearance in "Tele-Lumiere" TV network interviews, in which he dealt with Christian religious and theological topics. Motives behind the offensive push  Lebanese citizens, in general, and Lebanese Christians, in particular, to try to shed light on this incident. It might not have been randomly done, accidental, or merely a reaction of a group of people provoked at Archbishop Haddad's audacious views.
Its danger can reach all sectors of society.
Fourth, we would like to ask officials of the church and also the politicians about the role they should play in preserving the freedom of political, religious, and cultural speech, and to avoid falling into the confinement of prohibitions in the age of globalization. They should bear in mind that since we were children and until now we keep hearing that Lebanon is the refuge of liberties, the oppressed, etc.
These questions may be larger than the group's potential; however, we are still in the beginning.
Union of Chambers and Fuleihan Discuss Integration of Private Sector into Global System
"As Lebanon is making efforts to be incorporated in the new world system, a strategic and economic position should be defined in light of its current geopolitical status quo, which does not agree with the trends of change."
"This memorandum was drafted in coordination with the private sector, after holding bilateral and multilateral negotiations. It is a process of association with active rules, laws, and legislation."
Then the Minister's advisor, Mazen Hanna, explained the objectives of the process for joining the World Trade Organization, as well as the technical aspects of the process.
The total deficit for that period was 1565 billion, which is equivalent to a deficit rate of 41.43%, compared to a total deficit for the same period the previous year of 1406 billion, at a rate of 42.6%.
The summarized financial position also shows that the levied tax revenues until the end of May registered an increase of 321 billion pounds compared to the same period the previous year. This is in spite of the extended period for filing corporate revenue tax statements, which usually ends on May 31. As there were several festivals and holidays during that month, the ministry extended the period to 6/10/2002, which means that part of those revenues will appear among the revenues that will be realized during the current month of June.
With regard to the treasury deficit reported until the end of May of the current year, this deficit amounted to 545 billion, a rate of 76.32% of the aggregate treasury operations, compared to a reported deficit of 271 billion pounds during the same period of the previous year, at a rate of 56.62% of the aggregate treasury operations.
Mayer explained that he came to Beirut to sign a financing loan contract in favor of the Port of Tripoli and that there are other projects financed by the Bank and currently under implementation, such as sewerage projects, the Mideiraj-Shatura road, the infrastructures of Grand Beirut, and the refinery in Sur.
Then Mayer and the accompanying delegation visited Prime Minister Rafik Al-Hariri in Quraytam. Finance and Economy Ministers Fuad El- Seniora and Basil Fuleihan attended the meeting, as did the Governor of Bank of Lebanon Riyad Salama and Construction and Development Council Chairman Jamal Itani.
A financing agreement was signed two days ago in the Construction and Development Council between the Council and the European Investment Bank to finance the expansion and development of Tripoli port project. Chairman of the Council Jamal Itani and Bank President Francis Mayer signed the agreement.
He reviewed projects financed by the Bank in various sectors, particularly infrastructural projects.
The amount of the loan will be used to execute the Port of Tripoli expansion project, which was started by the Port Investment Authority two years ago.
Constructing a secondary north and south wave breaker with an approximate length of 1300 meters to protect the port from sea waves.
He added "markets are needed for our products and for strengthening our ability to compete."
Abboud presented the solutions suggested by the Society that can reinforce industry and promote its competitiveness.
After the opening session, the first session was held under the title "Means and Mechanisms of Developing Syrian-Lebanese Relations." Former chairman of the Society of Industrialists Jacques Sarraf chaired the session. The Secretary General of the Supreme Syrian-Lebanese Council, Nasri Khuri, participated in the session and noted that the Brotherhood and Coordination treaty has set for the first time a futuristic view of the economy in both countries. It also determined the applied mechanisms that can transform the treaty into reality.
During the third session, a roundtable discussion addressed new investment opportunities in Lebanon along with emerging markets. It was attended by the Investment Encouragement Institution and Ramco Printing.
Minister of Finance Fuad El-Senyora announced that an agreement has been reached between the Ministry of Finance and the international company Global Refund to manage refunding of the value-added tax paid by tourists. He revealed that the company will assume the operation as of the 22nd of this month and will refund tourists who have departed Lebanon via the airport since the value-added tax was applied last February.
He mentioned that the company has a month to arrange its affairs and apply its program, starting with the Beirut Airport.
Every organization will be required to pay an annual subscription fee of 69,000 pounds, an extremely low rate compared to all other countries.
Al-Senyora considered that the agreement was made with the best possible terms so that the treasury would not spend a single lira. The mechanism will encourage trade operations and will promote exports, consequently enabling Lebanon to be a center for shopping and tourism.
Improvement Expected in Balance of Payments Following March Surplus Salama: Privatization to Include Al-Riji, Telephones, and Casino
He stated that priorities in this regard will be based on the offers submitted to the government and might include more than one type.

He foresees a positive impact on the market after the privatization of some governmental inputs.
He expected that the results of the balance of payments during the month of June will also be positive "based on data currently available to the Bank of Lebanon."
He promised to discuss the issue with the Central Council, showing an understanding in the banks' concerns in this regard.
The Governor said that the Central Council will consider the bill.
Charming are the works of Rafael, Schubert, Liszt, and Chopin when they are reborn from an inspired heart, filled with its Eastern culture. The touches of that culture fascinated those works and unearthed their charming, hidden secrets.
Abdel Rahman Al-Basha, with his strong technique and unique ability in mastering his instrument, does not drop for a minute the close relationship between music's body and soul. He follows the paths of all the composers that he invited that evening.
From Rafael to Franz Liszt, the first performance in the program was a journey on the path of an artist inside whom the music lived until it became his language, living and painful.
In seclusion with his instrument, just like a stranger on a deserted island, we all become shadows around him receiving his light when he plays. His fingers are so smooth, making each and every note an act of beauty and elegance.
So from Liszt to Schubert and Chopin, the listener recognizes the quiet depth that is fervent in Abdel Rahman Al-Basha's breath.
Schubert's "Sonata in A Minor" is sad and gloomy. Al-Basha treated it as if living a personal ordeal.
From the fresh "Scherzos" to the tragic "Funeral March," it was a crescendo with his fingers.
The demonstration showed the determination not to forget the crime. Attorney Seleem Uthman delivered a speech on behalf of the victims' families, in which he described the crime as a terrorist act. His words carried strong condemnation for ignoring the crime and failing to bring the criminals to justice.
Second, this demonstration was intended to respond to the judiciary's critics.
Will the speeches of today end the judiciary's silence, whether in crucial times or when it comes under fire? Will the judiciary adopt new techniques that prevent the banning of information, in order to commemorate the coming anniversary without the mourning of today's memorial ceremonies?
The assailant's angry voice broke the silence of the night: "You are a Zionist . . . Traitor!" and shouts became louder. The same expression repeated again and again.
The ten people were put in jail. An investigation will be held according to regulations.
"When the Bishop arrived, a discussion began between him and these young men. Suddenly, one of them hit him."
Al-Nahar newspaper published a report yesterday titled "Extremists and No Background for the Assault Attempt."
In his note, Minister of Justice Sameer Al-Jisr responded to these campaigns and considered the judiciary to be "the martyr of fabrication, the martyr of persistent pressure, the martyr of general judgments, and martyr of misuse of power."
The owner of the car appeared after security forces and the Beirut Fire Brigade managed to extinguish the fire. His name is Michel Afeef Abd El-Noor, born in Eintoura-Kisrawan. He had parked the car in the parking lot at 10:00 a.m.
How painful was the sight of the assault against Bishop Gregoire Haddad yesterday evening in front of all the Lebanese who watched the "Lebanese Broadcast Institution."
It contradicts the church as much as it contradicts the essence of Lebanese principles.
Bishop Gregoire Haddad fell under those hostile blows that are against the spirit of Lebanon and the spirit of the gospel. With him, the symbol that Lebanon represents also fell. The real, open, believing and disbelieving Lebanon. Lebanon of the soul and intellect, not the Lebanon of bigotry, ignorance, and blindness.
Two years
For the land is inhabited by echo
In a step between palms
Throwing tears of blood
The scent of morning
Chatting on the hills
A torn face
The scent of the prairies
In the field of victory
And say:
Telling the story of the times of all seasons
And the slaughtered passion
In Al-Aqsa . . . and Christ's altar
The scent of some that
The tyrants slaughtering men
Promising a victory
Where are the promises that
In which we read the history
Dr. Domat Salama, Head of Social and Behavioral Science Section at the University's College of Human Sciences, delivered a speech saying, "In her book 'Going Back to Roots,' Dr. Malik focuses on the difficulties faced by Lebanese immigrants after resettling in their homeland."
"The rest is details."
It was then the turn of Haytham Jum'a, the General Manager of the Ministry of Expatriates. He delivered a speech saying, "The book addressed one of the most important issues of returning Lebanese immigrants in an accurate and objective manner, because it is the result of field work. The significance lies in her identification of the problems of youth and children who were born and lived away from home, with all the accompanying psychological and social problems they faced because of living in different society, which generates a transformation in the factors of social life and radical changes in mentality and behavior."
She also narrated the case of some Lebanese who are hesitating between staying in Lebanon and emigrating.
The national anthem was played in the opening ceremony, before Chairman of the League of Secondary Education Teachers Dr. Ahmad Sinjiqdar delivered a speech before conferees. Dr. Sinjiqdar reviewed the obstacles that seriously damaged scientific education and changed views of teachers.
"All these issues, along with other requirements we make, are aimed at protecting public schools and the development of public education."
"Can you imagine, for example, that we have to bring 20,000 teachers in for a General Assembly meeting every time we need to change a single letter in our bylaws?"
"Last year, and on this very same occasion and place, I called for a unified framework in which all members of the educational sector in Lebanon would work."
"Establishing job descriptions and standardizing salaries for equivalent posts according to qualifications and experience, as well as filling the gap between salaries of a single category, a single post, and all categories, will also serve the cause."
In His Inspection Tour of Baccalaureate and "Old" Intermediary Exams, "Questions Are Not Complicated But Not Simple," Murad said.
Others left their studies less than ten years ago.
He added, "We have listened to the students during the tour. Some of them found the exams difficult, while others found them easy, and yet some others found them average."
"We wish everyone success, especially since the process, questions, control, and marking of these exams will be orderly, which is something we have noticed in all aspects of this center."
Answering a question on whether it would be an additional privilege if holders of intermediary certificates were allowed to apply for the baccalaureate, he replied, "These exams are identical to those in mainstream schools in every aspect regarding the questions."
He replied, "The beginning is always difficult before people get used to it."
Willpower creates miracles. It shows that man, unlike any other creature, enjoys the power of mind, heart, and conscience.
Boulos Salam also had such a powerful drive, energetic spirit, and brilliant mind that he tamed pain to the extent that he savored it.
Helen was born on June 27, 1880, in Tuscumbia, a small town in Alabama, U.S.A.
"Inside her was a power struggling to be released." This is what the American scientist Alexander Graham Bell said in describing her. Bell was married to a deaf and dumb woman, and he "had a remarkable way of communicating with the disabled."
She used to swim and row powerfully and swiftly. She also used to attend concerts and "listen" to the tunes with her feet and fingers placed near the musical instruments.
"The flowers in my office do not all have the same scent. Regular oranges do not have the same odor or taste as Indian oranges. The same can be said about colors."
"It is also easy to recognize a willful, depressed, frightened, or careless person."
She said, "My friends wrote my life story."
The French government honored Bushra Adra, the advisor of International and Francophonic Relations of the Ministry of Education and Higher Education. It granted her the "Academic Palm" award in recognition of her contributions to French language education in the North, establishing the League of French Language Teachers, organizing French language courses for public and private schools in the North, and consolidating Lebanese-French communication through education and Francophonism.
"to serve her society humbly. She has ensured regular operation of the Centre culturel français in Tripoli during the devastating war. Mrs. Adra established the National League of French Language Teachers (...) and instituted it through training courses for teachers. She cooperated with educational organizations, the United Nations Development Program, municipalities, and the Centre culturel français. (...)"
"The first honor is this large audience consisting of notable figures and friends, and most important, my husband Said Adra. (...) The second honor is receiving this high-ranking French award."
The International Football Federation (FIFA) decided yesterday to assign the goal scored in the tenth minute of the match between Costa Rica and Brazil two days ago to Brazilian forward player Ronaldo, instead of assigning it to Costa Rica's player Luis Marin, who supposedly goaled his own team by mistake.

New Delhi accused Islamabad yesterday of being behind the attack in Jammu-the winter capital of Indian Kashmir-last Saturday. Twenty-seven civilians were killed and 35 others were injured. The attack warned of renewed tension between the two South Asian nuclear powers.
On an invitation from Gol Agha, the meeting will be attended by governors of Helmund, Orozgan, Farah, Zabul, and Namruz regions.
He explained, "Al-Amoudi was hit in the early hours of the evening with a bullet in the head. His condition was critical when he was admitted to Al-Shafa hospital. Several surgeries were performed but failed to save his life."
The Libyan Secretary of the General People's Committee of the People's Bureau for External Liaison and International Cooperation Abd EL-Rahman Shalqam and his counterpart Sun held a working meeting, during which they expressed their intention to "push bilateral cooperation forward, expand it, and intensify its operations by signing extra agreements and exchanging visits."
The Gaddafi Charity Foundation, directed by the Libyan leader's son Seif Al-Islam Qaddafi, had aided North Korea, which is suffering a food crisis.
The victim, who was the father of six children, was stabbed in the back by two white men with shaved heads and a woman in her twenties while he was repairing his son's car on the sidewalk. He was transferred to a hospital and died there, police stated.
He believed that the man was "in the wrong place at the wrong time."
Investigations of the massacre, which occurred during World War II in the town of Bidfaine, showed that hundreds of Jews were slaughtered by a group of locals, not by the occupying German forces.
"Again, this does not mean that anyone can tell us what to do."
London-Reuters-A group of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) researchers announced yesterday that progress has been made in discovering a naturally occurring gene that prevents the development of the deadly disease.
He said, "It is a development in the discovery of what VIF does. That is very important news."
After a week of sharp criticism, the government of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon revised its position yesterday and decided not to support a bill prohibiting Arab citizens from owning land in Jewish areas.
Meanwhile, a source reported the Prime Minister as saying, "It would not be the right thing to pass a law unless we are absolutely sure that it is necessary (...) and an important issue for the social fabric and relations between Jews and Arabs, and among the Jews themselves."
Last week, the Israeli government decided to present the bill after a 17-2 vote. The bill was submitted by the extremist MP Hayem Drukman to the Knesset for approval, raising a storm among Labor Party cabinet members who left the session for prior engagements before the vote.

*In Rabat, Moroccan press called for protecting "national sovereignty," condemning the Spanish position on the issue of the island of Laila.
It added, "To Jose Maria Isnar, accepting the accomplished fact would mean losing self-confidence and endangering the last Spanish colonies in Africa."
It added that the Presidency of the Union is "extremely concerned about the situation induced by Morocco" on the island.

He said, "Nidal Abd El-Raouf Al-Amoudi (27 years old), resident of Beit Lahia, was killed by a bullet in the head fired by the IDF."
They added that Abd al-Wahhab left his home quickly after the jet fighter roared through the skies.
In the West Bank an Israeli unit, entering Balata refugee camp near Nablus to impose a curfew, killed a 19-year-old Palestinian.
This incident, which took place early Saturday night, triggered an alert in central Israel, reminding Israelis that attacks can happen in spite of the IDF's almost total sealing of the West Bank and the curfew imposed on hundreds of thousands of Palestinian citizens.
He added, "The means to achieving that is by bold confrontation and by achieving a series of tactical successes on the battlefield to prevent violence and to undermine terrorism's ability to gain any profit."
New Delhi accused Islamabad yesterday of plotting last Saturday's attack in Jamo, Indian Kashmir's winter capital. The attack left 27 people dead and 35 injured, and it warned of renewing tensions between the two opposing South Asian nuclear powers.
The new attack drives India and Pakistan, who already have fought three wars since the division of the Indian subcontinent in 1947, to the verge of a new war, after New Delhi accused Islamabad of backing Islamic separatist insurgence in Indian Kashmir.
Pakistani authorities condemned the attack, considering it to be "apparently aimed at triggering tension in the area," a statement issued by the Foreign Ministry mentioned before the New Delhi accusations to Islamabad.
The Chairman of the Council Sayid Salah said, "The attack against the Hindu minority is an act of terrorism. True Kashmiri warriors target only Indian forces and official facilities. They never attack civilians, regardless of their religion or affiliation."
After the attack on the New Delhi parliament, which killed 14, the two countries mobilized one million soldiers on their common borders, particularly on the observation line separating the Indian and Pakistani sectors of Kashmir.
Diplomatic pressure continued. U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell is expected to arrive in the area by the end of the month on a visit that was planned before the attack.

American Warplanes Raid Southern Iraq; Baghdad Ignores Opposition Conference in London and Commemorates 44th Anniversary of Overthrow of Royal Hashemite Family; Doha Embarrassed; Al-Salihi Al-Samurai; American Raid
"Al-Thawra" newspaper emphasized the Iraqis' determination to maintain their freedom and independence, saying, "Washington and London are dreaming of ruling Iraq. Although it might seem to be a pleasant bite for them, it is not going to be easy to swallow. It is a very tough bite that chokes anyone who tries to swallow it."
However, the chief editor of the London-based "Al-Quds AL-Arabi" newspaper,  Abd al-Bari Atwan, in an interview with the Al-Jazira satellite channel of Qatar, quoted a source close to the Jordanian court as saying there is a deep desire in the Royal Hashemite family to restore the royal system in Iraq.
In this regard, diplomatic officials in Doha said Qatar objects to any attack on Iraq, but it fears that denying a possible American request to use its lands as an attack base might damage its relations with Washington.
"Saddam will find himself surrounded by several hundred soldiers (...) It seems that the U.S. is preparing for all possibilities, such as land warfare or special forces (...) It will not need all that."
However, former director of military intelligence General Wafeek Al-Samurai, who attended the London meeting, warned Washington about attacking Iraq, noting that a swift coup d'état will be the best way to overthrow Saddam.
The statement did not mention damage or casualties, but an Iraqi military spokesman stated earlier that seven Iraqis were injured in these raids.
Khaled Pashton, spokesman for Kandahar ruler Gol Agha, said that the conferees will also discuss launching a campaign against drug cultivation and trafficking, as well as necessary security measures to control the borders of these regions with Pakistan and Iran.
The two forces would coordinate with anti-terrorism forces of the international coalition, within the framework of pursuing hard-line warriors.
Observers believe that the Kandahar Governor's suggestion might be aimed at containing the anger of the southern regions' population after the raid on Kakrakay.
While Afgan President Hamid Qarzay's remains silent regarding the Gol Agha and southern region governors, Deputy U.N. Representative in Kabul Nigel Fischer warned of anarchy in Afghanistan if the international community does not start investment operations in rebuilding the country.
He warned that Qarzay's government does not have sufficient funds to pay its employees after the month of August, and that large-scale road construction projects are suspended.
Two years after the general parliamentary elections in Lebanon (August and September 2000), which was a turning point in Beirut and Shouf, and more than one month after secondary elections in Al-Matn, in which the opposition made its first serious breakthrough in its political conflict with the authorities, it is extremely disturbing to notice a grave retreat among political powers designated as democratic, especially because these powers share views, suffering, and goals that qualify them to launch a wide-scale Lebanese dialog that can at least revive democracy
However, what we fail to understand or justify is Junbulat's turn against the essential factor credited for bringing him his primary, distinguished attractiveness and leadership for the issue of ailing democracy in Lebanon. He delivered an approach that has not been heard from him since the self-criticism that he carried out.
Prime Minister Hariri has a different point of view in expressing the same issue, but his approach ends in the same political demand.
However, he is also canceling every justification for opposition primarily against Syrian existence in Lebanon, while some members of that opposition, represented by the Qirna Shahwan Meeting,  are trying to start a dialog with the presidency regarding the Syrian issue in the first place, and then about internal issues at a secondary level.
Art For the Sake of Art
The campaign sponsors say that Khalid sang in Rome two months ago with an Israeli singer in the presence of Shimon Perez.
Palestine is sacked. It is not enough that the Palestinians are victims; in addition, they are accused worldwide of being anti-peace. And to make things worse, they are paying the price of  continuously ruining the image of Arabs.
Is it worth the price that a foreign newspaper writes, "Arabs punish those who believe in peace?"
As designated since the beginning of festival, the revenue from the second concert will be donated to the Palestinian Red Crescent. That is just days before the controversy around Khalid and even before the "sin" he had been criticized for.
If the Palestinian tragedy is the main motive of those tough critics, then it is better for them to go to Beiteddine tomorrow and donate to the Palestinian Red Crescent. Perhaps by doing this, they will provide something positive to Palestinians.
On Bastille Day, July 14, France's national day, a failed assassination attempt on France's President Jacques Chirac was carried out by a young man allegedly mentally unstable and affiliated with a group of neo-Nazis. He fired one shot from a rifle at the President as he was inspecting units that participated in the traditional military demonstration on the Champs Elysées.
It seems that the handing over of the man who is accused of killing the three Lebanese soldiers in Sayda last Thursday night is deliberately postponed. Will such attempts be faced this time with an effective solution in order not to let this new crime pass without punishing the parties involved?
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmad Maher announced yesterday that U.S. President George Bush will receive the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Egypt in Washington after their meeting with members of the Quartet representatives tomorrow.
This is the first time in the kingdom that photographs of the king and his wife have been published.
Al-Yasiri was an Iraqi navy officer and was injured in the uprising of southern Iraq in 1991 against the Iraqi leadership. He managed to flee to Saudi Arabia and now lives in London. He is considered an ally of the chairman of the Iraqi National Conference Ahmad al-Chalabi, who supported the three-day meeting that was attended by approximately seventy officers.
Has resolve started to slacken on the issue of handing over the man accused of killing three soldiers in Sayda last Thursday night, or are diminishing attempts going to be faced this time with exceptional resolve not to let this new crime pass without retribution against involved parties?
The government's credibility and ability to maintain a tough security approach arouse concerns. It also develops an urgent need to translate alleged Syrian support into the ability to maintain law and order.
However, these factions finally sent a message to leader of the Al-Nur group Abd-Allah Shereidi and Ussama Al-Shehabi, calling on them to disclose Hamada's whereabouts or they will also be considered accomplices. If they refuse, the entire camp will be turned against them in order to protect itself.
After meeting with Prime Minister Rafeek AL-Hariri last night, Socialist Progressive Party leader MP Waleed Junbulat called on the Palestinian forces in Ein al-Helwa camp to hand over the murderer "because the Lebanese state will not, and may not neglect this issue."
It is understood that concerned authorities will not allow any violations. The decision must be effective, particularly following an increase in the compensation for van owners, according to a decision made by the cabinet in its latest session.
Al-Yasiri was an Iraqi navy officer and was injured in the uprising of southern Iraq in 1991 against the Iraqi leadership. He managed to flee to Saudi Arabia and now lives in London. He is considered an ally of the chairman of the Iraqi National Conference Ahmad al-Chalabi, who supported the three-day meeting that was attended by approximately seventy officers.
Among those is former Iraqi Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Nizar Al-Khazraji, descendant of a large tribe in Mosul in northern Iraq, who fled in 1995 and currently lives in Denmark; and General Tawfiq al-Samurai, who was in charge of military intelligence.
On another front, American Assistant Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz expressed a view in a press conference held in Istanbul that Turkey will benefit from any possible change to the Iraqi regime.
He expressed his objection to the possibility of establishing a Kurdish state in northern Iraq. The semi-official Turkish agency Anadhol quoted him as saying, "A separate Kurdish state in northern Iraq will not please Turkey or the U.S., because Iraqi Kurds themselves believe that it is in their own interest to remain Iraqis."
However, he dropped the possibilities of U.S. assistance to those members of opposition and said, "We are concerned about America's behavior toward this opposition. It wants to use these people for its own benefit in the region."
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmad Maher announced yesterday that U.S. President George Bush will receive the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Egypt in Washington after their meeting with the Quartet representatives tomorrow.
Saud Al-Faisal is expected to join his Egyptian and Jordanian counterparts in a meeting with American Secretary of State Colin Powell on Thursday in Washington, and in talks with Bush at a time to be determined later.

*In Damascus, Syrian newspaper "Al-Thawra" called on the Quadrilateral Middle East Committee to consult with Arab states that are directly involved in the Arab-Israeli conflict, such as Syria, and to "determine the party responsible for hampering the peace process, which is undoubtedly Israel, and to consult with absent Arab parties who are actually concerned with the conflict and to listen to their views."
(Reuters - WSF)
Before that, Al-Hariri had sent a telegram to Chirac, congratulating him on the National Day, in which he expressed "his wishes for France to enjoy an age of prosperity and national peace in the current rule, and that it may continue to work for peace in the world, particularly in the Middle East."
In response to a question as to whether he will mediate somehow to solve this issue, he said, "No. I believe the people in charge of the camps must have enough national vision and must understand this issue is harmful to them, not useful. Harboring some of these individuals is extremely dangerous. As to mediation for the sake of mediation, I am pursuing the other line, if you will, the line of communication with all national Lebanese figures, without exception, to unite against all forms of extremism, especially since the region is on the brink. Perhaps there are other major events, but in Lebanon the most important thing is national unity."
Khalil Fayhan wrote:
The sources mentioned that during discussions that took place in the second meeting of the Initiative Committee in Cairo last Friday morning, the Syrian Foreign Minister emphasized that any meeting held by any minister or ministers of member states of the Initiative Committee cannot be considered an official meeting with the Quartet. All nine ministers and the Arab League Secretary General must be present, according to the agreement made in the Beirut Summit and in the first meeting of the Initiative Committee last May 18.
They admitted they do not have any information as to whether these countries have an American promise to approve the Arab Peace Initiative as a base that can be considered on the agenda of any international peace conference that may be required by the European Union and France. French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin re-emphasized this requirement in Washington last Thursday. He already had repeated it in Beirut, Damascus, Cairo, Ram Allah, and Israel prior to his visit to the U.S.A.
On the other hand, they informed Maher and Al-Ma'ashar that their meeting with the Quartet is informal and that each of them represents his respective state, not the Initiative Committee, which still awaits arrangements for meeting the Quartet. These ministers criticized the preliminary response to the Arab request to send nine ministers and the League Secretary General by saying the number is too large, and that meeting them would require at least two days, whereas the Quartet representatives do not have time for that because of their overloaded schedules related to other issues.
On the occasion of the French National Day, the French Ambassador Phillipe Le Cortier held a reception in al-Sunawbar Palace. Minister Ghassan Salama as a representative of the president, Mr. Mahmoud Berri as a representative of the Chairman of Parliament, and Minister Baheej Tubbara as a representative of the Prime Minister attended the reception.
He added, "Lebanon and its friends in the Middle East and in the world rely on France to maintain Lebanon's position, to have a say, and to offer its friends and partners its solidarity."
"It also welcomed the Arab peace initiative that was adopted in the Arab Summit held in Beirut."
"Our country, which has contributed to the reconstruction of Lebanon and has maintained for several years an active policy in the area of cooperation between the two countries, appears today with full commitment to activate its support to its partners for the benefit of financial reform in Lebanon."
He said, "We have full confidence that this event, which is the first to be held on Arab land and the most important event Lebanon has hosted, will be a successful one."
In its session next Thursday, the cabinet will discuss its ordinary agenda, which consists of no critical issues. Administrative and regular issues will be discussed.

The opening was attended by MP Bayar Al-Jumail, former leader of the Phalanges Party Eli Karama, members of the opposition Phalanges Party, and a large number of Phalanges and supporters.
President Al-Jumayil then spoke, thanking the Motherhood and Childhood Society and its officials for their "struggle, courage, and benevolence."
"All of these prove that what we say represents an act of belief supported by a large sector of Phalangesists who remained loyal to the blood of martyrs, at the top of whom is the late President Basheer Al-Jumyail, and of Lebanese who will all remain loyal in confronting all the conspiracies from outside and inside to destroy the Lebanese cause, in order to wipe out the state of being, sovereignty, and dignity of the Lebanese people."
Yesterday, at the Mukhtara Palace, Leader of the Socialist Progressive Party Waleed Junbulat received a Palestinian delegation, including a National Committee for Documenting Israeli War Crimes representative, a Democratic Palestine Liberation Front leadership member, Jenin Municipality Council member Riyad Al-Arida, Democratic Palestine Liberation Front political office member Kameel Faisal, and Nasser Shubaylat.
"They have also shared with us many occasions in the occupied territories, in addition to providing financial and moral support to our families in the camp of Jenin, and their active role in advocating the rejection of compulsory service. We consider that major support to the Palestinian people. All of that serves the national and historical positions of the Druze sect."
Another group of visitors to Mukhtara was a delegation from Abiya town, led by Sheikh Abu Hassan Kamel Hassan and a number of clerics and well-known figures of the town. Speaking on the town's behalf, Khaled Hamza mentioned issues and needs related to the town, such as infrastructure projects, in addition to the right of the people to be compensated and the issue of Mitmar Al-Naima.
After the national anthem and an introduction by Farhan Zein El-Deen, Municipality Director Haleem Abu-Saleh paid tribute to Junbulat's contributions to the town, emphasizing, "building the Municipality House promotes agreement and cooperation, so that we can add to the chain of achievements yet a new pearl. We hereby announce the start of the Municipality House construction, where firm and good intentions will meet."
Finally, Junbulat visited the House's construction site and set the cornerstone of the building, which will be built on approximately 3000 square meters and will contain four basement floors to be used as a building services depot, a conference hall, offices, and a lecture hall.
He said, "We have to shift Arab media from the narrow field to the international field, because the current stage requires the development of a unified Arab plan."
In response to a question regarding media cooperation between Lebanon and Syria he said: "There is substantial and comprehensive media cooperation between Syria and Lebanon within our common belief and principles. We all bear the same basic principles towards the rights of our homeland and nation. I have close ties with my colleague Ghazi al-Ereidi, and we meet and work together to push Arab media out of the narrow path and to break into the international field, because our Arab nation is facing fatal challenges where its enemies are using all legitimate and illegitimate weapons they have to fabricate information and facts and pass them to international public opinion. For that, these matters were discussed in the Arab Media Ministers Council, and it was agreed to develop a single Arab plan at the international level, particularly for the American arena. This plan is to be theme-based and should reach out to American society for friendship and amiability."
Yesterday, at the Mukhtara Palace, Leader of the Socialist Progressive Party Waleed Junbulat received a Palestinian delegation, including a National Committee for Documenting Israeli War Crimes representative, a Democratic Palestine Liberation Front leadership member, Jenin Municipality Council member Riyad Al-Arida, Democratic Palestine Liberation Front political office member Kameel Faisal, and Nasser Shubaylat..

A former prime minister said that he fails to understand the U.S. position, as it is lifting financial constraints on Lebanon on one hand, and yet requiring it to disarm Hezbollah on the other hand.
He proposed a technical solution as follows: "Instead of varying the distance between one frequency and the other by 300 to 400 kilohertz, this can be reduced to 200 kilohertz."
Supreme Shiite Islamic Council Vice-President Sheikh Abdelameer Qublan visited Damascus, heading a delegation of Shari'a courts judges and sheikhs. He met with the head of the Judicial power in Iran, Mr. Mahmoud Hashimi Shaherody, at the latter's residence in the Al-Diyafa Palace.
Shaherody responded, "Lebanon represents the first trench facing the Zionist enemy, and its people are good and righteous." (...)
Franjieh was speaking Saturday evening upon sponsoring the opening ceremony of the public hospital in Ehden before a large gathering of citizens, and in the presence of MP Qaissar Muawwad, former MP Istifan Al-Dweihi, Attorney Yusif Al-Dweihi, Robert Boulos, and Jawad and Seleem Karam.
Representative of the Italian Foundation Emelio Mainidi presented the official and private Italian contributions to health projects in Lebanon and enumerated the health centers for which the Foundation participated in providing medical equipment.
"I "wanted to avoid delivering a written speech in my town of Ehden."
"During the rule of President Al-Herawi, may Allah (God) grant him goodness, we planned for the Zagarta-Ehden highway project and managed to build the road without the exchange and without the dispensary."
"Our gratitude goes to the Embassy and the Ambassador of Italy. We thank him for all that he did for us, which ended up in the realization of this project; no one else did what he did."

Bahamdoon Station - From Ramzy Musharafia:
Today's Bahamdoon Station wiped out its old image from people's memories as the ignition that sparked the war in Al-Jabal.
In the afternoon, one might not be able to find a place to stand in the restaurants and cafeterias. Sidewalks and parking areas are overcrowded.
"The lowest possible cost of renovating a hotel in Bahamdoon Station can reach 5-6 million dollars. Taking into consideration that the business of these hotels is seasonal, we have to give them a chance to generate profits."
He emphasized, "The municipality is working to help the state through Bahamdoon's summer and tourism-preferred location, because summer visitors spend money in our markets (...) Therefore, we have to import summer visitors and tourists."
"We will remain in Bahamdoon Station until we can no longer fetch a large number of summer visitors, particularly in view of the competition between Arab countries, not only in Syria and Egypt but also in Tunisia, Yemen, and Algeria."
Qassim, who spoke during a celebration held by the party in the southern town of Majadel, also said, "The readiness and power of the resistance were the reasons behind Israel's failure to achieve much of its hostile schemes in Lebanon. The resistance will remain a firm barrier to the Israeli project and all that it stands for. Let the Lebanese and others be assured that the resistance is protecting them from additional Israeli strikes."
On the second anniversary of Syrian President Haffez Assad's death, the Commands of Baath Party Branches in West and Central Biqaa organized a seminar entitled "Strategically Haffez Assad" in the Park Hotel - Shattoura hall."
Then Minister Ghazi Al-Ereidi delivered a speech in which he said, "We are obliged to back Syria within a framework of integration through which we would be backing ourselves and defending our interests, security, and common future."
Bushra - "Al-Nahar":
In Sur ("Al-Nahar") the party commemorated the anniversary with a celebration in the Basel Assad Cultural Compound in the presence of Party Leader Jubran Arbaji; Minister Ali Qanso; MPs Asaad Jirdan, Abd-Allah Quseir, and Ali Bazzi; a large number of political, party, and association figures; municipality directors; mayors; and a crowd of party and local people.
Israeli forces stationed above the hills of Al-Arkoub fired their heavy machine guns yesterday at dawn in the direction of adjacent liberated areas, while helicopters hovered in the skies of the occupied Shiba farms.
Present were MPs Yaseen Jabir, Ali Bazzi, Ali Khreis, Qassim Hashem, and Abd El-Lateef Al-Zein; Nabitiya Goernor Mahmoud Al-Mawla; Director of the official National Media Agency, Khaleel Al-Khuri; the movement's organization official for the south Jameel Hayik; and a number of social and cultural figures.
The Zahla Metropolite for Orthodox Romans Esperidon Khuri promoted today the Priest of Eita Al-Fakhar Subjects, Father Metri Al-Hassan, to the rank of Advanced Priest in a celebration mass held in St. Andrews church in the town. Among the participants were the Metropolites of Sayda and Sur, sect references, and Bishop Elias Kfouri.

The Hilton building in Solidaire, Zaytuna, downtown Beirut, was blown up yesterday. It will be reconstructed according to modern architecture so as to establish in its place a five-star hotel at an approximate cost of 100 million dollars, the vast majority of which will be contributed by investors from the Gulf.
Bahamdoon Station - From Ramzy Musharaffa:
Telabbas Gharbi, which sits on a hill at the center of the Akkar valley, is the town whose citizens are known for their love for the land they worked on. They watered it with their sweat of exhaustion, yearning for science and knowledge. Hence, some of its children became physicians, judges, lawyers, university professors, and officers.
The news of the Hilton hotel's demolition and future replacement with a new hotel could have passed as common news in the economic and investment pages of daily newspapers in Lebanon. However, it is the Hilton hotel, site of the fourth episode of a fierce battle that took place in 1975 and 1976 during the Lebanese civil war, along with the Saint George, Venicia, and Holiday Inn. In and around that hotel, hundreds of Lebanese youth died as martyrs, and that is why news of its demolition cannot just pass by without taking some time to learn a lesson.
The battlefield was simply not theirs. Neither was it the suitable place for their dreams and aspirations. They also know that no Lebanese who has minimal sense and reason will ever fight another Lebanese. They all fully realize that the blood of the martyrs was wasted on both sides.
The French Press Agency reported from Sydney, Australia, yesterday that a series of rape incidents committed by young Muslim men of Lebanese origin raised massive disapproval in Australia and caused a wave of reaction against foreigners in a country that is traditionally known for hosting emigrants.
Police officer Peter Ryan announced that he definitely never saw an ethnic group targeting another group before.
Parts of the media covered these incidents or tried to minimize their effects, while avoiding their ethnic and religious aspects in preservation of "political correctness."
More than 50% of the people included in the study declared they would not prefer any of their relatives to marry a Muslim man.
Muslim Lebanese Community spokesman Qaysar Tarrad considered that some conservative families believe that the victims were the ones who seduced their sons to have sexual relations with them.
Some reduced sentences issued last August caused disappointment within Australian society, but the prosecutors managed to increase the sentences at the court of appeal to 13 and 14 years in prison.
After more than a year and nine months since the uprising started, the Palestinian resistance has failed to impose on Israel the political compromises it refused to make through negotiations, and failed to force it to respect its signed obligations. In fact, what happened was the exact opposite.
Politically, it will be under international supervision and under Israeli supervision terms of security.
And finally, making some concessions in the form of evacuating isolated Jewish settlements, which will represent the maximum offering Sharon will make in return for a settlement with the Palestinians in the long run.
There are several issues raising concern. Foremost is that the political settlement proposed to the Palestinians as a result of their military defeat in the recent confrontation with Israel is totally unacceptable to them, even if Arafat leaves and a new Palestinian leadership comes, simply because it is not viable.
Therefore, it is most likely that the loss incurred by the Palestinians today will be covered by other Arab parties and will affect the future of the entire region.
Noting a contradiction in responses made by concerned officials, they demanded equality with their the Ministry of Telecommunications colleagues in terms of permanent employment.
"The mentioned law is applied to all public sectors and organizations and private businesses, except our sector."
"- Two-months salary for each year of actual service after the tenth year up to the thirtieth year."
"Minister Qirdahi referred it to Minister of Finance Fuad Senyora, who rejected it on the premise of insufficient funds."
It continued: "We request equality with the Lebanon Electricity Organization through adoption of the same legal provision, so that the long-time employees of Ojero can benefit from it."
Intra: 3 Years to Profitability; Seminar on Mushrooms & Their Marketing in Bint Jubayl School; Group in Al-Zouk Station Stopped
He noted, "The development plan is a transitory program with a view to reinforcing funding sources in Intra and its subsidiaries, and enable the company to assume an investment role so that it may have a financial investment arm through the Bank of Finance, a tourism arm through the Casino of Lebanon, and a real estate arm through the set of real estate assets it owns."
In a lecture he delivered, Agricultural Mushroom Research Institute Director Hassan Al-Kashi discussed the types of agricultural mushrooms and the appropriate techniques for cultivating them, as well as their economic feasibility and its marketing potential locally and abroad.
Shopping Festival Inaugurated in Bint Jubayl; Filayjan: Shopping Means Construction and Development
He also thanked all supporters of the festival.
He explained that demands for infrastructure development means commitment to justice and balanced development in equality with other areas, particularly in terms of capitalizing on the role of emigrants and attracting them back home."
"The policy of the Lebanese government has been and will remain to be for a just peace that liberates the land, but not placing bets on Israel or its love of peace."
I continued reading this amazing book until dawn. The book is not just about views and style, but it also reveals the amazing visions of its author's timeless movies, beginning with "The Rock," "The Adventure" (L'Avventura), "The Night" (La Notte), "Red Desert," "Blowup," "Correspondent's Job," and others.
"I met Romy for the first time at a party."
"After a while."
"These are Alain Delon's pictures. He framed them and hung them on the walls in his house in Dechy."
"Actually, I became a professional actress with the help of my parents."
But the organizers exaggerated in subdividing the categories under the pretext of specialization; this had a negative effect on the festival. Awards were given to some just to please them, and many awards were shared among participating works, which indicates a huge difference of opinion among the jury who were influenced by other factors that sometimes had nothing to do with artistic standards.
Until those in charge reconsider their attitudes, we congratulate the Lebanese media represented by Al-Manar and Al-Noor for the awards they brought home with them.
The mistake was committed by Khalid, the Algerian singer. According to the campaign against tonight's concert, which is part of Beiteddine's festival, Khalid will join the Egyptian popular traditional singer Hakim, known as "Egypt's Lion," and a player of Oud and lute, the Palestinian New Yorker Simon Shahin.
There are those who watch over the nation's morale and won't allow it to be stabbed in the back.
But does this mistake deserve a campaign?
Simon Shahin will perform in two concerts in Beiteddine-tonight's concert with Khalid and Hakim, and another performance will be held tomorrow night with the "Kantara" band that he manages.
Anyway, it is not too late.
Emmanuelle Devos: Cesar Award Winner, French Actors Are Not Systematic
"They used to perform on stage; so it was natural for me to take up an acting career after I finished my first year in high school."
"That's true."
"I met Noémie Lvovsky and worked with her in a short movie. After Desplechin's movies and specifically 'The Guard,' 'How I Argued With My Self,' and 'Esther Khan,' things started to move fast. Because of these movies, I went to the Cannes Festival."
"I met Nicole Garcia through her son, with whom I worked in the theatre. She advised me to read Carrere's novel, and six months later we talked about transforming it into a movie."
"Nicole is sort of a worrier, but she knows how to hide it very well."
"This is why she was my inspiration."
"Actually, I can't say 'how much I would love to work with X or Z' because there are many people I hoped to work with, and they certainly did ask me."
"No! Movies scare me."
"I remember 'Medusa's Year' and '37.2 degrees A.M.' with Valerie Kaprisky or Matilda May."
"I don't have enough time anymore to go to the movies, but I did watch the film 'Seven Songs from the Tundra' at the Cannes Festival."
"I have a feeling that technique is all that I have learned and developed in life. It can be used in a book or a painting. As for the film 'Read My Lips,' I have read a lot of novels by Modiano because he talks about people who suffer from loneliness." (...)
In their memorandum, the teachers are requesting their representatives to question the government about its failure to enforce issued laws.
Teachers' associations had held a wide-scale  meeting in the League of Public Secondary Education Teachers facility.
3- Why is there such determination not to enforce two laws issued more than a year ago for payment of funds required for B.A. and B.Sc. holders and for compensating directors, while both are laws previously referred by the government to the parliament, who passed them.
Second: Continuing to boycott public exam marking processes until these rights are approved, while holding the government and the Ministry of Finance and its procrastination primarily and solely responsible for the consequences of this step.
A group of pupils from the Cultural Social League of Muslim Students demonstrated in front of the Ministry of Education and High Education entrance, and a delegation of demonstrators delivered to Minister of Education Office Manager Hesham Tubbara a letter demanding payment of dues to teachers and positive handling of their demands, calling on teachers to lift the boycott and start correcting public certificate exams.
They also deemed "the government in general, and a number of ministers who refuse to approve the rights of teachers in particular, fully responsible for wasting the students' final year, and consequently their futures." The Committee demanded "rapid release of the teachers' legitimate rights. We remind them that one day they were all students like us, concerned about their future, and that they would never have reached their current positions were it not for their teachers."
Archmendrite Hanna will be received at Beirut Airport on Tuesday the 23rd of the current month in the evening, to be the guest of honor at a dinner to be held the following evening (Wednesday, July 24) by the Forum at half past eight in the LeMeriden Commodore hotel.
Father Hanna will spend Sunday the 29th in the towns of northern Matn.
In the Hermel Secondary Cornerstone Celebration, Murad: Is it Punishment of the Minister that is Required?
"Is it perceivable that the A'si Dam remain trapped inside recurrent promises?"
"Our ambitious project is part of an educational plan for the spread and geographic distribution of schools. It is the expansion of learning opportunities and making them available to anyone who reaches the early education age by constructing the core school in areas where there remain pockets of deprivation. This is in order to make a proper start toward applying obligatory and free education." He emphasized, "With knowledge and education we build, and through public education this building should also be."
"We want an answer."
Tripoli - Akkar - "Al-Nahar":
The director of the secondary school, Mr. Najeed Al-Bitar, then spoke and announced, "The inauguration of the English branch at the beginning of the next school year will be a new beacon and important fortress to be added to this constantly renewing ambitious institution."
Mr. Bitar then presented the school medal to Mr. Antoine Jabbour for twenty-five years of educational service in the school. He also presented the Fuad Sulayman Award and the Mrs. Biarta and Mr. Jubran Jabbour Prize to the four top pupils in the four academic branches, namely Layal Hanna, Dima Jabbour, Joseph Farah, and Amani Shalaq.
A singing performance was then conducted by Father Nicola Malik, followed by certificate distribution and a cocktail party.
Lebanese American University Graduates 77th Class; Nassar Called for Globalization of Understanding
"In the Lebanese American University, we started in 1992 the human resources development project."
University President Dr. Riyad Nassar delivered a speech in which he called on the graduates to adopt openness and dialog and to deepen the globalization of understanding for the "establishment of peace and justice, particularly in this century, the first year of which was a year of violence, fear, and frustration." He mentioned the current change at that level, which indicates, in spite of its sluggishness, that there is increased concern to solve disputes through dialog rather than confrontation.
The following students won the University President Award for scoring the highest grades in each of their colleges: Heba Hayfaa Abbas Talees (College of Business Administration), Najlaa Afeef Numan (College of Engineering and Architecture), and Soha Nazeeh Kurki (College of Arts and Sciences). Student Maya Imad Yamout won the Torch Award for her leadership qualities.
My father summoned me and talked to me in such a solemn and sharp tone that I was fixed in place with open ears and a tied tongue.
"The people need a sweet, truthful, responsible, free, honest, and daring word that carries hope and radiance of a bright beautiful tomorrow."
The occasion today is the silent passage of the 11th anniversary of his death.
Your charming face
Appeared as gold in the country
And the poet saw his drawing in the picture of his town:
For my soul is from its pride and my body is from its flowers
Prison can testify how many times I bid it farewell to the morrow
Lebanon, may it be paralyzed any hand
Give you from what I have, world
Tripoli - Akkar - "Al-Nahar":
"A minister will fly" was what the spectators kept saying on the sixth day of the Third Paper Car Festival organized by the Ministry of Culture among the activities of the Francophonic Summit.
The festival, which was began on July 8 and will end today, included shows given by artists and international kite specialists, in addition to workshops for children run by Frederic Buyud. The festival witnessed a first-time experiment, water kites.
Present was former Minister George Qurm and Communist Party Political Council member Saadallah Mazraani.
He said:
The new issue of "Health Food" magazine has been released. It contains a file on ice cream, which is considered the "fruit" of refreshment, vitality, and summer, because of the energy and calories it provides the body, and its content of natural nutrients such as milk, chocolate, nuts, and various fruits such as strawberries, blackberries, and others. Most important of all is its cooling effect, which helps overcome the summer heat.
The conference started with a recitation from the Holy Qur'an, followed by a speech by Jabal Lebnan Scholars Organization President Sheikh Afeef Al-Nabulsi, in which he praised the resplendent history and continuous struggle of the hawzas.
Sheikh Muhammad Jafar Al-Muhajir spoke about "The Scientific Hawza, A Perspective of its Present and a Vision for its Future." Dr. Muhsin Salih spoke about teaching methods in the Hawza curriculum. Sheikh Dr. Khanjar Hamiyya spoke about the effect of philosophical thought on the process of induction. Mr. Muhammad Gharwi spoke about the Hawza books and the experimentation of alternatives. Sheikh Shafeek Jaradi spoke about specialization in Hawza studies. Dr. Saud Al-Mawla spoke about the view of others to the scientific Hawza and scholars of religion. Dr. Hassan Jabir spoke about the overall objectives of Islamic law (Sharia).
The second session was presided over by Hezbollah Southern Region Official Sheikh Nabeel Qawook, and Dr. Hassan Jabir delivered a lecture in it about the overall objectives of Islamic law (sharia), followed by Sheikh Ameen Termes, who spoke about the ethical inclination and Quranic awareness within religious hawzas, then Saudi researcher Hussein Khaleefa spoke about the power of scripture between appearance and phenomenon and the possibilities of juristic products.
All of those, in addition to a multiplicity of psychological diseases, increase the potential of suffering sexual disorders, which can lead to total sexual impotence if not treated properly.
In the first session of the conference, Dr. Mamoun Al-Zebda focused on the significance of holding such a conference in the Arab region. "This is strong evidence of improvement in medical standards, which will lead to improved health awareness. It is also an earnest call for attention to sexual education and culture in a way that complies with religion and the traditions of this conservative society, so that we can protect the individual, the family, and the society from straying on false ideas and beliefs."
In the conference opening ceremony, the organizing committee distributed acknowledgement certificates and coats of arms to a number of lecturers and participating and sponsoring organizations.
It is also clear evidence of the importance of an audience to keeping artistic works through time. The audience is a basic target for any creative work.
And, here, "perfectly" means reaching the recipient (because "poetry is a diction phenomenon," as they say) while being recited beautifully and with a neat performance to draw the best attention.
That is, until Al-Sayab came back to Beirut a few days ago, this time with Aziz Khyoun (the great actor, director, and manager of Iraq's National Theatre), and performed at Dar Al-Nadwa (on an invitation from Dar Al-Nadwa and the Professional Artists Union). He presented a poetry evening titled "Iraq ... Oh Iraq" with a clever assemblage and perfect editing done to his collection of poems. Suddenly, the thin, weak, and shy Badr stirred the audience, impressing them and speaking with great confidence. Aziz Khyoun added a different dimension to the experience. If Al-Sayab had the chance to hear his work performed by Aziz Khyoun, he would have loved his poems even more (as would have Beethoven with von Karajan).
To say that some poems are for expressive performance and others are not is false. It is the belief of those who are incapable of sending their poems to people's ears, hearts, and inner feelings.

Pakistani President Condemns Attacks on Christians on Independence Day; Musharraf Rejects Elections in "Occupied" Kashmir and Abdul Kalam Replies, Describing It as an Inseparable Part of India; Kashmir; Bin Laden; Medals for French
The Pakistani President, who assumed office in 1999 following a coup d'état, was eager to commemorate the anniversary in Islamabad's Parliament Plaza. Surprisingly, he celebrated yesterday's anniversary inside a closed hall amid strict security measures.
"No one but our country Pakistan and the Pakistani poor, whose livelihood depends on finding jobs, and jobs are linked to bringing in investments, but what is happening is investments are declining."
In response to criticism of his government for failure to combat extremist Islamic groups, Musharraf pointed out, "There are no ready-made solutions for sectarianism and extremism (...) We have to act in a systematic manner to deal with the threat."
He also promised that the general elections planned for November will be "free, honest, and transparent."
He declared his country's commitment to a peaceful resolution of the dispute in Kashmir, emphasizing in the meantime that his country will defend its borders in case of an attack. He pointed out, "No one dares to even think of an advance across our borders."
"The election process is proceeding normally in Kashmir."
Also, Musharraf told the Russian newspaper "Izvestia" that the leaders of Al-Qaeda, Usama Bin Laden, and the Taliban, Mulla Muhammad Umar, might have been killed, as "no one has specific information as to their whereabouts and activities at the present time."
Convicted by Indonesian Court of Human Rights Violations, Former East Timor Ruler Sentenced to Three Years in Jail
The human rights tribunal is considering lawsuits against 18 officials accused of committing crimes against humanity for alleged involvement in the violence that tore East Timor during the independence referendum.
Judge Emi Morni Mustafa said that the defendant "failed to prevent his men from committing atrocious human rights violations."
Hundreds were killed in the days prior to the referendum that took place on August 30, 1999, through which the people of East Timor chose to separate from Indonesia.
Pyongyang Willing to Receive American Envoy & Negotiate with Tokyo Korean Agreement on Family Reunification & Disagreement over Military Talks and Railway; Pyongyang and Tokyo
South Korean negotiators failed to achieve one of their most important objectives, which is to set a time for military talks that may allow the re-establishment of the railway project that came to a halt before the Korean War (1950-1953).
Replying to a question about reasons for failing to agree on a specific date for military talks, South Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Lee Tai-Sik said: "We are not totally satisfied with the outcome of talks ... But Pyongyang's acceptance of holding military talks as soon as possible reflects its seriousness in this regard."
He added, "Progress in talks is expected to reflect positively on the restoration of dialog between North Korea and the United States."
Seoul laid the railway as far as the demilitarized zone, but Pyongyang has done very little since the railway agreement was made during the historic summit between South Korean President Kim Day Jong and Northern Leader Kim Jong-Ill in June 2000.
Diplomats said that North Korea's most recent reform is the devaluation of its currency (woon). Pyongyang also cancelled the exchangeable currency used in financial transactions with foreigners.
But the North Korean government denied the accusation.
Four thousand freshman university students were required to write a one-page paper about the book.
He compared that feeling to the campaign against Japanese-Americans after the Pearl Harbor attack in World War II.
University President James Moser defended the choice of the book, emphasizing the need to discuss religious extremism and racism in the United States.
This is not the first time for North Carolina to object to attempts to know Islam and understand it.
U.S. Air Force Command announced that an Apache military helicopter crashed Tuesday during a mission near the Afghan capital. Meanwhile, special American envoy to Afghanistan Zalmay Khaleel Zadah has been on an undisclosed visit to Kabul since late last week.
In Washington, the White House revealed that Khaleel Zadah began a visit to Afghanistan on Saturday, and will remain there until next Saturday to hold talks with Afghan President Hamid Karzay and other officials. It denied any connection between Zadah's visit and Iranian President Muhammad Khatami's visit to Kabul on Tuesday.
The newspapers also mentioned that Tehran will allocate 2000 scholarships for Afghan students.
Sources very close to Khatami confirmed that Afghanistan initially approved an Iranian offer to organize the Afghan police and army.
In other news, U.N. High Commission for Refugees spokeswoman Mackee Shinohara announced that gunmen broke into the Commission building in the Afghan city of Guzna and stole telecommunications equipment and an amount of money.
Over the past three months, unknown attackers bombarded the city with missiles. The city hosts several hundred American Special Forces.
He added, "I will go to Kabul to meet Foreign Ministry officials regarding this issue (...) To the best of my knowledge, everyone who was vindicated has been transferred from other prisons in Afghanistan to Kabul."
Through a realistic perspective, the Lebanese discover that there are certain files they have no capacity to deal with, for several reasons.
The Lebanese also discovered the immense overlap between the entities of the region in their options and policies.
Introducing the idea of equalizing the situation of camps in Lebanon with those in Syria is taboo and can elicit for the perpetrator a thousand and one curses and a thousand and one accusations of serving Israel and its plots!
Lebanese-Palestinian relations need ongoing and serious work to reinforce the terms of the temporary Palestinian presence.
A state that wants to impose its authority and win the people's respect is a state that reflects their ambitions with the maximum possible honesty, not a state that publicly announces its disability and also announces that it will do nothing to recover from such disability.

Truman could also have actually whispered a few more words to the US president: Dear George, this jumble of contradictory characters and contradictory ambitions cannot form a model of the "Northern Alliance" that played a role in Afghanistan... And we are now in Iraq!
Vice-President Dick Cheney, who chose to watch the delegation members during their meetings through "hidden cameras", also "generously" talked to them, but across video connections!
If any of those who stood to say to tell the reporters that they are "aware that change has taken place in the strategic domain and that they will exert sincere efforts to remain united" thinks deep inside that he is fit to be the "Karzay of Iraq," then the depth of contradictions and divisions between the formations that comprised the delegation prevents that in reality.
Even Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld does not the exact answer.
Basically we had no need to present all these pitiful details, but they do bear political indications that raise more than wonder. How can the American administration go on talking about the inevitability of striking against Iraq and overthrowing Saddam Hussein's regime if they do not have any view of the form of rule or the man or men of authority who will assume the responsibilities, at least ostensibly on the previously mentioned premise that what is required is an "Iraqi Karzay" while the decisions come from Washington?
The "Maarif" newspaper quoted Israel's Military Intelligence Chief General Ahron Zaifi as saying before members of the Foreign and Security Committee of the Knesset that he expects the American attack on Iraq to start before November 2002 or in March, 2003.
Concurrently, the United States is exercising immense pressure on Iraq's neighboring countries, which violate the sanctions imposed on Iraq and allow it access to arms.
Conversely, the leadership of "Hamas" abroad strongly objects to a cease-fire.
At the internal level, "Maarif" commentator Abraham Tirosh yesterday wondered who wants elections?
With that he wants to prove the difference between him and his beginner predecessors, who were inexperienced and failed to complete their terms due to their improper practice.
As such, Netanyahu - expert of economy - will be in a better position, so what would Sharon be placing his bets on?
"The "Labor" party leader demonstrated strength and announced that he has no problem, and that the Labor Party will participate in the elections whenever necessary. However, deep down it can be assumed that he is concerned and believes that now is not his suitable time for elections."
"Resolution" (Beyond Use of Army) Palestinian Superiority Inside Ein Al-Helwa Camp Security Dissolution Or Regional Call For Offers?
This question is dictated by the recurrent statements of Lebanese officials whenever clashes or incidents occur in the camp, that there is no chance or suggestion for a Lebanese army entry into the camp for a number of reasons that usually do not convince the public opinion. It is noteworthy that such statements implicitly suggest that entering the camp is not a sheer Lebanese decision.
Official sources assert that the step taken for apprehending Badde' Hamada was received with great praise and appreciation in the capitals of decision making states, who perceived in this step evidence that the Lebanese state, with support from Syria, has the ability to control the disturbing security situation in the camps.
The recent killing of the three soldiers was simply the last straw, so that the state's need to resolve the situation in a certain direction became dire, and that is what is doing today in this regard.
As to the probabilities that solving the renewing radical fundamentalism problem in the camp of Ein EL-Helwa could lead to an impact that would give this local card positive results abroad, that is not unlikely, but needs insistence on the part of relevant official sources that there are no specific requests from the USA or otherwise with regards to imposing certain conditions in Palestinian camps that match what is requested of the Palestinian Authority in the occupied lands. In fact, it took action against this fundamentalism in the Daniya incidents in the early days of 2000. At that time, the issue of Bin Laden's fundamentalism and the Al-Qaeda organization were not yet introduced to the international community. The same fundamentalism was fought by Damascus for years in Syrian areas.
As of today, the majority of the state is on leave. What remains on the official activity agenda for the rest of this month is no more than two additional cabinet sessions on the 27th and 28th of August to approve the 2003 budget bill.
The cabinet will not hold its ordinary meeting next week, until it is time for the two additional sessions scheduled for considering and approving the budget in its final form.
With the approval of these amendments, the Electricity Laborers Association ended its strike, and the laborers and employees will resume work as normal starting today.
In return, the revenues of the two companies as of September 1st will be assigned to the benefit of the state.
During the session, a number of ministers made remarks about vacancy nominees.
And why was it not submitted to the cabinet for approval and referral to the parliament?"
Sensitive and important positions, such as New York, Washington, Paris, and Rome are being discussed.
The Israeli Ministry of Health recommended yesterday that relief employees and emergency workers receive smallpox vaccinations, amidst Israelis' increased concerns of potential Iraqi missile attacks against the Hebrew state in response to any American attack.
The radio quoted him as saying that despite lack of confirmed information on the part of Israel regarding an attack from Iraq using smallpox or any other chemicals, "we have to take necessary precautions, and those responsible for taking care of the people must be prepared."
He also expressed his objection to statements made by US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who said that the policy of containing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's regime has failed, saying that "It is possible to push Baghdad to take action in connection with accepting the return of international arms inspectors."
He preferred to use the term "advice" rather than "pressure" saying, "We are always providing Baghdad with advice."
Al-Talibani explained to "Al-Jazeerah" that "That statement is inaccurate."

After meeting with Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa, Danforth stated that peace will contribute to rapprochement between Khartoum and Washington.
He will also meet with a number of political figures from south Sudan, and will participate in a mass that will be attended by southerners and held in a church in the Zamalek area.
He said that the government has always been prompt in inviting Egypt to participate in these peace efforts, and declared its approval and support for the Egyptian - Libyan joint initiative two years ago.
He emphasized that they also discussed the talks to be held today by Maher with Danforth, and those he held with Special British Envoy to Sudan Alan Golti.
He denied that the previous motto was used to mobilize Muslims in the north against the Christians and Arwahis in the south. He indicated that the new motto is more applicable to the new political phase, which he named the "Spring of Peace."

and that American officials "Talk to the world in the language of power that is reminiscent of Hitler's language."
He emphasized that his country does not intend to extradite the alleged Al-Qaeda leaders detained on its lands to the USA, explaining that, "Every time a foreign person illegitimately enters Iran from Afghanistan, he will be extradited to his country."
"That is why Mr. Rumsfeld makes such irresponsible and illogical statements (...) Such statements change nothing in the Iranian government's desire to combat terrorism."p
*In Washington, the opposing "Iranian Resistance National Council" accused Iran of building two military nuclear centers secretly near the cities of Natanz and Arak in central Iran.
Muawwad Responds to Franjiya by Challenging Him To Public Debate: Extending Strength From Syria Destroys Al-Taif
Has Franjiya forgotten that Al-Taif was set to secure the national reconciliation that, in the words of President Rene Muawwad, "Excludes no one, including those who insist on excluding themselves from it." Where do we stand today in relation to that reconciliation?
Do we need to remind him that building the state of law and institutions, preserving liberties, setting a fair and balanced elections law, adopting an administrative decentralization law, achieving political reform, and balanced development are all essential items of Al-Taif agreement?
We disapprove of his claim that Naila Muawwad did not read Al-Taif, and invite him to a public debate for the people to learn about Al-Taif as understood by Franjiya and Al-Taif for which we offered a martyr.
Does Minister Franjiya see it in the interest of Lebanon and Syria to illustrate demands for sovereignty, independence, and free decision as contradictory to establishing distinguished relations with Syria?
We condemn such logic, which clearly forms a call to sectarian strife.
Contrary to Minister Franjiya's opinion, we believe that true national accord that is built upon the fundamentals stipulated in Al-Taif and the establishment of the modern and developed democratic state is enough to ensure protection for all Lebanese regardless of the denomination, and to pull the country out of the political and economic and social crisis that they brought upon us."
He also received congratulating calls from: President Umar Krami, Minister Basheer Murhaj, Parliament Vice-Chairman Eli El-Farazli, Supreme Islamic Legal Council Member Abd El-Rahman Al-Sheikha, Ambassador to France Elise Alam, and Constitutional Council member Emile Bajani.
"I wish our dear chairman and all members of the Association Council success and further contribution to the democracy and freedom march in Lebanon. The press and free speech are its two fundamentals, and that is what the Editors' Association embodies."
Hoping you will continue to serve the fourth authority, we present you and the respected Association Council with congratulations and great appreciation."
*Saudi Ambassador: "Before the eloquence of Chairman and great writer Milham Karam, words fail to express the magnificence of this occasion."
The new appointees are: Fadi Samah as General Manager for the Ministry of Industry, Ali Fakeeh as General Manager of the Research and Guidance Department in Central Inspection, Waleed Safi as Financial Controller for the Council of the South, Fadia Abi-Daghir as Dean of the Dental Medicine College in the Lebanese University, Eli Assa as Chairman and General Manager of the Public Administration Institute, and members Antoine Massara, Hashem El-Husseini, Bassam Turbah, Abbas El-Halabi, and Robert Fadil.

Al-Diman - "Al-Nahar":
Socialist Progressive Party Leader MP Waleed Junbulat backed Minister Sulayman Franjiya in his support for extending President Emil Lahud's term "If the competing candidate does not belong to a nationalistic line that is based on participation, Al-Taif, and the intrinsic relationship between Lebanon and Syria."
The "not so innocent" surprise with which the Parliament ended its two-day legislative session yesterday was to blow up operations of 16 to 24 passenger diesel-powered vans, giving their owners financial compensation, against which Prime Minister Rafeek Hariri and Minister of Finance Fuad Al-Senyors found no objections "despite the ascetic policy followed by the government" in service of the environment and public health.

As part of his farewell tour among officials and figures, Iranian Ambassador Muhammad Ali Sibhani visited Prime Minister Rafeek Al-Hariri in Quraytam yesterday. Following the visit, he stated, "Bilateral relations between Lebanon and Iran are developing and improving, and have currently reached their best levels, with all praise to Allah."
In response to a question as to whether he considers Lebanon to be in danger in view of regional developments, he said: "I believe Lebanon currently enjoys many elements of strength and invulnerability that will protect it from dangers in the future, most importantly national unity, followed by an element of valiant resistance, as well as Lebanese and Syrian cohesion and consolidation, and the support of neighboring states in the region, particularly Arab and Islamic states."
On the other hand, the "Al-Nahar" correspondent in Soor reports that Muhammad Ali Sibhani made a farewell visit to Al-Imam Al-Sadr foundations in Soor, where he was received by Foundation President Mrs. Rabab El-Sadr Sharf El-Din and Imam Musa Al-Sadr's son, Sadri, in the presence of a gathering of officials.
Next Meeting To Send A Message To Lahud Covenant and Constitution: Camps Are Islands Prohibited To The State And Authority Strikes Freedoms As Means of Distraction
Nasri Al-Malouf was absent due to his traveling.
It recalled what was stated in the National Accord Covenant about "dissolving armed militias and organizations, whether Lebanese or otherwise, handing their arms over to the Lebanese army, imposing overall state sovereignty with its own forces on all Lebanese lands to the internationally acknowledged borders, as well as Syria's pledge to support the Lebanese authority. Implementation was guaranteed by the Supreme Arab Trilateral Committee, the Arab Summit, the Arab League, the International Security Council, and the European Union."
"Government in any time and place is about 'prediction' and as such bears the immediate responsibility for finding solutions to problems and dealing with crises in an optimal manner, rather than running away from them, or taking the mistakes of others as an excuse to cover inability."
Motorbikes Forbidden In Beirut as of October 1; Hamana Municipality Honors a Tourist, the Kuwaiti Minister; Protests Escalate
"After considering how implementation was done in big Lebanese cities and abroad and following increasing complaints from people, a total ban on the use of motorbikes was decided.

Sidon-From Ahmad Mantash:
Hence, what a number of Palestinian officials have jumped to conclude regarding the existence of an arrest order for al-Daniya Group evaporated rapidly for a number of reasons. Everyone in the camp was urging reconciliation and avoiding the use of force and arms in dealing with matters.
Large parts of the camps enjoyed calm, stability, and regular life as if nothing had happened.
The biggest surprise took place when reporters visited the location of al-Daniya Group in the emergency camp, where rumors spread that the Group disappeared from the place.
Situations inside the camp, particularly the recent clashes, were discussed.
"The security of the camp is part of the security of Lebanon. This solution is made with agreement of all concerned parties in appreciation of the ultimate responsibility, so that attention may be directed toward the blessed uprising of our people in Palestine."
"Al-Nahar" had previously mentioned this procedure two weeks ago.
Public Relations of the Lebanese Internal Security issued the following statement: "After a number of smuggling operations that took place across the Lebanese- Syrian border, members of the Halba Squad command, which reports to the North Regional Zone, in coordination with the Head of the Security and Reconnaissance department in Akkar and based on an order from the Appeal Attorney General for the North Rimon Awauydat, launched a raid on August 13 in a bid to control the border. The force managed to arrest the following: Muhammad Ali Nassar (42 years old), Muhammad Salman Mahmoud (30 years old), Ali Askar al-Sawwan (39 years old), and Faisal Ibraheem Dendel (30 years old), while attempting to smuggle goods across the Lebanese-Syrian border."

The Council reviewed similar experiments in big Lebanese cities and abroad.
Mirhaj called for building on what has been achieved, "particularly that Lebanon has managed through its resistance, unity, and upswing to return to the regional and international map as a country of might, sovereignty, and independence."
Why Do the Poor Have to Beg the Rich to Save Them from Dying of Hunger?
What is required, Your Excellency the Minister, is to restore the dignity of our citizens in a way that they do not have to beg the hospitals and medical clinics for medical treatment; instead, citizens should have their full rights to get free medical care, especially the elderly!
"First: Smoking should be prohibited inside forests, as should picnic barbecues. It should also be forbidden to throw cigarette butts from the windows of cars and buses. (Most fires start from the sides of roads.) Signs must be installed across the country, stating that violating the above-mentioned regulations is an offense."
A citizen from Basaleem complains about a poultry pen belonging to one of the villas located 500 meters away from him. A very bad smell comes out of the pen and prevents people in the neighborhood from using their yards and gardens. The large number of chickens also results in an increasing quantity of fleas.
Harit Hereik Municipality confirmed that the location complained about was inspected, and the owner of the generator was asked to take necessary measures for the comfort of residents.
"Where is justice and logic?"
Leaders of the assembly, who consider themselves directly responsible for the stability of the security and political situation in the two countries, are at the stake. This kind of situation had special appeal to the founder of the assembly, the late president Hafidh al-Assad. It used to give him the chance to communicate with all major international and regional opposing forces.
that it lacks sufficient elements of attraction in the eyes of non-Muslims, but it also does not satisfy the ambitions of the vast majority of Muslims themselves.

- Fifty Years after the Partition of Palestine (1947-1997)
Some readers who were kind enough to send their comments criticizing the letter that we proposed be sent to cultured Americans found it insufficient to comment on the idea of dialog and/or on the content of the proposed letter. They went beyond that by criticizing American policies. Such criticism takes the form of direct political criticism, as presented by Mr. Mahmoud al-Qe'i, a former UNESCO manager in Paris, or cultural criticism, as exercised by Salah Salem, the al-Ahram journalist, who represents the voice of youth among readers who commented on the draft letter.
- Establishment of a Palestinian state on all lands occupied in 1967. The state must enjoy full sovereignty and must have Jerusalem as its capital.
- Confirming the legitimacy of resisting the Israeli occupation and Jewish settlement on lands occupied in 1967.
Hamas, as well as the other factions and forces that participated in drafting this document-namely the Fatah movement, the Popular Front, the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, the Fida Movement-all agreed to approve the document after making a number of amendments to it, as suggested by Hamas delegate in the High Monitoring Committee, Ismail Abu Shanab.
1- Not mentioning the establishment of the Palestinian state on lands occupied in 1967 as a goal of the Palestinian people.
Some observers described the position assumed by Hamas as an attempt to preserve the movement's cohesion and not to lose its popular base. This is due to faith-related reasons, the slogans it raises, and the martyr operations it carries out inside Israel, the relinquishment of which would make it lose aspects of its strength and existence.
On the occasion of completing the international al-Hazimiya-Sofer road works, funded by a grant from Saudi Arabia, Naseeb al-Rayyis, President of the Contra Company which executed the project, honored Development and Construction Council Director Jamal Abd El-Raheem Eitani in a celebration he held at his house in the city of Alia.

Shuhayb then spoke, saying, "Most ministries are absent and most initiatives are present."
"The relationship between Lebanon and our Saudi brothers, and between the Mountain in particular and the Kingdom (Saudi Arabia), enjoys such depth and loyalty that enabled it to become a source for initiatives that emphasize the strength of that relation in all aspects and in all times."
"The challenge started, and I did not do much. My role was limited to gathering the young people of the Development and Construction Council, the Board of Directors, all engineers, and the Projects Department. We all sat down and agreed that this was a challenge that we must meet and complete as required."
He considered that "Kuwait and the Kingdom of Saudi [Arabia] are the most helpful to Lebanon and to the Development and Construction Council in particular."
The Trans Mediterranean Airlines Workers Association decided to dismiss its General Assembly meeting that was planned to be held yesterday, after receiving a promise from the administration to implement decree number 7724 issued on 4/11/2002. The decree provides a raise in daily transport allowance for workers from 2000 to 6000 liras as of the beginning of the year.
The company's administration released a statement to workers and employees yesterday morning in which it informed them of its decision to "implement the provisions of decree number 7724 issued on 4/11/2002 regarding the daily transport allowance as of August 2002."
In spite of that, employers insisted on their position until positive signs started to appear with the Prime Minister's call last week to employers to implement the decree, followed by an explicit call from Industrialist Society Chairman Fadi Abboud a few days ago to "implement the decree and avoid any maneuvering in this regard."
It called on the government to take actions to "defend the dignity of the state, which is being insulted by economic organizations after showing great disrespect toward laws."
The board discussed the livelihood topic and urgent labor issues.
The Union threatened to publish the names of various organizations that are delinquent in implementing the decree "to publicize their infringement of laborers' rights and their violations of laws."
Regarding the electricity issue, the Union's executive board declared its total satisfaction with the decisions taken in connection with securing the rights and compensations due to Lebanon Electricity workers and employees after the Najma Plaza meeting, "where Union leaders managed to insert necessary amendments regarding the rights, benefits, and compensations demanded by the Laborers and Employees Association, and on the basis of which the recommendation to end the strike was made."
It also emphasized that the disagreement regarding appointment of physicians "may not destroy the Union's major achievement of covering dentistry costs," calling on the concerned parties to observe the necessity of adopting this step outside debates.
In the trilateral dialog, the Union emphasized "the necessity of prompt governmental action to preserve the social contract by reviving trilateral meetings that aim at elimination of the heavy accumulations that impede the social livelihood, the correction of which can lead to solutions for many pending issues. As the government is the major invited party to this dialog, it bears the largest share of the responsibility for not accomplishing it, which results in additional living burdens on the working class and limited-income citizens."
Demanding fairness, owners of diesel-powered vans continued their sit-in at the center of Beirut.

"Article 7: All former regulations are to be cancelled. This resolution is valid from the date of issuance."
"Article 2: Exporting Shami goats and Awasi sheep is prohibited."
Parliament's ratification of the regulation and privatization of the electricity sector was the main topic of yesterday's speech by the National Associative Work Front Secretary General Maroun al-Khouli. He told "al-Nahar" that the General Laborers Union leaders failed to resist the privatization laws and transform them to the benefit of laborers of sectors intended to be privatized. They also failed to transform the laws to the benefit of classes of people who will pay the new bills issued by the new investors due to their monopoly of these sectors.
"For the record, we can only salute this unique and pioneering role in defending the rights of laborers."
He noted, "The mission of that council is limited to completing privatization without continuing its administrative and legal supervision and control to protect consumers from increasing prices as a result of monopoly."
He was thirty-nine years old when he was hired by the French state in 1937 to design a bust for the republic's icon Marianne. Sculptor Paul Belmondo, born in Algeria in 1898, was living at that time in Paris and was not yet the obscure father of Jean Paul Belmondo, a bright star in the universal world of theatre and cinema. He was just a young sculptor, attractive and composed. Moreover, he had a zeal, persuasive and vital in the artistic community in a city (Paris) that was experiencing the strongest clash ever between classical and modern artistic schools. Clashes were taking place among the followers of the same school, as it is the case among those who follow the school of expressionism in sculpture initiated by the master Rodin, those who commit to the conservative standards of beauty that started to rise again thanks to the master Bordile, then Charles Despiau, and then Paul Belmondo, after subsiding awhile, facing the currents of modernization.

This idealistic pastor piously leads his people, exuding unselfishly a flowing apostolic divinity that has been ongoing for two thousand years, to rational doxology connected with his man-brother and to a profound proficiency when it comes to religious discussions.
Grammarians never agreed on that.
Authors who wrote for this issue are Daniel Newman (from the Higher Institute of Translation in Brussels), "Myths and Realities in Muslim Alterist Discourse: Arab Travelers in Europe in the Age of Renaissance" (19th c.) and Emmanuelle Pax (from Tours University, France), "Damascus Christians: Territorial Marking and Civility."
Last but not least, Edgar Nammour (independent researcher) wrote "A Story from the Streetcar Line in Beirut by the Newspaper Lissan-Ul-Hal."
Between 1921, the date of his arrival to Paris, and 1937, the year of completion of the bust of the girl Marianne, Belmondo had developed a technique toward full grasp of his tools and materials until his name was famous enough, despite the absorption of the Parisian critics in launching restless battles entitled cubism, abstraction, surrealism, construction, realism, socialism, etc.
Paul Belmondo's favoring of the art of portraiture was natural after Bordail the teacher had restored to this sculpting title the main rank it occupies in the neo-classical fine arts section: "The inscribed surfaces in the face and the light that assures its specific items composed the dilemma around which a sculptor should create." He used to say in reference to the necessity of the sculptor's concentration on the details, which when perfected, indicate skill according to the special personal facial features.
Because of the various details in the vitality of the living models' features, from which a sculpture emerges to assimilate after its completion, Paul Belmondo's sculpture indicates the performance of the artist in his profession that knew a crescendo in technical perfection and manual skill that kept developing in him until his death in Paris in 1982.
Such a saying is never enough to justify the media campaign accompanying the series of preparatory exhibitions, though the contemporary artist who follows the neo-classical current is deeply rooted in French culture and did not win the bet because of the deterioration of this current before innumerable aesthetic suggestions that were imposed in a counter direction to Paul Belmondo's sculpting.

Everyone was working securely under the umbrella of the publication law, which was strictly applied.
It became obvious that the press was on top of the warlords' target list, to silence the warning voice and bury the evidence of the crime.
The Lebanese press still carries deep inside it an essential message stemming from the basic principles and values on which our homeland was established. The most important of those are preservation of peace among the people, co-existence, freedom, sovereignty, and independence.
The two can not be separated.
Lebanon without the press is nothing but a mountainous spot amid this flat, vast geography governed by silence, wrapped in turbans, dominated by the commanding and forbidding ruler as in the story of Scheherazade, where the furious, voracious Shahrayar slays a woman every morning to avenge the wound of betrayal.
And the truth is painful.
That is why he is fond of slaying a media organization every morning, as slave women are slain in palaces.
The war against the media is still on. Attempts to bring the LBC to its knees
"Mutinous" organizations are wanted, dead or alive.
And the best way to do that is to close eyes one way or the other, and what remains is only the perjurer.
One of the most prominent slogans of the Lebanese press in the good old days was, "Say your word and go," which means that a free press says the whole truth and proceeds fearlessly with its march, no matter what the consequences might be.
What is required today is that His Excellency stand by that word and protect it from any blemish or impurity.
President Emile Lahud received Unionist Leader Joseph Reidi and Dr. Jameel Jabr, author of "Patriarch Mar Istafan al-Duweihi, The Glory of Lebanon and Marunites." Lahud congratulated Jabr for his work and hailed Reidi's efforts to release the "Honorable Figures from Lebanon" series.

Muna Khaleel is the representative of the Marine Turtles Protection NGO (MIDEST), the only international NGO for protecting marine turtles in the Mediterranean. At the break of dawn, she carries in her hands six newly born marine turtles. Mothers of the tiny turtles have returned to the al-Mansouri shore, approximately a hundred kilometers south of Beirut. The species had deserted the shore for 30 years.
Several factors contributed to the selection of the preserve for this type of turtle that kills jellyfish, which are multiplying at a rate threatening the ecological system of the Mediterranean.
She adds, "The long-lived green marine turtle becomes able to lay eggs when it reaches the age of 30."
She recalls, "The egg-laying turtles emerge from the sea in groups of four or five as night falls. They advance with their heads up, as they are prepared for any possible danger."
After laying the eggs, the protection process starts.

At the opening of the 20th annual conference of the Asian Football Confederation in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur yesterday, the recently appointed Qatari Federation Director Muhammad Bin Hammam, who succeeded Haji Ahmad Shah of Malaysia in this position, renewed demands for five positions, instead of 4.5, for the Asian continent in the 18th Football World Cup finals to be hosted by Germany in 2006.
Bin Hammam considered that by launching its new Asian Champions League competition, the Asian Confederation is in a better position to justify or support its request for additional positions, "and we want FIFA to provide more opportunities for us to show our talents."
China, which is organizing the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, expressed interest in hosting the Football World Cup of 2014 "if the competition is to be held in Asia that year," declared Chinese Federation Deputy Director Zhang Gee.

Islamic-Christian Research Team Releases Call From France: "Dialog is a Necessity and an Adventure"
At the end of their annual general assembly, the conferees decided to publish the following call regarding the Islamic-Christian dialog, considering it a necessity and an adventure at the same time.
"To us, dialog is not merely a political tactic or an opportunistic position imposed by instant necessities."
"1- Why is the mission of religion misinterpreted and modified to legitimize violence and war?"
"5- How can the positive aspects of human science and progress be preserved, while working simultaneously towards propagating their benefits and fruits for the benefit of humanity?"
"2- We must encourage the establishment of an ongoing dialog that would allow for discovering general and common human values (justice, dignity, dialog, accord, participation, solidarity, cooperation, peace) and putting them into practice."
"6- We must cooperate in developing a common human program to preserve human advancements that would simultaneously rehabilitate spiritual and moral dignity."
Participants from Lebanon included Cardinal Musa Dawud (Head of Oriental Churches Compound in the Vatican); Bishops Gufrael al-Salibi and Boulos Matar; and Messrs. Ghassan Tweini ("al-Nahar" published his contribution), Muhammad al-Sammak, Saud al-Mawla, Abbass al-Halabi, and Hagob Bukradonian.

Both Iran and Saudi Arabia are rejecting an American offensive against Iraq, saying that it could disturb the region. Saudi Arabia also refused to give the U.S. forces access to launch attacks against Iraq from the Saudi territories.
The U.S. has described Iran, Iraq, and North Korea as the "axis of evil" trying to possess weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and warned that it could attack Iraq to topple President Saddam Hussein.
Khatami had arrived in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday and did Umra (minor pilgrimage).
He added, "What it [the U.S.] wants is to control independent regimes and seize the region's resources."

The U.S. and the European Union (E.U.) announced yesterday that field cooperation between the two sides in combating terrorism exceeds by far the disagreements regarding extradition of suspects and information sharing. In a meeting in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, which is currently assuming the periodic presidency of the Union, American Attorney General John Ashcroft and his E.U. counterparts emphasized their united position against terrorism and expressed their confidence that agreements will soon be reached regarding legal assistance and extradition of criminals.

Saudi King Deputy Prince Abd-Allah ibn Abd al-Aziz welcomed in Jeddah the Iranian President Muhammad Khatami, who started on Wednesday a visit to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, amid increasing U.S. threats to launch a military strike against Iraq to overthrow Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer asked, "How can we not extend the state of emergency while we are fighting a war against terrorism?"
He added, "Today, a year has passed after the events of September; we are as resolved and determined as ever to participate in the international efforts, in which the United States of America is assuming a major role, to combat terrorism and uproot that serious disease." He hailed Bush's foresight.
Saudi Crown Prince Abd-Allah ibn Abd al-Aziz had confirmed in a similar letter he sent to the American President the kingdom's determination to combat all forms of terrorism, saying, "They [the hijackers] were deceived, and their minds were hijacked, which converted them into an instrument used to offend Islam and Muslims and to offend an ideal historical friendship between the American people and the Saudi people."
Cooperation among African states in the area of terrorism is based on the Algeria Agreement for Protection From and Combating Terrorism, which was signed in July 1999 during the 35th Summit of the African Unity Organization (transformed in July 2002 into the African Union).
He said, "We will fight with resolve any action that contributes to the independence of Taiwan."
He added that the majority of Taiwan's population, which is over 33 million people, support peace, stability, and strong relations across the Strait of Taiwan, while the leaders of Taiwan support a "separation plan" backed by a small minority.

Meanwhile, North and South Korean officers met in the truce village of Panmunjom to discuss details of a railway agreement and a road to cross the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.

Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Perez said yesterday that the United States does not need to ask itself whether it will attack Iraq or not, and delaying action could be an historical error.
He said, without referring to U.S. President George Bush's administration specifically, before the Foreign Relations Council in Washington: "I believe that the United States would be making a mistake if it asks, 'Should we attack Iraq, and should we attack the forces of Usama bin Laden [leader of the Al-Qaeda organization].'"
However, he described Iraqi President Saddam Hussein as a "cold-blooded murderer" who possesses chemical and biological weapons and has used them against Iran and Kuwait and has used gas to kill his own people.
"And this fully applies to the situation in Iraq."
Maher said before the General Assembly that "Egypt refuses military attacks against Iraq; we must preserve the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq. Iraq in return must respect international legitimacy."

There is no doubt that the United States has started to feel a European "understanding" toward its position, as expressed within the "formalities" of the U.N.
What the Iraqi President's delegates continuously repeat to the outside world, that the strike will take place whether Iraq complied or not, might prove fatal to the Iraqi regime, which has a reputation of suffering myopia when reading  international reality.
It might be useful for the Iraqi President to be aware that he will not get from the Arabs-even the most nationalistically enthusiastic of them-anything but media statements.

After Several Political and Military Street Showings of Power, the Authority Softens Confrontational Tone after Yielding to Judicial Resolution; Nicola Naseef wrote:
This is reflected by highly informed official sources in their evaluation of the events of recent days in particular; this is detailed as follows:
2- The political results intended for the Qirnat Shahwan Meeting declaration to discontinue dialog with the President have not been realized.
station issue, the relationship between authority and opposition issues, the Lebanese-Syrian relations issue, or any other issue remains exclusively in the President's hands.
3- The authority believes that controlling the street lies in its hands, not in the hands of the opposition.
In fact, this evaluation produced by highly informed official sources makes them emphasize that the President is not in the process of confronting the Qirnat Shahwan Meeting. What makes them more adherent to such emphasis is the situation he stated a few days ago, which formed a large political coverage for the movement of security authorities, the army, and internal security forces that were deployed in some areas.
Can we assume that Laila beat the wolf in the Wazzani spring issue in the south?
That day, Israel bombarded the diversion workshop. The workshop stopped, but Rimon Eddah did not stop, since that day, concentrating on the importance of water as an essential element of the conflict with the Israeli enemy. Water is a natural wealth that Israel wants to steal.
The amounts of water total 450 million cubic meters per year, out of which Israel gets 440 million by theft and threats, while Lebanon's share does not exceed 7 million, which might go up to 9 after completion of the new drawing operations to the two areas of Marji'yoon and Jabal Amil, which began this week and raised threats from Israel to the extent that Sharon said, "Diversion operations are reason enough for war."
Naturally, diversion efforts in al-Wazzani continue. At the same time, the Lebanese government conducted wide international communications to explain that Lebanon gets only a small part of its water rights according to international law.
Reasons are that the Israeli cabinet dedicated its most recent session last Sunday to three issues related to Southern Lebanon: the recent operation carried out by Hezbollah in Shib'a farms; the issue of Lebanon diverting part of al-Wazzani water; and allegations fabricated by Israeli intelligence through Zaif Shef in Ha'Arts about 150 to 200 al-Qaeda members allegedly took refuge in Ein al-Helwa camp.
Scientists have managed to isolate a hormone called Ghrelin made in the stomach and used for increasing appetite.
It also accompanies obesity at increasingly high rates in some Asian urban areas.
It seems that balancing the effect of both the Leptin and Ghrelin hormones is the key to controlling the weight of healthy people.
Researcher Allison Rain and Professor Steve Plume, Head of the Medicine Section at Hammersmith Hospital in West London, had previously proven that Ghrelin stimulates hunger in animals. They showed in their recent experiments, published in a scientific magazine, that it has the same effect on humans.
Results showed that the volunteers who were injected with Ghrelin consumed 28% more than those who were injected with the saline solution.
The cause that triggers its formation is still unknown.
But  as the Ghrelin receivers' identity has been determined, it will be easy for orally administered medication to reach the inner secretion cells that produce Ghrelin in the stomach lining.
The Israeli-Lebanese dispute over al-Wazzani water is attracting increasing attention. It triggered an intensive U.S. diplomatic campaign to ease the tensions and to prepare a field action by Washington early next week. Meanwhile, Russia has also started to work on easing tensions.

The ruling National Party of Egypt is to hold its eighth conference today, amid curiosity among political circles whether the party is to renew and develop its cadres and ideology to cope with rapid changes, especially since its old guard holds views different from those of the "newcomer" members, according to analysts.
He expected that "Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture Yusif Wali will continue to be Secretary General and the Minister of Information Safwat al-Shareef and the Minister of Parliament Affairs Kamal al-Shazly will retain their posts of Deputy Secretary General."
He emphasized, "There are demands for reform, but they remain just words with no deeds."
He mentioned that the core of activity is driven by "newcomers in the chronological-political sense, who see a need for development and renewal, and they oppose the old guard."
Abd al-Majeed warned, "There will be a threat to the party if the old guard is eliminated, because the party will lose their useful influence and power in the legislative elections, as newcomers have not yet mastered the art of the election game."
He emphasized, "If the party manages to eliminate the queue of opportunists without achieving true radical reform, then other queues of such devils will emerge," mentioning that "the prisons of Egypt have hosted a large number of members of the ruling National Party leaders."
Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir, Patriarch of the Maronite Church, appealed to Jesus Christ on the anniversary of the Exaltation of the Cross to "give us strength to carry on the message of the Christ in these days," and he prayed for "trust in God despite the difficulties and hardships that we face."
After reading parts of the Bible, he preached a sermon titled "We Preach Christ Crucified" (1 Cor. 1:22). He preached about the meanings of the anniversary of the Exaltation of the Cross, and he said, "The Cross has become a means for redemption; we must bear it with Jesus Christ to join him in the redemption."
"Origanus, one of the great ancient theologians once said after extensive contemplation and experience, 'The blood of the martyrs is the plant of Saints.'  The church is growing, and every time it faces a crisis, faith grows deeper in the hearts of its sons."
"He who searches for Christ and not the Cross will find the Cross and not Christ."
In addition, masses and religious celebrations were everywhere on the anniversary of the Cross.
It also indicated that expenditure grew at a rate lower than overall revenues, which resulted in reducing the deficit compared to expenditure, which rates at 38.4%.
Also during those two periods, overall expenditure growth was less than overall revenues (19.8% and 18.7% respectively), which reduced the deficit rate to expenditure from 43.5% in the first quarter to 38.4% in the second quarter of the current year, and from 43.9% in the first half of the past year to 40.7% in the first half of the current year.
Indebtedness continued to increase. The net overall debt increased at a rate of 39% in the second quarter compared to the first quarter of the current year to approximately USD 29 billion compared to approximately 25 billion by the end of June 2001, i.e., an increase of USD 4 billion.
In the meantime, national imports continued to decrease at a rate of 1.8% and 7.6% respectively during those two periods, which reflects continued signs of low overall demand in the economy.
He warned, "The greatest danger at this stage lies in what is ahead of us in terms of grave threats to Lebanon, Syria, and all Arab countries as the dual American and Israeli tone is emerging."
He confirmed that "al-Kharroub province is at the top of our priorities."

Al-Fawwara is an agricultural town and is famous for its water and its diverse crops of fruit and vegetables. Its fruit production in the mid-seventies exceeded 100,000 cartons, apart from vegetables.
The town of al-Fawwara is preparing for a special day, as it receives today one of the world's most important cardinals, Cardinal Francis George, the Archbishop of Chicago and Head of the International Islamic-Christian Dialog Committee.
In preparation for this event, the municipality mobilized the residents to hold a comprehensive workshop that started by expanding the new church's yard and surroundings, as well as the roads leading to it. Bulldozers were provided by MP Nima Tima, as well as a financial donation to build supporting walls. Most of the expansions were paved, in addition to a large cleaning campaign that covered the town's main entrance, the path of the parade, and the ceremony's venue. The town was filled with welcoming banners and papal, patriarchal, Lebanese, and American flags.

Al-Miqdad emphasized the "necessity of joining efforts among governmental and non-governmental organizations, research centers, and universities in order to secure a better life."
He announced that the aid includes computer training provided to financial and administrative staff and how to use university programs that cover preparing and implementing the municipal budget, setting municipal charges, preparing cost tables, monitoring the progress of municipal transactions, and decision models for municipality councils and directors.
It was agreed that the meeting's agenda will include the "issue of freedoms and the freedom of press, especially in the Arab world, as well as the American attack against Arabs, particularly the war threatening Iraq, the 'Syria Accountability Act,' tightening the grip on Lebanon, and the campaign against Egypt and Saudi Arabia."
On the occasion of the Lebanese National Resistance Front launch anniversary, the Beirut organization in the Communist Party called for an assembly near the memorial scene where the Front's first operation took place at the Concorde-al-Sanai' intersection at 8.00 p.m., the day after tomorrow.

Minister of State for Administrative Development Affairs Fuad al-Saad believes that "the public sector is governed by laws, regulations, procedures, and practices that hinder it."
Fawwaz al-Khuri, from the minister's office and the official in charge of training,  delivered a welcome speech. Civil Service Council Preparation and Training Manager Farouk Deeb also delivered a speech in which he stressed the seminar's importance in arming administrators with managerial skills and abilities to receive everything that is new.
"because the world is also encountering rapid social changes that affect customs and traditions."
He specified the points that must be dealt with as follows: "Change of heart of the Lebanese administrative sector is inevitable, in order to transform from the state of recession to activity, and consequently win time. Accepting this fact by decision makers with true commitment will be of great use. Selecting individuals capable of managing the changing era is a must. It starts with the selection of innovative administrative leaders and qualifying them to play this role through training, innovation assistance, and knowledge transfer. The intention behind that should not be to disseminate a packaged or hybrid imported administrative culture, but rather to make use of previous experiences, provided they are adapted and customized and that additions are developed for them so as to agree with our social and administrative culture and traditions. This is what we are doing today, and this is what we organized previous workshops for."
Reno added that the process of change in ministries goes through general managers.
International Consultant Jean Marc Dosho then presented the leadership abilities for the public sector and talked extensively about total quality management.
"With regard to Israeli threats to Lebanon regarding the waters of both the al-Hasibani and al-Wazzani Rivers, which were the subject of my previous message to your Excellency on 3/23/2001, I would like to indicate the following:"
"During its occupation of southern Lebanon and Western Biqa, Israel destroyed the infrastructure and displaced residents of the area, preventing whoever remained from using the waters of the al-Wazzani and al-Hasibani Rivers. Since 1978, Israel has also seized the total amount of water of both rivers, i.e., approximately 160 million cubic meters annually."
"Whenever Lebanon attempts to secure basic services to the inhabitants of liberated villages and areas, it clashes with Israel's threats to wage war against it."
"It is necessary for me to mention that this message's content has been delivered to the ambassadors of permanent member states of the United Nations Security Council to Lebanon, dated today, September 12, 2002."
"The period given by the cabinet to television and radio organizations to pay the charges required from them expires today. Licenses belonging to TV stations that have not started transmitting yet will be withdrawn today."
He added, "If there are certain problems with the Ministries of Finance and Information, then that would be another issue."
Regarding the fate of media organizations that were given licenses and have not started transmitting yet, he said, "According to the cabinet decision, the licenses will be considered void. However, in reality there are some organizations complaining that they were given licenses but were not assigned wavelengths on which to transmit."
In response to a question about the wavelength and frequency table, he said, "The Minister of Telecommunications says that he will finish that table within a month."
He delivered a sermon welcoming "these moments and hours in Lebanon, St. Teresa embodies the precious wishes that filled her heart and achieves a precious aspiration of her, which is roaming the land that plants the cross of her bridegroom and unveils God's face to any human, encouraging those who come close to love God as she had loved Him."
"I mean St. Teresa for Jesus or Aphilian Teresa in Spain in the 16th century (1515-1582), and the spiritual teacher of St. Teresa Jesus the Child Father Youhanna the contemporary cross of regional St. Teresa."
"She was dedicated in her Carmelite life and has carried all people in her prayers."

"Al-Nahar" General Manager Jubran Tuweini considered that the satellite configurations were introduced to confuse the MTV station case.
He said, "The rulers of Lebanon and their affiliates are, unfortunately, trying to divide everything in Lebanon, including families and parties, in order to increase their benefits from such division and eventually to impose their oppressive policy. That is why we do not want the press to be involved in the riddles of politics and politicians. Presumably, all decisions will be made by full majority."
"The dialog is conducted through the President, not with him. We do not consider the President to be part of the issue, but rather the sponsor of the dialog we require to be held between the Lebanese, on one hand, and the Syrians, on the other, in an attempt to find a real solution and turn a new page. We have not stopped the dialog, but it is the dialog that has become futile."
"We are not suggesting a coup against the rulers, but we are asking them to listen to the point of view of other people who live in the country for the sake of ourselves, our children, and our country's future."
He announced an open invitation to next Tuesday's meeting to evaluate  communications with Chairman Nabeeh Berri and with the Patriarch, as well as  the ongoing developments in the issue to identify the steps required to re-open  MTV.
Let us imagine that the executive manager of a pioneering media organization felt an urge to speak frankly about all the activities carried out by his organization.
"We now possess at least six radio stations and two TV stations in some metropolitan areas."
"Although most decision-makers on our board of directors are some of the greatest supporters for preachers and conservatives in Washington, this does not contradict their determination to show anything as long as it generates profits!"
"Having bought hundreds of radio stations all around the country since the new communications law came into effect in 1996, we are now capable of cloning our voices with enough pretence to make people believe that they are listening to a station with a local team."
"We are extremely enthusiastic to increase revenues from demonstrating our products within our programs."
"Our organization makes millions of dollars from tobacco commercials. It might not be quite responsible to publish a large number of reports about the atrocity of lung cancer resulting from smoking."
"On the other hand, our book section succeeded in finding better ways to communicate with large organizations before signing any contracts with new authors."
"Such devotion may very well hinder the increase of profits that our shareholders are entitled to expect."
His public statement in this regard should take the following form:
"As to restrictions prohibiting ownership of local newspapers, those are on their way out, too."

False Images; Fadi Tawfiq
Indeed, some deliberately distort the image of Arabs and Muslims, but those who do so and repeat it incessantly whenever given the chance, which is quite often, were never known to be keen about their image in the eyes of other people.
They are two separate issues, although they may seem to be identical. While reference to the distorted image implies doing something about improving it, usually reference to their act of distorting our image is a prelude to stating that they hate us.
Even if is usually done with the purpose of distorting the image of certain people who are felt to be capable of "communicating with the Western mentality."

He woke up in the early morning as usual,
His wife was lying in her bed and dreaming that justice would be restored once again.
She tried to rise from her bed. Surprisingly, he told her,  "You can continue your bed-worshipping for a while, and then we will go to the pine forest. Our usual time has not come yet."
She promised her father to walk with him in the fields, and she has no choice but to keep her word.
He hides his secret inside its seats. When she asked why he was late, he forgot his dignity for a while and smiled at her with sheer joy.
The three are walking along small and narrow pathways.
The soil is celebrating the joy of daylight, and the space is closely watching the stillness.
But she was used to his small gifts that he collects from the wild.
How can the body become decrepit midway, without a farewell song amid the secrets of color and the pitfalls of life?
On that day, I remembered that she had not been horrified by a nightmare, and black stories did not come across her.
Over there, at the top of the slope, he surrendered to the internal mother earth. The trees remained standing, reading for him the poems of dawn... One cursed artery down the head took him by surprise, revealing its perfidious face in the last moments of bigotry.

As though the ugly absence was weeping inside her.
The United Action Front, which consists of fundamental Islamic parties, had focused in their election campaigns on the necessity of Pakistan's withdrawal from the U.S.-led anti-terrorism coalition.
For the fourth time in three years, efforts to maintain a Catholic-Protestant administration in Northern Ireland have been dealt a severe blow with the announcement made by the British minister in charge of Northern Ireland affairs, John Reed, that London has decided to suspend indefinitely the activities of the two semi-independent bodies in the British region, namely the parliament and the government, as of midnight Monday (23:00 GMT). This comes after a disagreement on I.R.A. espionage operations caused the peace process to witness the worst crisis since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.
Daloa also has a significance for morale. It is the stronghold of the Bit tribe, to which President Gbagbo belongs.

- Creating opportunities for future generations-Accurate diagnosis of the problem is part of its solution.
In an interview published by the French newspaper "Le Figaro," Ben-Eliezir referred, before heading to Paris yesterday, to the situation in the Gaza Strip, where the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) are regularly carrying out bloody intrusion operations. He said, "There are two possibilities. Either we get out of Gaza, or we go into it. (...) I prefer getting out of it."
The U.S., British, and Arab forces started yesterday the "Early Victory 2" military exercises south of Jordan.
In the meantime, King Abd-Allah II ibn Al-Hussein inaugurated in Amman the first International Special Operation Forces Military Equipment Exhibition (SOFEX 2002) with more than 300 participating companies from 40 countries, in addition to official delegations from approximately 50 countries.
This step comes, according to Reed, in order to allow further negotiations after the Ulster Unionist Party, the major Protestant party in the region, threatened to resign. This would have led to toppling the coalition government that includes four major parties and represents one of the most prominent results of the peace pact.
In a special interview, the British minister expressed that his decision "was the least bad option."
The crisis that erupted because of those accusations took a more dangerous turn when Tremble threatened to resign his post on Tuesday, if the party ministers of the Sinn Fein party, the political arm of the I.R.A., are not dismissed from the local government.
Rebels Halt Cease Fire Negotiations and Threaten to Seize Abidjan
A number of residents quoted rebel soldiers as saying that they are determined to continue southward to reach the president's birthplace.
In Bouake, rebel spokesman al-Serjan Uthman announced the suspension of all cease-fire negotiations with the West African States Economic Group mediators.
He added, "I held talks with everyone and declared a national unity government. That is why the coup is unjustified, and that is why the attackers have no slogan to raise."
Before the rebels declared their withdrawal from negotiations, Senegal's Foreign Minister al-Sheikh Tedban Gadio had reported on Sunday that they approved "in principle" the peace plan which was supposed to be finalized yesterday.
After a brief visit to Qatar focused, according to the Qatari News Agency, on "the situations in Iraq, Palestine, and Sudan," he said, "All Arab states reject any military action against Iraq, and not a single Arab soldier will participate in such an action."
Moussa told reporters before leaving Cairo for Doha that he will hold talks with the Emir (Prince) of Qatar al-Sheikh Hamad bin Kahlifa Al Thani, and Foreign Minister al-Sheik Hamad bin Jasim bin Jabr Al Thani "regarding the latest developments of the situations in Iraq and the Middle East."
In Damascus, an editorial of the Syrian newspaper "Tishreen" said, "Oil represents the major keyword in the U.S.-British war against Iraq. (...) Iraq is a major oil country, whether in terms of reservoirs or production. Accordingly, the U.S. and its companies have been dreaming for a long time of controlling Iraqi oil and, of course, the oil in the Arab Gulf area in general."
Reports said that the demonstrators remained within the University vicinity and distributed a statement condemning "the American aggression against the Middle East," emphasizing their "solidarity with the peoples of Palestine and Iraq."
Tension With Eritrea and Somalia Reconciliation Conference Dominate the Yemeni-Sudanese-Ethiopian Summit
The Ethiopian prime minister, who has been on a visit to Sana'a since Sunday, said, "No one can impose isolation on Eritrea, only the Eritrean leadership can do that."
However, the leaders of the unilaterally declared "Republic of the Land of Somalia" in the northern part of the country, since 1991, decided not to participate in the conference.
"The two countries are currently using different means to promote their interests in the region. (...) Finally, it has been a long time since the international community provided such support as what we are giving now, financially and politically, to achieve peace in Somalia."
Kuaji said, "We are discussing the verification mechanism."
History will record that the Francophone group's member states held in Lebanon the most important summit in its history.
Perhaps from this perspective the summit must be viewed as a historical event that surpasses its representation as a cultural and intellectual parade to its indication as a voice of reason screaming advice and warning of slipping toward wildness or barbarity of international relations.
The summit that brought together 51 states, which are one-fourth of the U.N.'s member states, presents a discourse that is the reverse of or disparate to that of the United States.
The issue here goes beyond the American administration's decision to attack Iraq, occupy it, and administer it as past week's news suggested, in order to subjugate the region that extends from North Africa to the depth of the Arab Gulf, including Lebanon and Syria.
But Americans are not good at French!
"Such a demand was demonstrated in the outcome of talks held by Israeli and American officials prior to the visit."
"The U.S. administration is convinced that presenting a detailed plan and a pledge to make efforts to eliminate the Iraqi threat to Israel can persuade Sharon to maintain self-control."
The newspaper mentioned that a senior U.S. Army official coordinator will be appointed to coordinate with the IDF during the war, whereas the war will be managed by the U.S. Central Command.
Are There Obstacles Before Paris 2?
French President Jacques Chirac assigned a few months ago a high-profile French figure, who enjoys wide experience in such conferences and in economic and monetary international organizations, the task of preparing for the said conference and coordinating among the various international parties that are supposed to participate in it, so as to make it a success.
Finally, he managed to persuade the ruling key players, the government, the parliament, and the political figures to accept and approve these changes. By doing so, he prevented a number of parties and opportunists from seizing the opportunity to embarrass him and have him dismissed because of the increasingly worsening economic crisis. These people did not mind worsening the economic situation to achieve their goals.
His final success will be consolidated when a date for the conference is officially announced.
It has initially.
In such a situation, no one would expect the conference to be held.
Meanwhile, the rest and majority of them believe that the timing of war will not be before next February or March.
The second obstacle that might hinder the Paris 2 conference is a governmental change in Lebanon or the eruption of a governmental crisis.
However, caution is required, particularly as news of governmental change after the end of the Francophonic summit has started to be republished by some media outlets. It is noteworthy in this regard that there is nothing to prevent those who desire change (and they are present and known to all of the Lebanese) from showing patience until the Paris 2 conference is over.
Regardless of the content of discussions in its sessions and the effectiveness of its recommendations and decisions, the "Beirut Declaration," which will be issued as its final statement next Sunday, will definitely be the best attestation, or rather the best will of the age that, as of September 11, is being written with a new mentality of aggression and rashness.
And from that perspective we understand that the Francophone summit "will represent a turn in the organization's political concerns."
This is a matter of extreme moral and political significance at the current stage.
The features of the plans and objectives in this context need no more than monitoring published analyses and statements by American officials in newspapers and media.
A Statement Attributed to Bin Laden Hails Kuwait And Yemen Operations
It specifically named Anas al-Kandari and Jasim al-Hajeiri, describing them as "brothers" of the executors of the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States.
It threatened, "We are continuing on the way (...) and renewing our pledge to  Allah, our promise to the nation, and our menace to Americans and Jews that they will enjoy no stability or peace of mind and will not dream of security until they leave our nation alone and stop their aggression against us."
(WSF,  Reuters, AP)
It added, "The U.S. military units did not respond to the shooting, which occurred at 7:50 local time (4:50 GMT), leaving no casualties."
He added that the Kuwaitis and Americans are reviewing security measures near military exercise sites, since "[such incidents] not only affect the friendly relations between military forces, but also affect Kuwait as a state."
The day following the attack in Failaka, a U.S. military source reported that U.S. soldiers stationed in northern Kuwait opened fire Wednesday evening at "a civilian Kuwaiti car" when they felt threatened. No casualties were reported.
Kuwaiti Minister of Interior Sheikh Muhammad Khaled al-Sabah said that the detainees were planning to attack American and foreign targets, mentioning that al-Kandari, who leads the Kuwaiti cell, recognized Usama bin Laden as a leader.
Saudi Minister of Interior Prince Nayef bin Abd al-Aziz stated that such cells jeopardize the interests of all Islamic and Arab states and damage the Palestinian struggle for independence.
Charles Rizik represented President Emil Lahud.
"- The crisis in the Middle East and the situation in Lebanon: There was agreement regarding this issue, but I cannot give any further clarification about it before it is approved in the ministerial meeting and then in the presidential summit."
"- Terrorism, and agreement has been made regarding this issue."
He announced that all member states of the organization, except for Dominica, will participate in the ministerial meetings, explaining that 32 new ministers arrived today (yesterday), which raises the total number to 46 in addition to special representatives.
The ministerial meeting will be opened this morning at ten o'clock and will be chaired by Salama. The second round will be continued until noon tomorrow.
He also spoke about holding the ministerial conference affiliated with the Francophone Summit in Lausanne next December, which is an important event to the Francophone Organization.
The memorandum submitted by the University to the French presidency and the embassies of Francophone countries and distributed to Arab and French media services reads as follows:
"Second: The absence of independent justice indicates the judiciary situation in Lebanon. Selective justice against Lebanese Christians uses and exploits laws for objectives that are against the multicultural nature of Lebanon."
"Fifth: The authority who is hosting you prevented the Lebanese army from deploying on the Lebanese-Israeli borders and the areas from which the Israeli occupation had withdrawn, while Syria prevents the Lebanese army from entering camps and territories where there is an abundance of criminals and murderers- such as the murderers of the four judges- and terrorists.
Lebanese Phalange Preparing a Conference for Arab Christians; Baqradawani: Hezbollah will Shell Israel if it Damages al-Wazzani Station
"As we shared with the people of the South their liberation joy, the Phalange leadership will share their joy of launching Al-Wazzani water operations, and will have strong presence in this event."
He emphasized, "Sovereignty over water resources is as important as sovereignty over land. Sovereignty is one whole indivisible approach. Hezbollah missiles will be launched against water stations and settlements in Israel immediately if the Lebanese water station is harmed. The balance of horror has been reached: a station for a station, an attack for an attack."
He expressed hopes that "Washington would read and understand the true essence of these messages and respond, not with fury, but with the recognition that should be characteristic of the world's greatest power. The incidents that have occurred and that might occur before the attack against Iraq are nothing but limited operations compared to operations that will take place after the attack."
The Party also looks forward to the Francophone Summit in Beirut to pronounce the message carried by Lebanon to the world, which calls for the dialog of civilizations, religions and their common ground."
Parliament Member and Patriarch Maronite Said Elias Said, said in France, "The resolve of the Lebanese people for decades and their determination to refuse humiliating settlements imposed by the West is an example to follow. It is the successful way for freedom lovers to follow to achieve freedom, independence, sovereignty, and gives hope of a new dawn for freedom soon."
"No wonder, since we are the grandsons of those who have chosen death and captivity over subsiding to the invaders."
"Destiny must obey,"
Two young men from the Patriotic Movement prayed for Lebanon.
Then he welcomed Minister of Tourism Karam Karam, who briefed the President about the results of his participation in the Cairo meeting of Arab Health Ministers, where a unanimous decision was made to nominate Karam as Managing Director of the World Health Organization (WHO), which is one of the largest U.N. organizations of 190 member states. Moreover, its annual budget, including donations, exceeds 5 billion dollars, and it employs more than thirty thousand people in its various units spread around the world.
He added, "Lebanon's nomination for the post of WHO managing director faces fierce competition."
Hoffnanian requested that support of Lebanon for that nomination be discussed on the periphery of the Francophone Summit.
At five in the afternoon, the President received the Minister of Information Ghazi al-Areidi. The two held a session that dealt with local and regional issues.
The surprise visit paid to Beirut by U.N. Secretary General Special Envoy to the Middle East Terry Rod-Larsen yesterday to discuss the issue of al-Wazzani water added further importance to diplomatic efforts being made at various levels in line with the launch of the water-drawing project from al-Wazzani to a number of southern villages tomorrow.
He noted, "The Israeli threats to Lebanon are meant to inhibit it from obtaining the share of water it is entitled to, just as was the case when it demanded after the Israeli retreat from the South millions of square meters claimed by the Israelis." He also said, "As we succeeded in restoring 17 million square meters of our southern lands because we deferred to the truth and international laws, we will also succeed in relieving our people in the South from thirst. The U.N. must ensure application of international pacts and covenants, because in our view it is the only reference capable of doing so."
"Additionally, we discussed the issue of water in southern Lebanon."
After the meeting, which lasted for approximately forty-five minutes, he told reporters:
"We decided to discuss these issues further."
"I am going to Israel today, with an arrangement to return soon to resume talks with Lebanese officials."
Criticizing U.S. President's "Mirror Policy," Berri: Lebanon Respects U.N. Decisions
"However, what I do not understand is his insistence on changing a regime or overthrowing a person with force, even if that person is a dictator."
"It is more worthy to leave the people the right to change their regime themselves."
He stressed, "Those people have a right to their land, and Resolution 194 issued by the U.N. Security Council recognized the Palestinians' right to return."
Berri had sent a telegram yesterday to Ukraine Parliament Chairman Vlodimir Letcin and to the Moldavian Senate Chairwoman, thanking them for their invitation to visit both countries, which he promised to answer at a later time.
Rod-Larsen will be Waterline Engineer; Chirac's Visit Bears Specific Significance and Supportive Positions
Chirac previously visited Lebanon in 1996 and in 1998. His third official visit will not be longer than 12 hours, during which he will hold a summit with his counterpart Emil Lahud upon his arrival in Beirut. After the summit, Chirac's agenda will include an expanded Lebanese-French meeting, a business lunch, inauguration of the National Management School (INA), an important speech he will deliver in the parliament, talks with Prime Minister Rafeek al-Hareeri in his office, continuing on to UNESCO to close the Francophonic City Municipality Directors Conference, and will finally end his day with a private dinner with Prime Minister Hareeri.
- The Paris 2 conference and the intention of the French president to announce its starting date after declaring the outcome of communications made by French diplomacy.
They indicated that Paris contacted Washington and New York as part of the coordination efforts to affirm Lebanon's right to al-Wazzani water.
3- Iraq and the U.S. threats of an attack to topple the regime in Baghdad.
They also noted that Rod-Larsen requested urgent meetings with the three chiefs and the foreign minister before Sunday. He only wished to hold the meetings individually with each chief or minister, which caused surprise and puzzlement, not only to Lebanese officials but also to international officials accompanying him.
Francophone Organization Demands "Strict Positions" on Violations International Human Rights Federation Concerned Over "Increased Security and Despotic System in Lebanon"
The Federation's Executive Manager Antoine Bernard started the meeting by reading a Federation statement that said, "The human rights situation in Francophone states has not improved."
Yuland Georgio then spoke on behalf of the Humanitarian Rights and the Human Right Organizations-Lebanon and referred to the closing of the MTV station by court decision, which "represents an example of human rights violation."
After a speech was delivered by Dr. Eli Abu-Oun, the representative of the new human rights organization al-Bitha, addresses were made by Palestinian Human Rights Organization representative Bassam Hebeishi, Nabeel Mimari from the Lebanese Human Rights Association, and Ghazi Aad from the Support of Lebanese Exiles and Detainees Committee (SOLED), who revealed that "the Lebanese Henry Dou, born in 1958, was arrested at the Syrian border on October 11, and his fate is unknown."
Some Palestinians also presented the problems of asylum applications and the situation inside the refugee camps, and mothers of detainees in Syria raised the cases of their sons.
Monsignor Abdallah Al Semaani assisted him along with the priests of the parishes of the practice clerics, which are Bsharre, Bkaakafra, Hasroun, and Diman, in the presence of a crowd of priests, monks, and nuns.
"A joy with a prayer that each one of you is according to the will of the Lord Jesus' Heart."
"Three weeks ago, the region was celebrating a wedding as it received a bride of the Christ, Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus, not only in Hatchit where is located a school for nuns named after her, and not only in Bsharre where is located a convent for the monastic order she belonged to, but in all the region of Jebbeh."

Friday, October 18, 2002
British MP George Galloway toured the South yesterday, and warned once again of a new "Sykes-Picot" being prepared for the area.
At his end, Qawook stressed, "The resistance is at its ultimate preparedness to respond to any possible attack by the Zionist enemy, because it is fully determined to protect the great national achievement represented in the restoration of Lebanon's right to its water."
After he was welcomed by Abul-Enein, Galloway delivered a speech in which he said: "I own two houses, one in Scotland and another in London. My house in Scotland is called Tal El-Za'tar, and now I have a new house in Al-Rashidia camp, which I visited 20 years ago with some Palestinian brothers."
"They are trying to destroy the Arab power in order to establish a new Arab system and to choose for it leaders of their liking. They are now trying to destroy the regime in Palestine, and you know they are saying that President Arafat, who was legitimately elected, has to go."
"That was the reason for the demonstration we held a week ago in London, which was the largest in British history."
"They are destroying Iraq because they do not want a powerful Arab state, because if there is a powerful state, there will be balance with Israel."
Galloway had met with a member of Al-Wafa'a Resistance movement, MP Abd-Allah Qaseer and Hezbollah International Relations Officer Nawwaf Al-Mousaoui in the Relations Center.
The team was frustrated at the increasing speed of dry eastern winds that have been blowing through the area since Sunday night, thus contributing to further kindling of the fire, as well as violent and sudden spreading of the flames inside the forest, devouring new areas that, based on initial estimates, have exceeded a million and a half square meters. This area is likely to increase if the winds do not stop, particularly since the army's military helicopters have to stop operating once darkness falls.
This means a major disaster to be added to the current disaster resulting from the fire, which has left thousands of charred trees.
Assigned by Civil Defense Director General Brigadier Darweesh Hibeika, the Civil Defense Operations Director George Abu-Moussa inspected the site. After touring the fire locations, he said, "Serious difficulties face the firefighting operations. Everyone is making his utmost effort to combat the fire under difficult circumstances due to the nature of the area. Fire engines were unable to reach the major fire points, and military helicopters are making huge efforts to circumvent the fire at these different points."
Another fire also broke out in woodland between Barashit and Beit Yajoun.
The problem of Palestinian refugees in the camps of Sidon with the UNRWA agency that is in charge of their relief and employment in the places of immigration is being provoked by the deteriorating economic, social, health, and educational situation that the Palestinian refugees have been suffering for years. The major cause of these circumstances is the service constriction policy adopted by the agency in Lebanon, according to objecting parties.
"Our rights are lost. We cannot benefit from schools, medical care, or medication."
"Israel displaced us."
Samira Halloum emphasizes that her brother "has been ill for over two weeks, and we cannot admit him to a hospital."
"I would like to ask, is the UNRWA owned by the U.S., France, and/or Britain?"
They wondered, "Why are some of our people who carry cards not entitled to receive the most elementary human rights of education and medical treatment?"
In a ceremony held at the spring's location, Qublan presented Wahbi with an acknowledgement coat of arms for executing the project in less time and at the highest technological standards.
He added, "This first step on the way to restoring the water will be added to the southerners' achievement of restoring the land."
"This water belongs to the southerners to use as they please. No one can tell them how to use it."
He then moved to the southern side, where there are restaurants, swimming pools, and cafés. He seemed comfortable with the abundance of water and listened to detailed explanations from Ramadan about everything related to the project of drawing water to Marjiyon villages.
He was asked whether he would attend the launching celebration tomorrow.
As to Moscow's view of the Israeli threats to Lebanon, he said, "As I said, if there is an issue or a problem it must be solved through diplomacy and political means."
In the afternoon, the spring was also inspected by Australian Ambassador Stephanie Shwapski, accompanied by the engineer supervising the project, Rasheed Falha, and engineer Ramadan.
Al-Hareeri Returns from Paris 2 with Positive Impressions, Reinforced By Internal And External Indications; Promotional Tour Continues and Expected First Harvest a Billion Dollars From Japan, Malaysia, and Canada; Why The Aid?
Although the level of representation at the conference has not yet been finalized, the invitation will be addressed to the presidents to select the participating delegation.
Added to that is France's direct interaction with donor states, urging them to participate and provide financial support to Lebanon.
Al-Hareeri sensed Arab and international concern with this location through his recent activity, particularly in Japan where there was recognition of "the importance of achieving steady growth in Lebanon for the stability of the Middle East and of providing it with support for that purpose."
While Lebanon seeks aid from Japan, the latter is suffering a growing general debt that is being funded by local banks, as the Japanese government and central bank are attempting to restructure the debts. It was thus amusing that Lebanon, for the sake of a joke, offered to provide technical assistance, as the Japanese situation is not too far from the Lebanese situation in form, of course, not in magnitude!
Thamer delivered the Industrialists Society's speech, in which he said: "Around five years ago, the Lebanese Industrialists Society started to run media and advertising campaigns to increase consumers' awareness and encourage them to buy products manufactured in Lebanon."
Erbeid then spoke and said: "The campaign is the first phase of an integral campaign that will extend through three phases:"
"They are also an invitation to industrialists to develop new and modernized marketing strategies to highlight the preferential edge of Lebanese industry that is based on specialization and superiority. They are also invited to increase advertising budgets in marketing operations to show the added value, art, and beauty of our products."
"Beirut of Overlapping Times," a Joint Photographic Exhibition for ALBA and Lemiere; The Slow Lens Reveals the Location and Its Consecutive Civilizations; Donabelle; Sites
All of them took traditional pictures within the period February-April, 2003, gathered necessary documents, wrote captions, and chose the best snapshots.
In this context, the selected topics acquired an important cultural indication, particularly since the archaeological excavations at the city center were rich material for people wishing to highlight the wealth of civilization that our capital enjoys, and which reveal successive historical ages.
Between the survey and artistic selection there were numerous stages. The final result was photographs showing: the Kanaanic city in the Al-Tal area north of the Martyrs Plaza, remains of the Roman Elcardo Maximos and its extensions, the Marounite Cathedral of Mar Girguis (eighteenth century), and Roman baths at the Tallet EL-Saraya depression.
The site was the center of exchanges in the city, due to its strategic location near the port and because it created a link between Beirut and beyond the sea.
The exhibition bears artistic, documentary, and historical values.

"Awaiting the Other," a Choreographic Show for Michel Halette Ygayane "Promotion" of Gilgamesh from Divinity to Humanity
Gilgamesh recognizes his mortal image in his friendship with human Ankido, who guides him through the human meanings of a living existence that is only complete if touched by the time, if he gets to know the places and gets tired from traveling, then he ends by going back to his home country loaded like any human with knowledge, wisdom, and conviction that each one born has an end.
The four of them seem to scent the "Awaiting the Other" show with their presence, elaborated according to rhythms that are hardly floating on the body of each one like shivers or shakes staying in place so they look like digging in place until melting, certainly in the eyes of the spectator.
Bruno Miechon is active and present, though his role is restricted within performances focused on his colleague.
The decor shows up, preceded first by lightings as they are only there to bring attention to this female dancer or that male dancer; it looks like cartoons on the wall deep in the podium, which did not match a dancing show designed to be deeper than the theater of Abed El Kader School.
On the theater entry, many people stopped when the show ended and the French Orchestra played a piece from the mythology of the Mesopotamia civilization.

SOLED: Syrian Interior Did Not Fulfill Its Promise to Lebanese Detainees' Families
"After the lapse of the three-month period promised by Syrian Minister of Interior Ali Hammoud to the families of Lebanese detainees in Syrian prisons during his meeting with them in his office in the Ministry of Interior, Support of Lebanese Exiled and Detained (SOLED) presents the following remarks:"
"- It is truly regretful to find continuation of the official Lebanese approach that is always trying to deny the presence of Lebanese detainees in Syrian prisons, in spite of all the proofs, evidence, and even admissions, the last of which was the admission made by Syrian Prisons Director Brigadier Bughous Al-Sarraj in front of the delegation of families and in the presence of the Syrian Minister of Interior of detaining Lebanese civilians and military personnel."
"- The governmental committee that was assigned the task of hearing complaints of families of the missing is in possession of all conclusive proof, among which is the official Syrian message that  proves without the least doubt the presence of Lebanese in Syrian prisons."
A number of Iraqi refugees demonstrated in solidarity with their fellow citizen Assad Muhammad Ali, who is now lying in a coma at a hospital while the money required to cover two surgeries to treat skull and thigh fractures is being arranged for.
Their resort to the Commissioner's Office  "is because covering the costs of our treatment is our legitimate right."
"But it did not."
The officials in the Commissioner's Office are fully aware of the demonstrators'  demands.
"We had no expectation that he would do so."
"However, the matter is difficult also due to the international crisis."
Meanwhile, the protestors addressed a memorandum to the Commissioner's Officer Delegate in Beirut, Mustafa Al-Jamali, in which they demanded the Commissioner's Office "pay the accustomed share of approved medical costs for its recognized refugees, so that the two surgeries can be performed tomorrow without delay or procrastination."
Following is the content of a medical report prepared by Dr. Nuzeer Nofal in the Beirut hospital regarding the condition of Iraqi refugee Assad Muhammad Ali:
"He was subjected to emergency head surgery, where the skull fractures were corrected and the hemorrhage stopped. The thigh fracture was also fitted with a brace."
The hospital administration appended to the report in handwriting that "the cost of surgery as mentioned is approximately 14,000 U.S. dollars."

In a press conference, he said, "Firing at the students was unjustified whether in terms of self-defense by the police or public security."
Meanwhile, Tehran reopened one of two border points with Afghanistan after having closed it for five months due to incidents on the Afghani side.
IRNA also indicated that the first group that crossed the border included Iranian officials who were heading for Afghanistan to hold negotiations regarding the re-opening of the border river of Helmand.
Diplomatic sources revealed Arab and international communications with the Iraqi leadership preceding their announced acceptance of Security Council Resolution 1441 urging them to accept it, as it spares Iraq a U.S. military strike and spares countries of the region the consequences of such a strike, while rejecting this resolution gives President Bush a pretext to justify the strike.
Although this administration reached an agreement with all member states of the Security Council, particularly the five major states, on issuing Resolution 1441, it will face disagreement with some of these states and with the Arab states if the United States wages war against Iraq without referring to the Security Council to discuss the report of the WMD inspection team in Iraq after completing their mission, and issuing a new resolution in light of that. Nothing can justify waging such a war by the United States against Iraq except Iraq's obstruction of the inspection team's work.
However, some sources of information expect the U.S. military strike against Iraq to be quick and swift, so as to give no time even for convening an Arab summit before establishing a new regime in Iraq and imposing on the states of the area to deal with it as a fait accompli.... Neither will the Security Council have time to convene before imposing such a status quo on it....
The battle against that was based on Security Council Resolution (1441). Powell was also assisted by the French to a great extent and to some extent by the Russians, who were determined to stop U.S. unilateral use of military force against Iraq. He added that the Syrians supported the Security Council resolution because it was not a war-waging resolution, and all the Arab world wants to avert war against Iraq.
A Ministerial Statement in English!
This rejection collapsed before the prerequisites of Paris 2, and the plan was born with vision. For the first time, Lebanese citizens see figures on paper, facts on paper, and promises on paper.
As much as it stimulates optimism, it burdens its developer with the consequence of exaggerated promises and, for the first time, perhaps exaggerated alarm.
The area of obscurity, whether negative or positive, is usually left to enable parties or states to make a reading according to their desires and to construe as they wish, when the draftsmen have no option but to resort to settlement.
This is a point of essence that evinces its liberation from the complex of reproach or even fidelity mistrust.
This also involves an extraordinary maneuver, even if such a maneuver is meant to lure the states into accommodating the government's requests.
So does that scenario include, also hypothetically, that the 27 states and organizations of Paris 2 have vital interests in drawing a red line in Lebanon under the title of preventing destabilization of economic and social stability?
Sharon Still Ahead of Netanyahu and Labor Voters Confused Among 3 Competitors
"And in the studios of Channel 2, a debate was held among the three candidates for leadership of the Labor Party and party candidacy for the prime minister post."
"However, it seems the audience was not impressed with his first promise and remained indifferent toward the glad economic tidings that came bare of any reference to tangible means by which that will be achieved."
As to the Labor Party leadership competition, the newspaper said: "While Ben- Eliezir needs to defend his style in running the party and justify his participation in Sharon's government, Haim Ramon must convince voters that he is better than Ben-Eliezir."

At a time when the drums of war are being beaten in attempts to establish alliances that are to lead states and regions into wars and tragedies, it is not trivial that bugles should be blown in the French capital to establish a throng, or demonstration as was said in Beirut, with a view to leading Lebanon's stumbling economic hand and help it through its difficulties toward a normal situation that enables it to regain its health and growth.
A country such as Lebanon also deserves a coalition for good, in an age hosting excessive reference to "axes of evil."
However, Lebanon, which is radically refreshed with intangibles, is not only expecting intangible yields and gains from Paris 2, as summarized by Rafeek Al-Hareeri: "One of the factors of international support for Lebanon is to preserve its stability due to its ramifications in the area."
If the conference is going to open parentheses or arms for us, it would be more worthy of us to open parentheses or arms for ourselves. It would be truly interesting should Hareeri manage to gather a demonstration of 17 states to support and assist Lebanon, while we almost totally fail to find a similar gathering of Lebanese politicians and "leaders" who stand in deeds not words beside Lebanon.
Mr. Faruk Al-Shar' is, as it is well known, the Foreign Minister of the Arab Republic of Syria. In that capacity, his attention is focused outward.
However, Minister Al-Shar' has recently acquired, it seems, a new secondary authority, that being discourse meant for Lebanese consumption.
In the latter case, the message undoubtedly involves an attempt to extinguish the fire ignited by verbal arsonists when they leaked, for ridiculous internal purposes, the fabricated news of a meeting between the Iraqi foreign minister and the secretary- general of Hezbollah.
First, because the presence of a throng of meddlesome journalists, which remains a characteristic of Lebanese consumption, obliges the official when asked to give lengthy explanations followed by a complex analysis, even if it lacks logical coherence.
From that perspective, Lebanese consumption talk seems to be beneficial, and its results are truly worth the effort it requires from Minister Al-Shar' and other Syrian and Lebanese officials, particularly since it not only satisfies those who are known to be bugles, but it also penetrates some opponents of Syrian hegemony, when they conclude from the Syrian commitment to the American line that Damascus has obtained an extension of the authorization it was granted over Lebanon during the Gulf crisis.
Also, security cooperation against fundamentalism, no matter how much it is indicative of proper conduct, is not worthy of reward to Washington, which is unaware that Syria is not trading its own goods in this regard.
Paris 2 Paper Absent From Cabinet Discussions
After the Higher Privatization Council session presided over by Prime Minister Rafeek Al-Hareeri, Minister of Energy and Water Muhammad Abd Al-Hameed Baydhon informed Al-Nahar that the meeting was "a review of the reports required in privatizing electricity to show the progress of work on it."
He expected the book of terms to be completed to announce the tender for selling 40% of the electricity late this year.
The Lebanese paper to the Paris conference, of which Al-Nahar published excerpts yesterday, mentioned, "The government will establish a public commercial company for the production and distribution of energy and another for its transfer."
The one-hour session was preceded by a 45-minute private meeting between President Emil Lahud and Rafeek Al-Hareeri.
Noteworthy is that the electricity sector represents, with the telecommunications sector, the cornerstone of the privatization project on which the government is depending to obtain from it and from assignment transactions 5 billion dollars next year.
And the legal report, the preparation of which was assigned to a law firm.
He found it more likely for that to happen after some time and expressed optimism regarding "completion of stages required for privatization." He noted that Lebanon Electricity currently has due debts worth 150 million dollars that must be paid.

He also expressed a view that licenses should not be granted for establishment of profit-seeking higher education institutions.
The session was ended with prayers at half past one in the afternoon.
In a comment on Security Council Resolution 1441 and its approval by Iraq, Buwez said: "The importance of the resolution lies in its blocking of the way, not only against American unilateral action, but rather against a serious precedence represented by the war decision taken by the United States separately from the international group, which was the case."
"It is now Iraq's turn to handle this matter intelligently, even if at the account of some national dignity due to the injustice and provocation embedded in this resolution."
"This is in addition to the potential positive moral impact."
Fast-Breaking Banquets of Fadl-Allah: Thought Cannot Be Confronted With Bullets and Violence; Nasr-Allah Supports Any Credible Economic Treatment
"We are facing today a cultural attack that is more dangerous than the political attack. It might even be intended to defeat political positions by picturing the status quo as being retarded, uncivilized, against human rights, and against freedom so that we lose our self-confidence, because we did not assume the thought they present us with as our culture."
* Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasr-Allah announced in a fast-breaking banquet held by the Provision Charity Society in Al-Ghubeiri Garden yesterday that the party "is not involved in political harassment in the economic matter. It supports any prime minister and any governmental body that presents a true and credible treatment of the economic situation, and we will support them and support any governmental party that makes genuine efforts to treat the economic and financial situations."
He also called for "keeping social offerings untouched, particularly social insurance and offerings given to people who have no one to support and fund them."
He introduced the speakers, and Engineer Muhammad Harb spoke on behalf of the committee.

Lahud Congratulates Akl for International Attorneys Union Presidency
The President wished the new International Attorneys Union President success with his new responsibilities.
"The conference session during which the election took place was an international festival for Lebanon and the Arab world shared with us by Arab attorneys association chairmen and large numbers of Lebanese and Arab attorneys, headed by Mr. Sameh Ashour (Egyptian Attorneys Association chairman) and the Union's Secretary-General Mr. Farouk Abu-Eissa, in addition to a large number of professional association chairmen in Europe, America, Africa, the Middle East, and Arab countries."
He mentioned that he will endeavor to increase the effectiveness of the Union, which is based in Paris and enjoys a consultant status with the United Nations and the European Union. It is represented in all U.N. centers in New York, Geneva, and Vienna, in addition to its consulting attendance in the International Penal Tribunal of the Hague. The Union has an important budget used for the reinforcement of legal matters and scientific activities.
The President commended "the Arab and international presence of Lebanese law specialists in general, and attorneys in particular. He considered that "Lebanon, who has regained its regional and international role was always present at international forums through a select of its citizens who raised its name high, and proved that this country is small in terms of size and area, but large in terms of its abilities and its people's capabilities."

Is it the Ministry of Transport, which is required to observe any excess in the load of trucks that damaged the bridge, in much the same way they damaged other bridges before?

We ask all groups of the Lebanese community to forgive us. Those for whom the month of Ramadan causes inconveniences and increases their suffering more than those to whom fasting is imposed by this holy month. Like the suffocating traffic jam before Iftar time, the mad rise in vegetable prices due to the increase of demand, of those of us who fast, for Fatoush, aggravation of those who fast by people who don't fast for many reasons such as smoking, eating in front a fasting person, unusual nervousness under the pretext of fasting, and the bizarre things that some fasting people do and that has nothing to do with the pillars of the true Islamic religion that is forgiving and supreme above all trivial things.

The question remains: What will the reaction of the people be after this policy buries them under the rubble of despair and frustration and makes deprivation prevalent among them?
Edition number: 1
There was no variance in these reactions among organizations close to the U.S. administration and those opposed to any coordination with Washington, while statements of some parties such as the Iraqi Communist Party emphasized that the new decision came as "an outcome of the efforts of all forces of good and peace, the endeavors of states committed to international legitimacy, and the activity of the increasing anti-war and anti-dictatorship movement in Europe and some concerned circles in Arab countries."
The Kurdish parties did not differ from their Arab counterparts. Kurdish National Union Leader Jalal Talibani said that this resolution means temporary postponement of the war, while the U.S. administration's decision to change the regime remains unchanged.
Shafeek Qazzaz, one of the ministers in Barzani's government, said, "Iraq led itself into this snare. Whatever its position on the resolution will be, there will be interference with the affairs of Iraq."
However, this organization also believes that the new resolution "will not reassure the Iraqis, who will remain under anxiety and trouble until this nightmare is heaved off their chests with their will and efforts."
Prime Minister Rafeek Al-Hareeri sponsored yesterday afternoon in the Government House the signing of an agreement for a 50 million dollar loan from the Kuwaiti Fund for Arab Economic Development to fund a construction project of 22 public schools to accommodate 34,000 pupils in the city of Beirut.

He saluted "the courage of the Lebanese state and its determination" to carry out these steps, valuing the pivotal role performed by the banking sector as part of the Lebanese economy. He also emphasized confidence in this sector and in its dynamism and the continuous development movement that accompanies it.
He noted that in this regard the Union will hold next June a banking summit in Montreal, Canada, and will invite to it the Canadian Central Bank to discuss current issues, most important of which is Arab-American banking relations.

One of the most beautiful, honest, and wonderful names of Virgin Mary, which She Herself declared in Lourdes,  "I am the Immaculate Conception."
Even though this ideal for Virgin Mary became a reality, since the first moment she was created in her mother's womb.
The high title "Full of Grace" praises the free divine gift.
Is it possible that God raises a virgin girl to the honor of the Divine Motherhood without granting her perfectionism and sainthood, of which any creature on earth or in heaven, no matter how much she is blessed, cannot get anything similar?
After being announced by the angel, she offered to the divine initiative a complete contribution according to her reply: "I am the servant of God."
It is our good luck, we Lebanese, that we acquired her love since our young age and kept her adoration as a precious inheritance from our fathers and ancestors.
The ship had stopped at night at Al-Muklla port on the Gulf of Aden southeast of Yemen.
This new shipment comes as part of a deal made in 1988 between Sana'a and North Korea for Yemen to purchase tens of missiles, fuel, and spare parts, according to sources close to the government.
It seemed that releasing the ship neutralized a situation that could have exploded in the region, in which tensions are increasing in severity since the United States revealed that it is willing to wage war against Iraq on allegations that it possesses weapons of mass destruction.
It added that a number of commercial, economical, cultural, and artistic agreements will be signed.
At the end of September 2001, the Russian "Vedomosti" newspaper quoted sources in the presidency that Russia will provide Yemen with MIG 29 aircraft worth 300 million dollars.

North Korea also announced on Thursday that it will launch a program to produce plutonium, which was covered in the 1994 agreement.
As at least one of every 20 people in North Korea, whose population is 23 million, wears a military uniform, this is one of the world's most committed countries to the military style.
The two countries reached an agreement last September to repair railways and roads crossing through the demilitarized zone, which extends for four kilometers, for the first time since the Korean War, which continued from 1950 to 1953 and ended with an armed truce.
Spokesman of the Afghani government Sayed Fadl Akbar stated that Karzai, who is accompanied on his tour by a large number of ministers, will visit Sweden, Italy, and Norway, while the United Nations will address an international call in the year 2003 to gather aid for his country.
International donating parties pledged an amount of 5.4 billion dollars during the next five years for reconstruction of the country while Afghan officials say that the country is in need of ten billion to cover these costs.

Meanwhile, attacks were renewed against bases of the international coalition against terrorism in Afghanistan.
In the framework of pursuing remnants of Al-Qaeda, a judicial source reported that the court of North Cairo decided to continue incarceration of the media official of Al-Qaeda, Muhammad Najah Abd Al-Maksoud, known as Abu-Musaab, for 30 days.
The public prosecution renewed his incarceration for six months, which is the maximum time according to the law.
It added that he was submitting daily to the leader of Al-Qaeda Usama bin Laden and Al-Zawahri a summary of the news related to Al-Qaeda transferred by broadcasts and translating the articles and the editorials related to the organization that were published in the two magazines "Time" and "Newsweek".

He added, "The activities of the Islamic Iranian Republic in this field are totally transparent, clear, and peaceful, and there is no secret or ambiguity" with regard to those two sites, explaining that their task is based on "securing fuel" for nuclear stations under construction or planned for construction.
Moscow and Tehran intend to add two reactors to the Bushahr station and are studying the establishment of another station in Alahwaz.
NATO Places its Capabilities under the Disposal of the European Union
It was also considered that the agreement a has conclusive effect on the actual launching of the European Union's rapid response force, which will include approximately 60,000 personnel and will be an armed appendage for the Europeans to conduct peacekeeping or other humanitarian operations.
The heads of the Union's states and governments confirmed Friday the "willingness" of the member states to replace "as soon as possible" the peace force affiliated with NATO deployed since September 2001 in Macedonia according to the wording of the summit's final statement.
The Union states suggested, in what was described as a concession to the Turks, excluding the participation of Cyprus, which will join the Union in 2004, in any European military operation in which NATO means are used.
A meeting is supposed to be held between the NATO Council and the Political and Security Committee of the Union next week to sign the joint declaration.

However, Foreign Minister Ahmad Maher denied after that the existence of such a complaint presented by Egypt against Israel and said, "We did not submit any complaint to the United Nations." This statement caused a storm of severe criticisms to the government and the foreign minister by representatives who considered that the minister's denial "reveals serious negligence and deficiency in encountering a continuous Israeli crime against the Egyptian people, their land, and their water."
Al-Chalabi, Karzai of Iraq, a Charismatic Personality and His Past Obstructs His Ambitions
In exile, he studied in American universities to become a professor of mathematics, and he moved between London and the United States.
But the operation failed, which drove Washington to abandon the project.
Out of an original amount of a hundred million dollars allocated to him by Washington in 1998, the Conference only received a little.
Some opposition groups also hold against him the use of the National Conference for personal purposes.
Al-Chalabi denies being the "Iraqi Karzai," as he is described occasionally in analogy to the Afghani president who is supported by the United States.
U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell invited yesterday his Russian and Chinese counterparts and European Union Foreign Policy and Common Security High Commissioner Javier Solana to discuss means of solving the crisis raised by North Korea's nuclear program.

We quickly introduce the explanation that acquires all the meanings of assurance that there is no argument about saying the truth, for it is the sun glowing with light and there is no darkness in its presence.

Neither Progressive Socialist Party Chairman MP Waleed Jumblat nor Minister Talal Arsilan needed the cell phone agreement to stir in the face of Presidents Emil Lahud and Rafeek Al-Hareeri a storm of rehabilitation of the cabinet by requesting them to respect the decree regulating this council.
In the last days this issue was raised again, and it seemed that the intention behind it was to direct more than one criticism to the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister alike for their overriding of the cabinet's role.
The essence of this mechanism is that the cabinet deals with the projects agreed upon as if they were an official process in its final stages of sealing on the table of the cabinet.
When they disagree, the ministers split into the ministers of Lahud, the ministers of Al-Hareeri, and the ministers who are spectators or overshadowed, and when they agree, the decision is left to both presidents alone.
And in any of these disagreements, neither Lahud nor Al-Hareeri referred to the cabinet their being part of it, but rather to Syria.
It is obvious that a switch in the constitutional position such as this that makes the President of the Republic a partner of the executive authority, not an arbitrator in it or between it and the parliament, does not worry in its results the Prime Minister even if it does not please him in any case with its mechanism of happening for its restriction of his role.
This was obvious through the decisive American procedure on the item of interrogation that will include the Iraqi scientists and technicians, particularly the part that stated explicitly the permissibility of interrogating those outside Iraq after transferring their families, to eliminate the possibility of their being exposed to pressure or punishment if they reveal the confidential information they possess.
But the story is not dependent on what Mr. Blix wants or refuses. In view of the escalating threats to wage war against Iraq, America will find a number of whispering scientists who are haunted by the "American Dream" as it haunted before them the German scientists during World War II and after it and as it haunted Soviet scientists before the Perestroika and after it, but it is not clear in the end if there really is anything worth whispering of weapons or information supporting the excuses of Bush, who regularly beats the drums of war.
And when we talk about 500 scientists, then we must find among them a "Judas" or a number of "Judases," unless the "disciples" of Saddam Hussein are of a different type.
The Search for Judas!
Indeed, no one needed to explain the comments of Thomas Friedman ("New York Times" 12/2/2002) nor the statement of Richard Lugar, the next chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in Congress, who expressed the day before yesterday that the inspection operations will not lead to anything unless the Iraqi scientists start providing information in return for their obtaining the right to asylum.
The story of scientists' asylum is not a mere analysis or guess, but rather it is one of the most prominent items in the American issue on Iraq.
And that is a matter not believed even by Thoma!
For after the Celles company signed the part of the contract relevant for transfer of ownership of the cellular to the state, positions were taken by the company and by the ministry indicating that the issue of the two documents for collection of the state rights from the two cellular companies was ended with disappointment, knowing that fierce battles were fought in the previous government for those two documents but without use until now.

He said, "We will move next week to announce the tender book and prepare later to receive bids, qualify them, and unseal them."
The first act of the previous cellular effort, which is based on operating the sector according to the agreement, was finalized with the signing by Celles company of the contract of transfer of ownership to the state after being preceded in signing by the Lebancell company last Thursday.
In addition to that, Bu Raad explained that an understanding was reached on a new point related to "referring all disagreements rising from the contract to international arbitration."
Jordanian authorities announced yesterday that a cell comprised of four persons, among whom are two Libyans, and affiliated with "Al-Qaeda" organization under the leadership of Usama bin Laden, was behind the assassination of American diplomat Laurence Foley in front of his house in Amman last October 28.
He confirmed that the two accused confessed "their affiliation with Al-Qaeda organization and their link with the criminal who fled from the face of justice and who is present outside the country since 1999 named Ahmad Fadeel Nazal Al-Khalayla, born in the city of Al-Zarkaa and known by the name of Abu-Musaab Al-Zarkawi and who is one of the officials of Al-Qaeda organization and who set for them a program of missions to execute terrorist operations targeting foreign embassies and foreign diplomats in Jordan and security men and other Jordanian vital targets."
"On the morning of the following day, Ibn Suweid and the named Yasser, using the rented car, headed to the area of residence of the victim Laurence Foley, and when they arrived, Ibn Suweid stole into the garden of the victim's home and in his possession was a gun of 7 millimeter caliber equipped with a silencer and a cylinder of teargas; wearing a bulletproof vest, jeans, and a scarf to hide his face as he lurked behind the victim's car, waiting for his exit from his house to his car. And when Foley started to open the door of his car, Ibn Suweid quickly fired all of his gun's ammunition at him, then returned to the car, which was waiting for him near the house and was driven by Yasser, they fled to their area of residence in Al-Reseifa."

"We find a lot of time to be busy, go out, visit, and many others."
"The Blessed Naamatallah Hardini loved God with passion, stayed with Him for a  long time, and talked to Him."
The " arietta" of those great people and their "dances" had enough writing, praising, and analyzing from "The Barber of Seville," "Madame Butterfly," and "Beautiful Water" by Debussy; that is why I will only write about the joy of the first birth, the happiness of a meeting that exceeded any expectation for an ascetic mystic who did not wake up yet for the "Nirvana."
The sweet fruit does not look like the others, even though everybody knows and signs "O Mio Bambino Caro" by Puccini, immortalized by the late Maria Callas in her last performance in Japan before she passed away.
We wish she were here! We wish she heard herself and held her breath to say, "This is me! This is what I meant, from my soul to your souls, listeners, whether innocents or sinners, citizens or strangers! Our emigration is unlimited and endless."
Each of the Conservatory and Ministries of Culture and Education has its own responsibility to publish this treasure and encourage bringing the same; maybe it would be our salvation.
He appealed to the President of the country to dismiss selling the sector and to move toward managing it on behalf of the state.
"The third defect is the lack of correction of the previous agreement implying that the state, not the two cellular companies, bear the compensations for employees who worked for the two companies for a period of approximately eight years, a matter that represents a lucid example of waste of public property."
He also called on the association coordinating bodies to "adopt the demand of not selling the two cellular phone networks and preserving public property and including it among their demands in the massive demonstration that they intend to conduct next week."
There have been many violations of laws, institutions, and the constitution during the past year. Harassment of the judiciary has escalated. In such an undemocratic atmosphere, I felt no desire to play any political role, he said in response to a question.
"Notice that the democratic discussion held within institutions is totally isolated from the real regional situation."
In connection with the relationship between Baabda and Bakraki, he pointed out, The history of the Lebanese Church predates that of the Lebanese state. He warned, The attempt to strip Bakraki of its political characteristics at this stage is more damaging to the stability of Christians and the state and to continued progress." Al Farzali emphasized that Bakraki is assuming a national, political, and often ideological role. The existence of the Lebanese state represents a fundamental issue to Bakraki. However, this does not necessarily mean that Bakraki is infallible.
Hezbollah Responds to the Canadian Ambassador: "Nasr-Allah Didnt Mention External Operations"
"His Eminence Mr. Nasr-Allah has repeatedly emphasized the choice of resistance, to liberate occupied Lebanese lands. He supports the Palestinian popular resistance against the Israeli occupation. However, he mentioned nothing about operations or targets beyond occupied Palestinian territories."

The statement called on the Arab League and the Organization of the Islamic Conference Organization to take extensive action to persuade the Canadian government to withdraw its unjust decision.
In an Open Dialogue with Youth, Al-Aridi: Blessed Are Those Who Do Not Know How Some Political Decisions are Made
Al-Aridi pointed out that the greatest danger facing youth is the flood of information, which creates intellectual and political confusion, develops emotional reactions, and causes division.
Al-Aridi mentioned the responsibility, which in my opinion lies in two key sectors: the first is the state, and the second is composed of the political powers."
"And who will take care of the country and decide on our behalf?"
In reference to the Ministry of Information issue, Al-Aridi said, There are 155 employees, 30 of whom are Druzes. But if you inspect any other ministry, you will find that a certain sect is represented much more than others. We are doing our best to achieve some sort of balance. Proper response is not what we always get because some people do not apply for a match or competition. Moreover, immigration has left a negative impact on certain sects rather than on others. Regretfully, this is one of the consequences of the painful and dreadful war in Lebanon.
Egyptian "Air Sinai" Resumes Flights to Israel; Saddam: Iran Should Pay Some of Its Oil Revenues to Palestinians; Musa; Baghdad.
He attributed the suspension of flights to commercial, not political reasons.
He said, "I still say that no Muslim should blow himself up among women and children, but among enemies and soldiers who are fighting and aggressing (...)". On Friday he told worshippers at Al-Azhar, "Anyone who blows themselves up among those aggressors (the Israelis) is a martyr, a martyr, a martyr. Anyone saying otherwise is a liar."
He said, "The Palestinians cannot negotiate whilst Israeli tanks are two meters away from Yasir Arafat."

East Timorians cast their votes in large numbers yesterday to elect their president, in what is viewed to be the final stage before the former Portuguese colony announces its independence on the 20th of next May, following four centuries of colonization and 24 years of Indonesian occupation that have seen violence, suffering and blood shed.
There was no information about disturbances apart from a simple incident shortly before the closing of the centers at 4 pm.
When power is handed over from the United Nations to a local government on the 20th of May, East Timor, with a population of 730 thousand people and one of the poorest areas in Southeast Asia, will become the first state to gain independence in the 21st century.
Despite the desire of the vast majority of East Timor's inhabitants for peace and better living conditions following years of suffering and massacres, this region, which lacks industry, faces an uncertain future, because it will need international assistance for years to come.
The following statement reached us from the Media Office of the Student Base of the Brigades:
1- The statement that two groups from within the Brigades entered the recent student elections in a number of universities is wholly incorrect. It would have been better had the writer of the investigation followed these elections and the results thereof in the pages of Al-Nahar at least, where the results were published showing that none of the alliances included one name from the Al-Saifi group. They have no presence in any university, and we are prepared to provide all the lists and names.
Furthermore, the statements of President Al-Jamil were not made from the Baathist or Nationalist pulpit. How can the message be similar when President Al-Jamil, Dr (Eli) Karamah and Deputies Pierre Al-Jamil and Antoine Ghanim are pillars of Qaranat Shahwan whilst Al-Saifi's group hang around at the entrance to Qaranat and were rejected.
Bint Jubail, Hasbiya - Al-Nahar:

The Bashri road ("Al-Nahar") was reopened at the end of the week at the Turza crossroads after works to remove the rocks and rubble that had closed it about one week ago, following a rock fall from the mountain overlooking it, had been completed.
It promised to submit reports to the French private and public institutions and departments, to look into the possibility of helping the municipality and restoring of some of the archaeological sites.
In Jubran Khalil Jubran's book "Al-Majnun" there is the story of a wise king whose people drank from a river that a sorceress had bewitched. They went mad and his choice in order to continue in power was for him to drink from the river and join them in their madness.

Everyone, from businessmen to layers and financiers, rejoiced at the law and the positive benefits it would bring to Lebanon, especially as it was the first of its kind in the region, but the hopes placed in it were soon dashed.
The draft Municipalities Law put forward by the Minister of the Interior and Municipalities, approved by the Council of Ministers, remains before him for ratification and promulgation now that its details have been discussed and proposals and observations recorded on its clauses in the Chamber of Deputies.
These texts of the present draft, which one must say represents the start of rain from the heavens for the process of comprehensive legislative and credit development, which begin with it and continue through laws on administrative decentralization and other laws that will come to light to consolidate the state of law and institutions, stopped at the outline headings.

Engineers in the north elected Fuad Al-Dahir as the new head of their syndicate yesterday, to succeed President of the Syndicate Bashir Dhuq, whose term has come to an end.
The victory of the new President of the Syndicate confirms the spirit of democracy that prevailed in the syndicate elections, despite the blocs that were established, according to Al-Dahir. He added, "We must go and realize the program that we have drawn up, which will put the syndicate among national concerns, especially given the economic situation in the country, and participate in drafting laws and studies that will help to overcome the present crisis."

In its letter dated 08/03/2002, the Ministry of Finance had told the Council of Minister that it had become apparent that "many public organizations were experiencing vacancies in the positions of cost contract controllers and accountants because these tasks were being performed by employers charged from public departments or public organizations under decisions issued by the Council of Ministers, the Minister of Custodianship, the Board of Directors or the committees thereof. This has reflected negatively on the performance of these organizations as some of these employees and staff are conducting their tasks without having the independence and competency which both an accountant and cost controller should have in order to monitor the financial business of the organizations and manage their funds in the best and soundest possible way.
Al-Bassat's victory shows two things: First, the rejection by the engineering base, despite the plurality of their party and political affiliations, of direct political interventions and their adherence to the independence of professional and syndicate choice.
- Al-Bassat 3326 votes against 3051 votes for Hamad.
- Mustafa Fawaz ("Amal" movement) 2756 votes.
He asked for a recount.
The new President of the Syndicate gave a speech in which he confirmed that "free opinion is the only victor in the syndicate elections". He believed that all his colleagues on the list "were victorious despite their defeat".
The election process was not without battle, represented in the strong competition between the two lists of Hamad and Al-Bassat, who accused the authority of "scandalously" intervening for the benefit of Hamad, transforming the battle from its syndicate character.
The branch of the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture at the American University issued a statement rejecting the "libelous manner" and accusations made against the graduates of the Faculty for their adopting a position in support of Hamad's candidature from among the three candidates from the graduates of the American University."

The famous film studio "Soyuzmultfilm", which created many exquisite artistic treasures during its 56-year history but disappeared in about the mid-1970s, has started again to produce films and show some of its work at the Russian National General Animation Festival, which was recently held in the old town of Suzdal.
According to the Deputy Director of "Soyuzmultfilm" Vicislav Shilobriev, the studio is currently equipped with the most advanced digital recorders and computer design system.
The "Soyuzmultfilm" studio is today busy in negotiations with the Official Public Russian Institute for Film Production because the development of the local film industry is dependent on this.
The stolen cartoon films are very popular in the west. The Japanese are crazy about Chiporashka, for example, the preferred animation film hero of Russian children. But Chiporashka's father, "Soyuzmultfilm", is losing money that could be invested for the new cartoon industry.
Foundation Stones Laid in 8 Schools in the Western Beqaa by Rashia Murad and Qablan.
In his speech Qablan focused on construction in the face of destruction. He said, "Now is not the time for words. These occasions are not happy ones. What is taking place in Palestine stops the smiles, cause tears to flow and keeps joy away from us. Our people there are dying whilst the Arab nation watches. It is as if God has become angry at this nation and caused them to talk much and do little. We had wanted these occasions to be happy ones, but on account of Palestine, its people and the blood of the martyrs there, these meetings are just to confirm that we are continuing to work in solidarity with our people there, albeit in word."
He noted that whilst there was construction in Lebanon there was destruction in Palestine, where an entire people was being killed, regrettably, within sight and sound of the whole world. He expressed astonishment at the way the world was watching what was happening in wounded Palestine. Regrettably, it is Arab silence that has encouraged the enemy to continue in these massacres, killings and destruction."
Perhaps the best response for the ruler is what the Saudi Foreign Minister said one day in a famous statement at the gate to the Republican Palace in Lebanon when a journalist asked for his opinion on the contradiction between the street and the rulers. He answered, "Do the Arab rulers not represent the Arab street and, if not, then who does represent the street?"
And after all that we will get the result and this deadly debate may end.
The Federation organized the competition at the end of last week at the Lebanese- American University. Female competitors far exceeded males.

Before the results were announced, winner Liali Aghazi from the Lebanese American University addressed the competitors and talked about her experience last year in London. She called on them to be "Lebanon's Ambassadors at this stage, to leave their country proud and with esteem".
"Responsible Citizenship" was the title of the final lecture of the program of lectures and debates accompanying the 2001 Zaghrata Book Cultural Festival, in which Minister Jan Lui Qirdahi and Dr Antoine Masarrah took part. Dr Frederick Maatuq led and interested persons attended.
He talked about the obstacles to the culture of citizenship, identifying them as the small size of the country, the fatigue of the people, the remnants of convention in spoon-fed education, the fact the authority was a source of negative values and the concept of the state. He indicated that, historically, the state was a tool of suppression that monopolized organized powers. Its work was only good when citizens became involved, called it to account and monitored it. For these reasons the Lebanese will wait a long time for a capable and just state.
There has been a large production in the publishing of books communicating what has been written in American, England and elsewhere about human rights. Some are trying to apply these to Lebanon and other Arab states.
We must believe that Lebanon has a message. Muslim - Christian co-existence in Lebanon is a message to the whole world. It is the only place where everyone is addressed and where everyone participates in decision-making. I call everyone to make a country in which they can co-exist and overcome all class and sectarian boundary."

The statue of the Poet of the Two Countries, Khalil Mutran, in Baalbak is still suffering from neglect and requires restoration.
Al-Nahar raised this matter some years ago.
The question remains: When will people, the state and cultural organizations take an interest in the legacy of the greats and the features of the poet Mutran, from his statue to his square and home, no longer be wretched?"
Public Affairs Advisor at the American Embassy in Beirut Deborah Smith summarized for "Al-Nahar" the importance of the project to promote American culture, saying, "It is a project of which we are very proud.

Anan outlined the parameters of his mission in a short speech given immediately he arrived at Larnaca Airport at 3:30 pm. He announced that he was visiting the island to encourage the Greek Cypriot leader Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash to "make progress in the talks in a spirit of settlement and rapid initiative" but he had not bought a solution or proposals for settlement with him.
The visit, which is to end today, following which Anan will travel to East Timor, does not make the two parties optimistic at the possibility of moving beyond the present impasse in light of difficult issues and the major difference in positions that remain after more than 30 meetings between the two leaders.
It should be noted that at the beginning of the talks in January the two parties announced their intention to reach a solution by the end of June.
Shortly before the visit Denktash hardened his tone towards the European Union and the United Nations, which he accuses of being biased towards the Greek Cypriots.
He also criticized the United Nations' call to the Turkish Cypriot side to cooperate fully saying, "If this call means that I have to agree to the demands of the Greek Cypriots, they must know that this is not possible."

In my belief, the addition of Iraq to the list now will be destructive."

Mahatir received praise from Washington, however, for the way he has dealt with those suspected of being Islamist activists since 11 September.
Washington cut its military links with Jakarta in 1999 following bloody incidents in East Timor when the inhabitants of the region agreed to separate from Indonesia in a referendum.
Toujan Faisal Accuses Abu Al-Ragheb of Offering Bribe for Silence.
She believed that Abu Al-Ragheb "was involved in distorting and insulting Jordan's image after he issued tens of temporary laws from which he personally benefited" - a reference to the decision issued by the government which increased vehicle insurances fees by 100% at the beginning of this year.
She is mounting her own defense after the defense team withdrew from the case in protest at the court's refusal to call Abu Al-Ragheb to testify before it.
Faisal, who became the first Jordanian female member of the Chamber of Deputies in 1993, is facing six months' to three years' imprisonment if convicted.
Jordanian officials believe that Toujan's trial has come after many years of her recklessly making charges against and slandering the government, which has greatly harmed Jordan's image and its democratic experiment. Observers, however, say that Toujan is a prisoner of opinion and that her trial is evidence of a sharp downturn in freedom of opinion and expression in Jordan, which ultimately aims to prevent her from standing for the Deputies Election to be held in the country at the end of next September.
On the second day of his visit Carter, accompanied by his wife Rosalyn, toured the Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, one of the largest laboratories in the country, the Academy of Social Work and the Latin American Medical Institute, where he expressed his admiration for the Cuban Health System in front of students who included students from Latin America and four Africans wearing a white uniform.
The Cuban leader, who gave his guest a warm welcome, delivered an off-the-cuff speech that lasted for about one hour, in which he defended his concept of democracy.
Carter commented on the charges, saying that officials at the White House, the American State Department and the American intelligence agencies, whom he had informed of his visit to Cuba, had not raised this issue with him.
When asked about Carter's statement to the effect that American officials had denied that they had evidence that Cuba was active in this field, he responded, "I do not know what reports were presented to him before he traveled.
Last week American State Department Deputy John Bolton accused Cuba of trying to develop biological weapons.
No Voice Louder Than That of Review.
There is no family without a martyr, wounded, detainee or disabled member.
The Intifada has not succeeded in causing serious ruptures in Israeli society.
But Sharon's project has not passed away (irrespective of whether it was the destruction or elimination of the Authority, breaking the spirit of resistance, realizing the transfer of people or creating a Palestinian alternative to Arafat).
But Israel's "democratic" image has been shaken to the depths, even among its partisan supporters.
After Chairman Yasir Arafat has recovered his freedom and the Israeli campaign has begun to retreat, the Palestinian issue is entering a new stage, one which requires a harsh, critical stance, followed by a different strategy of struggle.
Thirdly, it would require that the Authority be re-established.
We have lost the military facet of the struggle, albeit for a long time.
And Palestine, with its cross, will be victorious over the barbarians.
With this logic the oppositionist camp risks putting itself in a dangerous, fundamental and basic contradiction, one that will be recorded against it and will cause it to fall into moral error before the authority, even should it win in the elections as an opposition candidate.
Its superiority has only been achieved by the accumulation of rounds and the ongoing, daily recording of the conduct by an authority of ill-repute in the field of democracy and in the fertile errors in the sphere of violations of liberties.
There is also, however, an unusual ambiguity in the stance of Brigadier Aun in supporting a candidate when his firm initial position is to boycott absolutely every election conducted in Lebanon in the shadow of Syrian influence.
And so long as another part of that opposition are convinced that a boycott is a weapon for not acknowledging foreign influence, then they must not change their position unless the circumstances relating to Lebanon's broad reality change and not under any other circumstantial considerations.
So have the behavior of the authority leaked out to the enemy camp, causing them, in turn, to assemble winter and summer at the same table?
This was the first public confrontation between the Iranian clerics and the government and was followed by numerous others at different stages, in which the Iranians mostly submitted to what the religious authorities, who had left the narrow domain of personal jurisprudence for the public arena and major interests, said.
Studies that adopt the Marxist methodology of analysis agree that they, namely the men of religion, form a class alongside the other classes of society in Iran...without this meaning that this description applies to clerics in other societies, in particular outside the domain of the Shiite sect.
Iranian religious scholars then split into more than one group. Some believed in the possibility of the establishment of a government representing God's shadow on earth, thereby allowing support for the monarchy embodying that rule. Others adopted the view that it could only be established by jurists. Still others opposed the intervention of men of religion in politics.
The electorate looked at the pictures of candidates and preferred the turbaned candidate to the effendi.
Do you think that if Al-Mirza Al-Shirazi returned today and issued a fatwa calling for a boycott of American goods, for example...how many Iranians would throw them in the streets as they threw the water pipes more than a century ago?
The most prominent event in this regard was the resignation of the Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Nabil Amr, who is one of Yasir Arafat's confidantes and a person of diplomatic experience in a unique experimental location as an Ambassador in Moscow.
In addition, the Palestinian leader is facing what is his and the Palestinians' most difficult and fundamental confrontation, so why bring up the matter of corruption and mismanagement now and weaken his position in the face of his rivals and enemies?
All Palestinians, those in the Authority and those in opposition, in the Occupied Territories, the Diaspora or the 1948 land, are passing through a dark, black, winding and long tunnel.
It is fundamentally wrong for the call to combat corruption and political, social, economic and administrative injustice in the Arab World to be a foreign demand and not a vital internal movement encompassing all classes.
When he went to Jenin he was not able to go out to it as he had dreamt, and when he went to Bethlehem the town did not come out to him as he had expected.
Great despair leads to absolute despair.
On Monday evening, Abd Al-Bari Atwan, the Chief Editor of Al-Quds Al-Arabi in London joined the opponents, saying on "Aljazeera" that Abu Ammar's popularity had fallen from 90 to 20%.
The situation is that the greatest Palestinian is now like the smallest Palestinian. He senses the victory of ruins and high spirits even in the agony of death.
Brussels Court Examines Acceptance of Case Against Sharon Today.
Attorney Chibli Mallat, lawyer for the plaintiffs, urged the court "to rule that the international legal jurisdiction and international human rights exist as a network that cannot be ignored".
Sharon's lawyers say that Belgium has no right to try the Israeli Prime Minister on a charge of genocide and crimes against humanity because these charges have no links to this country.
However, prosecution lawyers say that Belgium's competence to try ministers who are still in power for material breaches of human rights had the support of a number of rulings of the Court of Justice in The Hague.
Numerous organizations defending human rights yesterday called on the Belgium judiciary not to "run away" from the case by not accepting that it should be examined.
At the Patriarchal headquarters in Al-Mathaf, Syriac Catholic Patriarch Agnatus Butrus VIII Abd Al-Ahad met with the delegation of the "Palestinian-Lebanese Monitoring Committee", which included: Zahir Al-Khatib from the Al-Shaghilah Union; Mahmud Qamati and "Abu Hura" from Hizbollah; George Shahin from the Al-Kataib Party; Abd Al-Amir Abbas from the Arab Socialist Baath Party; Qasim Salih from the Social Progressive Syrian Party; Ali Himdan from the "Amal" movement; Solak Totalyan from the Tashnaq Party; Osama Himdan from the "Hamas" movement; Marwan Abd Al-Al from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine; Abu Hasan from "Al-Saiqa"; Jumaah Al-Abdallah from "Popular Front-General Command"; Abu Fadi Hammad from the "Intifada" movement; George Al-Baraks from the "Lebanese National Front"; and Abu Khalid Al-Mashal from the "Patriotic Struggle Front".
I know well that many are working for the issue, and I wanted to work in the area of my religious and humanitarian message for this people.
We evoke the blood of the women's children, old men and martyrs and promise all our nobles and leaders, including the Patriarch, that we will remain united to gain victory over our enemies."
This capital they safeguard, even in these base times when money is declared bankrupt.
With this introduction we wanted to provide evidence that the application of law is in the nature of the Lebanese, who thirst for order.
We point out to the new committee, the knowledgeable, the understanding, that reform will take place by application of the laws governing procedure, which resemble the most important international legislation.
1- Article 579 of the Civil Principles stipulates verbatim as follows:
2- Article 580 stipulates verbatim as follows:
It is therefore not possible for a judge in whose competency the basis does not lie, as happens today.
So too with every urgent measure: it must be taken by a judge competent in the basis.
This article notes the instance of taking urgent measures whilst the case is being examined.
3-They have breached these binding principles and created a judiciary for urgent matters, without having any competence in the basis.
The only urgency lies in the name.
Two Protests in "Al-Askua" and Tripoli and March in Ain Al-Hilwah to Commemorate Anniversary of Catastrophe.
At the end the media officer at the United Nations office, Najib Fariji, accepted a petition in the name of the protesters.
Statements were issued on the anniversary of the Catastrophe by the Syrian National Socialist Party, "Al-Jammaah Al-Islamiyyah", "Bait Al-Quds Union for Students of Palestine", "Committee for Supporting the Resistance in Palestine", the "Al-Ittihad" Party, President of the "Association of Islamic Charitable Projects" Sheikh Husam Qaraqirah, "Palestinian Democratic Students Union", and the "Islamic Union for Students of Palestine".
The two leaderships of "The Independent Christians Movement" (Al-Murabitun) and the "Islamic Unity Movement" held a meeting.
The Committee Chairman, Deputy Ali Al-Khalil, explained, "At the forefront of these challenges is the continuation of the massacres perpetrated by Israel against the Palestinian people to suppress their uprising, force emigration of their people and strike their national authority, under American sponsorship and within the sight and hearing of international public opinion, in addition to regional and international contacts for convening an international conference on the Middle East."
This will not at all serve the Arab interest, as is clear from the total support of the George Bush's administration for the government of Ariel Sharon and also the decision of the American Congress taken on the second of this month, which summarizes the two decisions of the American Senate and Congress to support absolutely the military operations undertaken by Israel against the Palestinian people."
Projects
- The draft law laid down in Decree number 7545 to join the Arab Labor Agreement number 19 of 1998 on work inspection.
- The draft law laid down in Decree number 7666 to ratify a cooperation agreement between the Lebanese Republic, the Ministry of Labor, and the Arab Labor Organization on the liaison committee between social security services in Arab countries.
Chairman of the Committee Deputy Muhammad Qabbani confirmed that the optimism shown by the committee after the meeting "is not good news for the investors.
He indicated that there was a focus on collection because the failure to collect the invoices is the fundamental cause of financial wastage in the electricity sector.
Facilities to pay meter charges have been provided and installation in April reached an average of 450 meters a day."
He was asked whether this optimism was good news for investors to come and invest in the electricity sector, and he replied: "We do not give good news to anyone. We speak facts and truths and do not play the game of investors or non-investors. We hope that at the end of the year and the start of the coming year it will achieve financial balance which means that the revenue from collection will balance the cost of expenditure."
* Why is collection incomplete in the districts where there are no security obstacles to the collection of the charge?
Most of this proportion relates to technical wastage.
* In a meeting of the Parliamentary Energy Committee in the Council of Deputies Deputy Salih Al-Khir raised the issue of interruption of the electricity supply in the District of Al-Minyah and its environs and Tripoli.
The picture of deputy by-elections in Al-Matan Al-Shamali is not yet clear in light of the rumors about the failure to find a consensus candidate.
He visited leader of the National Bloc Party, Carlos Adah, and discussed with syndic Antoine Qalimos matters relating to the by-elections in Al-Matan.
For his part, in an interview with the "Central News Agency", candidate Ghubrial Al-Murr announced that "the efforts to reach a consensus have stumbled, blaming Deputy Michel Al-Murr for this failure "because it seems that he will enter the election battle through his daughter Mrs. Mirna".
I will not accept illegitimate practices by any party. I am known for not being accustomed to accepting any pressure and no pressures have been brought to bear on me.
I suggest that Deputy Michel Al-Murr resign from his position as deputy in return for me withdrawing my candidacy from the elections. If there is no response to my proposal, I think it unlikely that there will be consensus solutions and it will consequently be Deputy Al-Murr who has obstructed the consensus in Al-Matan and wanted the battle."
They also condemned the disappearance of Engineer Ramzi Airani, considering it "a serious setback for the security credibility of the state".
2- The manner in which the situations are dealt with cannot lead to the desired results unless those in power work as one team in bringing about a rapprochement in respect of the accumulated problems and the present challenges, which increase day-by-day, and choke the nation and the citizens.
It rejects the notion that political affiliation and party activity should constitute a cause for such action, which contravenes the constitution, norms and laws.
Peace, the State and the Election Auction.
What is more important than everything taking place these days, however, is the complete collapse of the peace process or what remained of it. All ideas of peace are hostage to two election battles, one American and one Israeli.
This is the first bazaar, which will continue and carry on until November, the date for legislative elections in the United States.
The recent Likud vote is a slap in the face for the Greater Ally, the United States, which has worked through more than one international Security Council resolution to persuade all the major states with the power of veto to agree to the idea of establishing a (sustainable) Palestinian state, along side the state of Israel.
Those who resist know that independence is taken not given, and so they do not rely on Israeli decision of yes or no, or on any other decision, but act out the saying: "Noble honor is not safe from harm."
Awaiting the battle, there is the worst result, a worse result or one that is less so, but there is no ideal solution: if George W. Bush succeeds in his plan and improves his electoral standing, he will thereby increase his customary arrogance. In addition, there is the possibility of Sharon falling or being brought down and Netanyahu's arrival. In neither case is there any good for the Palestinians or the Arabs generally.
For Likud are an Israeli Party that will retreat from its policies and slogans in return for any electoral gain.
Diplomatic sources in Beirut have noticed the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Anan is showing special concern at the Israeli-Lebanese border situation in light of the dangerous situation being experienced by the region as a result of the Israeli government using force and occupying Palestinian territory, where its army has perpetrated "unimaginable atrocities", according to Anan's Special Coordinator in the Middle east region Terry Rod-Larsen.
They gave an example of what was happening in this regard. According to an Israeli claim, as military experts were blowing up a Palestinian weapons ship, Israeli fighters were flying above southern Lebanon and were countered by resistance batteries, some rounds from which fell over more than one settlement, causing damage to several vehicles and causing damage in them.
They explained that Hizbollah would not accept that they should not target the batteries as long as Israel's violation continues.
On account of the tense and worrying situation in the region and the Israeli-Lebanese borders, there is a move to retain the Fijian battalion, which comprises 600 soldiers and which should have departed finally at the end of next June.
Will the smog of appointments be dispersed with the "smog" of cell phones, including the Civil Service Council, to complete the Authority's quorum?
In this atmosphere, ministry circles anticipate that the "cell phone stir" will lead to administrative appointments, especially in the Civil Service, with the names nominated to work in the vacant Maronite Center in the Civil Service being put forward, such as the administrative inspector general, Asad Dumat, or the Director General, Head of the Technical Affairs Branch in the Government Headquarters, Claude Saad.
The vacancies in the Civil Service Council are reflected in the position of employees and their families, in particular in relation to those placed in retirement.
While the Ministry has rearranged its internal affairs, and following transfer of some of these contractors to the surplus list and entrusting the tasks in accordance with contracts distributed among the contractors, pursuant to the proposed structure, the Ministry found itself today in a blind alley: the break up of the Civil Service Council contract prevents ratification of the contracts.
This is the first time that the Minister of Information, Ghazi Al-Uraidi, has had recourse to this arrangement, according to circles in the ministry which have criticized the distribution of these allowances to friends and favorites previously, to the degree that some of them have exceeded the basic salary.
This has led the Civil Service Council to send letters to these departments asking them to explain the refusal.
Circles in the ministry will renew a series of steps which it had announced it would apply in the event that affairs become normalized, such as a tightening up control of attendance, before concluding, "The project is continuing, and in the event that the appointments are delayed the form of implementation will change; otherwise the content will remain as it is."
The spring weather that has lasted for more than a month yesterday turned into rainy and stormy weather in some northeastern and northwestern areas.
In the afternoon it shifted into the mountains and the north with intermittent lightning storms and cold spells for short periods, causing damage to some fruit-bearing trees.
Al-Daniyyah - "Al-Nahar":
Sidon - "Al-Nahar":
A delegation representing the heads of the Sidon - Al-Zahrani municipalities (Al-Nahar) visited the head of the Deputies Finance and Budget Committee Samir Azar at his home in Jazin. They asked the Chamber of Deputies to move towards the Ministry of Finance in order to free the municipalities funds, which "are considered to be held in trust and for which it has no right of disposal".
Al-Damur Municipality has adopted the proposal submitted by colleague Kamal Asbar Al-Gharib, member of the Press Syndicate Council, to erect a commemorative monument bearing the name of Al-Damur journalists who have died. They held and published concessions for regular, daily political publications and number 18. Some published them in their hometown. Another group of journalists are still alive and working.
Al-Daniyyah - "Al-Nahar":
But there is no work or movement on the part of the contractor.
For his part, Deputy Ahmad Fitfit said in a press conference held at the Kafrhabbu-Al-Daniyyah crossroads, "One can no longer remain silent at what is taking place on the main Al-Daniyyah road. For the third successive year, the summer tourist season in Al-Daniyyah has been ended by the Tripoli-Sir-Hawarah road.
Miqati demanded, "An emergency declaration should be made for the Al-Daniyyah road and the financial, technical and human capacities of the Ministry be made available to save what can be saved and the following steps taken:
- Give immediate instruction for proper maintenance of the turn-off points on the road, especially at Miryatah, Rashain, Wadi Izqi and Tahwirah Bakhaun - Bait Jayyidah (agricultural road).
From Mahmoud Asi:
It leads from Al-Nabatiyyah to the neighboring villages in the west. Tomorrow an official will respond by saying that this hole has been rectified, but it is no more than a sample and example of all the roads in the south, whilst in other regions there are no defects.
And prevent the roaming vendors from standing anywhere, under threat of preparing warrants for their arrest. He added that the police pass through all the streets without exception, stressing that they can stop them from standing, but not from wandering, under the relevant law.
They said this should not be allowed and is unacceptable in an area full of residents and shops, one that deserves attention not neglect.

Regarding the complaint concerning the water leak in property 964, the Cleaning Department at Beirut Municipality have addressed warnings to those washing the cars and thereby causing water to leak into the property specified.
Yaqub Al-Sarraf."
The President of the Republic knows, or he should know, that he has won in media terms because, to put it simply, he stands on the "side of right" in the view of the public opinion on the issue at hand. This is also a lesson for the rivals of the President of the Republic within the ruling structure: How the public opinion senses "the right" can penetrate any obstacles, because it was one of the critical turning points that the major television stations and press, which do not usually relish the "policies" of the President of the Republic, put forward his view on the topic of the "cell phone" in such a way as to help his media victory, in terms of their influence on public opinion.
Whatever the case, this procedure has a positive effect on students of the regions, because the university has come to them, giving them the opportunity to learn (46).
The academic level also began to fall as a result of interventions to ensure the success of some students, and in view of Lebanon being closed in on itself during the war and bound by the conditions of the local prevailing authorities.
It is expected that the Council of Deputies in the Lebanon Electricity Workers Syndicate will today adopt the recommendation to lift the open strike in which the employees of the Al-Laitani and Qadisha Utilities and Beirut Water have participated for a full week. This took place in light of the government's response to the syndicate's demands.
There follows the most important parts of the decision signed by Minister of Finance Fuad Al-Sinyurah on 13/05/2002.
Whereas this credit is allocated to cover the costs arising from the provision of medical care and treatment to employees and workers currently in service, in addition to those no longer in service on account of their having reached the legal age, as well as members of their families and dependents, on the basis of Council of Ministers' decision number 4, dated 10/11/1999.
Whereas the Council of Ministers with its decision number 25, dated 27/09/2001, decided to postpone examining the matter and seek the opinion of the Minister of Energy and Water in preparation for it being resubmitted to the Council of Ministers under the provisions of the General Law for Public Organizations.
Approval has been given to the decision to open the credit the subject of discussion.
The first stop was the port of Tartus where the Lebanese delegation toured the port before signing a cooperation agreement between the ports of Tartus and Tripoli.
In terms of air transport, we have come a long way as can be seen by Syrian Airlines commencing operation at Beirut Airport."
The discussion dealt with matters concerning the Jordanian Syrian Overland Transport Company and the Lebanese Syrian Jordanian Maritime Transport Company.
Ministers Miqati, Ubaid, Al-Dhahabi and the Secretary-General of the Supreme Lebanese-Syrian Council Nasri Khuri and the accompanying delegations visited the Al-Ladhiqiyyah branch of the Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport and examined the activities conducted by the Academy to prepare sea cadres to international standards.
"Because we expect spending by Visa card-carrying visitors to Lebanon to increase by 25% this year, and because 23 banks deal with Visa Card with 200,000 cards, we have chosen Lebanon to launch our annual campaign based on persuading for better use of the investments by the banks involved."
A press conference was held at the Phoenicia Hotel yesterday, in which, in addition to Shaqam, the Director General of Visa International in the Middle East region Peter Skriven and the Regional Middle East Marketing Director Brimal Patel, took part. The Director General from the Ministry of Tourism attended in place of Ilham Habballah.
He said that the development of electronic payment is closely linked to the infrastructure for these payment operations, "especially electronic cash machines, hotels, restaurants and shops".
She confirmed that Lebanon had made considerable progress in reclaiming its tourism infrastructure.
This was because the Governor of the Syrian Central Bank Muhammad Bashshar Kubarah believed that the conference was an opportunity to discuss ideas and present Arab experiments in the field of banking work, and was not expected to make decisions or recommendations.
The debates, in which 11 Lebanese officials and experts took part, focused on the following headings:
Bearing in mind that similar experiments have not been encouraging, as can be seen from the fact that the monetary authorities in a number of countries usually adopt high interest rates to defend against exchange prices, which weakens their development.
- The fragility of Arab money markets and their limited business when compared to other countries, and studying ways to develop these markets and open companies and institutions and change their individual and family nature.
- The legislation regulating the confidentiality of banking work, and the pros and risks arising from the adoption of this legislation for combating money laundering.
"Additional Days" by Hasan Daud in German Translation.
He adds that the reader finds in this work, which has a unique identity (or approach), information about Lebanon's social and political reality.
In Daud's first novel, "Matild's Building", the war was still forcefully present and formed part of the novel. You see the main female protagonist, and how the confusion of the war troubles her daily life.
The Sartre conception of "committed literature" was influential in many ways.
Within this framework, it is worth mentioning the most important bases of Hasan Daud's writing. Findrich says, "As part of these new concepts, we also find the special features of Hasan Daud's writing: his focus on the individual and his distancing from society as a socio-political arena, which he only uses as a non-specific framework for the narrative thread."
From the "Janin Rabiz Gallery" exhibiting Joseph Shahfah (until the 31st of May) to "Strange Fruit" in the Starco building exhibiting the sculpture and fitting works of Sarah Badr (until the 16th of May), to "Espace S.D" exhibiting the works of the following male and female artists: Rafiq Majdhub, Ghufdir, Hussein Madi, Greta Nofal, Munirah Al-Sulh, Rita Aun, Tinbak and Jan and Mark Nahhas
We scarcely reach the threshold when we are stopped by a painting drowning in yellowness derived from the canary color mixed with white and thrown leisurely above lined expressions linked to mechanical writing or script that is pointed at times and faded at others.
What you want is noise to the extent of a scream, despite the fact that there is no sound in the place other than that of the ventilation machinery, or the movement of a short film tape, which sheds light on the goal of the young Sarah Badr.
We question what drove her to exhibit paintings that are not of an acceptable standard and to install them as if they were part of a place in which she wished to create a suspicious atmosphere, one that swings between the critical reality and the shadowy embodiment. She did not separate between the two forms and she did not stop even to crystallize what her hands placed on the broad canvas, hung and stretched on bars of metal to a section formed like a washing line, or screen extended to receive the movement of pictures emerging from another source of inspiration.
But we saw in "Espace S.
What she exhibits is satisfactory.
The original drama continues to dominate the imagination. The shadows recalls man of the beginning of life, or its bodily or organic transformations, which take one back to a form devoid of defining features.
The West, under its old label Rome, represented an idea that had great influence in the culture of the region.
There is also the story of the Prophet Abraham, the Companion, with Egypt's Pharaoh, in addition to that of Moses.
The first Umayyad prince in Andalusia was Abd Al-Rahman bin Muawiyyah bin Hisham bin Abd Al-Malik. Abd Al-Rahman was feeling from Abi Jaafar Al-Mansur! We also find that Al-Hakam bin Hisham, one of the Andalusian princes, was described by Arab historians as being an "immoderate tyrant with unattractive, wicked consequences".
Just as revolutions were mounted against the Arab rulers in Spain, who were later defeated, revolutions were also mounted at the custodianship and mandate.
Power is the same.
Al-Ghazali overthrew Ibn Rushd, who was then pursued and his books burnt, and the Syrians declared Muhyi Al-Din bin Arabi an infidel.
Nationalism from Germany.
Now, at the end of the clash of power, represented in the support of American (the new Rome!) for Israeli, we find the West's cards being thrown in the fireplace once more, but it is the people and not the regimes that are doing it, in other words the disease has gotten out of control...
The power that was sought by the Prophet, of which he dreamt. And the adapted story will be formed with astonishing historical precision when we hear of "soldiers" from God fighting.
At this juncture, once more, we understand the words of Christ, in their reserve.
Head of the Beiteddine festivals, Mrs. Nura Junbalat, spoke about nine Arab and western artistic performances at a press conference held yesterday by the Beiteddine committee at the Press Syndicate headquarters under the patronage of President of Syndicate Muhammad Al-Baalbaki, who began the conference by saying, "Journalism is an art and wholly inseparable from culture.
We respond with "Yes".
The main opening of the festival will take place on 3 July and continue until the 8th of the month, with Andrew Lloyd Webber's masterpiece "Cats", the song and dance show that stopped some days ago after continuing on the stages on London, America and the international cities for 21 years.
On the 16th of July he will perform the most prominent examples of this mix of East and West in jazz and contemporary music looking forward to the third millennium.
On the 27th of July, Ute Lemper will present to the audience at Beiteddine her performance songs, singing the roles of Kurt Weill, Marlene Dietrich, Edith Piaf and Jack Brill.
On the 9th and 10th of August, Fairouz will return with Ziad Al-Rahbani.
In fact, we should go further. We all, officials, educated and citizens, should send letters to Ambassador Patel via the internet (should he have a web site), addressing his government through him, explaining our issues and viewpoints in a civilized manner free from insults and agitation.
Action would be for us to create new ways of dealing, ones that conform to their way of thinking, in order to persuade them with pretext and logic.
We need to change our way of dealing with them.
To be cleverer in the face of Zionist wiliness and cunning.
About the world of reality that was wanted for us, but which we did not want!
"My joy is for the one who spreads the heart of man over the destiny of a whole life."
Carlos Fareer is a Brazilian resident in Paris, and is viewed to be among the greatest photographers in the world. After a year he had new views of cities like Alexandria. He was accompanied on its streets by the French writer of Egyptian origin Robert Suli, and Venice and India on the way to Atus mountain ... and today, after the City of Aleppo, there is Beirut in the lens of his mind.
He then referred to the war years, "This city, which has suffered from war and violence for years, has surprised me with the people's life and vitality and motion of existence."
However my life as a photographer came automatically based on a passion for photography. I photographed Hitchcock, Truffaut and Ghudar from the cinema.
"The producer Jean Montalbeti asked me to edit a set of photographs of the meeting that would take place between Marguerite Yourcenar and the cinema actor Dominick Sanda by recording on a tape with the title "Darham Hilm".
I told her about my Brazilian roots, about the Amazon Indians and the Indians of America.
Our conversations took place against the background of photography.
"She was very simple.
She was spontaneous in her actions, just and truthful."
To avoid resorting to manufactured comments under every picture, we have chosen from her writings texts which illustrate the picture in her meditations."
After the national anthem, Mother Wahbah made a speech in which she drew attention to the fact that competition suffered by books from the media and from information technology was strong. She believed that these methods call for a spread of culture and education openly, but they produce a superficial simple culture if they are misused.
The Municipality of Jubail opened an exhibition of the artist Antoine Matar in the Abbot Emmanuel Khuri Hall, Antash Jubail, which included 82 watercolors of the town through its history from the end of the nineteenth century to today of sights from the life and views of the old city.
The Ministry has also placed some property acquired from the Directorate General of Antiquities at the disposal of the municipality, for it be transformed into a reception and information center for tourists, as part of a comprehensive plan for the Jubail, Kasrawan and Al-Batrun areas."
The chancellors of the universities and participants will discuss a number of issues focusing on the culture of dialogue and modern technology in the service of better cooperation in Mediterranean universities.
The Thursday Seminar and Dar Al-Nadwah have issued an invitation to the opening of an exhibition by the artist Muhammad Sharaf "Luniah Excerpts" at 6 pm on Tuesday, the 21st of May, at Dar Al-Nadwah, Al-Hamrah.
Sponsored by the Catholicos Aram I, the Armenian Hamaskaine Association for Culture and Education has issued an invitation to an evening celebration to honor the producer and actor Rafujan Khadshiyan at 8 pm tonight in the Catholicosate Cilicia of the Armenian Orthodox in Antilias.
Number 13 Among Lebanese and Palestinians; "Flamingo" Hotel, Larnaca, Anointed with Memories of Lebanese War.
The "Flamingo" Hotel may have come under the microscope and entered the memory of Palestine following the arrival of the thirteen Palestinians there directly from the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, of which millions dream of lowering their heads to enter its door, which is no taller than one hundred and thirty centimeters. But Lebanon had prepared for this memory some years ago.
Cyprus...Larnaca...there is..."Mackenzie" street, the street of the Lebanese emigrants...and the "Flamingo" Hotel, oasis of safety.
Three minutes separate it from Larnaca Airport.
The owner of the hotel at the time was former Cypriot minister "Mr. Batikhi".
And when will the war stop?

What Wonders I've Seen In...Washington!
First, the front of consultations conducted by the American President with officials in the region, whether via diplomatic envoys, the last of whom was William Burns, or by his meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Abdallah, followed by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Ariel Sharon, as with King Abdallah II and, the day before yesterday, Prince Saud Al-Faisal.
If this contradiction in stances is a cause for surprise with many, it remains less serious than the astonishment provoked by the statements made by Powell last Wednesday, when he referred to "the establishment of a transitional Palestinian state on the hope of establishing a permanent state, which should possess an infrastructure, institutions or something resembling territory, albeit that this might not be determined in its final form."
Of course, there is no specific answer. As far as the "transitionality" goes, its features and characteristics are completely clear, at least in the bloody series of murderous crimes perpetrated by Sharon and the "transfer" of Palestinians to another world!
Two dates, one of them fixed and the other available for renewal at any moment. They do not work in favor of publication of an acceptable and serious American plan to apply the vision of President George Bush to establish a Palestinian state, nor even to launch the international conference about which Washington has been speaking this summer, notwithstanding all the differences about its form and content.
Then there is another, family dimension to please. This is to ensure the position of his brother Jeb in the Florida Governorship where the Jewish bloc is decisive.
Sharon will not therefore stop attempting to sabotage or empty out any American effort to the extent that guarantees rejection by the Arab side.
Attack on Archbishop Haddad: Extremism a Warning For All.
In parallel with this, the condemnatory and widespread reactions which have become universal in the country do not disregard the warning that some groups intend to hold one group rather than another responsible for the vice of religious and sectarian extremism, because all classes equally are at risk of extremism and obscurity, and there are many parties who have an interest in inflaming sedition and fabricating differences to distort the image of Lebanon.
They initially stated that they were engaged in religious ceremonies and that they consider what Bishop Haddad says "an insult to the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary."
It is expected that a stance will be announced today by the Maronite Patriarchate in Bikirki regarding the incident, on the grounds that Bishop Haddad is a member of the Catholic Council of Patriarchs and Bishops in Lebanon, which is chaired by Patriarch Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Butrus Safir.
Yesterday in Bikirki Maronite Patriarch Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Butrus Safir received Deputy Butrus Harb, who said, "The visit was to consult with the Patriarch over political developments, including the Al-Matan elections, the practices that accompanied them and the atmosphere that resulted, which almost forced the country to suffocate, thereby harming the great constitutional achievement embodied in the success of the opposition candidate against that of the government.
If we were to give the battle a personal characteristic we would take away from it its national and democratic value and diminish the value of the achievement realized at the national level and that of civilization.
The success of Ghubrial Al-Murr was a major and very important issue, a great victory. But that does not mean that the success of Ghubrial Al-Murr means that we have achieved the national objectives for which we aim.
We thus ask those concerned to meet their responsibilities and carry out what is required of them in an impartial way, by being partisan to the truth and by always standing by the people and the poor.
Work for consensus in everything that serves the interest of the country, but it should not be based on taxes and everything that affects the poor and deprived classes and does not touch upon the big issues, by means of which the interests of the country in confronting the political and economic mistakes that encircle it are determined.
The Serbians have to return to election centers once again on December 5 for another round of elections open to all candidates.
He added, "I would like to see the end of Djindic's regime. (...) The political crisis has only gotten deeper."
He also accused Djindic of opposing such changes in order to extend his term.
The percentage of voters in the second round of elections was 45%. Kostunica won 66.7% of the votes, which is double the 31.3% that Labus had received.
The party close to Pakistani President Pervez Musharaf, the Islamic Pakistani League party, expressed willingness to ally itself with Pakistani fundamentalist parties that won the recent parliamentary elections, in order to form a new cabinet.
The Front won 45 seats, overcoming the Regional National Assembly in the northwestern province, near the borders with Afghanistan.
However, he added that an Islamic alliance demanding an American withdrawal must become a member of the coalition government after the general elections.
Negotiations between parties to form a coalition government were proceeding quickly yesterday. However, the process might take weeks, as no party had won an  absolute majority.
However, the embassy refused to confirm the news.
After a month of confused elections in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, no party won an absolute majority in the 87-seat parliament when the results were announced last Thursday.

He re-emphasized that Turkey will receive a possible influx of refugees, who will be placed in camps held on the Iraqi side of the borders in case a large migration takes place because of broad American military operations.
The Turkish Minister of Defense said that "Kirkuk cannot be a capital for a Kurdish movement."
The Turkish government has admitted recently that it possesses a military presence in northern Iraq.
He answered them, "Yes, no to war."
He added that it is difficult for the United States to conduct its military operation without approval from Turkey, and "if necessary, Turks fight as best as possible, but Ankara does not want war."
On the fringe of the Economic Cooperation Organization summit in Istanbul, Iranian President Muhammad Khatami said that terrorism must disappear from the world by all means through cooperation among different countries in accordance with international rules, indicating that once again the region faces grave threats.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hameed Reza Asifi said, "I hope that the information regarding the appointment of an American military officer to rule Iraq is no more than a rumor. (...) Establishing a military command could be part of  psychological warfare (launched by the United States). However, people who propose such ideas lack regional in-depth knowledge."
The Iranian Islamic Republic News Agency IRNA quoted him as saying that it would be "a mistake by the United States, which will only reinforce resistance (to American plans) in the region, particularly in Iraq."
Washington had accused Kuchma in late September of personally approving the sale of four "Kolchuga" radar units to Baghdad at one hundred million dollars, violating U.N.-imposed sanctions on Iraq.
If it was proved that the Kolchuga system-which is capable of detecting, locating, and targeting warplanes without being identified-exists, it will hinder the United States' military plans to overthrow President Saddam Hussein.
Pascual said that the objective of the mission is "to determine, in cooperation with the Ukraine side, whether there is available information regarding the transfer of these systems [to Iraq], and whether there is available information that can help us in protecting British and American pilots who are protecting the no-fly zones in Iraq."
Ukrainian Attorney General Sfiatoslav Bescon is expected to visit Washington in an attempt to obtain the master tapes to have them inspected in his country.

In the morning, French and American detectives with Yemeni investigators boarded the tanker, which is anchored off the eastern Yemeni coast, for the third time since the explosion took place on October 6 off al-Mukalla port on the southeastern coast of Yemen, 800 kilometers from the capital Sana'a.
Moreover, some Yemeni officials considered that not finding any remains or possessions that might belong to the boat driver strengthen the possibility of a remote-controlled attack.
The company manages the dock, which the Limpor was approaching when the blast took place, and it requested assistance in closing the leak that the explosion caused.
A spokesman for the British Embassy in Sana'a refused to comment.
Most probably, the tanker will be towed to Dubai to repair it in a ship repair dry dock (at Rashid port). A new crew will work on the tanker; six of them are French, one of whom arrived Saturday-Sunday night in Al-Mukalla.
Such issues exist inside Lebanon and provoke sectarianism, while the entire region (including Lebanon) is facing a dangerous phase that could result in changes in the region's political map.
We are not talking about the war on Iraq and occupying it, but rather about what could be waiting for Palestine and its popular uprising in terms of expected bloodshed and destruction done by the Israelis.
Anyone Lebanese returning to Lebanon from abroad can avoid holding the Lebanese policy accountable for an increasing local "sense of selfishness," which in fact is no more than a form of political joke at a time all of us are expecting major transformations in the region.
We do not mean large Arab states, which are good only at political dispute while they are politically countless.
The Egyptian film "Maali al Wazir," starring Ahmed Zaki and Lubluba and directed by Samir Seif, will be shown in the opening session.
Among the actors/actresses to be tributed in the Festival are Madiha Yusri, Izzat El Alayli and Imane who quit acting 40 years ago.
Egypt will be honored in the 13th Annual Arab Film Festival in Famic (Eastern France) to be held October 16-27, according to the Festival organizers' statement issued yesterday.
The Algerian satiric artist Mohamed Falaq was selected as an Honorary President of the Festival.
For the third week, the romantic comedy "Sweet Home Alabama" starring Reese Witherspoon was ranked second, generating USD 14.1 million. Its total reached USD 85 million in 17 days.
In Italy, the new movie starring actor Roberto Benigni, holder of the Oscar Award, realized a huge success, though there were different points of view by the critics.
The movie does not change anything in the famous children story written by Carlo Collodi in the nineteenth century.
The logic with which Ariel Sharon is addressing the Palestinians before traveling to Washington is no different than the logic with which President George Bush addressed Iraq and the Iraqis: The benevolent man of peace and charity who wants to save a lost and misled people. In fact, unless those people help themselves, then they must be ready to suffer the punishment.
It is nothing new for Sharon to use Bush's approach in his war against the Palestinians. He has been doing so since September 11, 2001. He always covers his faults by using this approach and succeeds in winning Washington's praise.
It is also said that Washington wants to test Sharon in terms of his possible reactions - hoping to control them - to several scenarios, such as in the case of terrorist attacks on Tel Aviv, Lebanon's pumping of Al-Wazzani waters, or an attack by Iraq, possibly with a WMD, against Israel.
After all, can Sharon really be controlled?
He is following Bush's steps with Iraq: identifying the terms of surrender to the Palestinians and carrying them to Washington as the purpose of his visit.
Abi-Nasr Strongly Criticizes Junbulat: He Participated in the Awkward Settlements and has Double Standards
"We have waited for a long time before Mr. Waleed Junbulat regained the wisdom of sensible people. However, our joy did not last for long, because his nature overshadowed his merits.
"The people will not forget that Junbulat crossed the line when he agreed to grant citizenship to criminals and non-residents with a decree that was not presented to the cabinet, instead of granting citizenship to eligible applicants according to the amended law of citizenship. His behavior is a violation of the constitution."
"Also in the name of his electors whom he represents, does he accept granting citizenship to criminals who were in jail when they were granted citizenship?"
"We call on Mr. Junbulat to stop maneuvers and return to the principles that granted him national leadership. Otherwise, he will force us to regret ever defending him when it was said that his leadership is backed by a foreign party."
"We do not have the talent for claiming secularism while simultaneously reinforcing sectarianism."
Eric Rolo: Documents Prove that American Policy is a Product of Old Schemes
Rolo revealed three documents that were recently published in U.S. newspapers, indicating that this policy is old and was planned years ago.
- The U.S. is the greatest state in the world and has no competitor. It would not be right to miss the opportunity of increasing its control over the world.
- They also mention indirect messages directed against Europe and Japan. They literally state  "preventing major industrial states from playing any international and regional roles."
The current reality of the U.S. administration proves that the person having the greatest influence on Bush is, according to the U.S. press, Dick Cheney.
Rolo concluded that these documents prove that September 11 was an opportunity to apply this policy. Without it, it would not have been possible to take advantage of anything to declare war against terrorism, because Bush, Jr., promised on the first day of this war that it would go on for many years.
- Controlling oil wells in Iraq, which represents the second largest reserve in the world, added to the fact that oil-producing companies are European and Chinese, not American.
Neither Land Nor Water
As Beirut welcomes presidential delegations from all over the world, internal conflicts seem irrelevant compared to the amazing international attention that Lebanon is enjoying. It is a country rising from the ashes of war.
Such desires became obvious when David Ben-Gurion set his dangerous scheme, which the "Jewish Agency" adopted and presented to the Paris Peace Conference on February 3, 1919.  The essence of these desires was embedded in this scheme, by considering the deep valley between Lebanon and Palestine to be natural borders.
We have talked in detail about the water issue because it comes simultaneously with the Francophone Summit, particularly since France was involved in the water issue during the French mandate in Lebanon and Syria.
The Helpless Arab Situation: Some Ripe Heads Must be Reaped
It is the age of declining nationalism with the start of the third millennium.
The Arabs have become the blamers and the ones totally resigned to their role.
Your words are true and frank, but to whom are you preaching, Mr. Moussa?
This is what the American version of al-Hajjaj bin Yusuf, known as George W. Bush, is trying to borrow.
The inspectors will be allowed to go to Iraq and visit all the sites where some WMDs might be.
Antara used to praise his opponent's strength and exaggerate in enumerating his possessions, so that he would be considered to have defeated a fierce enemy when he won.
It is the opinion of our teacher Ghassan Tweini (in a lecture he delivered in the Lebanese Studies Center in the U.K.) that the war against the Iraqi regime will commence next month, in November.
The post-Saddam phase is currently being deliberated for optimum means and formulas to place the American presence in a direct form while work is being done to select the alternative. Perhaps it will even be represented in a presidential board.
Extremism and Moderation
Staying away from the "dialog of the deaf" that can deal with anything but the issue of the presence of foreign armed forces on our territory is an extremism that needs to be reviewed by you. Also one should reconsider his position regarding total acceptance of the current situation, which is your only way back to the warmth of moderation.
- Any mention of existing presidential disagreements is extremism, whereas moderation can be searched for in the quantities of al-Hareeri detergent that is constantly being used for heart-washing operations under his sponsorship after every meeting following a return from solitude in Sardinia.
- Imperatively demanding Arab states to abandon engagements with the Zionist enemy in statement and condemnation combats is extremism that contradicts the moderation of keeping all the burdens of the Palestinian issue on the shoulders of Lebanon alone, where thousands of casualties and hundreds of destroyed villages are the result of daily Israeli attacks against our country.
Anyone who has a different view belongs to the group of people who can say that the girl is only a little pregnant.
Let those who transgress and violate sanctified blood on their lazy beds remember Ibn Nabata's poem:
Houses of Revenge, a Fault for a Fault
Yomna left the table where she was sitting with her husband Najeeb Lateef at a distance from Rimon Eddeh's table, and she approached him and shook hands with him.
And usually Rimon Eddeh comes from his summer home near the hotel to spend some time in the garden every Sunday.
He answered her invitation, and they danced together.
When the three of them met in Alia, the president blamed her angrily and with hot temper for what she did, considering her behavior harmful to his reputation.
"But dancing publicly with Rimon Eddeh in the Sofer hotel like that and in front of everybody, despite your awareness of what is between us and them, this cannot continue."
"Be careful."
"Perhaps it will be our turn in the future."
Sheikh Fuad, the family elder, listened to that dialog.
In last Saturday's edition of al-Nahar, the headline read as follows: "Own on the October 13th Operation Anniversary 12 Years of Darkness and Justifications That are Worse Than the Crime."
The Jordanian Generation Of the Hashemite Royal Family
The young king announced, "talking about a confederation between Jordan and Palestine is an attempt to initiate a conflict between the two peoples." It was the first statement of its kind by a Jordanian official.
We are finished then with this story! What else?
Here there is still some ambiguity.
Why did it become obsolete? Because it is linked to a set of mysterious positions regarding the Palestinian issue that represented the essence of the policy of the late Jordanian king, Hussein ibn Talal, in this regard.
It was a normal result that finalizing the confederation issue or the refugees issue was suspended. Such affairs depended on a contemplated, basic Jordanian role in the final solution of the Palestinian issue to simultaneously settle all these matters.
Then there would be no options or side settlements.
"If any other member of this family is thinking in another direction, then he would be representing only himself."
He promised, and a gentleman always keeps his word.
Breaking countries into pieces is not an American habit. Anyone who does not believe that can ask the people of Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, Indonesia, and Sudan about how the White House worked towards preserving the integrity of their countries which were torn due to their rulers' discrimination.
Washington is determined that not one penny of oil revenues will be misused, not a single one will go to a non-Iraqi party, because it is their right to their national wealth.
Let the Iraqis feel more comfortable because one-fourth of their oil will no longer be used to pay compensations imposed by the U.N. on the Iraq of Saddam Hussein, which are estimated at approximately USD 160 billion. It will not be used to pay the current regime's foreign debts, estimated at approximately USD 80 [b]illion. The U.S. administration is so interested in preserving the wealth of Iraqis and securing their future, that it has started as of now to put pressure on crediting countries and those who claim compensation money against their losses in the Gulf War of 1991 to write off Iraqi debts.
Law and order will be enforced and settled gradually for a smooth transfer of power to eligible Iraqis.
Let the Iraqis rejoice.
All they have to do now is to be a little patient. They have been suffering for quite a long period of time; they can wait a little more.
In every war, they were stuck between two hells.
My words here are the evidence that the forum accepts conflicting opinions, because I might say things that do not appeal to you or your opinion.
This is a fundamental truth.
Second: To believe that Muhammad is the servant and messenger of God, and that the Koran is the word of God from the beginning until the end.
Perhaps this was more than a response to the hostile media campaigns to announce positions on plans... The king announced, for the first time by a Jordanian official, that "talking about a confederation between Jordan and Palestine is an attempt to initiate conflict between the two peoples."

What Lies Behind the al-Wazzani Issue...
That is Israel's story. In reality, Lebanon had started work on al-Wazzani several weeks before Sharon's declaration of war. No one can imagine that the Israeli air and land surveillance and intelligence services took no notice of the bulldozers, laborers, and motion of trucks moving water pipes and equipment from the very first day of work, especially since the working site is very near to Israeli soldiers' installations in the occupied Lebanese farms of Shiba.
Needless to say, Sharon knows that Lebanon will not and cannot accept his proposal of "agreement between both parties for sharing water," even if it wants to, as it is committed to the "unity of the two tracks" with Syria, and that the negotiation fantasy will only come true if occupied Syrian Golan and Lebanese Shiba farms are returned to their original owners, and perhaps the Palestinians return to Palestine.
When Lebanon started working to draw part of its share in al-Wazzani water, the Palestinian intifada was at its peak, and Sharon's war was at its boiling point. It was not in his best interest to open a second front that might expose northern Israel to a rain of Katiosha missiles sent by Hezbollah in retaliation for bombing al-Wazzani constructions.
Perhaps in his fierce war against the Palestinian people's intrepid resistance, Sharon is still blaming the Lebanese resistance, which supplied its Palestinian counterparts with moral support after being a role model and an invitation to resist the occupation and to liberate all militarily occupied Arab lands.
That price could be in Palestine, Lebanon, or any location desired by the destructive Sharonic mentality.
Baydoon stressed the importance of cooperation between the ministries and departments concerned and the Lebanese University, considering that the missing link lies in the fact that the Lebanese University works in areas restricted by the government, "and as such, the government does its share of the job, particularly studies, without using the potential available to the University, which is substantial."
Qubeisi talked about the importance of the agreement "as the geological map was laid out only once, in 1934. Since that time, no similar work has been carried out."
Article 5 stipulates the final deposit at a nominal value of 10,000 liras "to be submitted to the state's treasury against a receipt of payment."
Minister of Agriculture Ali Abd-Allah said, "Food security in our current situation will not be achievable and will remain endangered as long as our right to water remains jeopardized."

Matosian Lays Foundation Stone of Al-Mashriq Company Downtown and Suggests to Cyprus Cooperation through Comprehensive Insurance Project Cooperation with Cyprus
Matosian talked last night at the celebration for laying the foundation stone of Al-Mashriq Insurance and Reinsurance company (he is its chairman of the board and general manager) in downtown Beirut, which was substituted by an olive tree that symbolizes welfare, future, and prosperity. This was under the sponsorship of the Minister of Economy and Trade, who was represented by Insurance Supervision Authority Director Waleed Janadiry, due to his traveling abroad. Among the attendees were Beirut Governor Yacoub Sarraf, Cypriot Ministers of Finance and Health Takis Cleridis and Friksos Stafides, and a number of insurance company representatives and interested people.
He also explained that international challenges after September 11, aviation accidents, and floods in Europe will represent a burden on international reinsurance companies and will reflect negatively on the local market, "as we will try to reduce the local consumer's burden by adjusting the insurance bill."
He said, "The insurance and hospitals sector is studying the establishment of a partnership for the development of an insurance contract to secure basic consumer needs at low prices, which will inevitably lead to constriction of the amounts carried by the Ministry of Health." He explained that he will present the elements of this contract to the Cypriot Ministry of Health "so that they can study it and benefit the therapeutic sector from this project."
He also emphasized the importance of cooperation between the public and private sectors, "which is fundamental to activate confidence and set criteria and policies that will ensure attraction of foreign investments and expansion of insurance markets."
In contrast, Khaleefa's novel is based on normal people gathered under an exhaustive idea "plot." A boy who is not only an orphan, but also does not even know who his parents were, is cared for by an aged mute grandmother who tells him nothing about his birth. He lives with her in a dilapidated cottage on remains and natural herbs under circumstances the misery of which the author spares no length in describing.

What I had the chance to know about Jamal Abou Al Hessen until that night, through some musical evening shows he performed in Lebanon, is his experimental musical style in the "Electro-Acoustic" shows and his specialization in the field of the various audio-visual means without avoiding, in his experiments, the traditional supplies which were the basis of his modern musical visions, changing the common national song from folkloric structure to photographic enriched with memory.

"I appeal to official security authorities to discover as soon as possible the location of Engineer Abi-Rashid. Any harm that might happen to any engineer, God forbid, represents an assault to the entire body of Lebanese engineers."

After that period of time, the defendant returned once again to the attorney's office and deposited with him a power of attorney bearing the signatures of 17 names from the Darweesh family, and attested by the Egyptian foreign ministry, the Egyptian embassy in Lebanon, and the Lebanese foreign ministry. He promised to bring the attorney a municipality clearance document for these buildings. Meanwhile, some of the Darweesh family owners who were actually resident in the United States of America and hold U.S. citizenship learned from publications of the compensations matter.

Following that, the defendant went to the attorney's office and informed him of the matter. The latter advised him to contact his principals in Egypt and find out the truth behind the power of attorney given to his colleague.

A Beacon Extinguished in Beirut

And ahead of a prominent figure in political and struggle work and one of the pillars of the national social movement in Lebanon, her brother Adeeb Qaddura, the youngest daughter in the family developed her own independent political track, emphasizing a new formula of relations between women and men in our society, whether that is a husband, brother, or father, where the woman becomes a peer not a subject, independent in her thought not a follower, and equal to him in her presence, not a mere shadow of his.
From now on, Zahia Qaddura will not be with us with her frail body, but she will definitely remain with her rich spirit, like springs at the time they spurt at the foot of a mountain that was topped with snow and then the warmth of spring crept into it. She will remain with her splendid presence, like a beautiful butterfly moving between flowers at the time of their yawning blossoms amid sunrays penetrating bashfully as dawn approaches.

Franco Fratini Assigned as Italy's Foreign Minister; Agagari's Wife Met Her Jailed Husband in His Prison: He Calls On Students To Demonstrate Peacefully
Fratini was born in Rome to a family originally from Tuscany. He was one of the most prominent figures of Berlesconi's party, Forza Italia.
Agagari, the struggler during the Islamic Revolution, was sentenced to death on November 6 for his advocacy of "renewing Islam" and his statement that Muslims are not obliged to "follow clergymen blindly."
He added that most foreign countries currently see Iran as an independent state, "the system of which is based on the people's will and elections."
"We realize that this crisis is a source of injustice." He mentioned, "The European Union did a lot in the past months, but we are convinced that more needs to be done today."
In a comment on Iraq's acceptance of Security Council Resolution 1441, he expressed hope that the Iraqi authorities will allow the international inspectors "to accomplish their mission actually and quickly."

With the prohibition of carrying weapons in the city, Maan becomes the second area to be included under this restriction after the Aqaba Private Economic Area, to which the prohibition was applied as an encouragement for foreign investment.

A large number of students were injured, while others were detained on October 23 during confrontations with police.
Khartoum University colleges includes 18,000 students, and they are distributed in four areas, two of which are at the city center, one in Um-Durman, and one in Northern Khartoum.
However, "the situations in the African Horn area call for all possible attention from the League as well as a constructive and effective role to solve the problems of the African Horn."
Pope John Paul II delivered a historic speech yesterday before the Italian parliament, the first in Vatican and Roman history since the republic was established. He called on Italians to contribute to achieving world peace, to adhere to Christian values, and to have more children.
However, the papal state ceased to exist in 1860, and the papacy was obliged to relinquish Rome ten years later when the forces of King Victor Emanuel entered it.
Before President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, ministers, MPs, and senate members, the Pope also touched on relations between the Vatican and the Italian Republic, which witnessed tension at some stages. He mentioned that they are currently intensive and said that the identity of Italy "would be very difficult to understand without mentioning Christianity."
He discussed the continuous Palestinian-Israeli conflict and said, "It is regretful that our hopes for peace have been harshly dissipated by the eruption of chronic struggles, starting with that struggle that caused much bloodshed in the Holy Land."
He reiterated his call to incorporate the principles of Christianity into the future European constitution.
The birthrate in Italy represents the worldwide low, not exceeding 3.9 births per 1,000 resident population.
Italian media services covered the event with extreme attention, and newspapers dedicated several pages to it, while public television interrupted its regular program to broadcast it live.
The speech had an unexpected result, as Beneditto Marcianti, who is a Mafia leader, turned himself in to Italian authorities. He had been sentenced to 30 years in prison last September after being convicted of murders and connections with the Mafia.
Entire generations of Chinese officials, including President Jiang Zemin (76 years old), are preparing to leave power after he relinquished leadership of the Communist Party in its 16th conference. His name was not mentioned on the party's new central committee elected by participants of the conference, which ended its proceedings yesterday.
According to applied tradition, they will relinquish their state and government positions.
One hundred eighty of the 356 members are joining the central committee for the first time.
Although observers emphasize that no one can speculate accurately on the successors of the "third generation," they all agree that the Chinese president nominated at least four of his allies in the new central committee.
The new charter provides that the party is also "the socialist leadership nucleus in the Chinese style and represents the requirements of developing the advanced productive forces."
The representatives also elected before the end of the conference in the People's Palace in Beijing a disciplinary committee of 121 members. This committee is considered to be the party's policeman. Finally, the Communist Party anthem was played.
The Senate had voted last September with 90:8 majority to include an independent committee in the previous draft of the bill, but it was omitted from the new text, which was mostly prepared in the White House by Republican Party legislators.
The Congress approved the bill on Wednesday with 299:121 majority.
Its establishment will represent the first major restructuring of government in a quarter of a century, specifically since the Department of Energy was established in 1977. It is also the most extensive since the Department of Defense was established in 1947.
Republican Representative Christopher Shays said, "We have a great opportunity to protect the men of our country and the world. (...) We need a revival to be made now."
The new department-level agency will merge 22 different agencies, including the Coast Guard, Immigration and Nationalization Authority, and the Secret Service.
However, critics say that his grip on the authority will not be permanent if Netanyahu, who is known to be an eloquent orator who deals with the media skillfully, manages to convince members of the party that he possesses the solution for the 2-year violence and economic slump that has been aggravated during Sharon's term.
Prominent Likud member Michael Eitan said, "At this stage, the indicators prove that a big victory awaits Likud (in the general elections), but there were times such speculations changed with events."
The results of a poll published yesterday indicated that Likud might double its number of representatives in the Knesset in the general elections, and that the Labor Party is heading toward registering the worst result in its history.
Israeli Radio broadcast that former Foreign Minister David Levy has returned once again to the Likud bloc of which he was a member.
Two Arms or Two Arches
There are some deep and very significant indicators in Paris 2.
Regardless of its outcome, holding the Paris 2 conference must represent a luminous point amid the international theater that is gradually withdrawing toward darkness.
Lebanon is expecting financial support to help it take one step forward in handling its burdensome debts.
And if the President and Prime Minister have been competing in blowing winds of optimism and pinning hopes on the conference, then it would be more worthy of many politicians to open their doors for the foam of "heart soap" flowing from Baabda and Quraytam; perhaps the breeze of optimism will hit frowning faces and gloomy hearts.
There is on one hand the Maronite Patriarchy with Qirant Shahwan as its tongue, voice, and perhaps thought; the Free National Current; and a number of political figures and party movements.
For on one hand he will see that both adhere to the same principles.
Are there other reasons for the lack of understanding between the two Christian camps other than those mentioned above?
The first is principle-based, if it may be described as such. It is led by Bakraki and the extremely effective forces of the Christian circle. Its essence is taking principle-based positions regarding issues and problems experienced by Lebanon, regardless of their impact on its Christians, whether negative or positive.
and standing against the belief that Lebanese Muslims are working towards Islamicizing Lebanon, at least at the system level, whether such Islamicization is political or religious.
The first one is adhering to the Al-Taif agreement due to equal sharing of major political and administrative posts on which we insist in spite of the transformation of Christians into a minority.
On the other hand, the realistic current believes that the principle approach expedites termination of the Christian presence in Lebanon, whereas waiting, which is not waiting for external intervention to return to the Christians their distinguished position by force, might be useful as the area might after a period of time, even if long, move further away from bias to sect and school of thought and become more advanced, perhaps even "civilized."
Sudden Activation of the Egyptian Role: Intelligence Director Meets Arafat and Sharon; Washington
Arafat stated that the meeting with Sulayman is "very, very important."
The Egyptian action comes four days after talks held by two delegations from Fath and Hamas to convince the Islamic Resistance Movement to stop its suicidal operations inside Israel.
Based on this proposition, Fatah and Hamas would stop their operations for three months, to be followed by an assessment of the situation and a test for Israel's willingness to stop its attacks.
He also said that the Israeli government, which was reinforced with extremists such as Netanyahu and Minister of Defense Shaul Mofaz, is now in fact a war government, and that the Palestinians cannot respond to such a government by stopping resistance.
"We are still proceeding with regard to the roadmap presented by the President to establish two states living in peace side by side."
The subcommittee spun off the Public Works and Transport Committee resumed the issue of pedestrian rights and traffic laws and heard the remarks made by the technical and legal committees and by the Preparation and Guidance Committee.
The committee meeting was chaired by MP Muhammad Qabbani and attended by MPs Faisal Al-Dawud and Waleed Abdou; Traffic Unit Commander Colonel Adel Abu-Dhahir; Traffic Emergencies Committee Chairman Colonel Joseph Al-Duweihi; Traffic, Auto, and Machinery Authority Chairman and Director General Faraj-Allah Surur; Auto and Machinery Importers Society Member Selim Saad; Beirut Municipality Traffic Unit Head Michel Skaff; Lebanese Standards and Specifications Authority Director General Antoine Sama'an; and representatives of the Ministry of Information, the Tameem International company, the Development and Construction Council, and Youth Assembly for Social Awareness (YASA).
"The Defense Committee will meet next Monday to approve the bill awaited by many hunting hobbyists."
He replied, "This law paved the way for civilized, modern, and organized hunting conditions that will prove convenient to all, hunters and environmentalists alike.
C personnel, in addition to employees of the Voice of Lebanon radio station and tens of others who wanted to sign but some of whom were unavailable at their place of work, while others were prohibited by their employers to participate "under potential culpability."
People are the aim and the base. The law was developed to regulate their lives, preserve their rights, and protect their families and properties. If it loses its human spirit, then what use is it?
To us, this means exposing our colleagues to unemployment and their families to need.
We wanted to start a symbolic, silent picket only for an hour, calling on our journalist and media colleagues, denying politicians or any other parties access.
We want to register our position of solidarity with our colleagues who have been affected in social and humanitarian aspects. We want to raise our voices and say: We do not accept solutions to be always at our expense and that we be wasted as "currency offset." The examples are many, the most recent of which was TV Lebanon and the National Media Agency. (Among all the ministries and governmental agencies, the journalists of the Agency alone are excessive and cause waste of public property.) And now it is MTV and Jebel Lebanon. Whose turn will it be tomorrow?
In other firms, people in charge prohibited the media people to sign! In the absence of any protection or security, they were obliged to yield. All they could do was to say, "You have our hearts."
3- When politicians and parasites are not allowed to interfere with the media, then the contemplated result would be achieved.
Meeting of Parties Calls on Ministry of Education to Confiscate History Textbook Originating From U.S.A.
"Such a matter represents an extremely serious precedent. It is condemned and must be strongly confronted, as it represents an attempt to pass American concepts hostile to our national struggle through teaching our students these misleading concepts that distort history, change the facts, and illustrate legitimate national resistance as terrorism at a time when efforts are being exerted to boycotting American and Zionist products."
- "The Meeting dealt with the situations in occupied Palestine, where Zionist aggression against the Palestinian people is escalating, in a desperate attempt by the Zionist extremist government to eradicate the intifada and the resistance."
The United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon (UNIFIL) was established by Security Council Resolutions 425 and 426 dated March 19, 1978, following the Israeli invasion of Lebanon on the night of March 14, 1978, which was triggered by a Palestinian commando attack inside Israel on March 11 of the same year.
Over the years, the Security Council maintained its commitment to the integrity of Lebanese territory and the sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon.
UNIFIL remained behind Israeli lines for three years, and its role was limited to providing protection and humanitarian services to local residents as much as possible.
The turning point was on April 17, 2000, when the Secretary-General received official notice from the Israeli government informing him that it was withdrawing its forces present in Lebanon by July 2000, in application of Security Council Resolutions 425-426.
In a few days time, these forces had left all their previous locations.
On June 16, the Secretary-General submitted a report in which he acknowledged that Israel completed the withdrawal according to the line determined by the United Nations, that the Army of Southern Lebanon has been totally disbanded, and that all prisoners in the tents prison were released.
In spite of the substantial improvement of conditions on the Israeli-Lebanese borders, the situation remains far from peaceful. The potential of serious incidents occurring still exists.
Because of the prevalent conditions, the Secretary-General believes that the need for UNIFIL to perform its functions will continue through the near future.
President General Emil Lahud responds to "  " in its attempts to ascribe to the resistance in southern Lebanon alleged links with Al-Qaeda, while the resistance itself does not respond.
In the words of the President, generally, there is bright clarity, but it is the clarity of caution of a fire at the door moving closer, then further, then closer, and with it the devil's hour comes closer. There was also will from someone who experienced will and thus passed through dark tunnels with the minimum losses and maximum safety possible so far.
In the view that correct and luminous personal relations add a warm human dimension to major and minor issues, and the relationship between Emil Lahud and Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasr-Allah, according to secretarial meetings, can draw, in terms of regional challenges, identical ideas and identical dreams (without dreams there would be no significant ideas) between a rule that views the weapon of resistance in hand is better than ten diplomatic weapons on the international tree, that has become exclusively American today, and between a resistance that views a president speaking on its behalf on its territory and defends it from a position more advantageous than that of an entire Arab and Western world that is led by terrorism and the war against terrorism on a disgusting trip of waste and submission.
No official statement has been announced as of yet by officials with regard to Iraq's acceptance of Resolution 1441 dealing with the elimination of WMD.
Because of the mentioned mutual suspicions between the U.S. and Iraq, and since no party can tell how things will develop, it is also required of Baghdad as a second step to submit detailed lists of programs aimed at developing chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons to UNMOVIC, the International Nuclear Energy Agency, and the Security Council, according to the third clause of Resolution 1441. Clause 3 of the resolution also stipulates that Iraqi authorities must submit lists of programs for "ballistic missiles and other launching systems, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, perhaps all it (Iraq) actually has of such weapons and their specific locations, components, component parts, inventories of chemical and biological precursors, all relevant materials, equipment, and sites, and the activities of research, development, and production facilities."
1- If the lists are incomplete and the consequences of that.
On the other hand, the other side says that only notification is required, with no need for a meeting, and that even if a formal meeting is held, there would be no need for another resolution.
It received new maps and is still demanding more maps. Israel's submission came as a result of international pressures exercised on it in this regard.
This requires defining the meaning of "provocation" before judging it for the proper application of the resolution and to answer the following further questions: Would resorting to carrot and stick approaches with scientists, employees, and officials be considered provocation?
Present were MP Marawan Fares, former Minister Farouk Al-Berbeer, former MP Bahaa Al-Deen Al-Eitani, Sudan Ambassador Sayid Bekheit, and the Assembly's General Coordinator Mueen Bashour.
Immediately afterward, machine-gun rounds were fired in the air, and a state of alert was registered among combatants of Fatah and the targeted center, which is supervised by Palestinian Major Mahmoud Eissa, known as "Lino."
* MP George Najm condemned the spate of explosions in Ein Al-Helwa camp and warned in a statement he made "of internal dissension that can damage the security of the camp and its neighborhood as a result of the explosive packs and daily explosions in various locations, all of which serve the interests of the enemy."

"Upon inspection by the health superintendent and his above report, it was found that the owner of the generator carried out some of the conditions imposed upon him. However, these conditions do not satisfy the required purpose. Odors remain in the location, which requires transfer of the generator to another location away from houses. Kindly assign security forces to advise the owner of the generator as such, allowing him a period of time you find appropriate for that."
"The Issue of the Individual" is the title of a book released by "Dar Al-Saki" in London. It is a group work comprised of contributions by Arabs and Israelis, all of whom unexceptionally discuss the issue of tension between public affairs and private affairs in all Middle East societies, particularly those related to the Arab world.
There is something even worse: For the past fifty years,
"The answer without the least of doubts is: No!"
The latter reveals that Israeli society, contrary to the Arab world that suppresses the individual realm, allows leeway for the development of the conflict between the public and private realms.
He says, "The conflict between those two worlds encouraged repression of any intellectual innovation, any multiplicity of opinion, any call for reform, any hope for change, and any desire for modernization."
However, it should also address us, the Israeli people, and our Minister of Interior Uzi Landao, who was complaining not very long ago about "those Israelis who forget the homeland and are only occupied with eating cheese and drinking good wine."
He held a press conference in the Banks Society offices yesterday, attended by the Bank of Lebanon Deputy Governor Faheem Midad.
He assured that ISO certification awarded to any bank is a certification of the entire sector.
He noted that this effort took close to a year, and that the bank staff contributed to it under the supervision of an internal team and the consultancy of the company, in addition to visits by representatives of the Canadian firm, who monitored the bank's adherence to the quality and operational policy it developed.
Abu Juda mentioned that the Bank is looking forward to being awarded total quality management certification in the future.
Turkish Delegation Visits Al-Hareeri and Figures and Signs Cooperation Agreement With the Economic Forum
The delegation gave Al-Hareeri an overview of the agreement signed between the Turkish businessmen and the Forum.
Al-Qassar called for identifying the best means for joint economic cooperation, particularly that Lebanon has deep-rooted and historic relations with Turkey.
In the afternoon,  the delegation ended its official talks with the signing of a cooperation agreement between the External Relations Council of Turkey and the Lebanese Economic Forum, aimed at furthering relations between businessmen in both countries.
He considered that the agreement is a new and distinguished relationship between Turkey and Lebanon, and that it implies the establishment of two businessmen executive boards, one being Turkish-Lebanese and the other Lebanese-Turkish.
He emphasized the necessity of correcting the trade balance deficit, which is currently in the interest of Turkey with an annual export value to Lebanon of approximately 200 million dollars, compared to Lebanese exports to Turkey of approximately 30 million.
50 Million Dollar Kuwaiti Loan to Build 22 Schools in Beirut
"The loan we signed at an amount equivalent to 50 million U.S. dollars will contribute to the construction of 22 schools in the Beirut governorate, benefiting approximately 35,000 male and female students."
"The loan that was signed is not the first and will not be the last among the series of offerings made by Kuwait to fund development projects in the Lebanese Republic."
The total cost of the project, the financing of which is shared by the Kuwaiti Fund, including land ownership, is approximately 185 million dollars.
The Fund had also administered five grants from the State of Kuwait to Lebanon as a contribution to the rebuilding of the South and to the funding of sanitary utilities and a power station at a total value of 68 million dollars.
In a subsequent statement, the Union said: "Olives are grown on 21 percent of Lebanon's cultivated land, and there are 68,000 families directly depending in whole or in part on this crop for their livelihood."
"Therefore, we suggest that the following items be discussed and approved in the first cabinet session:"
Arab researchers have often neglected an important dimension in the historic culmination that drove the Protestant West to adopt the project of usurping Palestine and converting it into a Jewish state. This dogmatic dimension represents the basic motivation and major justification of the colonial imperial program of evacuating Palestine of its people, then establishing a Hebrew state on its land. This is because the satisfied and relaxed West over there never saw in Palestine over here anything but a "biblical" geography and a history of "promise."
Any reader of Farhan Saleh's book "Identity and Heritage" (*) must acquaint himself with the author in the events of his diary, to discover then that for social research be genuine and effective, it must take the form of social work and activity that is aware of the suffering of the community, involved with its daily events and relations, slumbering with its reveries, and rising with its frustrations.
I start with a personal remark that might not mean much to the casual reader but might be a key to those who are concerned like myself with the historic sense and pause for long before the "anthropology of civilizations" and their racial and human characteristics.

If only someone could measure the tears of faith, joy, and emotion that fell heavily, they would then be estimated as a sea and its waves! And if the roses and basil spread upon Her sacred relics were counted, they would be in millions! And if the prayers said before her were counted, they would be prayers for a hundred years! And if beating chests for supplication and invocation were counted, they would be estimated as many as the church bells of the world in one year! And if the visitors were counted since the day she arrived in Lebanon, that would amaze all the people on earth!
Love eliminates selfishness, and "me" becomes "we." Indeed!
Our Condition, the Crisis, and Advice; Ghassan Tuweini
It is as though Arab regimes have shifted into a state of weightlessness, wandering without knowing how to face.
Pausing at this request, we wonder: What if the Iraqi president heeds Ghassan Tuweini's advice and endeavors to save what can be saved in the last hours, thus sparing his Iraq and the area this affliction with a professional stroke that would defeat America's excuses by abdicating and resigning, as the matter has totally gone out of his hands and the hands of Arab states and all states of the world?
It seems so far that almost everyone has abandoned, disguised or undisguised, the blood of Iraq that is about to be shed.

The Legislative Elections: The Lists Of Parties That Received The Final Receipts
The Unionist Democratic Union (UDU) was able to win 23 final receipts, the last of which were received yesterday evening for the two districts of Tunis II and Bizerte. The party expects to win the three remaining receipts for the districts of Beja, Kairouan and  Monastir.
The political bureau of the party is expected to meet tomorrow (Wednesday) to discuss the status of the lists and the issue of the final receipts.
The People's Union Party (PUP) expects today to complete its receipt of the remaining final receipts, which are for the districts of Medenine, Mahdia, Beja and Bizerte, in addition to the district of Monastir, which submitted its list relatively late.
Family Planning:
The basic role is still entrusted to organizations that are active in the area of the family to seek the necessary mechanisms and sources of funding, which remain the basic problem behind the lack of effectiveness of these programs given the lack of commitment by some of the donor countries to provide the necessary funds.
In which he pointed out that the results of field studies conducted by experts and specialists to evaluate the achievements of the 1994 Cairo Conference on Population and Development have confirmed the existence of many challenges and problems across the  various segments of societies of the Arab region. These are basically the status of women and demographic growth, which remains high in many countries and is reflected in the standard of living of the family as well as in its economic, social and health aspects, and aspects of reproductive health, like unwanted pregnancies and diseases related to pregnancy, reproduction and abortion, in addition to sexually-transmitted diseases and the problems of adolescence. In spite of their low incidence rate compared to that in Western countries, for example, AIDS cases are only 2 or 3 % of all diseases in general, the facts are not entirely reassuring. Rather, preventive programs especially must be promoted, since the Arab countries are important tourist destinations in the world and attract large numbers of tourists each year.

The Department statement said, "During the operation of erecting a wall on the third building of the expansion at Dubai Airport, a section of the reinforced arsenal under construction collapsed on a number of workers."
He further indicated that there are three agencies that oversee quality safety procedures, the first is the contractor, the second is the Advisory Office, and the third is the Department of Civil Aviation.
With the appearance of more images of devastation and destruction, and the bodies of the  victims and the blood of innocent women, young men and children, the Al Aqsa Intifada enters its fifth year with steps laden with wounds and pain. With it, another series of numbers is added to the list of victims recorded in the registers and reports of official agencies and in the records of organizations and committees for the defense of human rights. It is an additional series of numbers that records its growing human losses day after day in the vast continual and dubious international silence over one of the ugliest kinds of occupation that has been going on since the beginning of the last century.
The truth is that the circumstances and conditions that surround the assassination of Izzedine Khalil in Damascus late last week raise many questions. For if Israel's responsibility in this crime is not disputed after the unofficial admissions by more than one Israeli security official about the operation, the reality also reveals many facts about the extent of infiltration of the Mossad, Israel's Intelligence Services, in a country considered in a state of war with Israel, and its success in carrying out its crime in broad daylight. It also uncovers the fact that the matter of informants, agents and collaborators with the occupation remains one of the most dangerous means available with which to strike at the ranks of the Palestinian leadership, serve the interests of the occupation and support its choices in eliminating any attempt at reviving the dying peace process.

Issuance of two decrees pertaining to improving the financial situation of judges
As to the second decree, it calls for granting the chief justices of the appellate courts outside Tunis, the public attorneys in these courts and other judges on parallel tracks (such as the heads of the courts of review) a bonus equivalent to the difference between the bonus given to the undersecretary of a ministry and the one allowed for the general director of a central administration. The decree did not encompass the chief justice of the  appellate court in Tunis or its public attorney since from the start these had already been ranked equal to an undersecretary of a ministry.
- Improve the system of notification in the courts to allow citizens to obtain various legal certificates from a distance without having to go on site to the court and allowing attorneys and legal aides to obtain the information they need to perform their jobs from their offices.
- Adopt a comprehensive maintenance program for the Palace of Justice in Tunis with the National Heritage Institute in order to protect its distinctive architectural character.

In terms of numbers, there are only 114,226 children who attend 2,422 kindergartens, which leads to a coverage rate close to 74.20% expected to reach by 20115.25% even if some optimists are convinced that the rate can be exceeded to reach 5.29% as a general coverage rate.

Developing the abilities of handicapped children through specific educational units
Miss Manal Ben Jamieh (14 years old) says, "This is my second year at the center. Before I came here, I did not know how to operate the computer. But now I can surf the Internet and write using the computer and I am very happy to be here at the center."
The center welcomes handicapped children between the ages of 5 and 18 years old, and enrolls children who are members of organizations and associations that care for handicapped children, in addition to the handicapped children who are accompanied by their parents.

Second, inflation that is deliberately caused by producers, whereby some of the latter increase their prices in anticipation of a price increase by other manufacturers.
As to the political perspective, the matter of inflation and its stabilization constituted at the end of the 20th century a game in the hands of the managers of developed countries, especially in those of Latin America. Strategies vary according to the political claims, and economic policies may be divided into two categories:
Politicians often exploit this state of affairs to score election gains. Prior to elections, politicians choose a policy of stabilization of inflation by way of the exchange rate, and afterwards they adopt monetary stability. The former leads to an explosion of consumption, which causes a slowdown in growth as a result of declining exports, while the latter causes a contraction of consumption followed by a resurgence of economic activity as a result of the incentive to save and grow exports.

Tunis-As-Sabah: With the beginning of January 2005 being the effective expiration date of the multilateral agreements on textile and with the growing direct competition in the European and Mediterranean markets by Asian products, beginning at that time, they will be able to enter that market without any quantitative restrictions, and the textile sector in Tunisia, as in all other Mediterranean countries, will find itself facing enormous challenges, given that China with its lion's share of the world output will become a fierce competitor in these markets.
In a review of the outcome of the professionals meeting held in Tunis on this September 24 and 25, Mr. Claude Tetrad, a Turkish national and representative of the professionals spoke about the difficulties of this stage, which are the source of a real threat to the professionals, since maintaining their competitive edge is in serious doubt with the invasion of the European countries by China, when Mediterranean countries used to be the reference zone for the sector and a primary center worldwide. According to the professionals, this situation requires bold and satisfactory decisions by the commission to give a new impulse to the sector and speed up the exchanges between the parties in the region.  This is linked to the agreements and the implementation of a follow-up mechanism for changing prices and the volume of fabric offered by China. Business owners in this sector also see that the present phase requires setting up pre-planned action programs to transition from a phase of delivery to a joint-delivery phase and to identify markets based on a strategy for renewal, and to facilitate bank funding for the professionals and to adopt relevant legislation that is commensurate with the changes. The spokesman for the professionals also emphasized that the survival of the industry requires looking seriously into these recommendations and acting for a rapid implementation on the ground by the decision makers.
Tunis - As-Sabah: It is not strange that the name of Taieb Louhichi is a prominent and important name in the annals of Tunisian cinema...
From this standpoint, Taieb Louhichi is a perennial value in Tunisian cinema that cannot be forgotten no matter the circumstances and the causes.
I had decided to permanently settle in Tunisia long time ago.. And I made the choice deliberately and with the conviction of working away from the limelight. I completed and released my new film "Dance of the Wind", which represents an important experience in my life. It is a pause to meditate on my cinematic life and I tried to widen the interest by choosing the Algerian actor and director Mohamed Chouikh to play the role of the director as the hero of the film.
* How is renewal in the films of Taieb Louhichi?
In spite of the intellectual bent, which some think that I favor and present .. anyone who reviews my films will find that the subject is simple and accessible to all the viewers...
Cinema is image.. and the word is not the expression because it depends on the image and the dialogue...
Youssef is a producer in his fifties who is preparing a film. He goes on a tour of the Tunisian south to locate shooting places, combing the region in its entirety and taking photos. During a trip through a strange village, he meets a beautiful shepherdess before he gets lost...
The movie was recognized by numerous important awards, of which the special jury award of the Arab Festival in Rotterdam and the award of the Cine-Clubs in Khribqat in the Far Maghreb, Best Actor award at the same festival, and the film opened the Digital Films Festival in Paris, and it has been shown in Montreal, New Delhi, Oman and the Maghreb.. It will also be shown at the Carthage Film Festival as part of the panorama that follows the selection of "Man's Word" by Moez Kamoun and "Gate of the Throne" by Mukhtar Lajimi to represent Tunisia in the official competition, and these are two first movies by ambitious directors, and I hope that they win the challenge and accomplish an important contribution to Tunisian cinema.

The portal will also contain a litigant's guide which will define rights, procedures and services, in addition to such legal services such as asking for advice and literature at a distance and receiving some certificates. It will also include the most important legal and regulatory texts pertaining to the law and human rights, in addition to legal publications of various kinds. The service of enabling the citizen to obtain legal services at a distance will have numerous advantages to the latter, who will avoid long lines and crowds, will have easier access to the information at any time he wishes and without the constraints of administrative work hours. The litigant will be able to find out the date of publication of the case, the time of the session, outcome of the case, and the date of typing. He will also be able to obtain, at a distance and without having to physically go to the courts, a certificate of case publication, a certificate of objection to a compulsory order, a certificate of appeal or cassation, a certificate of penal judgment, a certificate of delay in execution of penal judgment and a notification of judgment by the real estate court.
Electoral Program. The Progressive Democratic Party is currently busy drafting its electoral program to be adopted for the electoral campaign.. The party's central committee had long discussed the aspects and details of this program.. It is not unlikely that the announcement of the program will take place at a press conference to be held by the Secretary General of the party, Mr. Nejib Chebbi.
The "Democratic Initiative" is the fourth party that is competing in all electoral districts, alongside the Democratic Constitutional Rally Party, the Movement of Socialist Democrats and the Popular Unity Party.
The first meeting will take place in Tunis, while the second will be in Sfax, the two provinces in which Bouchiha will launch and conclude his electoral campaign.
The leadership of the Movement of Socialist Democrats has decided to organize a meeting of the heads of electoral lists this coming Sunday to discuss the strategy of launching the electoral campaign for the upcoming electoral eligibility in the legislative elections.
Toward an improvement in the services of the electronic site for remote registration and a special site soon for university services
Difficulties
It is expected that improvements and new additions will be made to the services offered by the site in the future, as well as broadening it to include other services. Work may also be completed during next year to simplify the registration process at the universities, and this will be carried out with the adoption of the practice of sending the documents necessary for registration by mail with payment of registration fees with electronic dinars.
However and in parallel with the spread of the use of modern technologies in administrative and service systems at all university institutions, more serious attention must be given to securing the ongoing training of administrative personnel at these institutions in the Internet, informatics and modern technologies. This will help avoid difficulties similar to those encountered by some students with their remote registration and which were caused by a lack of training and knowledge on the part of some administrators, so that the interests of the students do not suffer as a result, nor the process of modernizing the communications systems in the national university sector.

One Of The Two Former Italian Female Hostages:
Early reports indicate that the two hostages were not mistreated by their captors and that they convinced their captors that they were not Western spies but that they worked to help the Iraqis.
The two former hostages also said that the kidnappers did not have a list or photos of the workers in their organization.
"We were sometimes afraid that we would be killed, but at other times we would laugh, thanks to our strong will", said Simona Torretta.
For his part, Maurizio Celli, of the Italian Red Cross, said that the hostages had gotten the two robes they were wearing on their release from their captors...
In contrast, "L'Europa Blicca" said, "They have returned to us", and the "Il Tempo" said, "We only say, "Thank you".
Baghdad (News agencies) - The Frenchman Philippe Brett, who presents himself as a mediator in the issue of the two French hostages, again reiterated yesterday that the release of the journalists who are held in Iraq is "a done deal" and that the execution of the deal is awaiting an American authorization "to secure an air corridor" for their transport.
Meanwhile, the satellite channel "Al-Arabiyah" had announced in an interview with Brett Tuesday evening that the latter had met the two Frenchmen and reached an agreement with the kidnappers for their release.
A videotape of the British hostage
Bigley said that the kidnappers "do not want to kill me" according to the television channel's translation of Bigley's words on the tape.
The British engineer Bigley (62 years old) was kidnapped on September 16 by the Unity and Jihad Group from the neighborhood of Al-Mansour in the center of the Iraqi capital along with two American colleagues who were later successively slaughtered last Monday and Tuesday.
The two women approached the photographers and journalists who were waiting for them and said, "We are fine", before heading to the VIP lounge of the airport where they were met by a large number of political figures.
Sana'a (News Agencies) - The Sana'a criminal court yesterday condemned to death two of the six individuals accused in the affair of the American destroyer Cole. The death sentence against Abd Al-Rahim Al-Nashiri was issued in absentia as he is in custody in the United States, according to an Agence France Press reporter.
He issued prison sentences against the other four accused ranging from five to ten years.
The court session was attended by the relatives of the accused who immediately said that they will appeal the judgment.
Al-Nashiri, who is considered the mastermind behind the attack and a Saudi of Yemeni origin, was arrested in October 2002 in the United Arab Emirates. He is believed to be linked to the two attacks against the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August of 1998 (224 killed).
Nouakchott (News Agencies) - The Mauritanian Interior Minister, Ghali Ould Cherif Ahmed, announced the day before yesterday that the Mauritanian authorities have "thwarted a coup attempt" and seized weapons that were to be used in carrying out "a criminal plan".
The Interior Minister of Mauritania also indicated that the other official in the coup attempt, the fugitive Major Saleh Ould Hanena who is being actively sought, entered Mauritania with Abderrahman Ould Mini with forged documents issued to them by Mali under the names of Diko Ali and Ould Mini who are supposedly from the region of Kayes (western Mali) and from Senegal.

Second Operator of Digital Mobile Phone Services:
In response to questions by reporters, particularly on prices of calls which are relatively high on the Tunisiana network compared with some of the rates offered by the same company in other African countries, the general director of the company asserted that the quality of the services, the  advertising and the labor costs in terms of engineers and technicians in Tunisia are different from what they are in other countries. Moreover, the cost of quality imposes a specific price and the company is still in the stage of increasing the rate of coverage of the network.
Subscribers to Tunisiana's services are now about 880,000, and this number will reach 1 million subscribers by the end of 2004. It is expected that it will reach 1.5 million by 2006. Also, the rate of coverage of the network is estimated at this time to be about 95% and this is expected to reach 99% by the end of May 2005.
Tunis - As-Sabah. More than 3,000 taxi service cars in the capital alone. Licenses continue to increase noticeably annually.
Investigative reporting and photography: Naima Ouiachaoui - Moufida Kizani
Some of them move about between the roads and the streets looking for passengers, while others deal through "brokers" who specialize in recruiting passengers.
And by the narrow and uncomfortable spaces that drove them into the streets and roads, and by the lack of business opportunities that have become worse than before and that are hurting those who carry old professional cards and have clean consciences and who will not be pushed into committing violations.
Does that mean that there are more than 300 on the roads and the streets?
They are here and there.. Italy Road.. Carthage Street.. And each one tries his best to bring in passengers. No entry or exit permits, and no respect for  waiting line.. Another section is expected to be added to this station, at the expense of the Ministry of Transportation and the Municipality. But so far it is as it is and there is nothing new to it..
The passenger compartment has also increased in size. In the past, a car could handle no more than 5 passengers, whereas today the larger cars can handle 8 seats."
Car Owners
Mr. Arbi Faridi wonders angrily, "The issue has become complicated and the "bandits" have hurt the sector. The station owner says the street is not part of the station , and the security agents insist, in the face of the mounting problems, that their primary function is to provide security inside the station. Then who is responsible for the "bandits" ...?" And Arbi adds, "Giving of priority has also become a subject of debate.. and we don't know how the process works. The whole thing is chaotic and we are the victims. The sector has become the turf of those with powerful muscles. As for whoever is like me, they have to sleep in their cars an entire day waiting their turn which may never come".
The car owners consider themselves to have suffered the most, since any infraction against the decision can cost them a 320-dinar ticket.
This point was raised by Mr. Youssef Ben Abdellah who added, "This decision does not serve the interests of the customer, nor does it serve ours. We hope for a review of this decision so as to make it in the interests of the Tunisian citizen."

Coming Soon
Working session with the Tunisian Solidarity Bank.
It appears that two courtesy visits to each of the Sfax and Sousse Bar Associations are intended for the same purpose, which is to hold two joint lectures in each of Sfax and Sousse.
The Carthage Film Festival, which opens its proceedings tonight at the Menzah Palace Covered Stadium is not an ordinary cultural demonstration. It is rather an international festival that is always able to put Tunisia in the spotlight of every part of the world because of its serious character, its cultural depth and its artistic dimensions that strive to serve the seventh art in the Arab and African countries, in addition to its receptivity to the entire range of cinematic experiences.
The festival was founded at a time when there was no cinema in the Arab and African countries except for the cinema in Egypt, which was able to establish a movie industry early on, in addition to some experiments in Lebanon.
This dominating pole has no interest in anything except the dissemination of the commercial artistic mold that is packaged to suit its own interests, leaving others only to consume...
And a large number of directors and movie stars from among those who won the Tanit awards will attend...
So welcome to all of them and let us all work to make this festival a success...

20 Jewish Extremists Carry Out Armed Attack on a Bookstore in Paris
The radio station also said that the Jewish extremists sought revenge against Alain Soral for his defense of the Palestinian cause in French newspapers and on television stations.
Early Signs Of New Crisis:
A new political crisis has erupted between President Arafat and his Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei on cabinet changes and the demoting of senior ministers, and Fatah members of Parliament have threatened withdrawing confidence from his government and taking steps leading to a vote on withdrawing confidence and to the ousting of the government.
Since the last crisis erupted at the end of last month, Qurei had given Arafat five weeks, ending this week, to comply with his demands.
Influential members of Parliament from the Fatah Movement have threatened to withdraw confidence from the government if their demands are not met by the deadline of next October 7.
A 24-year old young man has put an end to his life on the morning of the day before yesterday, Wednesday, inside his parents' home located in the Khadra' neighborhood in the city of Kasserine. One of his relatives discovered the tragedy after the fact and began screaming.
However, other information indicates that the deceased could have indeed experienced a psychological crisis which affected his stability before committing suicide and, yet in spite of that, he apparently tried to hide his condition. He then seemed to care about nothing but to escape from life, and obsessions about this decision began dominating his thinking until he decided to carry out that decision.
In International Waters
Available information revealed that the Navy patrol was monitoring marine traffic and guarding the Tunisian territorial waters under its jurisdiction when the radar detected a speed boat in an area in the international waters.

Using the electronic commerce system has also become possible in a number of fields, for mail and education and even for the purchase at distance of products using the electronic dinar. These are fields in which the developed countries have made great strides because the modern era is the era of modern technology and scientific and technical progress in  all fields.
Other data suggest that 67% do not see electronic commerce as compatible with purchasing products at distance and 77% do not see room for this type of transaction in tourism and health services.
Echoes Of the Elections
The speech by the Secretary General at the Jendouba meeting centered on the commitment of the party to a path of plurality, democracy and transparency.

Tunis - As-Sabah. The Tunisian consumer is wondering about the reason for the sharp increase in the prices of fish of all sizes and types despite stable weather conditions. The consumer's surprise and bewilderment are even greater when the prices of medium and ordinary types of fish like sabaris, mankous, mackerel and red sea bream (shelba) exceed ten dinars per kilogram.
We can find the answer to this question in the random exploitation of fish resources and the lack of compliance by many sailors with the designated seasons for fishing one type of fish and not others.
It is quite obvious that fishing operations will lead to a depletion of fish reserves since quantities caught from the reserves differ in size according to the capacity of the reserves and the effort exerted during the fishing operation. The reduction in the number of fish that are caught and in the available production coming from fisheries of many countries is attributed to the growth of the effort characterized by chaos and turbulence that are not compatible with the capacity of the reserves and their productivity.
Najib Al-Louz
The contents of the agreement
On the economic level, this agreement will create great opportunities of cooperation between the two countries, particularly in upgrading Turkish investments in Tunisia, and creating opportunities for multinational firms with Tunisia serving as a launching pad towards the African continent.

Return to Falluja:
According to press correspondents in Iraq, five Iraqis were killed yesterday and 20 others were injured in the city of Samarra north of Baghdad as a result of the non-stop ongoing US military operations against the city.
US forces had announced yesterday that they had killed 109 armed individuals during the operation they launched against the city, and that one US soldier was also killed and four others injured.
In Falluja itself, US air strikes on the city late last night killed 7 and injured 12 others.
In terms of its casualties, the US Army announced the death of one of its soldiers in Baghdad two nights ago, and later announced that five others were injured in several attacks in various parts of Iraq.
The Palestinian government declares "state of emergency" throughout all the occupied territories.
The sources added that the martyrs were preparing to carry out an attack on an Israeli town in the area when they were detected and eliminated by occupation soldiers. The sources indicated that machine guns were found near the four bodies and that the martyrs were wearing explosive belts and bullet-proof vests.
Clashes and house demolitions
The Committees of the Popular Resistance had called on the citizens to burn automobile tires, fuel and plastic materials in order to interfere with the reconnaissance planes and helicopter gun ships trying to assassinate the resistors.
After an emergency meeting of the Palestinian government yesterday at Arafat's headquarters in Ramallah in the West Bank, the Palestinian President accused the occupation army of using internationally banned weapons against the Palestinians in the north of the Gaza Strip.
The same source added that Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei had decided to cancel a trip scheduled to take him to Russia and Turkey in order to participate yesterday in the emergency meeting of the government.
The Palestinian official expressed his regrets about what he described as "the position of the international community that did not rise up to the level required for dealing with the situation in Gaza".
Allentown (United States) (News Agencies) - American President George Bush charged his democratic opponent John Kerry the day before yesterday that he will allow France to decide when Washington can use force to defend itself.
A day after Kerry declared that the United States has to pass an "international test" before waging any preventive war, Bush told his supporters that "the use of forces to defend America must not ever be subjected to the vote of countries like France".
With these statements that he made last night, Kerry gave Bush new ammunition to bolster his accusations against him that he will not be decisive in defending the United States, even though he did say that he will not hesitate to act unilaterally if necessary.
It is known that democratic candidate John Kerry came out victorious in the first televised debate with his republican opponent, President George Bush, who appeared uneasy after the former forced him into his Iraqi predicament and made him resort to defending his policies in Iraq.
From our correspondent: Aisha Ben Mahmoud
Based on my observation, I concluded that the greater importance of these places  resides also in how they attract a large number of visitors, foreigners or Americans, and in the positive impact this has on the US economy, given that revenues for this tourism benefit successive generations of Americans over the long term. In contrast, the level of precision in displaying the "historic" landmarks and sites and the exaggeration in narrating the details for the purpose of weaving a historical and objective story may not apply to other sites that have a connection with the "dominating" Jewish lobby according to the testimony of many whom we met in the context of a program from  the State Department designated to benefit of a group of Arab reporters specializing in business and economics.
This incident confirmed my impression of the "heavy" weight that the Jews have in the United States, so much so that one of the prominent editors at the Chicago Tribune expressed openly that he prefers not to delve into a discussion on the extent of the Jewish lobby's control and their influence on the orientation of the newspaper, justifying this attitude by jokingly saying "I want to preserve my job and my livelihood!
Keeping in mind that their number is about three times the number of Arab Americans (3.1 million people).
An elderly man in his early ninth decade died in the last few days in Manzil Tamim on his arrival to the local hospital as a result of severe pain that afflicted his abdomen.
Additional information revealed that the elderly man apparently became hysterically angry, which affected his psychological balance and he decided to end his life.
She impersonated a maid to sneak into homes.
The last case involved the theft of jewelry from the house of a lady who left the door of her house opened as she went to the market, which the accused noticed before entering inside the house and stealing the jewelry and some money.  As she was running away, her bad luck had her come face to face with the owner of the house who asked her what she was doing at the door of her house, to which she gave her usual reply that she was looking for work.
Provincial investigators of the National Guard in Sidi Bu Zayd discovered this week the identities of the perpetrators who committed the robbery operation which targeted the fuel supply station located in the area of Souk Jedid.
He further said that he noticed that the customers were surrounding him from all sides while he was filling up their car with gasoline, then they restrained his movements and tied him up with ropes. They forced him into their car, which sped towards the outskirts of town where the kidnappers got rid of him before returning to the gas station to steal a important financial sum from the safe as well as a television.
The body is for the husband... but the heart is for "the other"
The wife then enters into a whirlpool of family life that may appear to others as calm and stable in the protection of husband and children when in fact she is controlled by frigid and lukewarm feelings. And as much as a number of factors accumulate and lead to this situation and prevent love from continuing, there are also other reasons that lead a large number of these wives to run away from the ideal solution for such situations, which is divorce, and instead to prefer to keep the appearance of a married relationship in the eyes of society.
Numerous reasons and multiple motives
Mrs. Zainab, on the other hand, was more courageous when she spoke, saying: "When I felt that love was turning lukewarm and every flame of feeling was going out, especially with my husband who gave no value to women's feelings, and then I am the opposite to what he wants, I decided to act according to the saying, "The body is for the husband and the heart is for another," because I, as a woman, look for a man who understands me and listens to me. This is the situation of many women, and the latter man could be a colleague at work or a close friend, and the relationship does not necessarily go further with him".
Tunis - The Weekly. The bank card is considered one of the most important personal documents that many of us depend on to conduct our business in the fastest possible time, given what this card provides its owner in withdrawing his salary or weekly allowance or the sums of money he needs either in ordinary circumstances or in emergencies. So much that standing in front of the automatic dispensers of banking institutions has become a refuge to many, especially employees, from waiting in lines at banks, particularly on the first of the month when most branches become crowded since most of them do not use the take-a-number ticket dispenser used in other service institutions to organize priorities in line. Still, the cardholder is often disappointed when he stands in front of the dispenser and is unable to withdraw the requested amount because of a technical failure in the dispensing machine or some other cause for which the man speaking on behalf of the dispenser requests of you in all kindness and eloquence.
Services that are also missing in some dispensers are the instantaneous balance statements following each withdrawal activity, which allows the person to control his accounts and know how much money remains in his balance and the number of withdrawal activities he carried out during a month or a week, particularly considering that many citizens are surprised by the fees charged for services in the periodic statements that financial institutions send by mail.
40 thousand tons of potato reserves
Pears have witnessed also an increase in production that reached nearly 62 thousand tons, while the harvest of pomegranates is estimated at 66 thousand tons. The month of fasting coincides with the availability of about 10 thousand tons of grapes, while the harvest of dates is expected to rise from 115 thousand tons to 122 thousand tons this year, except that their production falls toward the end the month of fasting. Two hundred tons of citrus fruits have been stored to meet the needs of the market and efforts are ongoing to store another 100 tons.
With all these quantities of food products available, there is no reason for fear and worry, and families should observe their financial circumstances especially after just being exhausted from the beginning of the school year and looking ahead to Eid Al Fitr after Ramadan.
Tunis - The Weekly: It seems that the era of black eyes is forever gone and a thing of the past, along with the time of the fathers and ancestors when those eyes were a symbol of beauty and Eastern charm. Perhaps, they accepted their lot and were content with black color because they had no alternative except for those whom God endowed with green, blue, gray or honey-colored eyes. Now that the criteria for looking at beauty has changed and the possibilities have become readily available in many ways to alter reality, not to say falsify it in the same way that show artists and movie stars do and greet us every day with a new "look", this infectious trend has hit our society and the ranks of our young girls and women who use colored contact lenses to look like Nancy Ajram and Haifa Wehbe ,even though these lenses were used in the past to get rid of natural defects by those who were fed up with wearing medical eyeglasses because of a defect in the eye function.
Strange question to ask about the reasons for wearing these lenses, that is how Mariam, a third year secondary school student, expressed her surprise for posing this question, saying, these things are time-worn and have become so ordinary that they are no longer the monopoly of a certain class. Today, in the stores that specialize in selling eyeglasses there are many kinds of lenses and at various prices, which allow everyone to try this experience, especially since the age requirements dictate that. Everyone nowadays runs after a good renewable appearance, and that is not the monopoly of today's girls. In the sixties too, there was a fashion for wearing hats and artificial hair and no one criticized that. Why then do we take issue with today's girls for imitating women artists and taking excessive care with their appearance and loving colored eyes? In addition, changing one's hairstyle is relaxing and "changing one's eyes" is too!
Movie Director Taieb Louhichi In A Special statement To "The Weekly":
And for the lead actors for this anticipated movie, Taieb Louhichi says I am seriously thinking about Lamine Nahdi and Fatima Ben Saidane and Hend Sabri and Mohamed Qorei.
Erakat Warns Of "More Violence, Extremism And Chaos":
The press correspondents specified that the helicopter gun ships of the occupation, in the latest raid they carried out yesterday afternoon, fired two rockets on an a gathering of Palestinian citizens in Beit Hanoun, resulting in the martyrdom of three Palestinians.
With this, the number of victims of massacres committed by Israeli occupation forces since last Tuesday under the name of "Days of Penitence" rises to 68 martyrs and hundreds of wounded, most of them defenseless Palestinian civilians.
Sharon also asserted the "need to widen the areas of operations to push away the rocket launchers from areas that fall within firing distance of Israeli towns".
In response to the statement by the Israeli Prime Minister that the large scale operation against northern Gaza will continue, and for which he expressed his satisfaction, Erakat said "that the Israeli military operation in the northern Gaza Strip will lead to more violence, extremism, chaos and bloodshed", asserting that "the Palestinian issue will not be solved by military means or by war crimes or by state terrorism."

Iraqi families refuse to vaccinate their children against polio.
For his part, Dr. Neemat Said, General Director of the Department of Health and Primary Care, said: "We have acted at the level of the National Council to confirm the validity and safety of vaccines imported from certified sources and from high-standing, reputable companies".
He added that "the issue of considering American vaccines has been one of the most important obstacles to our work, since maximum benefit from the vaccine has not been obtained, and the other strange thing is the presence of groups who are instigating citizens not to use and vaccinate their children because the vaccine is donated by an occupying country.  This is what ensures that they don't take it".
Seoul (News Agencies) - Statements by the second in command in the "Al-Qaeda" organization, Ayman Al-Zawahiri, that were aired two days ago by the Qatari satellite television channel "Al-Jazeera" have led South Korea, Norway, Australia and other countries to raise the state of alert in their security circles for fear of attacks reaching them.
The Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) said that raising the level of alert is connected with national interests inside Norway, whereas the threat against the Norwegian national interests outside the country remained unchanged.
A week away from federal elections which will take place in the country, Downer rejected the opposition's accusations of turning Australia into a principal target for extremists after Prime Minister John Howard offered major support to the American president in the invasion of Iraq.
Brussels: (News Agencies) -  Left-wing Green Party members of the Dutch Parliament presented a request to question the two Ministers of the Interior and Justice to obtain clarifications on the conditions surrounding the arrest of a Moroccan family last Sunday in the city of Utrecht for suspicions of their relationship to terrorism, their release two days later, and the behavior of the security apparatus conducted during the house storming operation, according to what a Dutch Parliament source mentioned the day before yesterday.
Meanwhile, the female attorney of the Moroccan family said that the investigations conducted with the family members, the father, mother and son, revealed the existence of a possible suspicion of a connection of the family to terrorism through the relationship of the son, who had worked at the Amsterdam airport, with one of his former colleagues, and that the mother listened during the investigation about the transportation and concealment operation of a black suitcase filled with explosives that she knew nothing about.

35 others were also wounded yesterday in acts of violence in Assam.
Fred Eckhart, his spokesman, said the day before yesterday that "the Secretary General was shocked and dismayed at the attacks and the exchange of fire in places where people are densely gathered in the states of Nagaland and Assam in India and which led to the death of many people".
And as preparations were underway for the funerals of the victims in the churches of the state with a Christian majority, G.
The group denied any involvement in the acts of violence.
More than fifty thousand people have died in the northeast of India since the rebellion movement began about sixty years ago.
Security agents have been able over the past few days to determine the identities of the perpetrators of a kidnapping and assault of a young girl that took place in one of the provinces of Manouba and later succeeded in arresting three of them while one of them managed to escape.
While things were quite ordinary in the beginning, what happened subsequently muddied their serenity when the two friends were surprised by the four perverts who showed up bluntly saying from the start their reasons for showing up there.
Based on these data, the investigators intensified their investigations until they arrested three of the suspects for their relationship to the case, while the fourth one escaped and efforts are underway to arrest him.
Provincial agents of the national security services arrested a young man in Mahdia with a judicial record after his involvement in a case of corruption of a minor under the age of 12 and in the attempt to assault him in a lewd act.
In spite of the fear that took over the student, he gathered his strength and began screaming and as the pervert was attempting to assault him, the neighbors heard the child's screams and they arrived on the scene forcing the drunk to leave and flee.
An attorney's clerk assaults an attorney
If this incident seems ordinary for some, especially that violence is a behavior that can happen to anyone, attorneys in particular were not about to forget this incident. Their opinions differed about the incident and eyewitness accounts were contradictory. Similarly, many attorneys' clerks expressed their sympathy and "solidarity" with their colleague who stands accused of assaulting the senior attorney and they held a sit-in in the hall of the court and expressed their anger in their own way!

The National Guard personnel for the Jahawiyah district area in Sidi Bu Zayd had arrested the suspect after 13 hours of efforts and attempts to prevent what he threatened to do i.e. commit suicide after he claimed he was wronged.
Some of the passersby rushed towards him to convince him to change his mind but he insisted - without executing the threat(!
To close his investigation, he was referred to the judicial authority to continue the investigation before taking him to trial regarding the alleged accusations.
The circumstances for the case which security authorities in the city of Genoa investigated are very dormant. The case states that a Tunisian young man met a young Italian woman by virtue of his job at a hotel. After their relationship got stronger, he asked her to help him arrive in Italy especially considering that the idea had been on his mind for years and that the chance has now come. Without much further thought, an idea crossed her mind to carry him with her in her vehicle, especially that the legal routes were closed. After they agreed about the solution she suggested, he informed his parents of his determination. Shortly before their arrival to the port, she fastened the trunk and put some things and presents to mislead the overseers. Instead of getting him out after crossing the borders and the trip on the boat she left him as is for about 36 hours until she crossed her country's territorial waters. It was then that she opened the trunk and found him a dead corpse starting to rot. She called the security authorities in Genoa right away and informed them of the story as we mentioned. Hence the dreams of the young man evaporated. He left behind a moral for his peers who don't calculate the results in such situations and throw themselves into the unknown in hope of accumulating wealth and exiting the circle of poverty and unemployment.
22 dead, 42 missing.
The sailing passengers were surprised by the smashing of their boat one hour after starting the secret journey. We learned that the boat was divided into two parts and sank to the bottom. 64 persons on board drowned, 11 more (one of whom was Tunisian) kept fighting the waves until their incident was spotted.
We learned, on the other hand, from a reliable source that approximately 280 other Moroccans from the far west have legally entered our country and settled in the cities of Shatt Miriam Coast, its surroundings, Hammamet and Tunis in preparation for the secret boat trips.
Sabir Mukashir
Because of the importance of this information, it was given the necessary attention by the judicial police squad of investigators at the national security forces in Hammamet. A well organized tight ambush was set for those illegal immigrants after requesting security reinforcement.
Sabir M.
Through intense exploration and marathon investigations, it was revealed that the customers of the mentioned hostel are 280 Moroccans who have come to our country within the past few days to participate in illegal journeys heading towards the Italian land.
The fate of 59 others is still unknown while explorations are under way to decide their whereabouts, especially given that the group of 280 Moroccans entered our country illegally to take part in a clandestine sea journey.

The minister stressed the need for follow-up and conection with the markets so that the data on prices in use on bulk markets are reflected in retail prices. He called for adopting an appropriate system of supervision, alertness and follow-up so that actions can be taken to stand up to any damage that might take place in any of the supply steps. He said: "Our slogan for this year focuses on creating a normal and natural supply situation in all areas and not just in the provincial centers. This situation requires seeking to take all precautions during the ten-day period that precedes Ramadan."
Private College Housing
Illegal competition
The competition is illegal but it cannot be curtailed without the students' awareness. Last year I suffered financial difficulties because of this, in addition to receiving an emergency aid offered by the University Services Bureau, one female student was entitled to a bed in the government housing in the middle of the year, and she left without being obligated to pay the rest of her dues. This is at a time when I have to pay the bills for water, electricity, taxes, etc. I suggest that the University Services Bureau investigates the status of some female students residing in the private housing. We invested in this field because we are aware of the importance of encouraging education in our country, but reject the loss.  The housing I own is fully equipped. Cooking utensils and water heating, home heating facility, in addition to a mixed cafe affiliated with the housing. I even thought of the disabled student and assigned a wing for him that suits his circumstances and special needs.
It is worth mentioning that many owners have refused to talk to us about the problem of college private housing.
Tunis- Al-Sabah: In an attempt to overcome the problem, the Ministry of Employment has focused on the numerous shortages suffered by the professional vocational sector, with the aim of improving the productivity of this sector, that yearly attracts thousands of young people dropping out of school. The latest national report about development summarized these deficiencies, claiming poor use of the currently available workforce, and the lack of technologically and pedagogically qualified people who could implement the new training plan. This applies especially to the tourism sector, leather and shoe manufacturing, manufacturing maintenance, and traditional manufacturing. There is also a difficulty of putting the training into practice in businesses, according to the descriptions set for it, and poor attendance in private vocational training.
According to the assessment, it was revealed that the percentage of graduates of the vocational training centers integrated into the workplace, based on the Tunisian Agency for Vocational Training, has reached 78% for the year of 1998 in comparison to 62% of the graduates of year 1996. The estimation of graduates integrated in the sectors of centers for 2001 is approximately 76.4%.

A program of unusual improvements in the area of cleanliness and environmental care has started to be implemented. This program will carry on to the end of next November. It will include minding city entrances, streets, main roads, underprivileged neighborhoods, weeding, painting and cleaning the curbs of streets, intersections and facades, and pick up sand and all litter.
Some of the market shopkeepers and merchants do not master the art of trading as one finds them always frowning in the customers' faces.
An improvement is expected on supply of fish and seafood during the month of Ramadan which coincides with the time of affluent production.
The movie "In the Empty City" which is the first work for the Angolan director "Maria Joao Ganga" enters the official competition for the Carthage Film Festival. The film does not belong to the war movie category, but the war prevails in all of the events
The first scene in the movie uncovers that tragedy. The children were transported on board of a military plane that transported soldiers. It also carried a coffin.
Most of the movie's events were centered on this child who slipped into a big, vast and mysterious city. We follow his surprise and spontaneity in dealing with people.
Streets are crowded with homeless children that are employed in smuggling goods and promoting them. Streets are also crowded with gangs, violent acts and terror which the director only alluded.
The ocean was an outlet for "Indala", the child, his adolescent friend, "Zee", as well as the city's children and residents.
The director Maria launches off her first long cinematographic work with this movie uncovering thereby her sensitivity. Her work was free from claims. With an obvious dismissal of special and fancy effects, she chose to present a painful story but without falling for the trap of instigating emotions. Still, she succeeded in creating spontaneous sympathy with the film's characters and paying attention to the tragedy of a nation whose first victims were, for the most part, children.
8 more martyrs with one child and a young girl among them.
For details, a Palestinian medical source announced that the child Lu'ay Najjar (4 years old) from the Khuza'ah village east of Khan Yunis "was killed by the fire of the invading Israeli army penetrating east of the village. A bullet hit him in the head while standing in front of his house".
Mr. Mushir al-Masri, Hamas's spokesperson, confirmed that all 4 martyrs are members of the Qassam battalion, Hamas's military wing, and that his brother, Faris al-Masri, a field leader, was among them.
In spite of the international to Israel to stop its aggression against the Palestinians, the Israeli army chief of staff, Moshe Yaalon announced that the operation in Gaza Strip will continue for weeks-not days.

The Sunnite board of Islamic Scholars considered that American forces committed a massacre in the cities of Samarra and Falluja.
He ended by saying: "When we feel that the Iraqi public is targeted in its religion and its honor then we are left with nothing but to declare the Greater Jihad. But it is early now and each situation has its own reaction."
The US Army confirms that 10 or 15 fighters suspected of their relationship with al-Zarqawi (who tops the wanted list) were in the place when the explosion took place.
On his part, the US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said that the danger in Iraq does not lie in the eruption of a civil war but rather in this country falling in the hands of extremists that "behead people".
The British hostage may have been handed over to another Iraqi group according to his brother.
The armed man said in that one-minute tape which was dated the 2nd of this month that Iyad Anwar Wali (44), a Turkish Iraqi with an Italian nationality and the Turkish Yalmaz Dabjah are working for the Mosad, the Iranaian and Turkish Intelligence agencies".

A unit was established to follow, oversee and coordinate and a leading team, comprised of members of several ministries concerned with these projects. The enterprises planned for the technology hubs have been appointed and an initial implementation model was prepared to set up the hubs of Sidi Thabet, Sousse and Sfax and to decide on the operating programs of the research labs in the hubs of both Sousse and Sfax.
As for the business incubators, data from the Ministry of Higher Education and Technology gives information about the creation of 6 incubators in Sfax, Nabeul, Gabes, Gafsa, Sousse and Rades. One incubator is being equipped in Kairouan and 6 incubators are established in Jerba, Mahdia, Kasr Hilal, Kef and Jendouba, in addition to 2 business incubators for the agricultural sector and 1 is already in operation. These incubators undertake 48 projects, six of them in the agricultural sector and 9 in technology hubs.
Tunis- As-Sabah: The security units of the National Guard for the two regional areas of Sousse and Monastir, the National Guard in Nabeul's region, the National Navy, the Civil Force Protection and a military helicopter, all, carried on search operations for the 42 people who went missing in the tragedy that took place in the Tunisian territorial waters. This happened last Sunday, across from the coast of Shatt Mariam city (170 km. South East of the capital) in the Sousse county.
In addition, there is another native person from Sidi Bu Zayd who turned out to be the trafficker for this illegal journey.
Sabir Al-Mukshar
The crew arrested 7 illegal immigrants and confiscated a speed boat, a marine motor and a number of plastic containers full of petrol.
The initial data revealed that the 7 boat passengers came from the capitals precincts. They made a deal with a trafficker native to the Menzel Salem area in El-Hawarriya to smuggle them. They gave him money and agreed to a departure time.
Tunis- As-Sabah. On an other hand, we learned that a mobile unit belonging to the national military informed its Italian counterpart of the presence of African infiltrators on board a ship which stayed positioned south of the island Lampedusa.  The Italian coastguard headed towards the place referenced.
It is worth pointing out that hundreds of Africans were arrested during the months of September and October by the National Tunisian Navy or the Italian Coast Guard in the international sea waters while they were on their way to the island of Lampedusa after their participation in illegal trips which usually originate from the coasts of a neighboring country.
Sabir al-Mukashir
The new law dictates a number of changes in the old law's articles as well as additions of new articles that will develop and expand the fund's responsibilities according to the government's policy in that field.
Mr. Muhammad Bajiyah stated that since the official issuance of this new law last August the interests of the Ministry of Housing and Infrastructure have been devoted to the preparation of practical provisions based on the composition of the budget law for 2005 and its potential provisions.
The national fund for residence improvement used to get involved in two kinds of transactions having to do with housing: individual transactions in the form of facilitating the execution of private and public sector works, or more general transactions in the form of financing what public local groups do rather than estate owners or builders of public housing.
Mr. Muhammad Bajiyah pointed out that the new law has preserved some of the goals entrusted to the previous one regarding financing businesses carried out by individuals to contract and reconstruct their houses and the necessary utilities. It expanded on its intervention areas to cater to the new situation's requirements and keep up with the developments that were previously mentioned, as well as fulfill the needs of old buildings and unexpected events by developing its participation means at a multitude of levels most notably:
Financing constructional rehabilitation and renovation which the government contracts to entities specialized in the field of constructional refinement and renovation as part of the support of the government's efforts and local groups in saving the old, existing housing structures and improving the living situation for co-habitants especially those with limited income.
The Arrest Of 9 Illegal Immigrants In Salakta
The documents of the incident showed that a night patrol group of the National Guard of Salakta headed toward the coast to guard it especially given that it is considered to be a strategic location for the take off of illegal trips.
They landed in the area using public transportation.
Tunis- As-Sabah. The day before yesterday, presidential help for small farmers in particular, and the farming sector in general, was renewed. New steps to add to previously implemented measures were announced. These measures are to complement those previously taken to ensure a good start for the following season, and encourage producers, especially the small-scale ones, to work harder and ensure the efficient use of their limited farming space. That will increase crop production and contribute to the national efforts for self-sufficiency.
In this paper, Mr. Abdallah Mallak, the general manager of supply, investment and professional organizations in the Ministry of Agriculture, Environment, and Water Resources, gave us several additional details regarding the measure to offer assistance in the form of seeds to small farmers.
To help the owners of affected hectares of land areas, it was decided to offer assistance in the form of seeds to benefit 8,500 small farmers. The formula was to give 1.5 quintals per affected hectare of land. That will amount to 38,500,000 quintals of solid wheat seeds in aid, amounting to 1 billion and 700 thousand dinars. That is to ensure the opportunity for a new start for those affected farmers.
Solid wheat seeds: 43 dinars per quintal
As our need for good seeds approximates 185 thousand quintals, the burden sustained by the government to subsidize the seeds will amount to 1 billion and 500 thousand dinars.

The national air carrier, "Tunisian Airlines", together with a number of French travel agents have put a schedule for connecting Paris with Tozeur. There will be 5 flights a week which will also connect Lille, Marseille and Lyon with the same destination. The airline "Air Carthage" has also scheduled charter flights to connect Tozeur with France.
The average of water consumed by the Tunisian family is 500 liters. The total is used for showering and hygiene (150 l.), toilet sanitizing (25 l.), laundry (75 l.), dishwashing (50 l.), drinking and cooking (25 l.), watering the garden and washing the car (75 l.).

Third: at the level of job opportunities, this sector is able to attract many qualified individuals in various specialties. It also extends to other branch sectors, increasing therefore other job opportunities.
A promising product in need of more attention
Tunisia has the potential to be a suitable sphere for ecological tourism because of its natural possibilities starting with the mountains and the forest along with the sea and the desert, ending with the lake and preserve.
The United Nations and ecological tourism
According to the same spokesman who said that these paths are considered to be a primary nucleus expected to be widened and connected with the capital of coral, Tabarka, as a first step and then with Al-Faijah preserve in Ghardimao -  according to a presidential directive that was adopted during the meeting of the regional council of Jendouba province. - As a second step, while awaiting the completion of the fundamentals of the program in all its parts during the next 5 years which will start from Bizerte and end in Kef with Senan castle and Yougharta.
The Tunisian coast stretches for nearly 135 thousand[A1] kilometers. This stretch does not only include the swimming beaches known for their clear water and golden sand, but it also includes natural treasures which remain unexplored and unknown because they were classified as military sites, as is the case with Jalta Island (Bizerte) and the Islands of Zembara and Zembarta (tribal sectors) and some of the other coastal locations that are no less beautiful and environmentally rich like these islands.
Tunis - As-Sabah - The Tunisian cinema is specially represented in the "new wave" films that appeared in the early eighties through the films of Nouri Bouzid, Ferid Boughedir, Moncef Dhouib, Abdelatif Ben Ammar, and Moufida Tlatli. It can be placed under the title "Tunisian Cinema." Meanwhile, there are other Tunisian films that are directed by Tunisian directors who live permanently in European countries such as France and Belgium. They can be placed or listed under the under the title of "Incoming Tunisian Cinema." For instance, the movies of Kalthoum Bournaz, Nadia El-Fani, Raja Amari, Nacer Khemir, Jilani Saadi, or Mahmoud Ben Mahmoud are the type of "incoming films" and they represent on their own a cinematic "current" worthy of being singled out in research and reading because they represent "other" Tunisian cinematic voice that is somewhat "lost" and "coming back."
This is a rough summary of the film and it would have been possible for the film to be on a level of importance if it had dealt more seriously with the media reality but it left all that to deal with other cinematic details that seemed to be a kind of search for the folklore and excitement.
Is it possible, for example, for the Tunisian film watcher to believe that a Tunisian family nowadays might force one of its children who is educated and works as a journalist to get married?
The Egyptian Movie Producer Khalid Al Haggar
How was your beginning with cinematic filming?
It is my choice considering what these names could offer and guarantee as an important addition to the cinematic work.
Any influence from Youssef Chahine on Khalid Al-Haggar's movies?
"Girl's Love"
It is a new evaluation of love in our life.
I see that as a positive indicator.
I firmly believe as you too believe, that love is not only sex and nudity.
Nudity could be acceptable if it comes in the context of the events of the film.
I respect and appreciate Inas Al Degheidy's cinema experience and journey; on the other hand I lean towards the presentation she offers.
I know Hind Sabri and I appreciate a lot the genuine expression that she uses in handling her cinematic roles.
This is the first time I visit Tunis where I present my new film "Girl's Love" considering that in the previous festival only my film represented me.
Interview conducted by Mohsen Bin Ahmed
Cairo (FB)- The Palestinian president Yasser Arafat announced in an interview reported yesterday in the Arabic newspaper al-Sharq al-Awsat that he is willing to become the Nelson Mandela of Palestine provided a Palestinian State is set up.
Since December 2001, the United States and Israel decided to cut all communications with Yasser Arafat who was besieged in his headquarters in Ramallah of the West Bank.
He announced the planning of general Palestinian elections (presidential, parliamentary and municipal) in the spring of 2005, after it was postponed many times. And on the 4th of September, the preparations had started for the first round of elections in the West Bank along with the compilation of the candidates' lists.
President Arafat confessed that there is a dispute between him and his Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei around the subject of the meeting of the donor countries in New York.
He said that the communications are still going on and the latest was two days ago with the Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Abd Al-Aziz.
The officials had previously arrested on an earlier date 23 Italian dealers who formed a drug smuggling network which was found to work in coordination with the second network made up of 12 Tunisians and an Algerian who were arrested in the districts of "Ancona", "Pisa", "Camereno", "Bergamo" and "Chiaka."
Because of the danger of the matter, the agencies for fighting drugs in Italy gave it the necessary attention and carried out numerous investigations that led to the arrest of 10 immigrants of Tunisian origin.

Another Maritime Tragedy In The Tunisian Regional Waters.
Late in the night of the incident, 9 people set sail stealthily aboard a small boat no longer than 2.5-meter from the shores of Al-Mathleen in the province of Bizerte on their way to Sicily in southern Italy with the help of a young man from the province.
Regardless of that, they still fought the waves and the pain and continued swimming until they reached the shore safely.
The Burning Tragedy At Shatt Mariam's
In this context, a reliable source disclosed that the investigators of the administrative branch for criminal matters succeeded in discovering the identity of three people found to be intermediaries in the stealthy sailing operations that started from our shores and the latest one was the illegal trip that started off "Shatt Mariam" coast. The number of Tunisian intermediaries increased to four when regional investigators of the National Guard in Sidi Bu Zayd arrested the fourth in the last three days.
But his awareness of the security supervision of his movements made him diverge from his course to the city of Teboulba to obtain a "trawler" before he decided to take off with the illegal trip from the coast of Shatt Mariam. Furthermore, it seems that he prepared a second boat in Nabeul that he would use in smuggling 126 Moroccans but officials of the judicial police in Hammamet stopped this operation.
But the number of bodies pulled out was 25 as of yesterday Wednesday leaving the fate of 39 missing persons still unknown.

Administrative courts' judicial jurisprudence
Recently, and as a part of a summary of scientific studies that have been carried out in the past two years, 120 Tunisian scientific studies were selected for being applicable. We learned that these studies are varied and have to do with industrial, farming, and processing sectors.
So will an expansion of these schedules take place to meet the needs of the guardians?
The organizer clarified that the projects should be subject to specific conditions before they reach the implementation phase - they are imagination, feasibility study and search for financial resources.
It is worth mentioning that Tunisia still basically relies on European financing and World Bank financing. This explains to a certain extent the persistence of American organizations in marketing their financing tools to Tunisian markets.
The biggest American operation in southern Baghdad. During this period, more than three thousand American and Iraqi troops carried out a large operation in southwest Baghdad where at least 30 persons were arrested.
The Iraqi police announced the day before yesterday that armed individuals killed ten Iraqi persons by firing on their car in al-Latifiyah, which along with al-Mahmudiyyah, al-Iskandariyyah, al-Yusifiyyah, and Jarf al-Sakhr, has been known by the name of "death road."  All of these are south of Baghdad and are considered as an important stronghold for elements of armed resistance.
The official made it clear that the attack launched by unknown individuals from a car also led to injuring five militiamen of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (under the leadership of Jalal Talibani).

Since the launch of the Manufacturing Qualifications Program in Tunisia in 1996, the number of firms joining this program annually has been 300. The number of member firms till August 2004 was around 3,050. The reports showed that this program has contributed to the improvement of the economic indices of the firms that completed the qualifications program. Some of the improvements are:

In comparison, and  except the Arab Tunisian Bank (-1.80%), the rest of the depression was slight and included: Sotetel (-0.26%), the Cooling and Beer Company (-0.70%), Housing Bank (-0.43%), Emirates Bank (-0.19%) and Stil (-0.50%).
This productivity is considered to be low if compared to other developing countries like India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and other industrial countries. If one compared factories similar to the Tunisian ones, for example, one would find that productivity is 75 times the wage in the developing countries and 59 in the industrial countries. Therefore, wages are not a burden in these cases when compared with the volume of revenues able to cover this cost.
Some anonymous senior personalities of the Arab industry sector declared to "As-Sabah" that the productivity issue cannot be separated from the global environment in which a government believes that providing the infrastructure is part of the priorities. Thus, according to these personalities, "it is unreasonable that the worker in the Arab countries, for example, has to wait hours for transportation to go to work. And when it is available, it is crowded. So, how do we expect this worker to focus after the nightmare of transportation?."

The number of deaths since the beginning of the Intifada towards the end of September 2000 increased to 4,455 (3,427 Palestinians and 954 Israelis).
Despite the occupation's vicious attacks, the military branch of the resistance movement Hamas, "Izz Al-Din Al-Qassam", has vowed to continue firing rockets on Israel, even in the case of the Israeli army withdrawal.

Confirming The Willingness Of Arafat To Negotiate With Anybody Including Sharon
He further added that there is no solution for this except with a serious political framework and with granting Palestinian people their rights and with the declaration by Israel that this operation failed and that it cannot succeed with more blood shed. As such, he emphasized the fact that Israel resembles the Arab world by not admitting its failure or mishaps and this is a disaster for both of us.
Dahlan further warned about the unsystematic way of handling the matter by the Palestinians. This will only backfire on the Palestinian people who become tired with how Palestinian movements and authority handle it.
However things are moving haphazardly now.
Dahlan further mentioned that he is under fire by a bunch of thugs and thieves and this will not stop him from continuously asking for crucial reforms to the political, administrative and security structure. He added that he will continue with his efforts for such reforms and restore what can be restored.

Taba (News Agencies) Following critical days in which attention has been directed toward the Gaza Strip as for the seventh day running continuous Israeli military strikes cut off dozens of lives in Palestine, attention has suddenly been redirected to the Egyptian Sinai peninsula, and to be exact, the city of Taba, where an enormous explosion at the Hilton Hotel affected dozens of people, with Israelis forming the majority of dead and injured.
Rashwan went on to say that the explosion in Taba could represent a message to the Egyptian government that it is incapable of guaranteeing its interior security, and therefore cannot play a role in guaranteeing security in Gaza, in accordance with a plan set forth recently.
Thousands of Israelis spend the Jewish harvest festival in the Sinai peninsula. Taba, which is only one kilometer away, is a constant destination for Israeli tourists at holiday time.
Between attempts to cause diplomatic dialogue to win through, and intentions of militarizing pressure
Will it again rely on the principal of unilateral military intervention and repeat its fatal mistake of ignoring international law as it did in its project of invading Iraq, or will the European alliance, accompanied by Russia, succeed in causing political language and diplomatic dialogue to win through and resolve the matter?

This "terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism", according to Shalom's expression, is set against what Israel insists are its peaceful and legitimate nuclear ambitions, which according to the statements of Iranian politicians, represent "the primary source of terror and hatred and instability".
What remains of the world after this list of states?
The Vatican Confirms the Fragility of his Health One Week Ago:
The Al-Arabiya channel conveyed the news from a source in the International Red Cross, whilst for its part Aljazeera quoted "well-informed sources in the Vatican", also reporting that Tariq Aziz had died in prison.
He said at around 15.10 (12.10 GMT) that "he was alive five minutes ago".
She indicated that the International Red Cross "visited Tariq Aziz last week and he was not in hospital."
An important Vatican official stated that he had heard the news but the family had not confirmed it. However, the official confirmed that the office of the Vatican had received news of the poor health of Tariq Aziz a week ago, and that it had contacted Red Crescent offices with the intention of discovering whether it was possible to send a medical team to Baghdad to treat Saddam's deputy.
Brussels (News Agencies) - European diplomats have stated that the European Union faces disagreement over the question of relations with Israel, in seeking to form a new general policy aiming to consolidate relations between the Union and its neighbors.
An official in Holland, which holds the current presidency of the European Union, said it has been decided that leaders of the Union states will draw up these programs at their summit which is to be held on the 5th of the coming November.
However, European diplomats said that during the meeting held last Wednesday ambassadors of the Union states were sharply divided as to whether this kind of offer should be presented to Israel whilst the Israeli army continues in the largest attack carried out on the Gaza Strip in four years.
Meanwhile other states, among them Sweden, Ireland and Spain, say that it is impossible to proceed further with Israel at the current time and suggest that some programs be drafted whilst others are left for discussion at a later date.
The newspaper said that the commander of an Israeli military unit had verified the death of a Palestinian girl in the Gaza Strip by emptying the chambers of his machine-gun rifle.
It went on to say that soldiers had told the newspaper's correspondent that "the unit commander from the elite Ghaf'ati brigade had verified the killing by releasing the chambers of his rifle into the body of the girl. Afterwards they lay empty."
We realized that a terrorist was approaching the post, and everyone leapt into the trenches and sought to aim in the direction of the terrorist."
One of the soldiers stated "I saw a little girl, and informed the commanders of the post that it was a little girl, and said she couldn't have been older than 12. I didn't fire in her direction. One of the soldiers shot a single bullet at her, and she fell to the ground."
One of them said, "the sight of what happened was an extremely grim affair.

The complainant said that a group of family members had left his place of residence and headed for another locality to tend to various private matters, and on their return had been surprised to find indications that one of the windows of the house had been broken, before they discovered the disappearance of the jewelry which had been hidden in the bedroom cabinet.
He added that he had been afraid of being exposed, or that his relatives would discover the presence of the jewelry, so he had determined to conceal it with one of his friends. The latter thereby became his accomplice in the affair, and was arrested as the stolen goods were seized from him.

The President of the State confirmed a deep conviction in the role of the knowledge society, and a resolution to increase the lot of scientific and technological research, allocating more space to the private sector, alongside improving the system of creating companies in all sectors and increasing integration into the worldwide economy. He indicated a resolve to create 70 000 new companies or projects during the forthcoming 5 years, smoothing the paths of entrepreneurialism and creating a bank specializing in the financing of medium-sized or small companies, alongside working to raise a new generation of companies and increasing incentives and encouragement for export companies.
These pioneering measures are intended to bring about a qualitative movement in the life of the Tunisian citizen, so he may realize the ambitions of which he is capable.
Why does the Tunisian break the law?
Mr. Yousef As-Sabai
Following the floods which occurred recently, instructions were issued by the President of the State ruling for harsh treatment for people carrying out unplanned constructions without prior permission.
It is observable that rulings have been issued for the demolition of 3510 unplanned buildings in 24 departments within the first six months of the current year, of which 1456 were carried out, i.e. 40 to 41%. The rest were concluded within the scope of a settlement, or were not carried out for social or technical reasons...
From the official to the citizen
Dr. Naguib Bou Talib (Sociology expert)
Added to that are temperament and habits, alongside other factors and variations which have been identified as present by social and psychological studies analyzing the causes of infringements of the Highway Code. Among them are the variations of age, sex, level of education and social situation...
Demonstrations of violence on the public highway, and they are numerous in word and deed, give expression to a kind of social tension which is a mark of the stress of the age and asserts the kind of social non-conformance which has transformed the public space (the public highway) into an arena of social struggle, albeit though it may have started off in an individual, passing way... this non-conformance conceals perils which could turn into general behaviors, a dangerous symptom threatening to spread to the individual and society as a whole.
I think that the first answer lies in the psychological mindset which has descended upon the Tunisian citizen in general. In my view, the best and most informative way of defining Tunisian behavior and its interaction with legal structures is to observe, for example, the manner in which the citizen drives his car ... from doing this we recognize that a number of citizens have unfortunately come to disrespect the laws. So why then this indifference?
Here we come to the matter of monitoring the observance of the law. It must be undertaken in a relaxed manner, since the affair is not limited to one or two occurrences...
The most successful means, in my opinion, to ensure respect for the law, is simply the citizen's realization of its significance and purpose, and his satisfaction that it is intended for the protection of his rights and the rights of the community as a whole... and then comes the role of monitoring the observance of the law with a greater strictness in order to punish infringers... as it is necessary that the citizen should feel that the law is in power and that everyone is equal, and there is nothing above than the law...

Shortly before that time, on the southern shore of the Mediterranean, the creation of an Arab Common Market was announced. This market's institutions are still discussing productivity rankings. With reference to the Second Conference on Productivity in the Arab Lands, which met during this past week, the importance these rankings give rise to questions around the sincerity of the wider Arab region regarding free exchange. Arabs are no stronger in displaying a united front towards the other groups; this was expressed by Hamad Ben Hashem Al-Dhahab, general director of industry at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in a statement to "Assabah". He stated that the Arab states were negotiating individually with the European Union, with no attention to common Arab strategic interests.
Farming Preparations for the Olive Harvest Season in Sfax:
The engineer Mohamed Al-Fiqi, president of the Bureau of Studies and Statistics at the Provincial High Commission for Farming in Sfax informed us that the past season's olive production was estimated at 464 thousand tons, and the quantity of olives distributed on the Karmada market (the largest market in the republic) from the beginning of the season was estimated at 52264 tons, of which 53% was from the Sfax woodland, and the rest distributed among the various provinces of the country. As for the prices, they fluctuated between 180 and 110 mi. per kilo.
All of these statistics lead us to discussion of this season, and initial estimates for the quantity of production.
The Institute relies upon two stations in the department of Sfax (among a total of 7 stations distributed over the whole of the soil of the republic) - the first in the agricultural compound of Bouzouita, and the second in the agricultural compound of Schaal. These stations observe the quantity of pollen in the air. Measurement and processing of the data supplied are then undertaken according to scientific and laboratory principles, to arrive at a graphical representation linking the amount of pollen in the air and production. The accuracy of these estimates, as Tayyeb Jardaq confirms, lies at 90%.

Although this growth does not equal the level recorded before 2002, that should not be the tree which hides the woods, since Tunisian tourism has been experiencing ferocious competition from the countries of the area and likewise from Asian countries.
To carry out these activities, i.e. to attract Arab tourists and European retirees desiring to spend their retirement in sunny countries, that source suggests aiming for a greater flexibility in providing permits for the ownership of real estate for these groups, as well as attracting their families and friends.
Likewise, managers of the sector are called to make use of the hidden capacities of Tunisian tourism by linking it to private enterprise. Tunisia has security as well as highly skilled manpower resources to offer, according to observers worldwide.
Crisis of "the coalition" in Israel rising...
The Labor Party has 21 seats in the Israeli parliament (the Knesset), and is the largest opposition organization.
Likewise, Olmert clarified that consultations with the United Torah Judaism Party with the aim of including them in the government "are not unlikely".
In another sphere, whilst the political struggle escalates inside Israel with regard to Sharon's plan for withdrawal from Gaza and the fate of the governing coalition, the occupation army continues its hostile actions in separate areas of the Gaza Strip within the context of an operation to which Sharon has refused to put an end, which has come to be called "Days of Regret".
An Israeli military source said that the army arrested 22 Palestinians on the night of Monday to Tuesday. He said that they were wanted in the West Bank.
The Palestinian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Nabil Shaat, stressed the want of any international initiative capable of putting an end to Israeli aggression in Gaza, which has resulted in the martyrdom of around 120 Palestinians since it began on 28th September, in addition to hundreds injured and the destruction of dozens of houses.
10 Israeli warplanes "violate the skies of Lebanon"
The leader of Hezbollah said that the flypast operations seemed to represent an escalation following in the wake of International Security Council Resolution number 1559, which criticized the strong Syrian role in Lebanon.
He added that "the flight of ten Israeli warplanes over the whole of Lebanon (...
) has been planning something in Lebanon."
Stefan de Mistura, the personal representative of the United Nations General Secretary in South Lebanon, expressed in a statement issued from the media center of  the United Nations in Beirut "the degree of his concern over Israeli violations of the Green Line" drawn by the United Nations to mark the location of borders between the two countries, following the withdrawal of the Hebrew state from South Lebanon in May 2000.
He said "this speech shows that still some opposition, resistance, will and resolution remains in the Arab world, (...
Riyadh (News Agencies) - A source in the Saudi police force has announced the death of three suspects and the injuring of 12 policemen in confrontations which took place at dawn on Tuesday, in one of the neighborhoods of Riyadh.

The American army continues its attacks on Falluja and violates the sanctity of mosques in Ramadi
It added that "warplanes fired missiles in the direction of targets which sheltered the armed people in the city, whilst exchanges of gunfire, using light and medium weapons, took place between the two sides."
Three people were injured the day before yesterday in the outskirts of the city during an exchange of gunfire between American naval soldier forces (the Marines) and armed men.
That came under the pretext of "suspicion that these mosques were sheltering known terrorists, concealing stores of weapons, encouraging violence against the Iraqi people and recruiting insurgents".
Assassination of an Iraqi official in Mosul
The Iraqi officer said that the two bodyguards accompanying him came away unharmed whilst the attackers succeeded in escaping.
He added that the area of the citadel, where the explosion happened, is in proximity to the road leading to Falluja.
The level of political tension in Lebanon rises
For his part, Deputy Muhammad Rad, the head of the Shiite Hezbollah contingent in the Chamber of Deputies, said to France Presse "those who support resolution 1559 are practically asking for foreign interference in Lebanon."
In a statement issued from his office in Paris, Imad Aoun doubted the truth of these words, accusing the Syrian regime of "playing the role of the fireman given to starting fires and then rushing to put them out."
As for the Lebanese opposition press, they saw in Al-Assad's speech "a declaration of war"; opponents accused the Syrian President of re-opening the wound of the Lebanese civil war, experienced by Lebanon between 1975 and 1990.
To Convince Tehran to Stop Enrichment of Uranium
Iran has not carried out any uranium enrichment processes, but it has never frozen the program, and has in recent times restarted work on its principal constituents. Diplomats said to the New York Times that the Bush administration would not have agreed to grant any incentives to Iran but for the persistence of the three European countries in their attempts to put together a proposal to Iran. It is expected that Washington will look into this after the presidential elections of the 2nd November. It is anticipated that the Western proposal will be put forward to Tehran at a later time that month.
On another note, the official Iranian television channel announced yesterday that an important delegation from the International Atomic Energy Agency had arrived in Iran within the context of preparations for the statement which the director general of the agency, Mohammed El-Baradei, would make on 25th November to the Agency's board of governors.
Experts stress there is no justification for the state of fear and alarm
As for the reasons for the withdrawal, its underlying cause may be traced back to the results obtained by the American FDA organization which, through running clinical tests on 1,040,000 people, proved that people who took the Vioxx drug for 18 consecutive months without interruption became twice as threatened by the risk - may God restore them to health - of succumbing to thrombosis and stroke, in addition to other complications.
Tipping the balance
Alarm is inappropriate
However, and in both cases, patients currently using Vioxx should contact their doctors immediately, with the aim of obtaining the appropriate decision regarding their treatment; since they are the only person capable of taking the correct decision in their regard, in accordance with their state of health.

Conclusion of President Mbeki's State Visit to Tunisia:
Likewise, the deputy president of the Democratic Constitutional Rally, the First Minister and members of the Rally's political bureau came to bid farewell to the president, along with a number of members of government.
The presidents Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Thabo Mbeki confirmed an increase in the volume of commercial exchanges, in particular by way of the air link between the two countries, in addition to the intensification of cultural exchange and technical co-operation in the area of health and medical services.
Recent occurrences in the middle east region, along with developments in the situation in Iraq, were the objects of renewed attention for the two presidents Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Thabo Mbeki, who expressed the degree of their concern with regard to the perilous developments seen by the region, and stated the need for speed in putting a stop to the violence and aggression which targeted innocent people in addition to increasing the tension and threatening international peace and security.
The President of the Tunisian Chamber of Industry and Commerce to Assabah
*What have been the practical results of the partnership meetings which you organized with the businessmen who came from South Africa with President Thabo Mbeki and the accompanying delegation within the context of the state visit to Tunisia?
Electronics, Communications and Sanitation
-We do not allow ourselves to speak for others... and we are not a political organization, we carry out the policy of our president and our government, and co-operate with all businessmen in the region in accordance with the laws of the market, profitability and benefit...
*Do you not believe that some difficulties exist in the development of economic relations with far away countries such as South Africa, such as the factor of distance, and the poor spread of English in formerly French-speaking North African countries?
-We as businessmen interact on the basis of the interests of one company or another... all businessmen. It is no surprise that the interest of European, Saudi, Kuwaiti, Korean and African businessmen in Tunisia is increasing, considering the investment environment in it...
Tunis - Assabah Desertification in Tunisia, in all of its manifestations, results in the permanent loss of around 19 thousand hectares of land per year. Around 96% of the area of the country, the essentially arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid regions, is considered to be under threat from desertification. Among them, 50% are affected more than others by the danger of desertification, according to the National Anti-Desertification Committee. This is the situation in Tunisia, which does not differ greatly from the most dangerous situations in particular among African countries. Two thirds of the African continent is represented by desert or arid lands, and desertification causes these countries vast and various losses which have a negative influence on efforts for development and reform. Such matters as these and others formed the focus of attention and study during an action and education workshop on the continuing erosion in African lands, which recently drew delegations representing 40 French-speaking African states to Tunis. The participants held discussions during this conference, which was also attended by experts in the desertification field.
The term desertification, according to the definition used in the United Nations anti-desertification treaty of the 12th September 1994, means the degradation of land in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid regions as a result of different factors, among them climatic variations and human activity.
Among the accomplishments of the national program of action to combat desertification at the organizational level is the creation of a permanent secretariat for the National Anti-Desertification Council, and the setting out of a national program of action against desertification, comprising the primary constituents of the Tenth Development Plan for 2002/2006 (chapter 5), and recognized as a framework for all interventions in this area; alongside the creation of provincial and local anti-desertification committees dependent upon the provincial and local councils for development.
News and Sketches
Assabah has learnt of the firm intention of "Tunisia Telecom" to enlarge the user capacity of the "Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line" (ADSL) service in the coming year, to include professionals and ordinary people all over the republic alongside manufacturing and economic institutions ... this aims to reinforce the potential for connection to the internet and the use of the web network with greater effectiveness and efficiency.
With the advent of the rainy season, the cost of the damage caused by the slow execution of a number of municipal works has become plain, for example in some municipalities in the suburbs of Al-Karm, Salamboo, Birsa, the Muhammad Ali area and Al-Yasmina... the delay in completion of works such as the surfacing of pavements, refurbishment of public lighting networks, resurfacing of some roads and carriageways, and laying of new sanitation and rain-water drainage channels... has caused mounds of earth to accumulate and waters to gather... will the local municipalities not hurry to complete these works as soon as possible.
Yesterday's session recorded a decrease in the shares of 13 companies, whilst rises were limited to the shares of 7 companies, in dealings which were not generally busy; the volume of exchange on the central market therefore was not greater than the electronic market. 646 thousand dinars resulted from the exchange of 50 thousand shares.
On the other hand, TUNISIE LEASING (+2.86% at a price of 19.500D) and UBCI (+1.46% at a price of 20.900D) particularly came to the fore, whilst the remainder of the rises were insignificant, such as SOTUVER (+100mi.) and SIAME (+40mi.).
She added that the Dutch commercial policy regarding the development of commercial relations with Tunisia rested on four main points. The first point centers on the development of diplomatic and commercial actions by firmly establishing diplomatic relations and procedures with the Tunisian authorities with regard to matters concerning international tenders, insurance, payments, customs tariffs and monetary exchange.
As for the fourth point, it is concerned with supporting Tunisian organizations by way of a Dutch program within the field of administration assisting firms aiming to develop the performance of small- and medium-scale organizations through Dutch experts and specialists. Alongside this is a program promoting imports to the European countries through support for Tunisian firms in penetrating European markets.
As for the imports, the majority of Tunisian imports from Holland were raw materials, related to the textile sector at 24%, to food industry at 29% and to manufacturing industries at 21%.
Ain Draham, the "capital" of photography and the heritage photograph
The inauguration of the professional photographers' joint exhibition took place on the first day in Ain Draham's youth club, under the patronage of the eminent governor of Jendouba, Mr. Ali Ksiksi, and with the participation of a group of photographers, academics, and other protagonists. Among them, by way of example and to mention but a few, were Ibrahim Bahlul, Omar Dhia, Sabir Al-Bahri, Mina Kurai, Zakaria Al-Shayibi, Hamid Bu'li, Jamis Luqat, Anis Al-Mili, Munir Mabkhout, and Schafiq Qiyas.
Third prize: Mohamed Bahlul - photograph "Mr. Madin, Jabal Zaghuan, 2004"
During the activities on the second day of the exhibition, a round table was organized around the subject of "The Art of Photography and Modern Technology". It was presented by a professor at the Institute of Journalism and News, Omar Dhia, and a group of academics, students and others interested in photography.
The majority of the participants in the discussion were united with regard to the necessity of incorporating photography into primary and secondary education, the insufficiency of the efforts of clubs, and need for work towards training specialists in the fields of artistic, journalistic and publicity photography...
Coverage: Mahir Khalil
After he had experienced its intoxication on two occasions, he began to seek to acquire more cannabis, and on contacting a friend of his aiming to obtain "jounta" from the Indian hemp drug, he was directed a dealer living in the old city. However this latter person frustrated him, claiming that she did not possess the substance, and directed him to her neighbor, who turned him away upon contact. It later became clear that the neighbor is currently in prison, in custody for his involvement in a drugs case along with members of his family... It seems that the suspect became addicted to taking drugs, so again contacted the dealer previously mentioned, at which she took pity on him and gave him a small piece for ten dinars, then quickly changed her mind to alter the pricing so that "jounta" became 15 dinars, the price which she defined for him to make the sale. She warned him at every opportunity of the results of revealing the affair, and the customer paid heed to this in order to ensure the purchase, before one day she surprised him by refusing to supply him because she rejected the principal of selling by small amounts, which did not satisfy the woman who aimed to "sell in bulk" to expand her enterprise... Upon her subjection to investigation and her appearance before the judges in the course of a number of sessions, the accused insisted on her innocence and explained that her presence in prison was only due to a malicious accusation made against her by her imprisoned neighbor, accompanied by his wife and her sister who were intent on "stitching her up" and putting her in prison...
Was the woman killed at the hands of her relative?
Within this context, the inspectors undertook intensive interrogations, calling in the daughter of the deceased to listen to her statement. She said that she was with her mother in the house when their relative burst in at dawn, accompanied by her son.
Sabar Al-Moshkar
It is the month of fasting and renewal, which deepens the purity of belief and sincerity of faith in our hearts, and reinforces the presence of moderation and temperance in our souls. It spurs us on to multiply our efforts and good works and perform our duties to the highest standards.
Oh citizens, men,
And Ramadan greetings to the Islamic peoples...
Mr. Abdelaziz Ben Dhia, in the address he gave on the occasion, stressed that the electoral engagements of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali involved a great deal of bravery and courage considering the difficulties and problems present in today's political arena.
Mr. Abdelbaki Hermassi, Minister of Culture, Youth and Recreation, indicated that on every occasion the political administration stressed its support for the Tunisian intellectual, and the best proof of that was the material support of ongoing budget allocations from the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Recreation, calculated to reach 5.1% in the year 2009.
By Noureddine Ashour
On three floors and over an area of 850 square meters, the aforementioned departments have been established in a manner which unites good organization and the desired benefit whether in terms of regulating of the work of each department or through the range of communications equipment included in all of the departments.
Fasting, Labor and Moderation in Spending are Acts of Worship
Islam is a religion of moderation, and it has ordered a commitment to this path in all areas. For the days not within Ramadan, so that we are not distracted from the goals for which it was introduced, the Noble Quran provides a prohibition of squander in form of the order: "Do not squander wastefully," a fact which causes the law invented in its respect to be a duty. It is well known that he who evades his duty commits a wrongdoing. In the book of Mighty God, the one who squanders is defined as a brother to devils, in the words: "Surely the squanderers were brothers of the devils." So, in this case, it would be impossible that any sane person with upright feelings should accept that the wise leading ruler would sanction such a behavior which alienates us from him, associating us as brothers to the devils, or to make lawful for us worship which contaminates our performance of other forms of worship.
Ramadan greetings to Tunisia; may she remain well under the wise leadership and the far-sighted policies of her devoted son, His Excellency the President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.
In view of the fact that the Tunisian company for the wholesale market in Bir Kassa is considered the principal nerve center of the supply operations and the status of the consumer market, "Assabah" contacted Mr. Hadi Soueid Kahia, general manager of the market, for information on the progress of work in the wholesale market and the exceptional regulations which will be put in place with the beginning of the month of fasting.
In relation to the quantities currently present, Mr. Hadi Soueid stressed that Ramadan has come at a good time this year in spite of the fact that it is the transitional phase of the seasons. Nevertheless, record figures had been recorded with regard to most consumer produce, in particular vegetables and fruits. This reflects on the prosperity of the market. Our interviewee added that in this period, in comparison to last year, a significant growth had been recorded in quantities and a noticeable lowering in prices. They are, in general, reasonable prices within everyone's the reach, a fact which will reassure the consumer that the month of fasting will pass in good circumstances and all the problems recorded in past seasons will be overcome.
It is mentioned that the quantities imported into the market yesterday represented 1075 tons of vegetables, 1150 tons of fruit, and 49 tons of fish, whilst the quantity of   articles transferred was 60 tons, among which were 6 tons of fish from Libya, 5.1 tons of fish from Algeria and 4.2 tons of fish from Italy.

With these, the number of these landmarks stands at 4197, across all the regions of the Republic.
The day before yesterday, the second mobile phone provider "Tunisiana" began marketing a new offer on the occasion of the start of Ramadan. This offer involves the sale of two prepay lines at a price of 40 dinars, i.e. at the price of a single line. The closing date for this offer has not yet been decided upon; it is anticipated that it will continue for more than a month.
The National Agency for Energy Control is organizing a media conference on "Energy Control in the Transport Sector" today at the Hotel Abou Nawas in Tunis. This will be attended by 150 participants, representing various ministries, along with Tunisian and foreign petrol firms.
Banks:- In the First Half of the Year:
The volume of bad debts will not see any noteworthy change in relation to the previous year, during which all banks experienced a rise in bad debts. The rate covering these debts reached 47% during the period concerned.
At least 32 killed, among them 15 Iraqi soldiers, in various attacks
A spokeswoman for the American army said that the two Americans had been killed yesterday in the course of two attacks on the Khadra area, one of which was carried out by a suicide bomber. She stated that the first attack had targeted a cafe, whilst the second occurred in the open market frequented by American soldiers and citizens.
He said "it is clear that they were not missiles or Hawn rockets, but rather explosive devices brought into the area."
Doctor Ismail Muhammad of the General Hospital said to Agence France Presse that "we have three bodies and eight injured."
The wire, received by the police in Ramadi, the largest city in Anbar, stated that armed men had attacked a National Guard headquarters the night before last, killing 15 men from among their ranks and seizing their weapons.
Added to that, the chief of the National Guard in Heet escaped from an assassination attempt which made use of a booby-trapped car.
An official responsible for the registration of deaths at the Al-Kandi Hospital, Risan Ghadban, said that "Abdel Amir Kazem As-Shamari, Investigating Judge in Rasafah (to the east of Baghdad) was killed as he came out of his house."
Rise of the American death toll
Palestinian Territories
Occupation army withdrew from the Rafah camp after an incursion that martyred at least three Palestinians, one of whom was a member of Al Quds Brigades, the military arm of the Jihad Movement, and a seventy years old man whose wife, 65 years old, sustained critical injuries.
The Movement's manifesto stated that the rockets will penetrate even further into the Israeli depth.
The Israeli paper Maariv stated yesterday that high-ranking officers in the Israeli Army are questioning the feasibility of continuing the current operation in Gaza Strip, and consider that "it is time to end it" to avoid having to face "complications".
Is it true that the world today is safer?!
Why should the United States worry that Pakistan is threatened with civil war because of the American hegemony over its regime.
President Bush doesn't ask why these terrorist attacks occur. He just mentions them to condemn their perpetrators then turns over the page to talk about the security and safety in Uncle's Sam country.
It is ironic that the United States, which oversees the installation of regimes loyal to it in Afghanistan, Iraq and other places in the world under the pretext of spreading freedom, has announced today that Afghanistan, where people go hungry, is transporting ballot boxes by donkeys to deliver them to the poverty-stricken, hungry and cold people in villages hanging off the mountains, hundreds of thousands of whom did not hear of the presidential or parliamentary candidates.
It is true that the attack suffered by the Israelis in Taba is a painful terrorist operation.
Is the solution more colonization of nations, or the withdrawal from the occupied countries and allowing their citizens to decide their fate themselves according to international law and according to the American political thought since Wilson's time which called for the right of every nation to self-determination without custodianship.
In Al Khirbah
We learned that those affected underwent a number of tests which confirmed - according to an administrative source at the mentioned hospital - that their infection was not critical. They were given the required treatment and vaccinations and their state gradually stabilized prior to them leaving the hospital.
Although these cases appeared in the countryside surrounding the city of Al Khirbah, the main source remains unproven. Some postulate the hypothesis that consumed water over which there is no supervision, and which is circulated by the itinerant sellers is the cause for the appearance of these cases.
Saber Mkacher
18 persons were apprehended as a result. They came from different regions, the most important being Kebili, ElKef, Sfax and the capital. We learned that all those apprehended were referred to the Public Prosecutor of the Sfax Court of First Instance and remanded in custody for further investigations before they are presented to the judiciary for the customary legal procedures to be taken against them.
The same applies to the third operation, forestalled on the night of last Wednesday to Thursday, when the National Guard officers in El Amra arrested three young men originally from the Province of Kebili who admitted to coming there to participate in an operation of clandestine border crossing.
Examining costs of registration, diagnosis and treatment
Assabah visited one of the public capitals in the centre of the capital, and this is the report resulting from questioning the citizens and the medical staff.
On the other hand, some of the citizens state that no matter how high the treatment fees in public hospitals, they never reach treatment fees in private hospitals. Mr. Mohamed Bouzayen says in this context: "I resorted to the public hospital after I spent a lot on private clinics and hospitals and got nowhere. I feel much better after coming to this hospital, and the expenses are minimal in comparison to the amounts I spent at the private health institutions."
A great improvement in treatment: We asked Mrs Sakina Assaghir about the way medical and paramedical staff treat the patients, and she answered: "In comparison to the past, there is a big improvement. I noticed there is flexibility and understanding in dealings with the patient. Cleanliness has also improved significantly and there is care about it. Generally, public hospitals have improved a lot in comparison to the past."
"Medical fees are nominal, but the patient considers them excessive"
An incorrect preconception
An outlet for selling frozen meats opens with available supply and defined prices
Modifying the market: To better understand the dimensions of the opening of this outlet, whose presence we are used to solely on the occasion of Al-Adha Feast; the extent of public attendance it achieved especially as it has been open for a few days; the coordination of its accredited supplies; and whether it will remain open after Ramadan in view of the continuing supplies, we met with Mrs. Amal Said, a veterinarian, the Quality Director at the Meat Company and the Company's representative in health inspection of supplies prior to, during and after the butchering. She said that the goal of this operation is part of the framework of the Meat Company's role, that is, interfering as necessary to modify the market, ensure its balanced movement and suppress prices.
Liver is on its way...
Amal Said, we touched on some issues related to the rehabilitation of the sector as a whole and establishing a system with integrated poles that would connect in one space the cattle market, the abattoir, control and sorting, supply and direct sale to the citizens. We got interested in this great idea, or project, that will constitute the engine which will pull behind it all the other cars, as it will introduce professional handling customs new to this trade, especially as the project has completed the study stage and is only awaiting the green light to become reality.
New commercial offers for mobile phones during the month of Ramadan
Additional offers: The new commercial offer from Tunisia Telecom also includes giving those Tunisia Telecom clients who have pre-paid accounts a special offer of 10 Dinars worth of free calls every time they recharge for 30 Dinars, instead of 40 Dinars, within the offer time.
Answering a question by Assabah regarding the preparations at Tunisia Telecom to deal with the additional applications which will increase because of the new offers, especially as there are unresolved complaints about the current services provided by the network which cause grievance to many of Tunisia Telecom clients, Mr. Ahmed Mahjoub pointed out that demanding good services is the right of every client, especially as there is another operator in the field pushing the competition. The company receives many enquiries about the lack of network coverage, but these are related to situational periods such as celebrations and feasts, and to weather conditions in particular times.
New Tunisiana
The first service consists of selling a telephone line with two SIM cards for 50 dinars. This service aims at facilitating the act of communication, especially for businessmen, since the two SIM cards can be used for two mobile phones in two different places so that when one line connects the second automatically disconnects and vice versa. The card can also be used for the car phone, while the client who purchases a SIM Card Copier with the line can keep all numbers and other information embedded in these cards, in case they are exchanged from one phone to another.
Rail Transport During the Month of Ramadan
119 trains daily
On the other hand, timetables for the coastal areas also changed to suit the month of Ramadan. The number of trips increased to 32 and the times have changed.

A new wave of attacks and shelling on Fallujah and a suicide attack on a police station south of Baghdad
This air raid comes only few hours after the artillery and air shelling by the American forces of the city 65 km west of the capital Baghdad.
These raids occurred after the head of the interim Iraqi government Iyad Allawi threatened to initiate an extensive attack on Fallujah if the population of the city did not hand over Al-Zarqawi.
The American forces think that the armed group of "Jama'at Al Tawhid wal Jihad" belonging to Al-Zarqawi have taken Fallujah as a base.
At the same time, a car bomb suicide attack yesterday morning on an Iraqi police station in the district of Dura, south of Baghdad, killed at least one person and injured ten others according to reports from one of the hospitals.
He added that the explosion occurred at 9:45 local time.
Capt. Faisal Abdel Karim, the spokesman for the Border Guards in Diyala Province, told Agence France-Presse, "We detained 135 Afghanis and Pakistanis during a raid on the border villages in east Iraq."
The Algerian Minister for Foreign Affairs denies the presence of military masses on Morocco's borders

The two presumed leaders of coups d'etat are presented to foreign press corps
France Press correspondent stated that the two ex-officers were put under strict supervision in the Police Academy in Nouakchott.
He kept looking at the ground, and looked agitated and tired, but he smiled when he found out that his visitors were journalists.
No signs of torture were apparent on either of the ex-officers and they seemed to be in good health.
Karzai leads according to initial results
In two provinces close to Kabul, Logar and Vardak (east) where the majority are Pashtuns, Karzai - himself a Pashtun - has obtained until now 88.1% and 74.1% of the votes respectively.
Despite this, it is difficult to ascertain the actual number of voters, because some received more than one card.
In Al'Umran
After additional questioning he mentioned that he got to know an African citizen and developed trust in him. After some time, he met him in the company of two African citizens. He intimated that he was able to make him a "millionaire" very quickly, and asked him to accompany him to a certain place.
Investigations started quickly to arrest the three suspects. We learned that a precise coordination is carried out between the various security units to prevent the Africans from departing Tunisian land.
Security units belonging to the city's National Guard, and specifically those of the Al'Adliyah police unit, were successful in the past few days in apprehending 14 young males under the suspicion of handling goods of unidentified origin.
Second Operation
Abundance won over pushiness
Also disappeared monopolizations by some of the merchants of basic staples, because of the impetus of supply and abundance of products. Consequently, we did not notice the absence or dearth of some staples for a few days only to show up again modestly on the night of "attack" and at prohibitive prices.
What happened in the Progressive Democratic Party?
However, the first amended version did not convince the Administration, which called on the Party to implement new amendments. This necessitated a second round of negotiations. The party was represented by Mr. Rachid Khechana, member of the Elections Observation Committee created by the Party some time ago with the aim to coordinate the Progressive Democratic Party's performance in these elections.
It should be mentioned that Mr Ahmed Chebbi, the Secretary General of the Progressive Democratic Party, convened a press conference last Thursday in which he announced the Party's adherence to the original Elections Program.
Tunis - Assabah: The Tunisian public will this evening meet the Lebanese singer Ragheb Alama at El-Menzah Sports Palace, for a concert that is part of the cultural program of Constitutional Democratic Rally's presidential and legislative election campaign.
He added, "I have a love relationship with Tunisia, and I will be singing to my family and brothers in Tunisia, and share in their joy of supporting the leader Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in the presidential elections.. for he is a man of pioneering decisions at the national, Arab and international levels."

Eye witnesses said that two powerful explosions were yesterday heard in the centre of the Iraqi capital Baghdad, and Reuters quoted these witnesses as saying that pillars of black smoke were seen rising from the area of Andalus Square.
The attacked churches are St. Joseph, St. Jacob, St. George, the Church of Rome and St. Thomas.
In Fallujah, the American and Iraqi forces created a tight security ring around the city west of Baghdad and barred residents from leaving or entering it.
Residents and eye witnesses said that the shelling targeted the eastern and southern parts of the city, and that artillery was also utilized. There were no reports about casualties.
Despite the extensive military actions on the ground, the American forces denied that the repeated shelling of Fallujah is the start of an extensive attack on the city, with the interim Iraqi government under Iyad Allawi threatening to wage one unless the city handed over Al-Zarqawi and his group despite the repeated denials by the residents that Al-Zarqawi and his supporters are present in their city.
He added, "the handing over period has been extended unconditionally for two days" clarifying that "the government expects to collect the heavy arms."
Col. Abe Abrams said to Agence France-Presse, "We haven't seen the quality arms yet.

The film "Him and Her" by Elias Bakkar, which originally did not screen at the festival for technical reasons, will also be shown then.
a waste of academic time and negative effects on students' results
Tardiness constitutes a problem for the teacher, as late students lead to disruption of classes...
Many suggestions
He suggests supporting the framework of managing college administration to facilitate control and supervision. He pointed out that the number of supervisors is very small in comparison to the number of students (1 supervisor for every 200 students).
Mr. Bou Ali finished by inviting all those interested in the educational process to make students the real centre of the educational process...
Is this a bad trend, or what?
I am not convinced
Suha, a student in year one says, "she attends the private tuition because she is forced to. She sits in the lounge of her teacher's house. Most of the time she doesn't pay any attention to us and we don't know why we are there?"
Absence of supervision and health warnings
About which toy will he provide his advice, and which reference will he peruse? The issue remains in the hands of the citizen himself, as choosing toys for children is a binding necessity They not only could affect the health of the young ones adversely but also affect their psychology, as some of these are dangerous for the child and his environment, imbuing him with violence (like revolvers and explosives..) and may also endanger his person.
Tunis - Weekly: Occasionally, as you cross the road on foot or on any other means of transport, something suddenly passes you by so quickly that it leaves naught but dust in its wake. You ask yourself a lot about this rapid lightning, and decide it could be nothing else but a motorcycle, the kind that young men ride and which often cause tragedies on the road ending in the death of young men in their prime for no reason but their desire at a moment of thoughtlessness to show off their driving skills on motorcycles of various types and sizes in front of high schools, so as to win attention and admiration without as much as using any means of protection and precaution,

What I like about the director Ali Nassar is that he listens to the opposite opinion and discusses it with you.
- Not exactly. Ever since I started directing my own plays and taking the leading roles in them, I have become very particular when it comes to choosing roles both on stage and in the cinema. I choose what characters suit me, those that can develop my artistic persona, and increase my good artistic credit and refine my talent as a stage actress in the process of artistic maturation.
London (AFP) - The Secretary General of the United Nations rejected accusations made in the report by the American Duelfer on Iraqi weapons which alleged that Russia and France specifically were ready to ease sanctions against Saddam Hussein's regime in return for oil contracts.
But in Anan's opinion tactics or promises offering oil contracts to companies from countries such as France, Russia or China would not have succeeded.

First political party for women
The document affirms that the enforced absence of women in decision making creates a state of inequality and ineffectiveness at different levels of the society, and that it is essential to change the way men run governments.
In her opinion the funds available in the public treasury are being spent unfairly and unequally. As an example, she says, "I don't know why lots of money is paid out as end-of-service compensation to military personnel who decide to move to the civil sector, while women on maternity leave get very small amounts although all the politicians allege that caring for children is the state's priority. Also, parents with disabled children sometimes live in really strenuous circumstances."

He then proudly marched into the cafe, but saw a young man whose brother was the cause of his latest imprisonment. This made him very angry and since he wasn't in a normal condition, he decided to take his revenge on that young man. He approached him, attempting to hit him with the weapon he was carrying, but those present interfered to protect the young man. This enraged the accused even more, and he took off smashing the chairs in the cafe. This caused some of those present to suffer small injuries. National Guard officers were informed and arrived at the place to apprehend the accused and confiscate the arms he was carrying. During interrogations he admitted straightforwardly to all that he was charged with.

Singer Ragheb Alama accepted the invitation and sang for free before his audience which still loves him a lot. Before the start of the concert, and during it, he confirmed that he came from Lebanon to participate with the Tunisian people in their support for their beloved President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. He said he loved Ben Ali because he is a man of love and goodness and because Tunisia has seen much progress on all fronts through his actions.
She performed beautiful songs choosing gems from the Golden Age and a few rare contemporary pearls, and she was magnificent in both areas. An opportunity like this and others must be given to her to introduce her to music and song lovers, as she is much better than some male and female singers who have imposed themselves on Tunisia and the Arab world.
Ragheb Alama lived up to his promise on Saturday night, and sang with enthusiasm. The audience responded to him, refusing to sit in the seats and choosing to dance without hysteria or clamor. They had the right to interact with the songs of Tunisia's guest, and more so to jointly perform the songs with the singer. Ragheb, of course, went along with his audience and let them sing along in a beautiful interplay.
The words of this song say:

The musician and professor of cultural sociology, Adel Bouallag, confirms this fact through his quiet but fruitful presence on the artistic scene and through his project "The Bells" which he created without any official support, relying on his growing funds and activity which continues  crystallizing.
Bouallaq defined his performance "The Caravan" in various ways, each complementing the previous definition. It is a journey through art guided by  voice, and the engagement of voices coming from the south towards the cities of the universe. It is also, according to the description of its producer, a journey to the beginnings of vocal expression in humans, when man discovered the voice potential in him and this is why the essence of the performance will concentrate around the journey of separation and conjoining between the body, voice and wind and the return of self to its primordial womb.
And so the real likeness of the desert remains absent from collective memory and has become a marginalized cultural heritage. This led us to dig into this collective memory, uncover what has become absent and dust it off. There was a need for the wind to uncover things and create its rustle that will bring back movement into the desert, to cut into the first representation of the desert in the European's imagination which is represented as a continual and sharp sound, akin to the whistling of the wind, which was recreated using a continual musical notation played on a string instrument."
Maybe this passage excerpted from the poetry of the "Caravan" performance, and which carries Adel Bouallag's signature, will make us anticipate surprises that will enrich both consciousness and sight.

Baghdad (News Agencies) - 14 Iraqis were killed and 52 others injured in a wave of explosions and acts of violence in Iraq that targeted last night and the night before and other places, while the American forces released the head of Fallujah's team negotiating with the Iraqi government.
A speaker who refused to identify himself told Agence France Presse that "at least six persons were killed and another 27 injured in an explosion caused, it appears, by a wired vehicle in front of a cafe in the Jadriya suburb."
A police officer said that "a passing civilian vehicle was hit by an explosion, and its driver was killed" on the road to the neighborhood of Ghazaliya west of the capital.
In Mosul, the American forces announced yesterday that a wired vehicle detonated in the city in northern Iraq, killing five Iraqis and injuring about 15 American soldiers.
A policeman said, "We were in three vehicles, police patrolling a southeastern district of Baquba at midnight when we came across a suspicious-looking car."
Relatives of Sheikh Khaled Hamoud had announced his arrest, but the American Army refused to confirm or deny the news.
General Amnesty
He announced that the amnesty period offered to those handing in their arms in Sadr City will be extended until the coming Thursday.
The public television quoted Pinhas Wallerstein, a member of the Jewish settlers council in Judea, Samaria (West Bank) and Gaza, as saying "It was one of the most disgraceful meetings with a prime minister.
Shaul Goldstein, deputy chairman of the settler's council, said to Agence France Presse that "Sharon has completely refused any suggestions that a referendum or early elections be held".
He added, "Sharon is leading this country to a split that may result in a civil war."
Sharon's plan faces strong opposition from within the Likud Party which he chairs and from the radical right, while the majority of the 250 thousand Jewish settlers in Palestinian lands have sworn to thwart it and are working to inflame the already tense mood regarding this issue.
Despite this, and because of the alliances inside the Knesset, it is expected that the plan will obtain an in favor vote of 67 MP's in comparison to 45 votes against it (19 of those from the Likud party) and eight abstained votes according to a poll carried out by the newspaper Maariv.
750 British soldiers to replace American forces in southern Baghdad
The paper added that a number of high ranking officers in the army expressed their concerns regarding this plan of re-deploying British forces to northern Iraq that British papers spoke of since last Friday.
The Guardian quoted an unidentified source in the British Armed Forces the day before yesterday as saying, "There is a dismay at the notion that we are interfering with the American (presidential) elections."
During the meeting, the President of the Republic signed a decree related to regulating school life in accordance with the laws of the Directive Education and School Teaching Act.
His Excellency the President has reaffirmed the great importance he sees in increasing efforts to embed an energy control culture among various milieus; in integrating energy-saving technologies into various industrial projects, the residential and the services sector; subjecting household electrical equipment to energy-saving setups and features; and increasing the use of natural gas and utilization of the incentives  provided in this context.
For this reason, the New Era Tunisia strengthened the position of every vital sector reinforcing its roots in the specifics of our Arab Muslim identity. Religious landmarks are one of the most important of these sectors and, in comparison to what it was like for fourteen centuries, have improved in quality and increased in number since the shining dawn of November 7th.
For this reason the care accorded to landmarks which stand witness to special periods in Tunisian history, such as the Mosque of Uqba Ibn Nafi in Kairouan, and the rebuilt Al Zaytouna Mosque in Tunis in whose courtyard his Excellency the President gave the permission for the Koran to be recited continually day and night, have met with public approbation because they know it implies pride in identity and taking responsibility for one's history and heritage.
Tunis - Assabah: This is what Jose Lopez Portillo, President of Mexico (1976-1982) said in the early eighties when announcing his country's inability to pay its outstanding debts because of lack of resources necessary for doing so.
-The presence of cartel companies that destroyed an important aspect of the market, that of free and transparent competition.
These factors played a decisive role in legitimizing state interference with the market. However, with the appearance of economic recession in the seventies, accompanied by inflation, the reality of this role began to be questioned. The above mentioned problems led many economists to look for imbalance created by state intervention. This intervention became the goal of the Virginia School or the neoconservatives, headed by two American economists, Buchanan and Niskanen. This school demanded curbing state interventionism in the market, thus preferring a market imbalance over the imbalance caused by state intervention and represented in misuse, increased costs and delays in the projects it executed, and investigating side effects without providing solutions to avoid them.

Tunisie Valuers, a stock brokering company at the stock exchange, noticed that this level falls behind that achieved in the first half of 2001, something the company considered as a "rebound". The financial services sector's turnover is made up of loans offered to companies of various types in the shape of equipment, buildings or money with the aim of assisting these in their improving their activities. This production is essentially aimed at long-term investments.
This improved situation explains to a large degree the 37% growth in the revenues of the stock-listed companies between the start of this year and end of August 2004, following a drop in its share prices of 57% between the years 2000 and 2003. Leasing companies listed on the Tunisian stock market are represented by the Compagnie Internationale de Leasing, General Leasing, Arab Tunisian Lease, Amen Leasing and Tunisie Leasing, the last one having the largest share of the market.
Tunis - Assabah: Traditional handicrafts contribute 81.3% of the total local revenue and 19.2% of total exports (250M D. annually). It employs approximately 300 thousand craftsmen, this number representing 11% of the employed work force. Added to these indicators, which continually strengthen the sector's integration into the national economy year after year,  are important procedures taken with the aim to improve traditional industries. Among these is the creation of the National Fund for the Promotion of Handicrafts and Small Businesses (Fonapram), organizing an annual exhibition for innovations in this field, making March 16th the National Day of Traditional Dress since 1991 and organizing the "Golden Five" Competition for innovation in traditional clothing, in addition to participating in exhibitions overseas. In this context a cooperation framework agreement has been reached since June 2001 between the National Office for Traditional Handicrafts and the National Tunisian Office for Tourism, aiming at collaboration towards the strengthening of tourism revenue on the one hand and developing traditional handicrafts on the other.
This exhibition is considered one of the most important international shows specializing in traditional artifacts, with 2200 exhibitors from 94 countries participating and 5.2 million visitors, 30 thousands of whom are craftsmen.
In addition to this general procedure, a final project for rehabilitating the companies practicing in the sector has been put in place, to include 700 companies, in light of the completion of a pilot operation by a specialized expert to rehabilitate 10 companies in various specializations.

Written by Asia Atrous
The past few days were heavy with distress, wounds and pain among pictures of assassinated childhood in stations, schools and streets once their school bags and children's toys became transformed into sources of terror for the heavily armed occupation soldiers, and among the confiscated dreams of the youth and the tears of widows and orphans that have been placed among the commonplace and recurring events.
Far from attempting in any way to doubt the integrity of Human Rights Watch or the intentions of the Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees representative, it remains clear that such reports are no more than an act of exoneration or pleasing the few voices that still believe in the righteousness of the Palestinian cause and depend on a stand by the United Nations that will restore respect for international law or strive to stop the current occupation of Palestinian lands.
Two weeks prior to the date of presidential elections in America:
Two weeks prior to the presidential elections, the American President George Bush and his Democrat challenger John Kerry exchanged fierce charges the day before yesterday about issues of combating terrorism and Iraq at the same time as the start of early voting procedures was announced in Florida, at the same time as the start of early voting procedures was announced in Florida. Bush devoted the larger part of his address at the election campaign in Marlton, New Jersey (East) near New York where a number of families of the victims of September 11th attacks live, to terrorism and severely criticized Kerry, accusing him of attempting to create "a false security".
In Tampa (Florida) Kerry said, "Mister President, you can choose to ignore facts, but at the end you cannot hide the truth from the American people."
He was responding to a newspaper article which stated that the former commander of the American forces in Iraq, Lt. General Ricardo Sanchez had complained last winter about insufficient equipment which, according to him, threatened the combat capabilities of the allied forces.
One of them, Lori Van Auken, said "Now we have introduced terrorism into Iraq.
It seems that elections are again heated in Florida, with its controversial 2000 results still in mind.
To win the White House race one ought to obtain 270 of the large electors.
Civil rights unions and defenders have already lodged a court case to prevent the State of Florida from disqualifying more than ten thousand registration forms, as this will discriminate against minority voters.
Diplomats said that the proposed resolution could still be abandoned if the Council reaches an agreement over a Council declaration that requires the consent of all 15 states.
The proposed resolution also demands that Kofi Anan, the Secretary General of the United Nations, provide the Council with a quarterly report about the status of Syria's compliance.
The current proposed resolution was referred to the Security Council last week, after a report published by the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Anan, in which he discussed Syria's lack of compliance with the requirements of a previous resolution demanding it withdraws Syrian troops deployed in Lebanon.
Syria still has approximately 15 thousand soldiers in Lebanon after the re-deployment executed at the end of September.
Barnier's visit to Ramalla and his meeting with President Arafat late last June caused widespread Israeli criticism. Barnier asked whether Israel's interest was linked to a torn Palestinian society, or to the contrary with a strong community that permits it to control extremist movements and act as a credible partner?
On the other hand, Barnier announced that Europeans are finding it difficult to accept the constant deterioration of the Palestinians' situation.
Do they make your lives more secure?
Washington (AFP) - Public opinion polls taken by the Gallup Institute have shown that more than half of Americans trust the Democrats candidate for the White House, John Kerry, more than his Republican opponent President George Bush when it comes to solving the country's economic problems.
On the other hand, 51% of Americans stated they were dissatisfied with Bush's economic policy, in comparison to 46% who had a contrary opinion.
The percentage of blacks supporting Kerry is very much smaller than what Al Gore obtained in the 2000 elections, which was 90% in comparison to 8% for Bush.
Gaza - Ramallah (News Agencies) Knowledgeable Palestinian sources yesterday denied the Israeli reports saying that the Palestinian president Yasser Arafat  may potentially have to undergo surgery that could necessitate airlifting him to Cairo. They confirmed that he got over the severe "influenza" which he caught on Tuesday last week, and which necessitated the summoning of an Egyptian medical team last Monday evening. Sakhr Habash, member of Fatah's central committee and one of those close to the Palestinian president, said that the latter chaired a three-hour meeting of the movement's central committee on Monday evening and spend long hours into the night following the events in Gaza city where skirmishing broke out between members of the Preventative Security and those of Military Intelligence.
A debate... a symbolic torch
A "symbolic" torch
The committee is formed from about 20 Tunisian personalities from the political, law and parliamentary milieu and from the intelligentsia and academia circles.
The newsletter contains all news related to the activities of members of the Initiative's lists and those of the Attajdid Movement's candidate for the presidential elections, Mr. Mohamed Ali Halouani.
A Finale in Zaghouan
Outpatient clinics in hospitals open all day long
From this point, the supervising authority will start preparing to draft as flexible a system as possible that will allow the continuation of hospital and outpatient clinics all day long. The authority will concurrently provide better Emergency Care services through a plan drafted to improve them. In the same context we mention that with the start of year 2009 specialized medicine will be made accessible in all provinces.
Parallel to this, care is taken to ensure that all deliveries will be supervised and safe, occurring in clinics or hospitals so as to lower death rate to below 15 cases per every one thousand deliveries. Departments will be created on regional levels for mother and child healthcare in addition to drafting a practical plan to strengthen maternity and neonatal departments while ensuring the necessity of early diagnosis of congenital disabilities.
as each municipality will be required to establish at least a fitness center in which their citizens can practice their daily physical activity such as jogging, walking or aerobics, similar to what is available in developed countries, in addition to improving housing to permit good living.
The movement usually starts in the second half of the month of Ramadan. This habitual strolling by Tunisian families does, however, cause serious crowding in large patisseries selling feast sweets and in clothing departments, thus limiting the ability to choose well and buy one's needs in good conditions, and at the appropriate price and quality.
Shops in the centre of the city
Sfax
Behaving in specific and civilized ways was also stressed, such as choosing seasonal products currently available in the markets whose prices are appropriate to the purchasing ability; avoiding excessive hoarding and purchasing basic staples only as per usual family needs to avoid disturbing the balance between supply and demand; giving the health side of things its due attention and adopting a healthy consumerist attitude to avoid an unbalanced diet; and boycotting any products whose prices increase unreasonably.
Tozeur
The situation being what it is, despite the positive aspects achieved by previous rounds because of good organization, the awards given to participants in certain competitions and the economic dynamic which contributes in reviving the business sector throughout the time of the fair, we still have to stop at a few deficiencies. It is necessary to respect the discount percentages specified by the relevant authorities to safeguard the transparency of business transactions, preventing some exhibitors to mark up their prices at the start then use the discount factor so as to keep the real price within the limits set by these retailers. This did cause in many instances a slowing in the process of sales and purchases. In addition, exhibitors should be encouraged to present products that fit with the current fashion, as it has been noticed in some of the past rounds that the products lacked variety and good quality.
Another positive aspect are the entertainment shows at the Trade Fair grounds which contributed to creating a festive atmosphere with which the visitors interacted. It is expected that this kind of functioning will continue, and that during the new round the grounds will see various kinds of nightly entertainment shows. The organizers of the Fair have also allocated valuable prizes to the winners of the competitions organized every night. These entertainment shows, established by the Fair's internal radio station, have contributed in attracting thousands of visitors, especially family men. It should be remembered that the Tozeur Fair was an international fair in whose grounds participated many exhibitors from neighboring and friendly states such as Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, Iraq, Nigeria, Senegal, Russia and other countries. Everybody is looking forward to making this round successful in providing shoppers with opportunities to choose what is suitable for them from their viewpoint in terms of their feast needs and home furnishings.
Tunis - Assabah  The chairman of the Central Bank, Tawfiq Bakkar, presided over a meeting the day before yesterday, organized by the Tunisian Professional Association of Banking and Financial Institutions, at the headquarters of the Arab Institute for Business Directors on the full convertibility of the Tunisian dinar and the economic horizons of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's election agenda.
With regard to full liberalization of the dinar, the chairman of the Central Bank said that "this course will be gradual a one and does not mean the dinar will be fully liberalized by 2009." This line is aimed at further supporting the competitiveness of Tunisian institutions by allowing them to fully retain their foreign currency funds from export transactions.
According to Tawfiq Bakkar, the features offered by complete liberalization of the dinar must be accompanied by measures and mechanisms such as the need to regulate overall budgets.
Movaz warns of "state" being torn apart and rabbis call on soldiers to disobey orders
On Tuesday, the leader of the opposition Labor, Shimon Peres, said he feared the Israeli prime minister would be subject to assassination by Jewish extremists as Israel prepares to commemorate the ninth anniversary of the assassination of Labor Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
He said voting day would be a holiday in settlement schools and settlers would come in their thousands by car and hold up traffic around parliament.
At the close of the meeting, the two men described it as "positive."
It is extremely dangerous for Zionism too."
New York (news agencies) - American press sources revealed that American intelligence "C.
The newspaper said in a report the day before yesterday that officials from the intelligence agency were convinced American soldiers would be met with a warm welcome once they entered southern Iraq and that they suggested smuggling in hundreds of small American flags into Iraq so that "joyful" Iraqis could wave them in front of the American "liberators," with the intelligence agency filming these scenes in a film to be beamed throughout the Arab world for it to be the ultimate press operation. However, General David Mckiernan, commander of the allied ground forces, opposed the idea quickly and so that American forces would not be perceived as an occupying army, the press operation was called off.
Will the political and economic crisis in Lebanon intensify?
A Lebanese banker, who follows Syrian-Lebanese relations closely, told Agence France Press that "Syria's problem with the international community is the true concern for Lebanon more so than the issue of elections."
Al-Hariri's resignation comes as Damascus and its ally the Lebanese government openly announced their rejection on Tuesday evening of the statement by the presidency of the Security Council, unanimously approved by Council members, reiterating firm support for "Lebanon's independence" by putting in place a mechanism for monitoring implementation of resolution 1559.
29 deputies out of 128 in al-Hariri's government refused to actually vote on the constitutional amendment.
Beirut (news agencies) Lebanese President Emile Lahud yesterday instructed the Syria-supporting deputy and former prime minister, Omar Karami, to set up the new government after the resignation of Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri, according to an official source.
Reuters news agency credited political sources as saying that former prime minister Omar Karami, an ally of Syria, has the best chance of running the government, as many ministers put forward his name to Lahud in their discussions with him.
As soon as he is elected prime minister, he will hold parliamentary talks on the form his government will take before he announces its formation, a process which will end within a few days.

caught red-handed in the flat. In the same operation, they also arrested the main suspect who was, at the time, sentenced to six months imprisonment and who promised to return to his neighborhood and desist from such perverse activities and behavior. However, soon after leaving prison he decided to continue his dubious activity which provided him with a source of income and made use of the flats he built to make them available to "lovers" for large sums of money. But these offenses and immoral behavior disturbed the neighbors who expressed their displeasure and informed the police.
Tunis -  Assabah Mr. Mohamed Nagib al-Shabi announced in a press conference held yesterday at his party headquarters that the leadership of the Progressive Democratic Party has decided to withdraw from the legislative elections to be held tomorrow Sunday.
Didn't the party candidates have about an hour and a half on radio and an hour and a half on television?
In addition, al-Shabi recognized that withdrawing at this stage would not lead to withdrawal of ballots with his party's candidates from polling stations because the withdrawal came after the legal deadline allowing this.
Involving educators and administration in identifying schooling priorities and needs
Moreover, and in order to enable each school to set out an administrative plan to identify its needs and goals precisely and to specify its interventions and priorities, the idea was proposed that school boards should be permitted to come up with a comprehensive project for each school based on its particular characteristics in order to pinpoint proposed priorities so as to improve efficiency and to establish a basis for joint cooperation between administration, teachers and parents which will contribute to developing the institution's functioning and advancing its performance and efficiency.
What of New Measures to Spread Digital Education in Schools?
To this end, training courses for educators have been included in order to train them in this field as part of a program for continuous education for the educational structure that will be responsible for information and communications technology activities for teachers from the general and vocational sectors. Sessions will be timetabled in on a weekly basis and incorporated into the school's pedagogical structure, with a weekly record kept covering most curricular activities for technological instruction and other areas of education, cultural clubs in all departments and a booklet in which to record new material learned in school and the weekly use made of this session.
Director-General of the Tunisian Internet Agency to "Assabah":
This introduction is a quick survey of the set of ideas passed onto us by Doctor Firyal al-Baji, director-general of the Tunisian Internet Agency as well as a university researcher into artificial intelligence and an active expert in the field of communications and information technology on the national and international scenes.
Incentives approved by the head of state to encourage businesses and young researchers will provide the impetus to achieve this aim which will be achieved through involvement in employing and exporting Tunisian expertise and creating an active dynamic in the national arena. Mrs. Firyal also adds that creating virtual industry space in each governorate will create economic movement in the regions based on artificial intelligence programming and solutions, software and services with regulation of artificial intelligence and developing its various applications, especially those aimed at disabled people given the huge cost at present.
Doctor Firyal al-Baji, director-general of the Tunisian Internet Agency, also raised the issue of building an information community, stating that this must necessarily involve developing human resources given that the latter element represents the cornerstone for building such a community and giving impetus to e-commerce. Tunisia, which has placed its faith in humans, is working on giving all its citizens an opportunity to participate actively in the new revolution and grasp the reins of communication and information technology. A quick reading of higher education and professional training indexes gives us a clear idea of the Tunisian course where the number of students studying media and communications is over 34 thousand and is expected to be close to 50 thousand by the year 2009, which highlights the clear, guiding vision on which the Tunisian choice is based.
Palestinian Authority condemns... and Hamas pledges
Two of these attempts, which he escaped, killed his sons Bilal and Mohamed.
Two Palestinian activists were also martyred by occupation bullets as they attempted to implement a commando operation against an Israeli military unit near the Nahal Aouz crossing in the eastern suburb of al-Shaja'ia in the town of Gaza.
The Israeli Justice Minister Yose Lipid criticized the call by some rabbis for religious soldiers to refuse army orders when settlements are evacuated and described this as an incitement to mutiny.
Observers think it likely that Sharon will win over 64 out of 70 deputies for his withdrawal plan, even if Shas deputies do not vote for it.
The axis of the debate is on the subject of whether to receive a delegation of Israeli geographers.
I truly believe that there is no reason at this time to receive this particular category of Israelis who draw on their identity as researchers from the heart of Israeli arrogance in occupying land and falsifying maps.
In Al Munastir
This information led police officers to intensify their investigations and inquiries which enabled them to narrow down their suspicion to three young men whose business had been going through financial difficulty for a while but who managed to find a solution of sorts to their accumulated financial problems.
Karima
Judicial police investigators in Al Manzah succeeded in uncovering the identity of the principal suspect in a burglary on a wealthy man's house in the region and seizing all the stolen goods whose total value is estimated to be tens of thousands of dinars.
As the grip on him tightened, he retracted his statement and confessed to the truth, saying that when his employer left for a minor pilgrimage to Mecca, he had this idea and quickly carried it out.
Selection today
This voting day comes as the crowning stage of a presidential and parliamentary electoral campaign which has generally taken place in a civilized atmosphere, allowing the contenders to present their agendas, particularly through radio and television broadcasts. The number of slots allocated to opposition parties has been five times higher than the slots allocated to the Democratic Constitutional Rally.
For those who have not received their cards, the Electoral Code makes it possible for them to obtain their cards at the municipality where they are registered, even on voting day.
We have also taken the initiative to create a National Elections Observatory which includes independent national figures to monitor all its stages and assess it in a report to be submitted to the President of the Republic.
We have given instructions to facilitate the task of observers and to enable them to follow the voting process so that their monitoring is direct and their assessment objective and fair.
I am certain that you will turn out in large numbers and that you will take into consideration Tunisia's interest, and nothing but this interest, when casting  your vote.''
Voting begins in polling stations, in accordance with section two of Order 1564 for the year 2004 dated July 14, 2004, at seven thirty in the morning and ends at four thirty in the afternoon.

Tunisia - Assabah: At a time when women's presence in the professional arena has reached an elevated position, this status is to be further reinforced in the coming years with a set of important measures to support women's role in the family, on the one hand, and their political and social presence, on the other.
Within the context of personal circumstances, it is also expected that the right of grandfathers and grandmothers, in addition to the parents, to visit grandchildren in nurseries will be endorsed in the near future. This is because grandparents, by virtue of blood links and as a result of continued contact between families, still play an important role in bringing up children.
Women's presence in primary education currently stands at 51%, 48% in secondary education and 40% in higher education. The percentage of women working in the medical professions has reached about 40% and women represent 31% of lawyers and 27% of judges. The percentage of women in agriculture and sea fishing is 32% and 43% in factories. Politically, 11.5% of parliamentary members are women, 21% of municipality board members and 16% of economic and social boards, percentages which will be increased over the coming years.
Tunis - Assabah: A number of ministries are organizing external assessments by examination to appoint a number of candidates as a function of the conditions and the number of required plans.

6 American soldiers wounded west of Baghdad
He added that "the explosion happened as policemen gathered to start their training course."
He added: "Nine Iraqi opposition gunmen were killed and three others wounded."
Sami Mansour said the gunmen arrived in the morning on board two minibuses and fired in the air when people tried to stop them from entering Bahrez
New American casualties
An Agence France Presse correspondent saw a military tank on fire at the site of the attack which was cordoned off by the American army.
It is rare for the American army to announce the capture of a member of the network in the town which it surrounded tightly on October 14 and against which it carried out intense air raids and storming operations.
Unilateral Israeli Withdrawal Plan from Gaza Strip:
After a long period of rumors and gossip behind the scenes, sources close to Sharon said he is determined to dismiss any minister or deputy minister who votes against the government's decision concerning the separation plan or who abstains from voting or who is absent from the Knesset session.
"Yediot Ahronot" newspaper said the day before yesterday that Barak will officially announce, at the end of this November, his challenge for presidency of the Israeli Likud party and his candidacy for prime minister.
The newspaper said that at the heart of this vision is the need to "completely disengage" from the West Bank after the plan to end engagement with the Gaza Strip is implemented.
While the United Nations' annual commemoration no longer means much to many of the deprived nations of the world, and this for many years since faith in the United Nations was shaken and its position declined with the decline and dwindling of the authority of international law, reinstatement of this commemoration today, in view of the many current challenges and dangers, is aimed at re-affirming that the lack of a clear concept of justice separate from the rule of force, the policy of double standards and measures which impose the choices of the powerful over the weak, was and is one of the principal reasons behind the lack of political and food security and the absence of peace and stability in many parts of the world.
And apart from Iraq's pain and its wounds and failures, and apart also from the series of recurrent admissions, which are not likely to end yet be this by senior American or UN officials concerning the mistakes which accompanied the decision to go to war in Iraq, the organization's record lost a great deal of its sheen a long time ago, such that the United Nations has become more like an organization offering humanitarian aid to regions afflicted by disaster were it not for the Security Council's decisions which every once in a while come to disavow this image.

Tunis (WAT) - Polling stations yesterday saw the presence of a large number of foreign observers who monitored the casting of votes for the October 2004 presidential and legislative elections. A number of observers told Tunisia-Africa news agency of their impressions of the voting process. Mr. Abdalwadoud Abdullah, advisory minister with the Mauritanian presidency, said "the atmosphere in the polling stations we visited was very good and voters came to the polling stations freely and spontaneously. The voting process was normal and I did not notice any breaches or infringements of any sort which is indicative of the citizens' awareness of the importance of the election process in bolstering the country's democratic path."
"I noted the existence of the conditions needed to ensure the election process took its correct course at the polling stations and the good material and organizational preparation for the elections which were conducted within the confines of transparency and credibility. I also felt the satisfaction of voters who expressed their pleasure at what they were doing without pressure and their faith in the person they choose as leader of their country or their representatives in the legislative parliament.
Mr. Montineya Mondast of the Democratic Republic of Congo:
Tunisian Families and Eating Behavior During Ramadan:
On seeing these statistics, it crosses the mind that eating habits, or eating in general, is linked to a particular month and not to the rest of the year for Tunisians and this is obviously not right because healthy eating involves giving the body what it needs and is related to particular indicators such as age, health condition, physiology as well as physical activity and movement.
The imbalance in quantity is caused by a change in shopping habits so that while shopping is generally confined to the end of the week, it suddenly becomes a daily occurrence with most families, and sometimes more than once a day.
These eating habits definitely have repercussions on the family budget. If most of the salary is spent on breaking the fast, what about other expenses?
Displaying Prices:
But it would appear that many traders refuse this right and do not abide by the law, proposing prices according to their whims and in a verbal manner.
Breaches with vegetables, fruits and meats.
The vegetable and fruit counter in various local shops also suffers from this problem.
Dalinda Bazawi mentioned clothing, shoes, second-hand and bridal gown stores, saying: "Most of them do not give the price and each time we have to ask about the price without knowing if it's the correct one or if it's inflated."
They are not aware that they are widening the chasm between them and customers and are losing their trust in them.
Why Do Some Married Couples Stop Wearing their Wedding rings?
The issue of whether or not to wear a wedding ring is not a social problem but many married women are not happy about their husbands not wearing this wedding ring, simple in appearance and complex in meaning, because they see their husbands abandon the wearing of their wedding rings as meaning they have forgotten about them and no longer care for them. Some husbands, on the other hand, justify this issue as simply a matter of convention and formality with no value because love springs from the heart and not from the finger. This is the view of Mr. Nagi al-Shabani, a middle-aged man in his fifties who considers that the wedding ring is not a problem and whether it is worn on the finger or not is not a problem: "Personally, I stopped wearing a wedding ring in the early days of my marriage even though I love my wife who is my companion and I have never been unfaithful to her."

Sofia Sadeq did not arrange "Ahib Albilad" and the poet Mohamed Al-Saghir Awlaad Ahmed said "my relationship with musicians began with Sofia Sadeq as a result of the poem "Ahib Albilad," a well respected work of poetry that I offered to Mohamed al-Majiri but, with the exception of this well-known recording, I haven't seen this poem filmed in a music clip...
My relationship with Amina Fakhit is one of shared humanity... she is my friend... she has the same artistic and creative sentiments and when the opportunity arose to make this a reality... we worked with Hisham Hamreet to produce something new..."
The poet said that musical knowledge is needed in order to write songs enjoyable to the ear and that singers need to read and memorize the poem.
It was expected that the performer Amina Fakhit would take part in this event but she withdrew at the last moment. At the soiree, which was attended by a satisfactory audience, Mohamed Al-Saghir Awlaad Ahmed presented a collection of his poems which met with the audience's appreciation... keeping in mind that the Tunis City Cultural Center established among its activities a cultural and creative committee through which patrons of the center would meet monthly with great artists in a cultural field for discussion and dialogue on many issues related to creativity.

It appears that the suspect marshaled all his swindling skills and abilities to convince the victim of his talents in this area and made him believe there was buried treasure in the ground on which he built his house and asked him for ten thousand dinars to get it out.
In spite of this, he was brought before the judicial authorities under arrest and his denial was regarded as an evasion of legal proceedings.

The first of these crucial points is the customers' feeling of safety in buses, the Metro or train lines and their sense of safety in stations. The second crucial point concerns information in terms of whether information about routes, notifications and timetables is adequate for customers of the transport company.
It should be recalled that the Tunisia Transport Company conducts this survey every two years to monitor the extent to which services offered by the company have improved.

No doubt all these traits and details will not escape the notice of clever investors who nonetheless continue to prefer bank financing to money market financing in spite of the positive aspects of financing by the latter and which the investor grades as "good," the most obvious of which is the absence of financing costs, contrary to loans.
Industry

Tunis - Assabah: The European Union and Syria initiated a partnership agreement today October 19, 2004 in Brussels, allowing Syria to join what is known as the Barcelona Process which includes countries of the southern and northern Mediterranean coast.
Politically, this agreement raised the banner of systematic political dialogue covering combined international issues, as well as the banner of democracy and human rights. This course is aimed at creating a climate of peace and cooperation within the horizons of 2010.
In reality, financial aid resulting from the Barcelona agreement is seen as having little consequence, for example it represents 34.0% of Morocco's gross domestic product and 0.7% of Tunisia's product. This aspect, i.e. the lack of allocated resources, has allowed the southern Mediterranean countries to "haggle" about how this aid is spent and some countries have refused money allocated by the "MIDA" program for specific areas because of disagreements on how it should be spent.

This agency, part of Fitch International, designates three out of the five banks as state-supported which means these banks receive a "2" rating in terms of outside support, by which is meant the type of support enjoyed by banks outside the banking organization (represented mainly by Banque de l'Habitat,  Societe Tunisienne de Banque, Banque Nationale Agricole).
The Societe Tunisienne de Banque, Banque Nationale Agricole and Banque de l'Habitat are public banking institutions where the state holds the lion's share of capital while the International Arab Bank of Tunisia and Amen Bank are banking institutions with private capital.
Ridha Mami says that arranging such exposure will have a positive effect on tourism in Tunisia, especially as Tunisia is close to Spain and enjoys modern tourist facilities in addition to sea, sun and desert.
The coming months look to be promising and reservations are being made and gradually increasing and, after a satisfactory summer, early signs look promising. I think it is possible to increase sales over the coming months and we hope to reach over 50 thousand tourists. We must mention here that our dealings with the Iberostar chain, which promotes many Tunisian resorts, have been excellent and in order to support Saharan tourism, we have decided to schedule two charter flights starting from November 1 from Barcelona-Madrid and Tozer, a further asset that will contribute to bringing large numbers of Spaniards to southern Tunisia.
Everyone watches Faisal Bilzain these days on the satellite channel Tunis 7 in the role of "Asil" the cafe waiter in the series "Hotel," the main topic of this interview.
- an ordinary person from a real-life situation...
- Actors in Tunisia don't have a very wide margin of freedom in choosing the roles they want so, as a result, the producer is the one who assigns roles and it is up to the actor to do his best to live up to this choice...
- In the series "Ind Aziz", I had a strong role...
* Didn't you have any margin of freedom in how you played "Asil"?
- I admit that the rhythm of events has lost its sparkle and luster, as opposed to the content which remains cohesive and clear...

Gaza (news agencies) - Palestinian eye witnesses said Israeli forces, which began a widespread operation in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip last Sunday night resulting in 17 deaths, withdrew yesterday morning to the surrounding settlements west of Khan Younis.
The Israeli army has destroyed 23 buildings and houses in Khan Younis since the start of the operation.
The security source said that citizens were not able to bury all the dead the day before yesterday because a number of tanks were stationed in the cemetery.
The medical source told Agence France Presse that "the citizen, Mohamed Abdulazziz Abu Muammar (28 years) died as a result of being shot in the stomach by Israeli occupation soldiers near the Supha crossing where cement is transported."

Observers say that launching the withdrawal plan will require another vote by the coalition government led by Sharon next March.
During discussions of his plan at the Knesset (parliament), and which will lead to the relocation of eight thousand settlers for the first time in 37 years of occupation, Sharon said "withdrawal does not replace negotiations.
Sharon mentioned that he said in 1998 that "in order to keep land gained in 1997, the land will have to be shared" with the Palestinians.
The Israeli Prime Minister said at the start of his speech that he was determined to "complete" the disengagement process from the Palestinians through the withdrawal of Israeli forces and relocation of settlers from the West Bank.
At the end of his speech, Sharon shook hands with the opposition leader Shimon Peres who backed his withdrawal plan in a speech to parliament and warned again that Israel would lose its "Jewish and democratic" nature by preserving its rule over Palestinian land.
Once again the American administration finds itself facing a new predicament in a series of recurring predicaments in Iraq and which its has to deal with and overcome with the minimum of cost in this critical week before the presidential elections are held on November 2. This comes after emergence of details concerning the disappearance of tons of explosives which went missing in Iraq and which were being guarded by American forces. In spite of all attempts and efforts by senior American officials to contain the crisis and lessen the impact of the scandal, the reality is that it will leave its imprint very clearly on public opinion in the run up to the election campaign.
The loss of tons of explosives in Iraq since the first week the American forces entered this country is an inevitable consequence and will not cause surprise or condemnation for it is simply a reflection of the failure of American choices based on the law of force.
Two car chases uncover Moroccan smuggling ring
The details of the first operation show that secret information reached the ears of the National Guard in Qasrain suggesting that a young man was involved in a suspicious activity likely to involve drug smuggling between Tunisia and a neighboring country. It seems the delicacy of the mission drove the judicial authorities to issue judicial delegation allowing investigators with the National Guard's central drug prevention team to look into the details of the case. They secretly watched the suspect and observed his movements and, during one of the past nights, learned that he had entered a neighboring country clandestinely then returned to Tunisia and traveled by car. His whereabouts were ascertained and he was chased to the outskirts of Hajib Aliyoun in the province of Qairawan where officers arrested him and seized five kilos of drugs expertly hidden in the car's bodywork and which he confessed he had bought from a Moroccan citizen.

- Along with Arab observer colleagues, I visited a number of polling stations in Tunis the capital and in the town of Qiarawan. I also visited the election campaign headquarters of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and one of the opposition candidates in the presidential elections, Mr Mohamed Bouchiha, as well as the National Observatory on elections and the League for Human Rights. I met with Abdulwahab al-Bahi and Zakaria Ben Mustapha and heard appraisals of the observatory's performance and its links with various opposition lists. From the information available to me and the polling stations I visited, I did not note any obvious breaches or serious transgressions and I congratulate our Tunisian brothers on the success of the election process.

After the American elections
In a Report by Ibrahim Boulihya, Member of the Algerian People's Assembly:
* The election campaign was conducted within the confines of transparency, fairness and refined democratic practices.
Coherent organization
- structuring polling stations in accordance with legislation in force.
- Ensuring security and calmness in the polling stations without security officers entering the polling stations.
The report concluded by recording the events of the voting operation:
- We would also like to congratulate the Democratic Constitutional Rally for its wise leadership and its achievement of this great victory which demonstrates its rootedness in the popular classes.
Tunis - Assabah  Long car traffic jams, chaos, the sound of horns getting louder everywhere: this is the least of the daily scenes people have become used to during the month of Ramadan and other months, especially during peak hours and when employees leave their place of work. This scene is not limited to the capital's center and main roads but now affects all its entry points from four directions, whether toward the southern suburb and Ben Arous or toward the northern suburb and Buhaira area or in the direction of Manzah, Nasr or the Bardo Aldandan area via Bab Sadoun. In order to limit this phenomenon, which is growing from day to day, the municipality of Tunis has recently taken a set of measures to ensure greater flow of private cars and transport vehicles in the capital. According to our sources at the capital's municipality, these measures come after a day-to-day, careful study of the problems of traffic flow and the complaints made by citizens and which often result in car drivers behaving irresponsibly.
These trucks will be able to use November 7 road for those coming from the north or cross via Route 10001 for those coming from the south, in addition to tightening up surveillance on cars stopping on the main roads, especially April 9 street.
Two Citizens Smash Glass of Bus and Metro Car
The first incident: a bus smashed with a stick
The second incident took place at about the same time near Tunis Marine Station when a woman smashed a Metro car which had just left a repair workshop and was headed toward the passenger station. It seems that a dispute between this woman and a passerby made her take out her anger on the car in front of her so that she threw stones at it and smashed its glass!
These prices which some butchers have adopted did not hold up for long in the face of imported meat and people's demand for it and their prices which remain accessible to all classes since prices have fallen to stabilize in many places at 10 to 11 dinars.

For the First Time in Lebanon's History:
For the first time in modern Lebanese history, the government includes two women among its members, Layla al-Salh the daughter of the president of the 1943 independence government Riyadh al-Salh and aunt of Saudi-Lebanese business man Alwalid Ben Talal, and Wafa' Hamza, an official at the Ministry of Agriculture close to Nabih Berri.
Among the ministers close to Karameh are Minister of Finance Elias Saba and Minister of Education Sami Minqara.
Karameh said after the announcement was made of his government's composition that he had hoped for "everyone's involvement" in a reference to the absence of supporters of Jumblatt, Hariri and the Christian opposition in the government.
It appears that the dismissal of Elias al-Mur and the appointment of Franjieh, a personal friend of Syrian President Bashir al-Assad, is a blow to Lahud and an attempt by the Syrian leadership to create a balance of power between its allies in Lebanon.
Following the announcement of Karameh's assignment, Washington became aware that Syrian interference in Lebanese affair is continuing.
As for "An-Nahar", it saw it as a "government whose creators tried to lighten its gloominess with two female faces for the first time in Lebanon but it remained on a course that led to a prolongation of powerlessness and problems with the international community and to subordination to Syrian hegemony."
The reporter said the occupation army destroyed houses and bulldozed land surrounding Nitsaran and Moraj and bombed a national security site with heavy weapons near the Sophia crossing to the north of Rafah town in the southern Strip.
The occupation army brought military reinforcements to the Beit Hanoun crossing in the northern Strip and the area surrounding of the settlement of Nissanit. Palestinian security sources said army vehicles were stationed close to the crossing in preparation for what appears to be another attack in response to the site being targeted by the resistance.
In Nablus in the northern West Bank, an Israeli settler killed a Palestinian boy who was harvesting olives near the settlement of Yitzahar.
Investigators with the National Guard's investigation and inspection team in Jandouba uncovered the details of a murder in a countryside area at dawn on Monday October 11, the victim of which was a fifty-year-old woman.
After examining the site in Jandouba, investigators with the National Guard's investigation and inspection team promised to look into the facts of the case according to the letters rogatory issued by the investigating judge. They called in the dead woman's daughter to hear her statement where she said she had been with her mother in the house when her relative stormed at dawn accompanied by her son.

Or is the parliamentary set going to reproduce the previous "version" of parliament?
The Tunisian parliament in its many versions (1994 and 199) has seen in-depth political debates which would appear for a while then disappear. Parliamentary dialogue within parliament has also succeeded in making the chamber of deputies a space for political dialogue and debate on ideas and positions on general affairs whereby many issues were put forward such as the of intricacies of progress, political reform, freedom, human rights, the assembly's relationship with the state and the role of the opposition.
The country is moving into a major political phase which will doubtless be different from previous phases. Parliament, in its capacity as a fundamental and constitutional framework for legal and political discussion, is called upon to be a driving force for the coming period, and this will not happen unless there are at least two factors:

American newspaper: American army loses control over Ramadi Governorate
The army's statement indicated that several intelligence reports confirmed that members of this group were planning to launch new attacks on Iraqi security forces and innocent civilians.
In the region of Baqouba, three Iraqis, including two policemen, were killed and four others were injured in two attacks that took place the evening of the day before yesterday in the area located northeast of Baghdad.
Targeting Reporters
Reporters working in Iraq are faced with the risks of being kidnapped in addition to the daily violence and lack of security prevalent in the country.
The Al Jazeerah Satellite News Channel, based in Doha, said the day before yesterday, Wednesday, that the Islamic Army Group in Iraq, which is one of the Iraqi groups fighting the interim Iraqi government and the American army, took responsibility for the killing operation.
No reports were immediately available on casualties.
Nevertheless, the New York Times Newspaper reported yesterday that the American army and the interim Iraqi government are rapidly losing control of this city, which is located near Fallujah.

The security agents at Haisher Circle are currently looking for the stolen items and working on solving this case to help the victim who suddenly lost her future.

Tunis - Al Sabah: With the large expansion witnessed by the university hub in Manuba, the problems of school and university transportation have been increasing in intensity year after year with the progressive increase in the number of students in the hub side by side with the building expansion being witnessed by the city of Manuba.  The construction of the new metro line planned for the university complex is considered a big qualitative improvement in transportation services in this area since this line will extend about 5 kilometers starting from the end of metro line number 4 in the vicinity of Dindan with a double rail line comprising 8 main intersections.
According to the engineering plan, the line consists of 8 stations, and it will be the second station that will allow about 21900 square meters of central linkage between the bus, the metro, and multi-purpose means of transportation.  It will contain 3 terminals for buses.  The metro station is equipped with a rail intersection for the return and another for passing, in addition to a garage that holds about 252 vehicles, and an integrated unit for response and services that houses personnel such as the station manager, the security office, the ticket sales booth, a tavern, an information office, and one for fitness.
Arafat Begins Journey for Treatment in France
Two Jordanian military helicopters had left Ramallah, with Arafat on board one of them, heading to Jordan where a French jet was waiting at Marka Airport near the Jordanian capital's suburbs to transport him directly to Paris.
Palestinian ministers said that Arafat is very weak, but it is a temporary setback.
A large crowd of supporters surrounded the helicopter and hundreds watched him from the roofs of houses as Arafat left to the Jordanian capital, Amman, on the first leg of his trip.
Shaath insisted that Arafat's absence is temporary and said: He is a sick man in need of treatment.
In Ramallah, Raymonda Al Tawil, Arafat's mother-in-law, said that the Palestinian leader's spirits are good, but people are scared nevertheless.
The French presidential office had said earlier that France will dispatch a plane to carry Arafat.
Her arrival from France came at a time when Palestinian officials aired pictures in which Arafat was seen sitting with doctors.
Requesting not to be identified, one of them told Agence France-Presse on Thursday that the blood cells that usually fight microbes are destroying the blood platelets.
Washington, in turn, has expressed its hope that Arafat receive the necessary treatment and avoided making any political statement about Yasser Arafat, who it has been demanding his ouster for a long time.
The Belgian Prime Minister, Guy Verhofstadt, was the first European leader to initial the European constitution.

Case documents show that several complaints were filed by a number of citizens (mostly young men) with various security offices in the Tunis Province who stated that they were subject to scams by an old man of sixty years of age.
Due to the seriousness of the matter, the investigators from the branch administration of criminal cases vowed to investigate the case and therefore conducted some inquiries.  Based on the descriptions the victims provided, they managed to focus suspicions on a man who looked dignified, and they detained him.

The man did not waste time and dashed to the home owner who, as soon as he showed her his good intentions, showered him with her prayers and expressions of thanks.  When he felt that the lady was responding to his claim of what he could do, he asked her to bring him a gas cylinder which was about empty in order for him to replace it with a full one.  She did not object to giving it to him so he carried it on his shoulders and went back to the woman guide who had met earlier, especially that he was confident she was still going along what he set out to do.  He found her waiting, at which time he asked her to lend him a ten-dinar note, claiming he did not have any coins and that all he had was a thirty-dinar note.  She could help pay for replacing the gas cylinder and that he would repay her the full amount she had lent him, together with a few purchases.  She did not mind complying with his request.

Those close to Chirac did not rule out that the Palestinian Authority may have also considered other countries to receive Arafat but realized that the Palestinians have always sought the help of France in crises since the French military rescued Yasser Arafat in 1982 when the Israeli army was surrounding him in Beirut.

We have learned that agents have confiscated part of the stolen property consisting of electronic supplies and variable sums of money, and they referred the suspects to the investigation office to continue interrogating them before taking the customary legal action against them.
During one day this week, he was caught in the act with a young man close to his age as his accomplice, and they were both subsequently arrested.  Faced with condemning physical evidence, they found no way out of their dilemma but to confess to what they were accused of, and led to the location where they had hidden the stolen items.
As the temperature rises and drops throughout the course of the same day, a person is not able to choose the appropriate dress.

Most of the time, it comes from Europe.
This virus is known to change every ten years.

The Scottish newspaper reported that during a lecture she gave recently before law students, Cherie Blair attacked the White House policies with regard to the British citizens detained at Guantanamo.
The British Broadcasting Corporation reported on its internet site that a number of conservatives in the British opposition protested the positions of the Prime Minister's wife, considering that she has violated a political custom that prevents a political figure from acting in a biased way when abroad.
She added that President Kennedy united the country, and John Kerry will do the same thing, while President Bush is doing the exact opposite.
Results of a public opinion poll conducted recently in Britain and published yesterday by the Independent British Newspaper showed that the majority of Britons believe that the success of the Democratic candidate John Kerry in the American elections is the best outcome for world security.
50 percent said that a Kerry win will weaken Blair's international stature, while 42 percent expressed their belief to the contrary.
Tunis - The Weekly: With the month of Ramadan into its third week, store windows have changed and are completely ready to welcome their parents and children customers to buy the Eid's necessities, usually distinguished by ready-made clothes, shoes, and toys.  This is in addition to the Tunisian sweets that are more likely to be bought than made at home, especially since working women prefer to buy to save time, money and effort.  Midtown visitors nowadays, especially during Ramadan's late evenings, notice the pushing and crowdedness that last until midnight.
As for the reasons behind the delay in buying the clothes, Ali stressed that he is a non-permanent employee at a private company, and his income does not allow him to save a portion in advance.
His comment was backed by Al Wali Khalid Ismael who indicated that store owners take advantage of this period to manipulate and not advertise their prices.  The customer is left behind as the victim.
The odd thing is that the rush of those citizens to the flea market is not limited to clothes and shoes but includes toys, despite the uncleanable germs they carry.

Our storyteller wept as she narrated the details of her tragedy, which she has yet to find a solution despite the simple attempts she has made and said: My father, may God bless his soul, is named Masood Ben Abdullah and was earlier named Masood Al Barhoumi.  He was born in the year 1918 in the city of Douz, then he migrated to the north and settled in the city of Bourguiba House in Bizerte, where he married and his wife bore him three sons named Lazhar, Bashir, and Ali.
Our storyteller pauses, and then resumes the conversation by saying: Why should we be deprived of seeing our brothers?

The same source explained that many other violations were logged and were reported by many citizens, such as health violations at a rate of 14.3% of all complaints, services at a rate of 8.2%, conditional sales at nearly 6% of all calls, scale fraud at a rate also exceeding 6%, cheating at 4%, and quality at 2%.
It is noted that the Consumer Advocacy Organization had issued a notice to the consumer before the advent of Ramadan in which it urged him to act moderately and to protect himself against violations by resisting the conditional sale, demanding the advertising of prices, exercising his right of choice, sticking to prices, and boycotting the items that are subject to a noticeable increase in prices...
But staying up late with friends is more enjoyable
And how do they compensate missing the family settings?
Despite that, I try to take advantage of the time we have before the residence closes to go out with friends and try to enjoy the Ramadan ambiance in the capital Tunis.
About the places they spend their evenings, Miss (N) adds, Most evenings are spent at the cafes since these places take on a distinct Tunisian character during this month.  In addition, the cafes have everything available, even ice cream can be found there in addition to good company, and therefore, they are the preferred place.  This does not stop us from attending some of the distinct city festival evenings if money is available, but if not, just walking around in the capital at night, going into the big stores and looking at the displays, especially the clothes, is considered a form of entertainment in itself.
Therefore, being away from family in Ramadan did not prevent our female students from finding alternatives that can provide similar settings like the truly special family Ramadan ambiance.
The role of actress Samia Al Ayyari in the Syrian series Scheherazade and the Last Tale, by Director Shawqi Al Majiri, represented an important addition to the career of this actress since it was the first time that she plays a role in classic Arabic outside of Tunisia.  During the time she played Samah in the current Ramadan series Accountabilities and Reprimand with Samia Al Ayyari, we had this dialogue with her in which she revealed many of her artistic concerns stemming from her participation in Scheherazade and the Last Tale
- Yes, there's luck and there's also (acceptance), talent and self-confidence, especially since this experience gave me the opportunity to meet for the first time the capable Syrian actress Mona Wassif and actor Jihad Saad.  I am not revealing a secret when I say that the Tunisian director Shawqi Al Majiri made me psychologically comfortable.
- I have liked and loved this project, besides all actors were on my side.  My biggest fear was the way I spoke classic Arabic because I was afraid I wouldn't be able to make my performance harmonious with the way people from the orient speak classic Arabic.
- Although the role was minor, it has had a big impact on the development of events.. I played the character of Kawther who is the reason for Scheherazade's woman complex after she left him and married his brother.  I can assure you that my role opened wide prospects for me to enrich my career and diversify my artistic career.
* Why Samah?
* Between Kawther and Samah, which of the two roles was closer to you?
* Away from the television drama, what about the theatre in Samia Al Ayyari's career?

Such are clips that may seem simple to some, but they are difficult in terms of the idea, creativity, planning and execution.  Their creators do not simplify the matter but instead they study them thoroughly and work very hard, especially since they depend on anticipation that must not be repeated so as not to become old.  Besides, you will find something new that you have not seen before in every clip, which demonstrates vivid imagination and open-mindedness.  Any normal person sitting in a cafe, driving his car, or walking in the street, being the victim of the practical jokes and as the real object, contributes to the success of such clips with his spontaneity and humor because no matter what happens to him, when he discovers what is going on, he laughs wholeheartedly without overreaction, anxiety and commotion...
Therefore, as much as these comic clips have made us happy, they have also made us sad because they made us face the reality we mentioned.
I do not know if the young audience, who spent the evening at the Sport Dome at the park last Sunday night with Syrian artist Ali Al Deek, was convinced of the artist's voice or not.  He is known in Tunisia for being the artist of a single hit song that made him famous because of its light heartedness and the novelty of the video clip that took it from the local arena in Latakia in Syria and into the Arab domain.  It has become widely known by the name of Aloush being very close to singing in the northwest or in Algeria.  Many of those who have heard the song or watched its video clip thought it was performed by one of Rabih Diryasa's students, but he is in fact from the mountains of Syria in the suburbs of Latakia, a native of a village that has maintained its rural tradition.  Aloush> in this song means the spoiled Ali, as we say in Tunisia, Aloulou...
His friends from the band conspire with him as they interact with his songs and dance their own way.. At times, they leave their instruments to accompany the drum with group dances that are known in Syria for their beauty and intensity of expression.
With Events
The truth is that if one follows the climates that surrounded this race, one would realize that even though it did not, from an organizational point of view, deviate from past election campaign climates and advertisements, the events that took place side by side almost made it a unique event, internally and externally.
Despite all that accompanied the election campaign of commentary, scrutiny, and attempts to depict and understand the scope of the upcoming political map in defining relations between the United States and the rest of world countries, and despite all of the possibilities that were envisioned in case Bush stayed as president of the United States or in case of a return of the Democrats and a Kerry win, the time of the American presidential elections returns every time to affirm that if the faces and names of the White House leaders are subject to change according to the rules of the election game and choices of the American voter, the interests of the United States and its priorities are subject to change.
Whether Bush is able to keep his job or whether Kerry can defeat him, it is becoming obvious that it is likely that the American Arab relations will not witness a significant change at least in the foreseeable future, and that the current crises, from Iraq to Palestine and from Syria to Lebanon or Iran, will cast their shadows on the interests game between the two sides..
Popular Front Claims Operation:
The Palestinian National Authority has denounced the guerrilla operation.  The Minister of Negotiation Affairs, Saeb Erekat, said that the Authority condemns all operations that target Palestinian and Israeli civilians.
Israeli Deputy Defense Minister said, in turn, that the army is considering a response to the attack.  He said in a statement to Israeli Radio that military orders were issued to intensify the operations that target the infrastructure of what he called the Palestinian terrorist organizations.
Immediately after the blast, Israeli police closed all entrances to the market for fear of other booby traps planted in the area and in search for persons suspected of involvement in the guerrilla operation.
The Tel Aviv blast coincided with the start of a debate on a draft resolution by the Israeli Knesset related to offering compensations to settlers from the Gaza Strip and four settlements in the northern West Bank who are supposed to be evacuated under the framework of a unilateral withdrawal plan.
Since the launch of the Structural Reform Program in the year 1986, the characteristics and mechanisms of these establishments have developed such that partnership and openness to the outside world are the main strategy companies in Tunisia are employing.  This is confirmed by the results of a recent study that was conducted by the German Technical Cooperation Program in Tunisia on developing international trade.
According to the study, most of these companies realize the value of the services that support structures offer for developing foreign trade, but utilizing such structures remains limited.
It also showed that Tunisian companies are optimistic about their future outlook as 86% of them believe that their performance will improve following the implementation of their new export plans, improving the quality of their product, and making its management more effective.  Most companies are entangled with a host of problems dealing basically with prices and complexity of administrative procedures.  The study demonstrated along the same lines the importance of the role of the customs office in the success of the export process.
Tunis - Al Sabah The world has been undergoing fundamental demographic transformations for many years.  The on-going changes may have profound impact on economies, whether they are developed or developing.
In the developing countries, however, demographic transformations vary from region to region.  Countries in central and eastern Europe, Asian countries, and Latin American countries will witness beginning in the year 2015 a rise in the way of aging in the structure of the population pyramid.  Conversely, with the exception of some countries such as Tunisia, which experiences a demographic growth estimated at 1.08% and consequently will witness a rise in the aging rate that will reach a rate of 10% at the outset of the year 2030, the rest of the Middle East region and the African countries will witness a rise in the ratio of the young in the population composition.

In this context, informed Palestinian sources disclosed yesterday that Brigadier General Jibril Al Rajoob, the National Security Advisor, is heading a team that is conducting investigations on the possibility that a slow-acting poison, which leads to death that seems natural after a period of time, had been slipped into Arafat.

Instead of defending its decision, the Administration denied the hiring of former Iraqi officers.

WAR UNDER THE COVER OF INTERNATIONAL LEGITIMACY!
It is a resolution that postpones the ill-fated day rather than drops the war project off American calculations!

A- I call on (Coptic) people to run the elections. But, when they get frustrated with success, they will not nominate themselves. Elections need much money, if one spends money to no avail, it is better for him then to turn his back on such a matter.
We have no problems with the leaderships in this respect. Rather, the small (administrative) offices may impede such matters. I can cite here two examples; we had not any churches in South Sinai and then we referred the matter to President Mubarak who, in turn, issued a republican decree to have two churches built in Al-Tur and Sharm El-Sheikh.
This proposal has been the first of its kind since the signature of Camp David accord and the two country exchange of ambassadors.

Iran has several reasons that makes it believe that its national interests are compatible with the removal of the current Iraqi regime.
The Iranian regime that has opted for animosity with its neighbours seems to adopt a policy that is far from clear towards them. That's why we can safely say Iran has been unable so far to make the best use of its geopolitical advantages as well as the quandary undergone by its most serious regional opponent.
While the two countries can certainly find some areas where they can cooperate, observers think that Iran would finally lose if it sought full normalization with the current Iraqi regime. They say that Iran should be well aware of the Iraqi regime's record so full of problems. In case of full normalization with it, the sanctions imposed on it would be ignored, thus enabling it to buy its requirements via Iran. Iraq would be able once more to use the available funds for weapons purchases at the open international market with which it could threaten its neighbours including Iran itself.
If the new regime could persuade the international community to lift the sanctions, Iran might find it prudent to work out its calculations and set up good relations with it instead of regarding it as its archenemy.

DEMOCRATIZATION OF ISLAMIC PARTIES!
Wisdom & Response: Facing this intensive tripartite attack, the trend of political Islam, particularly the moderate factions, found itself in historic embarrassment and critical situation that needs wisdom and swift response with which it can deal with these internal and external variables and pressures on the one hand, and harmonize itself with the high tone of democracy that is dominant nowadays on the other.
From Radicalism to Participation: Besides, there are heralds of moving from the radicalism of political Islam - which sought to rule and establish an Islamic regime to substitute the infidel ones in line with the attempts of the Jihad and Islamic Group in Egypt, the Islamic Salvation Front and the Armed Islamic Group in Algeria (GIA), Taliban in Afghanistan, the National Islamic Front in Sudan and others - to participation anew in the movement of public, political and social movement, which swings between shy democratic change and centralism and control.
Therefore, facing this pounce, which is being accompanied by a strong anti-Islam Western campaign that incites people to abhor the Arabs and the Muslims will not be easy; i.e. through regretting violence or desiring to benefit from the democratic atmosphere, even if it is limited. To face this pounce, however, we need main surgeries to and radical changes in the ideas and methods of the movement of political Islam - surgeries and changes that will make it gain credibility, not only in front of America and the West, the assailants, but also in front of its Arab and Muslim societies, which fear and suspect it.
Sensitivities:
In this context, we cannot disregard the essential role that can be played by the moderate and enlightened political Islamic movement, as being a main component of the social movement side by side with the other ones, particularly the political parties and civil organizations. This moderate and enlightened political Islamic movement seeks to dismantle the artificial complex between Islam and democracy, a complex that has become an aggressive weapon in the hands of the manufacturers of hatred, aggression and extremism in the West these days!

But it is in the interest of the European Union to have Turkey in NATO, so that it may serve as a military colony and an exclusive base for NATO, but it is not in Europe's interest to make Turkey a member of the European Union.
He pointed out that the problem was not the veteran Turkish politicians or their followers, who still held Ataturk in high esteem. "The problem lies in the new generation and the ones after it, whose youths were weaned on the Internet and satellite television channels, and are learning lesson after lesson from the scholars of the Muslim world, even from Osama Bin Laden himself, every day and every hour, and there is nothing to do about it."

AL-HUDHEIBI: ATTEMPTING TO FOUND A PARTY IS A VAIN EFFORT WE WOULD NOT MAKE
The reverse might be true as that might bring upon us further harm."

The first came from the radical organizations - Jihad, Gamaa Islamiya (Islamic Group), Takfeer and Hijera (an organization that renders the society infidel), Taliban and Al-Qaeda - that have adopted violence and practiced terrorism over the past years. The second shock came from the sharpness of the American pounce, which placed all trends - moderates and extremists alike - in one basket and under one hammer, although the strikes against them differ from one trend to another. The third shock came from the ruling regimes in some Arab and Muslim countries. They found it a suitable opportunity to get rid of the trend of political Islam in general and move from the stage of besieging and containing it to the stage of elimination, especially as it is one of the strongest political active movements that can polarize the people's feelings in the name of religion; something that makes it challenge the ruling regimes.
It is clear that accumulative efforts inside this movement have helped in effecting this remarkable change from the phase of "absolute loyalty to the Imam or Guide through swearing by the Holy Quran to obey him through thick and thin" to the phase of the freedom of differences, multi-opinions and views. It is to be mentioned that the stage of "absolute loyalty" was established by the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) Group, Sheikh Hassan Al-Banna, in 1928 and is also observed by the Shiite Movement, considered to be the most ancient organization of political Islam, as it was founded more than 1400 years ago.
This movement will have to either sit fortified behind its outmoded methods and leaderships, return to violence an extremism, or develop their ideas and update its methods and policies; i.e. involve in the political social movement that aspires after democracy, justice and human development. Main Surgeries:
Other Challenges: Moreover, there are other challenges before these trends, if they are desirous to live in harmony, coexist and participate in the aspired-after democratic change. The most important challenges are represented in modernizing political ideology, updating religious discourse, renewing their leaderships, as the old ones are outdated, changing the "adventurous" leaders who were involved in armed violence. The challenges are also represented in introducing new leaders that are open to the domestic and international developments, benefiting from the wave of democracy and human rights that is spread worldwide, making use of the modern mass media and technology, which, among other points, destabilized the policy of the iron fist.
However, we here try to handle some aspects of this thorny issue from a different point of view. We call for reforming our conditions with our own hands in order to respond to necessary needs that stem from inside our societies, which suffer from poverty, backwardness and persecution, and which have the feelings of anger, hatred and rebellion. Such reform, for which we call, is not a mere response to American pressure or Western temptation that sees its vital interest in modifying, updating and modernizing Islam, the Arabs and the Muslims and pushing them forcibly towards the path this pressure and temptation want!

They also include granting credit privileges and facilities to the high-tech projects to turn out products of high quality and competitiveness, establishing new branches of the Industrial Development Bank in governorates to streamline financing industrial projects in addition to coordinating with the Social Fund for Development to provide the necessary finance for bankrolling institutions with a view to lending the investors' small projects under the personal collateral system.
In the framework of strategic cooperation with prince Al-Walid Bin Talal, the erection of several projects mostly in the tourist and real estate development sectors are being considered, Mostafa declared.
Last Thursday, Mr.WWalker told Hosam Abul-Fotouh of Ahmed Al Baradi's wish to transfer the agency from Hosam Abul-Fotouh to the other businessman - Naguib Sawiris.
That loan was one of two loans which Ahmed Al Baradai granted recently. The second loan was offered to Orascom Telecom, a holding company contributed to and run by Naguib Sawiris.
This was announced by head of the Holding Company for Pharmaceuticals, Dr Galal Ghourab, who expected a surge in Egyptian drug exports by 30%.
The third round of meetings held by the Egyptian-Armenian economic, scientific, and technical cooperation committee under the chairmanship of Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Fayza Abu Al-Naga and Armenian Trade and Economic Development Minister were wrapped up yesterday (Oct.21) in the Armenian capital of Yerevan. During the meetings, the closing protocol was signed.
CROATIA EXPRESSES WILLINGNESS TO INVEST IN EGYPTIAN OIL SECTOR
Fahmi pointed out that the Croatian side had expressed willingness to participate in the international bid, which was put up by the General Petroleum Corporation and the Holding Gases Company for the prospect for oil and gas for 2002, and which would wind up on next November 4th. He also reviewed the development achieved by the petroleum sector in the field of natural gas in light of the huge amounts of confirmed gas reserves amounting to 58.5 trillion cubic feet in October 2002.
Magda Shahin, the Egyptian Ambassador in Greek, said that the signing of the protocol comes in culmination of the efforts exerted by the Egyptian embassy in Greece which resulted in better activation of the Greek side's interest in the fields of joint projects and investment in Egypt.
The Egyptian delegation are due to reach Athens on Oct. 23rd next, Shahin added. It is worth mentioning that the number of the Greek founders of the council hit 22 members, up till now, representing heads of Greek mega projects in the fields of paper, fertilizers, foodstuffs, textiles, irrigation systems, fish farms, pharmaceuticals, construction and electric appliances.
He disclosed that Egypt imports roughly 400 thousand tons annually for subsidized and unsubsidized sugar.
The Japanese delegation consists of 7 experts in production of beet sugar who would meet, during their visit to Egypt, with Minister of Agriculture, Dr. Yossef Wali. They would also pay a field visit to Port Said governorate to examine Port Said Company for the Agricultural Manufacture project, due to be set up on a total area of 300 feddans south of Port Said to produce 50,000 tons of beet sugar annually with investments reaching LE500 million.
The operations mainly include the extension of a railway line from Shubra suburb to Qaliubia governorate on the surface to reduce traffic density on Cairo-Alexandria agricultural road.
Some companies for medicine and cosmetics are considering importing industrial raw materials from India.
He added that a delegation of the Holding Company would visit India to discuss cooperation fields and to carry out joint projects on the margin of the exhibition.
Deputy head of the Indian company paid a 5-day visit to Egypt and met with Head of the Holding Company for Medicines Dr. Galal Ghorab along with a number of officials from the private sector companies of manufacturing medicines to offer setting up joint projects for producing drugs and raw materials used in pharmaceutical industries using Indian technologies, machines and equipment.
The memo said that domestic producers were facing unfair competition as a result of the tariffs on production supplies including polypropylene coming down. Producers added that they were taken aback at the considerable increase in similar goods imported from Lebanon that exceeded 400% after the agreement was put into effect.
Printing Chamber Chairman said that the three companies which produce polypropylene films are considering transferring their factories to Lebanon to be able to market their products in Egypt.
The report added that an Egyptian company producing 100% of the local Egyptian production of polypropylene filed a dumping complaint against the polypropylene imports coming from Saudi Arabia produced by "Sabik" and "Exxon Mobile" companies. In the complaint, the company claimed that imports from Saudi Arabia come at much lower prices, which materially impeded the local industry. This impediment can be seen in an absolute and relative rise of such imports, decline of sale prices, rise of the cost ratio to the sale price, fall in production and sales, increase of store, and drop in power use and profits of domestic production.
Holding Orascom Telecom Board Chairman, Naguib Sawiris had given press statements to the effect that such an agreement was considered the first of its kind as it would creat a partnership between two Arab companies for running the mobile network in the Arab world.
The Government decided to lay down an urgent plan to face the defaulting program of privatizing public enterprise sector companies.
The company management will be transferred to the new investor after increasing the capital and the decrease of rate of the enterprise sector's contribution to less than 51%. The company will also be moved from the enterprise sector law no. 203 to the stock companies law no. 159.
3-The Ministry of Public Enterprise Sector will continue contributing a large quota to the company after increasing its capital in order to ensure partnership between the government and the new investor to reform the company's position as a transitional period before the sale process.
EMPOWERING INVESTMENT AUTHORITY TO LICENSE INVESTMENT PROJECTS CONSIDERED
STRIKE AGAINST IRAQ WOULD DRAIN EGYPTIAN ECONOMY
The report added that the Egyptian economy's failure to recover is due to the dollar high exchange rates on the black market as well as to the rise in exchange rates, the refrainment of banks from offering credit and the sharp retreat in the imports of raw materials and capital goods used for industrial production.
He said in a news briefing that there is a big difference between an insolvent customer and a customer who does not pay off debts regularly as the latter deserves cooperation and help.
Jassem Al-Mana'i of the Arab Trade Finance Program (ATFP) told Al-Ahram that the ATFP gave 20 Egyptian banks some 500 million U.S. dollars, including 357 million U.S. dollars as credit lines and the rest is additional facilities to spur trade between Egypt and other Arab countries.
Egyptian business societies are currently intensifying their pressure on the Government to change the way of dealing with the bank defaulters' case, which has been witnessing an escalating pace in the recent period after the property of two prominent businessmen, namely BMW agent Hossam Abul-Fotouh and the so-called "carpet baron" Hassan Abul-Makarem was judicially sequestrated.
The technical obstacles, which consolidated this rapprochement, gave a logical background to the memo that was referred to the Cabinet by the Association. This background is represented in the nature of dealing with the insolvency cases that failed to pay off at least 20 per cent of their total debts so that banks could float them and give them new credit.
In the second case, banks were taken aback by their need for expertise that are capable of properly managing a reasonable number of projects, something that could impact on the revenues of such projects on the one hand and deprive their owners of the required development for their projects to restore their role in boosting national economy on the other.
STORES FOR EGYPTIAN COMMODITIES IN KENYA
Egypt will take part in the activities of the 35th Baghdad International Exhibition that will take place in the period from 1 to 10 November with a view to bolstering bilateral trade relations and acquainting the Iraq market with the Egyptian products and commodities.

It added that the annual growth rate of commodity exports in Egypt hit 8 per cent against 14 per cent for Turkey, 19 per cent for the Philippines and 1.5 per cent for Tunisia.
Meanwhile, Egyptian imports from Canada increased by 13.5% in 2001 hitting 193 million Canadian dollars against 170 million dollars in 2000, he added.
Japan is a promising market for Egyptian exports regardless of the obstacles they face, said a recent study titled "Egyptian Exporter's Manual to Japanese Market" by Foreign Trade Ministry's Commercial Representation Body.
It also called for making full use of the Japanese "G.S.B." system to contribute to boosting Egyptian exports to Japan. It also called on Egyptian businessmen and companies to continuously and directly contact Japanese major commercial companies' branches in Egypt in addition to the Egyptian Commercial Representation Office in Tokyo in order to make use of its services and contacts in promoting Egyptian exports.
EGYPTIAN-DANISH COOPERATION FOR DEVELOPING FOOD INDUSTRIES
Minister of Industry, Ali Al Saidi said that signing the contract came within the framework of the Ministry's plan to modernize Egyptian industry by the construction of 15 technological centres specialized in a number of industries especially food industries.
"One wife is not enough" is the slogan of a female association announced recently. It not only calls for polygamy but also calls on every wife to choose another woman for her husband to marry in a bid to help eliminate the spinsterhood problem.
The association is on its way to be announced, she said, adding that it includes co-founders from Egypt, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates and welcomes any nationality from all over the world. "We want it a universal association," she said.
POLITICAL REFORM IN SAUDI ARABIA: A RACE AGAINST TIME
The building domestic and external political pressure could be the motive behind the assessemnt of Prince Turki Al Faisal, former chief of general intelligence, that there was a need for publicly stating during the Symposium on War at the Time of Peace, which was held in Yemen last month, that regional countries had no option other than reform.
While political reform in Saudi Arabia is gaining official, popular and American unanimity, the central question of what direction and limitations this reform will have to present itself. Therefore, we will attempt here to shed light on, or try to explain, two options for political reform in the kingdom, which are:
The frustration of the democratic choice in Saudi Arabia is usually supported by two pretexts. The first one is the fear, which has been promulgated in the writings of Western politicians and journalists, that a radical fundamentalist regime may assume power in the kingdom.
In this context, there will be American pledges to Russia for buying more of its oil, which may later undermine the market strength of OPEC production. Perhaps the imminent danger against the Saudi royal family is the weapon of partitioning that some senior members of the US Administration have brandished. A number of institutions and organizations are even still working on the development of proposals containing convincing justifications for the fragmentation of the kingdom into small states, with the royal family's domain confined to Najd if the Saudi rulers refuse to succumb to the American conditions for change.
In addition to the awareness of the political situation within the medium and upper classes of the Saudi community, the low class is now fully aware of these conditions. Moving to the economic situation, the kingdom's economy is a downhill slide whose indications are only too obvious, including a high unemployment rate that is estimated at 32%, a heavy local debt in excess of SR670 billion and a chronic annual budget deficit. This harsh situation puts the kingdom in the face of bitter remedies, the first of which will have to be a comprehensive taxation system. This will necessarily require the expansion of the scope of political representation.
In fact, the issue of political reform overlaps in most cases with the power struggle within the royal family. The two rival forces that seek political reform are working for liberalization of power, though in opposite directions in the presence of a prevalent trend for tightening the grip on authority. The popular force is trying to wrench power from the hands of the royal family, while the rivals within the latter are seeking to bring about a balanced distribution of power, but exclusively within the royal family.
With its royal system, Saudi Arabia is still capable of developing a political system that will gain popular acceptance, and with limited losses whose precious return will be internal political stability and the insurance of the regime for a longer period.
The implementation of the constitutional monarchy option in Saudi Arabia faces the challenges posed by the external, and domestic, demands for curbing the authority of the royal family and the increasing rivalry for expanding power within the monarchic regime itself, and the situation could become worse if this option is implemented, unless a force that is capable of taking decisive action to break the current strife between these forces comes to the fore.
There is the trend of Crown Prince Abdullah, backed by a sweeping popular trend with all its diverse political orientations and leanings. This trend is opposed to the potential U.S. war on Iraq.
First; they are closely related to the U.S. to the extent of dependence.
Third; the Kingdom's attitude towards Iraq. Unlike other neighbours, the Kingdom has no historical territorial disputes or ambitions (like Turkey or Iran) or political goals (like the Hashimites in Jordan, royal Iraqi rulers and Baathists in Syria from the perspective of ideological difference).
It is basically a defensive view as - like the royal era in Iraq- it is worried about Hejaz, the original homeland of Hashimites.
The example of Afghanistan is clear as the regime there did not turn against Iran as presumed since powerful parties in the regime have close ties with Iran.
For the first time, the Kingdom deeply get engaged in this domestic Iraqi affair following the end of war through a conference of Iraqi opposition forces in 1991, during which Turk al-Faisal and Maj. Gen. Mohamed al-Otaibi imposed their country's will on Iraqi opposition with financial temptations, but to no avail.
The countries concerned in the region did not voice frank hostility to the U.S. option and tried to find "elements" with whom they might reach an understanding or drag them away from the U.S. camp relatively even after a while.
Although it once received Mr. Baker al-Hakim, a Kurdish leader, the Kingdom did not maintain good terms with him maybe due to local Salafi pressure. On the Shiiet secular side, it once received Ahmed al-Galabi, but angered and even insulted him. Afterwards, he voiced hostility to the Saudi regime and accused it of being an enemy to the Iraqi people and Wahhabite of sponsoring international terrorism.
A Saudi analyst termed this Saudi policy as flogging a dead horse.
This discourse, which is, to a large extent, unfamiliar to the Iraqi political atmosphere, will have favourable reflections and create more Iraqi political factions, with final outcomes coming in favour of neither Saudi Arabia nor the Iraqi opposition with its divers factions.
However, this does not necessarily mean that the destiny of Saudi and Iraqi regimes is interdependent, but the principle of making the best of a bad job should be adopted.
In a meeting with Egyptian Businessmen Society, Saleh said that the Iraqi people do not care about the mass media campaign led by America to wash Arab and foreign brains, adding that Baghdad's government would equip the Iraqi people's sons with all weapons in case an attack was launched against Iraq.
Unprecedentedly, a religious travel agency started to arrange visits for well-to-do Egyptians to visit Islamic preachers in exile, forefront of whom are Amr Khalid and Al-Habib Ali.
Safi expressed his fear of the Saudi Arabian authorities rejecting the holding of symposia lest discussions might touch upon the current situation and the American military presence in the Gulf area, stressing that he would ask the participants not to put up questions that have to do with politics.
The number of those who want to travel to Medina hits ten thousand persons so far, including businessmen, some artists and a large number of high-class ladies, he said.
On the other hand, many attempts are being exerted by a number of youth artists foremost of whom are Mohamed Henidi, Alaa Walieddin and Sherif Munir in addition to a number of businessmen who are in close relation with Yemeni preacher Al-Habib Ali to have him given access to Cairo again.
Al-Wafd newspaper discloses another fresh crime Israel had committed on the Egyptian borders after it polluted the shores of Egyptian Rafah recently.
"Building that fence runs counter to the text of two articles in the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Accords, International Law and relevant UN resolutions," they said, adding that Israel would thieve 1500 square kilometers of Egyptian lands in case it forged ahead in that fence.
Their number hit 5,000 passengers before the Eid Fitr vacation. On their part, Egyptian authorities exert painstaking efforts to open the passage before the Palestinians willing to enter Gaza Strip and the West Bank or before those willing to enter Egypt from the other side. However, occupation authorities put a lot of obstacles thus keeping the passage open but without letting travelers in. Hatred feelings aggravate among travelers when they find themselves standing up for long hours in queues while the Israeli soldiers rest relaxed having their food before work permits is given. Despite the big numbers of passengers and those waiting on the Egyptian side to enter Palestinian territories, the Israeli recalcitrance reaches its peak when the soldiers let in only two or three buses at best.
Occupation authorities, on their part, did not give her family exit visas for visiting her in Egypt.
The posters allege that such products supported the Israeli army in its war against the Palestinians and warned that buying them was tantamount to drinking their Muslim brother blood.
The new bill consists of 119 articles and provides for codifying the positions of water councils which were initiated in 1999 so that they would undertake the management of water resources and charge farmers for the costs of replacement, renovation, maintenance operations and digging of canals and the construction of dykes in cultivation areas.
CONTROVERSY ABOUT INTEREST RATES IS STILL ON!
Deputy Executive President of the Egyptian Faysal Islamic Bank of Egypt, Gamal Shaban, said that the argument over bank interest rates would continue in spite of the recent fatwa.
He said, "I've lost my seat even though I was no party to the judicial appeal. The legislative committee also lost its reputation as it had issued a report that had no parliamentary precedents."
Heshmat voiced fears that the decision might be "an escalation message" to the group and its guide, Ma'moun Al-Hudhaibi. He said, "I neither wish nor hope this would be true."
He said, "I hope no confrontation will take place between security forces and the masses as it would be rather difficult if it occurred."
In regard to the coming elections, a date for which the Ministry of the Interior expected to fix, Heshmat wished "the government would rise above intervention trickery in order to preserve the public image" He called on the government to cooperate and avoid conflict so that the forthcoming elections would pass peacefully.
In statements to Kuwaiti Al-Siyassah newspaper yesterday, Nayef said that Saudi Arabia deported the Muslim Brotherhood members resident in Saudi Arabia to their countries after they had attempted secretly and aboveboard to harm Saudi Arabia and after they politicised Islam for personal purposes. He pointed out that many of them adopted a method cloaked in religion to shake the nation and tear it apart.
The American researches James Riston, together with researchers from 6 European countries - England, France, Spain, Germany, Australia, Hungary and the USA, as well as a big number of Egyptian researchers took part in a conference entitled "The Concept of the Enemy in Different Cultures", organized by Averroes Society at Bibliotheca Alexandrina monitored four paradigms that have emerged in the last five months and were inappropriately used and misunderstood (the Crusades, jihad, war and Saladin).
The American researcher added that American citizens had not heard of that opinion issued by the biggest religious authority in the Islamic world condemning terrorism and what happened on September 11th.
EGYPTIAN DIPLOMACY AND THE IRAQI CRISIS: ANYTHING WRONG?
Giving priority to precluding a military attack on Iraq should not have prevented it from paying some attention to the consequences of such an attack including a probable change in the political system in Iraq.
Such obstruction has no reasons, either. If the reason was Egypt's keenness on preserving relations with the Iraqi regime, why, then, didn't Egypt boycott Sudanese opposition forces after the improvement of its relations with President El Bashir's regime in the last years.
Furthermore, establishing a rapport with this party or that does not necessarily mean supporting its attitude or just blindly following in its steps.
What Egyptian or generally Arab interests can be gained through refusing to take part in determining the future of Iraq and consequently leaving it to America together with other non-Arab regional forces?
It is a risk that affects not only Egypt's interests as a state but it poses a threat to the whole Arab order, if the Iraqi opposition leaders replied in kind when they step to power.
This particularly gives significance to the Libyan withdrawal request which it had not entirely relinquished that what it seemingly is, as it would be the beginning of the dismantlement of the Arab order, an event which Egypt has untiringly tried to avoid.
It may realize later on that such an approach to the crisis would not be an extension of the great role it had twice played to protect that order in the previous decade but would rather subject that order to genuine danger.
Quoting the sources, Hebrew mass media said that chief of staff General Mose Ya'lon decided to set up a new section in the Staff Command for tapping the Internet, thus providing the new Israeli security sources with important data required for the Hebrew state security. They indicated that the new section would be set up next month and would be in charge of electronic and computer cases and special section in the Army Staff Command as well as a special section in the navy, the air and the intelligence departments.
CAIRO SPONSORS DIALOGUE WITH HAMAS AND JIHAD TO SUPPORT ISRAELI LABOUR PARTY
The sources went on to say, "The Egyptian analysis is based on the necessity of taking political steps to support the Israeli Labour Party and narrow the gap between it and the Likud in the coming elections, which requires a halt of martyrdom operations for a specific period." In his dialogues, Soleiman moved from requesting "a stop of operations from Ramadan to Ramadan" to requesting "a truce for a period between three and six months", the sources added. Meeting with one Jihad leader in Egypt last week, he laid emphasis on "a truce for a specific period".
POWELL: SAUDI ARABIA OUGHT TO CHECK TRADITION FOR REFORMS WITHOUT U.S. DICTATES
Powell ruled out any possible shakeup of "friendly Arab regimes" , which may deem the U.S. initiative interference in their affairs and, thus, decide to resist gradual shift towards democracy. It is up to them to choose reforms appropriate to them, he said, hoping that Washington would help them set forms of change that suit them.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND IRAQ BACK AFTER 12 YEARS OF DISRUPTION
On Monday, Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh started an official visit to Moscow, which is the first for him since the collapse of the former Soviet Union. The visit was arranged for last year and then delayed more than once.
Russian-Yemeni military cooperation will remain in the vanguard, the same sources pointed out. Yemen, however, tries to purchase its needs according to special conditions and facilities in a way that meets its defensive requirements especially as far as replacing new spare parts for its impaired weapons and qualifying its human cadres in the armed forces in light of agreed-upon programmes between the two countries were concerned, they said.
A tidal wave of getting religious was noticeable in the current year, which sociologists ascribed to the role of religious programs broadcast by Arab satellites and watched by Tunisians who act accordingly.
The league said it had received complaints from citizens, both males and females, who were exposed to excessive measures. Women were stripped of their head covers by force in some police stations in the capital.
This rare alliance unifies practically the most two important competing trends in trade unions in the face of the Jordanian government ambitious project which is meant to professionalize the syndical action and isolate it completely from political action. However, it constitutes the best of what pragmatic' Islamists have invented in this confrontation.
The concern of the Islamic trend is currently concentrated on preventing the government from imposing its candidates on the most important syndicate - Engineers Syndicate. This will not be achieved unless some positions are given in according to the planned bargain which was considered a dream in the past. However, following a coordination meeting on Thursday it became an applicable project in the face of the government plans to control the syndical action.
PUTTING ARAB DICTATORSHIPS TO DIFFICULT TEST!
Powell admitted to his country's mistake in relying on repressive dictatorial regimes. He associated the future of the Arab region with democracy, political multiplicity and economic prosperity, promising that his country will support liberal democratic powers, non-governmental organizations and civil society institutions.
Second: the absence of any real move to find a just solution for the Palestinian cause according to international legitimate resolutions and the continuation of the American Administration adopting the Israeli rightist extremist point of view which is ruling the Hebrew State.
Minister of Agriculture in West Australia State Kim Shans urged Egypt to draw upon Australia's strong trade network in Asia.
The Australian government is moving at a brisk pace towards multilateral trade arrangements and at a slow pace towards bilateral trade ones, he said, voicing willingness to hold talks with the Egyptian government to set trade arrangements between Egypt and West Australia. The Australian state largely imports citrus from the United States due to bilateral trade arrangements, he said.
He said he would seek to boost Australian investments in Egypt, noting that Australia, like Egypt but unlike the U.S., is a capital-importing country.
Pointing to the wheat production crisis last year, he said the key five international wheat exporters, including Australia, experienced unfavourable climatic conditions, which negatively impacted on wheat output.
He pointed out that the programme aimed at modernizing Egyptian industry management mechanisms at all levels. The programme is based on building industrial installations capable of meeting domestic international market needs. He pointed out that such a goal would only be reached through catching up with rapid international developments in the field of technology.
The meeting also dealt with an overall analysis of textile and food industries in Egypt with regard to supply and demand as well as the competitive capacity, quality, prices, and growth strategy with a view to constructing successful technological institutions.
The proposed harbor was that of Dar es Salaam. "It is important to exert Africa-oriented efforts and some losses should be endured at the beginning because the profitability would be big later," Mustafa Al-Ahwal asserted. Drawing an example, he pointed to the Egyptian navigational line, whose losses amounted to about six million dollars in the past three months, but contributed to the increase of Egypt's exports to Kenya to 40 million dollars in 2001 against four million dollars only in 1999.

As to what Microsoft Corporation stood to gain from this endeavour, Ramadan affirmed that the return for Microsoft was to have a role to play in the implementation of the Egyptian national telecommunications plan and participate in the development of IT industry in Egypt, in addition to increasing awareness among Microsoft clients. "Microsoft Corporation invests its money in the field of training," he said.

Illiteracy would be totally omitted, the report said, pointing out that this needs 600 million pounds annually and 3 billion pounds in the coming five years.
The external scenes of the documentary program took more than two years via semi-daily contacts between the Information office in London and the press office in Cairo on the one hand and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), producer of the program, on the other hand. All the Egyptian officials were bent on streamlining the task of the crew in charge of producing, directing and photographing the program, which directly boosts Egypt's tourist image abroad as Egypt is a safe destination that enjoys interest of Britons and Europeans in general.
The source said the negotiations between both the Ministry of Finance and the Geological Survey Authority on the one hand and Santmine on the other have reached a stalemate due to Finance Ministry insistence on collecting sales tax on the company's works and its imported equipment as well as the ministry's unrecognition of the agreement signed by the company with the government and approved by the People's Assembly for prospecting for gold early 1990s.
Al-Hayat learnt that the concerned bodies had received an all-out report about market circumstances.

Regulations The proposal stipulates that non-Egyptians can possess real estates on condition that such real estates should not be subject to Monument Protection Law and should not be registered as a monument. The cabinet has the right to set special terms and rules for possession in certain areas in the country.
This action was welcomed by the officials concerned in such field. They considered it an end for reforming domestic market, which has been suffering badly from the low demand for purchasing real estates for two years, something that was resulted in the aggravation of the state of recession and the decline of purchases particularly in light of the international and domestic circumstances.
The International Development Agency also agreed to provide a $67 loan with an annual interest rate of 3.8% that will be paid in bi-annual installments at the beginning of March and September every year starting from the year 2004 till March 2029.

EGYPT & CYPRUS HOLD NEGOTIATIONS ON NATURAL GAS
This comes as a result of great efforts in prospecting activities in the areas of concession of foreign and national companies operating in Egypt (the Mediterranean and West Desert), Al-Tawila said, adding that the reports unveiled the confirmed reserves of natural gas reached around 51 trillion cubic feet at the beginning of the year 2001, thus making Egypt the seventh producing country in the Arab world.
Russian agricultural experts commended the Egyptian agricultural exports to Russia and their good reputation on the Russian markets.
3 EGYPTIAN-MOROCCAN PROJECTS WORTH $60 MILLION TO BE IMPLEMENTED
As for the third project, whose investments amount to $50 million, he added that it would produce pipes. Both Egyptian businessman Mohamed Helmi and the Moroccan one Milod Al-Sha'bi would contribute to this project. It was decided to set up the project in the 10th of Ramadan City in lieu of Morocco now that the feasibility studies proved the significance of establishing the project in Egypt thanks to the availability of raw materials.
An Egyptian-Libyan working group have met recently to formulate the draft plan next March in order to be referred to the political leaderships in the two countries to endorse it in its final stage.
Libya is in need of Egyptian gas to use it in many fields, he said, pointing out that the investments of the two-way pipeline to transport Libyan crude oil to Egypt and Egyptian gas to Libya exceed 300 million dollars which will be divided equally.
Egyptian Minister of Housing and New Urban Communities, Ibrahim Solayman visited Libya last month for this purpose. Bilateral relations are being expanded so as to take different directions, such as boosting trade exchange, removing obstacles and restrictions imposed on diverse kinds of commodities and their movement via the ways of transporting goods, devising new mechanisms to facilitate the movement of goods and settling the rights of the exporters of the two countries. They also seek to boost investments in certain fields, such as oil, industries based on using the available crude oil which makes a high added value and investment in agriculture.
Under this heading, Al-Ahram Al-Arabi weekly Chief Editor writes an article to say: If we had had just and fair governments in the Arab world with political and military forces sharing power with peoples, we would not have been locked in this current cul-de-sac, brought by the September 11 events and the consequent war on terrorism, preceded by political weakness in dealing with the Palestinian cause and collapse before the Iraqi crisis.
The state established in 1921 in Iraq started to collapse at the hands of successive dictatorships, whether in the royal or republican era starting with Abdel-Karim Qassem and ending with Saddam Hussein.

Work supply is likely to increase by 2.6% annually starting from 2002 till 2010, thus creating 638 thousand job opportunities is required on an annual basis.
Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) Group started to "foot the bill" of its position as well as its members' anti-American activity and the ways of denouncing a potential war on Iraq.
Noticeably enough, the accusations included information about the way of the Ikhwan dealing with the Iraqi crisis. The State Security Investigation memo said that the defendants laid down a plan to exploit the U.S. threats to Iraq together with the engulfing atmospheres in order to push ahead with the Group's activities in governorates and mobilize the public opinion against the Egyptian regime through alleging that the Egyptian political moves towards the Iraqi issue are negative and ineffective.
Under this headline, deputy chief editor of Al-Hayat Abdel Wahab Badrakhan wrote an article which ran to the following effect only in part: War has become one of the Arab complex daily nuisances that abound in contradictions and incongruities.
The third party - the Arabs and the world - realizes that the genuine goal of the USA is not disarmament and that the Iraqi danger, if it still exists, cannot be as serious as it once was a decade ago.
While one party thinks the world has let it in the lurch during its heroic steadfastness against the impregnable imperialistic power, the other party is carrying on with its war regardless of the world.
America would not care about the results so long as it is certain of its fire capability and its supremacy in terms of mass destruction weapons.
However, those who know the mettle of the regime's elite do not share such expectations as, according to them, if those leaders wanted to go they would take preliminary steps in advance.
It is that implicit alliance that is still both effective and active between the two parties.
Islam, he added, ordained that remedy should be sought for every disease whether through traditional or genetic means, pointing out that every useful thing, according to an Islamic principle, is permissible it entails some danger. Accordingly, seeking treatment through the use of genetics is religiously permissible on condition that this should observe the following:
In secret, chairman of the Israeli Foreign Affairs Council and onetime deputy Mossad chief paid an unannounced visit to Cairo last week.
Q- How do you see the situation at the Israeli domestic level?
A- Yes, but the situation may change with the start of different political negotiations and talks, which will not begin unless Palestinians stop violence and their leaders actually denounce the military operations carried out by the armed groups inside Israel. I repeat again that this will not be achieved unless big regional powers mainly including Egypt, which now makes painstaking attempts to urge the Palestinian parties to put the Palestinian house in order, step in.
For your knowledge, most of the Palestinians abroad will not agree to return to the Palestinian territories as they got either political or economic positions and do not want to abandon them.
ARABS TO LOSE $20 BILLION IN CASE OF ATTACK ON IRAQ
Director of the Arab Labour Organisation Dr. Ibrahim Qweider told Al-Ahram Al-Arabi that an attack on Iraq would negatively impinge on the Arab economy particularly as far as labour is concerned.
As far as tourism is concerned, assessments say that tourism would go down by some 40% if Iraq is attacked, a loss of about two billion dollars. Chairman of the Importers Division at the Federation of Chambers of Commerce Mustafa Zaki said that Egypt would initially lose between 1 and 1.5 billion dollars due to the quasi-complete stop of business transactions and the foreign investors' withdrawal of their money from the stock market. Zaki expected that the Arab loss in general would reach 20 billion dollars. The Egyptian losses would hit 10 billion dollars at best, he predicted.
WHAT WOULD ARABS DO AFTER SPRING WAR ON IRAQ?
In this context, the final status issues, mainly including Jerusalem, agreed on in Oslo 1993, will be handled so that Jerusalem may become a single and eternal capital of Israel. This tendency has begun to take shape since Ariel Sharon's visit to the Holy Shrine, the beginning of the Palestinian uprising on 28 September 2000, and the excessive use of military force by Israel in the wake of Beirut Arab summit on 28 March 2002 as well as the ensuing violence in the occupied land. If this silent tone has recently appeared to necessarily iron out the Arab-Israeli conflict, it is natural that the solution will come at the expense of the Arab interests and in favour of the Israeli political and strategic objectives whatever the justification. In this case, there is no shame that the reality of the pro-Israel American foreign policy will come into open.
In general, predictions to answer this question are subject to several vague and uncertain factors. But the coming events would support any amendment or change like these conceptions. My main aim to tackle such an exploded issue is to give a clear warning signal to prepare for such changes so that they may not surprise us after the end of the current deadlock. The ability to face this is represented in the ability of the regional regimes to quietly harmonise and adapt to the current changes of the world order led by the US. The opposite will lead to the imposition of the required changes at the regional level particularly in the area of the Arab-Israeli conflict without giving an adequate opportunity for gradual change. This is a very serious matter, as changes in the regional map will be imposed on the regimes.
Security authorities have arrested 43 members of Jihad organization in several governorates, who have planned for terrorist operations against foreign interests in Cairo, and targeted some key figures and vital installations in a bid to disrupt security and damage Egypt's relations with foreign countries.
It is true that the Israeli authorities' inhuman practices against the Palestinian people and the individual and collective assassination operations as well as the absolute backing received by Sharon and his massacres have all indirectly but most significantly contributed to arousing the feelings of anger among Arab youth ranks, but we should not find excuses for terrorist elements.
According to investigations, the defendant Ihab Ismail used the Internet to contact Jihad Organization leaderships abroad and could form three groups inside the country, the first in Mehalla Al-Kobra comprising 20 members, the second in Al-Beheira comprising 17 persons and the third in Cairo. He tasked defendant Mohamed Darrag to act as the liaison agent between different elements.
Using Carrier Pigeons The terrorist organization member depositions also contained details of their scheme which they sought to execute including blowing up vital and foreign places. They explained all those operations and how they would be carried out. They included targeting a vital installation using 200-300 of carrier pigeons.
The investigations have so far proved that leader, Ihab Ismail had contacted elements from Jihad Organization abroad, but no direct relation with Al-Qaeda Organization leader Osama Bin Laden has been proven so far even though Bin Laden's recommendations and Ayman Al-Zawahri's statements have been regarded as action charter by them.
However, the government also won a victory in its conflict with the Labour Party, as the same court has revoked a previous ruling that was issued in favour of the party which provided for the resumption of the party's mouthpiece - Al-Shaab. The court decided the dispute in this respect be referred to the Political Parties' Court which is currently considering a memo by the Parties' Committee in which it called for canceling the party's license once and for all.
EGYPTIAN GOVT INFORMS PARLIAMENT OF ABORTING AMERICAN TRIAL TO BRING IN WASTES INTO EGYPT
"The importing company obtained money from the American side to dispose of that waste and imported 69 new containers," the report pointed out. However, the importing company has not asked the release of these containers yet, the report said, expecting these containers to carry the same kind of wastes. Customs charges would hit LE500 thousand on these containers in case they were proven hazardless.
The Gaza dialogue was a complete failure due to Hamas' recalcitrance, they said, adding that Hamas is now unwilling to reach an agreement in the Cairo dialogue.
ARAB RESERVATIONS ABOUT TURKEY'S REQUEST TO JOIN THE ARAB LEAGUE AS OBSERVER
For his part, Turkish Premier announced that his country's wish to join the Arab League would be referred to the Turkish Parliament soon for approval.
The sources wondered about the destiny of Mosul and Iskenderun provinces where Turkey has been claiming historic rights in those areas which are geographically owned by Iraq and Syria.
Esmat Abdel-Maguid, former Arab League (AL) secretary-general and chairman of the committee on preparing the first national Palestinian constitution, was quoted as saying that the proposed draft constitution would include a secular Palestinian system of government that guarantees equal rights between Muslims and Christians, public freedoms and freedoms of opinion and expression.
The American Administration is considering the idea of applying the Afghan model to the Iraqi tribes, in a bid to destabilize the tribal fabric so far supporting the Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
According to Iraqi opposition sources in London, President Saddam Hussein had called on tribe chieftains in South Iraq and asked them to pledge not to repeat the 1990 lesson or revolt against the regime as was the case when George Bush, the father, urged Iraqi tribes to rebel against Baghdad's regime after the end of the Gulf War.
According to a Western delegate in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, "the tribal weight can not be ignored because tribes are an important element in the Iraqi government."
EGYPT THREATENS TO DEEM HAMAS "ANTI-PEACE ORGANIZATION" IF IT CONTINUES MARTYRDOM OPERATIONS
The sources linked Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's coming visit to Washington on January 21 to the adoption by all Palestinian factions of a final position on freezing operations.
Well-informed sources said investigations of the defendant revealed that he had sent an e-mail to the American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that carried allegations that the life of the American ambassador David Welch would be endangered during his scheduled visit to Assiut on 11th and 12th last month.
Head of Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics Ahab Olwi said, "Egyptians spend LE6.4 billion on education annually. He pointed out that that figure included these items: transport fares, clothes, books, school fees and private lessons fees.
The decision was justified by the minister reaching retirement age. However, international sources attributed the axing decision to other reasons related to the repercussions of canceling contracts with Russian Lukoil Company.
Both Amer Rashid and Amer Al Saadi were deputies for Hussein Kamel , the man in charge of WMD programme, the former for missiles programme and the latter for biological and chemical programmes.
Chairman of the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMS) Ahab Olwi told Al-Mussawar weekly that the new year's agenda abounds in fresh issues, mainly including overpopulation as the annual average has risen up to 1.300 million citizens. Both birth and death rates have decreased thanks to health care. All aspects of life seem to be affected by overpopulation. For example, Egypt's annual average wheat consumption is 11 million tons, while Egypt produces 6.7 million tons, requiring the import of 4.3 million tons, he said.
Girls are now vying with boys over jobs in pursuit of a suitable husband as young men now prefer employed wives who can help cater for household needs.
Islamic societies will certainly face pressure backed by the UN laws, programmes and institutions active in the field of extending relief and aid to the poor, like world food programme whose commitments to Islamic Conference Organization (ICO) countries hit $13 billion over the last four decades. The ICO countries constitute 43% of the beneficiaries of that programme of food assistance.
On the other hand erroneous convictions might be changed and the whole file could be turned from a highly explosive mine into a means of rapprochement with the other through the involvement of those societies in setting a vision for the future and the employment of their personnel and some of their techniques in the execution and supervision processes.
FEW HOURS BEFORE PRINTING, MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD LOSES CONTROL OVER AL-LIWA AL-ARABI
Al Gomhouria's deputy chief editor, Mohammad Abul Hadid, wrote: America is using a carrot and stick policy in dealing with the issue of hitting Iraq, brandishing the stick in the face of the Saudis, and waving the carrot to the Egyptians.
Plainly speaking, what is wanted from Saudi Arabia is to open its territories, bases and ports to the American forces and also take part, if it could, in footing the bill for hitting Iraq.
The American message to Cairo was phrased with such cunning that raises a thousand questions.
It may also mean that Egypt is still holding firm to its stand of refusing to participate in any military strike against Iraq, and so the promised additional aid is the carrot that the Americans are waving to us to make us change our position.
Everybody, including the minister, knows that sending military forces is not the only way to take part in a war.
PALESTINIAN JIHAD DENIES EGYPTIAN INTERVENTION TO STOP INTIFADA
The Islamic Jihad organization is keen to exchange views with Cairo over the Palestinian cause, the Jihad chief added.
While the situation on the Arab-Zionist conflict level is aggravating and the balance of power is being tipped seriously in favour of the Zionist entity, and while the possibilities of remapping the whole Arab region in accordance with an American concept are growing, the unity of internal ranks, a prerequisite for facing those challenges, seems to suffer from deep rifts that, with the efforts of the nation's faithful sons, can be healed. The statement pointed out that the initiative was put forward to the whole nation, rulers and ruled alike and to the intellectuals and politicians of all political and intellectual trends.
Egypt represents the safety haven in the region, as its crime rates are considered lower than crime rates all over the world. Egypt could also rise to its responsibilities in minimizing crime movement, lowering its rates and raising the rates of discovering such crimes.
Eritrean ambassador in Cairo, Mr. Mahmoud Omar Kroum, delivered a message to Arab League's Secretary General, Mr. Amr Moussa, from Eritrean Foreign Minister, Ali Saed Abdullah.
The exporting companies contracted an Arab customs agent in Haifa to follow up the Jordanian farming shipment until it was shipped to Europe, the sources added.
JIHAD SCHEME TO SABOTAGE FOREIGN INTERESTS IN CAIRO ABORTED
Supreme State Security Prosecution under Counsellor Maher Abdel-Wahid are investigating the organization members. It has been uncovered that they have prepared large amounts of TNT explosives to use in their sabotage operations. Automatic rifles, pistols, live cartridge and huge sums of money to be spent on their schemes were seized in their hotbeds. Al-Ahram correspondent added other details saying:
Available information emphasized that a certain Ihab Ismail had professed Al-Jihad ideology based on regarding the government as heretic thus lending legitimacy to any rebellious acts against it. He planned for executing terrorist operations targeting public figures and blowing up vital and foreign installations to disrupt public order and damage Egypt's relations with foreign countries.
Ismail formed a military cell comprising three elements known only to him to attend meetings under code names. According to the admission of one of them, they have been attending that cell's lessons for about a year to enhance Jihad ideology regarding the government heresy and hence the necessity of confronting it under the pretext of its failure to implement Islamic Sharia and in order to establish what they alleged as an Islamic state.
When 40 or 60 kilograms of explosives happen to gather on the roof, the person in charge of the blowing up duty carries out the task with a remote control device to blast the building.
The suspended Labour Party has won a limited judiciary victory over the government, as it has got a final ruling from the Supreme Administrative Court entitling Eng. Ibrahim Shukri to lead the party and revoking the Parties' Committee's decision not to recognize the party.
Proponents of the Islamic Trend led by the party's General Secretary Magdi Hussein received the new ruling with disappointment. Their sources said that although the ruling upheld Shukri as being leader of the party, it admitted that newspapers, at the same time could be confiscated under an administrative decision despite the fact that it is unconstitutional. It also made the future of the party unstable as it referred the whole case to the Parties' Court which is an exceptional, administrative court, the sources said.
The Ikhwanite deputy raised that issue months ago. Then, the Administrative Control Authority prepared a report about the violating consignments in which it described that waste as "dangerous". Importation of such dangerous materials is banned according to the Environment Protection Law, the report said, indicating that passage of such wastes into Egyptian lands is even banned and the violator would be fined LE20 thousand.
Some Fatah central committee members were opposed to the Cairo dialogue as a similar 2-month dialogue was earlier held in Gaza among all Palestinian political forces, but, unfortunately, no tangible results were reached, the sources said.
The Palestinian sources unveiled that Mashal said his attendance was contingent upon the involvement of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Executive Committee Secretary Mahmoud Abbass (Abu Mazen) in the dialogue as a head of Fatah's delegation.
Moussa said in a joint press conference with Gul that the talks touched upon agreeing to embark on new relations between Turkey and Arab countries.

INSPECTION CERTIFICATES FOR INDUSTRIAL IMPORTS IN COUNTRY OF ORIGIN
Foreign Trade Ministry will not intervene in inspection charges and cost that will be fixed by the three companies on their dealing with the Egyptian importers who would like to deal with these companies, said Abul-Qumsan, pointing out this new system will help facilitate the release procedures of these commodities on their arrival to the Egyptian ports and will relieve the Egyptian bodies concerned with this area.
He said due attention is paid to activating the trade movement between the two countries particularly after the visit paid by President Mubarak to China early last year.
He said the political leadership instructed to overcome any impediments to set up Chinese projects in Egypt, which would be reflected on the mutual investments in addition to paying heed to the Chinese market, the biggest in the world in terms of population density. China ranks sixth in the international economy and is one of the major eastern countries importing Egyptian products along with India and Australia, the minister added.
The agreement set clear-cut rules of dealing with the countries concerned, Ghali said, pointing out that the door is still open for other Arab countries to join in light of the free Arab trade agreement. The agreement enhances competitiveness of the commodities of the four countries in the face of European countries, he added.
The programme would include training courses for personnel, organizing seminars, workshops, databases exchange between European Union countries and Mediterranean countries as well as setting up a joint website offering data and promotional items, which is one of the results of the Egyptian-European partnership agreement.
In a lecture he gave in Zayyed Centre for Coordination and Follow-Up, the ambassador said direct Emirian investments were distributed among 97 projects covering tourist, service, agricultural and building sectors to the value of 923 million dirhams (251.4 million dollars). Indirect investments hit 770 million dirhams by the end of 2001 and covered many sectors as well, thus putting UAE in the third rank among Arab countries investing in Egypt following Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
EGYPTIAN EXPORTS TO BRITAIN UP
On the other hand, Canadian Foreign Trade statistics showed that bilateral trade exchange volume surged up by 13% to reach 196 million Canadian dollars during the period from January to September 2002 against 173 million Canadian dollars during the same period in 2001.
COLLECTIVE MARKETING FOR EGYPTIAN POTATOES
PROJECT FOR PRODUCING PETROL STATION PUMPS
The managing director of the project Mr Ahmed Gawish said 25% of the production will be allocated for the African and the Arab markets while most of it will cater for the local market which badly needs this product that is currently imported from abroad.
In one of its recent reports the CBE confirmed that the total loans obtained by the private sector's businessmen and investors in local currency hit LE156.589 billion while those obtained in foreign currency reached what is equivalent to LE43.808 billion.
DRUGS FOR HEART & EPILEPSY TO BE LOCALLY MANUFACTURED
BAN ON MEAT IMPORTED FROM EUROPE CONTINUED
The country of origin should also apply mad-cow disease tests routinely to all its livestock that would be slaughtered. The frozen meat should also be from front and rear quarters. Technical committees affiliated to the General Authority for Veterinary Services should travel to the country of origin to ensure that the set conditions, quarantine measures and the Egyptian specifications are met.
Egyptian auto industry has started to attract Kazakh importers as a contract has been inked recently for exporting over 1 million U.S. dollars' worth of 10 Egyptian-made busses, he added.
Citing some of these negative aspects, Quetta mentioned drainage of Egyptian banks' money to fund these projects whereas it should have been the job of foreign banks. In addition to that, the conditions of renewal of concession period for the project are not clear. The state of the project after the end of the concession period together with the project's quality and validity for production are some of the negative aspects. The contracts signed did not stipulate the treatment of depreciation of equipment after the elapse of the concession period and not setting the value of the letters of guarantee as per the guidebook of the UNIDO (the United Nations Industrial Development Organization).
She added that the agreement which had recently been concluded between Egypt and Switzerland provided that part of Egyptian debts owed to Switzerland should be changed into non-refundable grants to be allocated to development projects especially financing non-governmental organizations for social development, preservation of the environment and creating job opportunities in governorates.
In his address before the People's Assembly Culture, Tourism and Media Committee, the minister stated that 474 thousand tourists visited Egypt in December last, an increase rate of 62% over the corresponding period of 2001.
WALI: WHEAT CULTIVATED AREAS AMOUNT TO 2.5 MILLION FEDDANS THIS YEAR
Wali pointed out that the policy of crop categories of wheat research programme would be adopted so that the crops might be cultivated where they could give the highest yield and to protect crops from diseases. Besides, new high-yielding crops that are resistant to yellow Rust disease would be encouraged. The rate of using selected seeds will also be raised to about 30% of wheat cultivated areas.
TURKISH DELEGATION CALLS FOR INCREASING INVESTMENTS WITH EGYPT
PISCINE PRODUCTION REVENUES HIT LE29 MILLION
The Arab Investment Guaranty Foundation said it would put forward 3 projects costing 106.5 million U.S. dollars to Egyptian businessmen for implementation in Syria.
The third project will be aimed to make flat glass by using Syrian sand to meet the Syrian market's increasing needs of this type of high-quality glass, with possibly exporting the rest to the neighbouring Arab market. Expected to produce 180,000 tons annually, the project has an investment cost of 32.82 million U.S. dollars and internal returns of 47 percent.
The conference, which wrapped on Wednesday, discussed the economic privileges of special insurance funds, controlling them, revamping their managerial systems and operations of converting them into other different activities, amalgamating or liquidating them, imposing penalties on fund members, settling disputes and assessing allocations for future pension advantages as compared to one-payment funds.
The economic consultant and head of European Commission's operations said that the commission is developing now a group of commercial programs with a view to increasing Egyptian exports volume and backing up the Egyptian economy to establish distinguished commercial relationships with European union's countries and other international markets and make use of promising opportunities granted by the international economic system.
Al-alam Al-Youm learnt that Egypt will sign in a few days time a protocol of cooperation with both Russia and Ukraine with a view to supplying Egyptian commodities to the value of half a billion pounds in return for wheat. Both " Export Development Bank" (EDB) and " Misr International Bank" (MIB) will finance this deal and other future deals, something which means solving all financial problems which were the main reason for the retreat of the Egyptian exports to Eastern Europe.
He added that the Egyptian exports to both countries are agricultural and foodstuff products, furniture, leather products, drugs, ceramics, textiles, garments, raw cotton and yarn, cosmetics and engineering industries, which are equal to the value of the Egyptian imports from both countries.

Only one Jew was nominated under the banner of the Union National des Forces Populaires (UNFP) in the recent elections in Morocco in Essaouira constituency on the Atlantic Ocean. It is noteworthy that Essaouira city is the birthplace of Azoulai, who was detained together with Abderrahman Al-Yousfi and were taken to the central police station in Casablanca in 1963. At that time, Azoulai was one of the UNFP (later Union Socialite des Forces Populaires (USFP) activists.
Official spokesman for the Orthodox Church in Jerusalem and Holy Lands, Archimandrite Attalah Hanna, called for forming an Islamic-Christian committee that works to abort American war against Iraq and liberate the historic lands of Palestine from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean.
"Christians, Arabs or Palestinians alike, should join resistance with all its forms against Israeli occupation because they are part of the fabric of the Palestinian people and the nation as a whole," he concluded.
Second: Clouds will continue covering parts of Iraq, especially in the north. However, the sky is likely to be clear at that time.
Last Wednesday, Damanhour city (Lower Egypt) witnessed a big farce which has been reported by Arab and foreign satellite channels. Citizens were prevented from voting during the elections between Muslim Brotherhood candidate, Gamal Hishmat whose People's Assembly membership had been cancelled and Wafdite candidate Khairi Qalag, backed by the National Democratic Party.
Surprisingly, the election process ended at 7 p.m. and the results were announced at 9 p.m. The Wafdite candidate won by 16,862 votes against 965 votes for Gamal Hishmat.
In reply to the charges launched by a non-Islamic organization in India that Al-Azhar had deleted the Koranic verses related to Jews from its curricula, he said that the recent development of education in Azharite institutes had concentrated on social and mathematical subjects to the exclusion of Sharia subjects. He pointed out that such development, while keeping away from the essence, dealt with the form, analysis and updating as we want Azharite graduates to be well acquainted with the affairs of life, open-minded enough to understand what was going on round them.
Amid an escalated wave of protests and rejection of the new unified labour act, which is currently being discussed by the People's Assembly (PA), Dr. Fatehi Sorour, PA Speaker received on Saturday a delegation from a march staged by Defending Labour Rights Association.
Great numbers of labourers from all over the country also participated in the conference during which Mohieddin and Dawoud called for squaring up to the issuance of this bill by all possible means.

Dr. Saleh was born in Cairo on August 23, 1946. After she had graduated from the Faculty of Islamic Studies, she acquired her master's degree under the rubric of "DivorceBetween Unrestrictedness and Restrictedness", which is a very important issue for women in the Muslim world, who suffer so much as a result of some men's abuse of the divorce right.

Although Israel used to accuse the Egyptian government of providing cover for these tunnels, the latter used to bury them once it knows especially as they are used for smuggling drugs into the Egyptian side.
Turkey, also for the first time, tries to seem as if its option was not decided as was the case in previous times.
The Arab legitimacy of war seems unattainable particularly as the international legitimacy itself is not reliable and the EU stance is a clear sign of that. In terms of politics, Turkey, under the new government, adopted a line that tries to stand out from its repugnant American side by not ignoring the facts set out by its European and eastern sides at the same time.
Despite the far-sightedness expressed by Turkey under the Justice and Development Party, its reactions to the escalating Iraqi situation did not come out of the mentality of the post-World War One.
There is no doubt that Turkey is a big deep-rooted country in the region, but, alas, it managed its affairs with the mentality of an artificial country like Israel. Its aspiration has been to be at the same position of Israel in the eye of the US.
ISRAELI FEARS OF SYRIAN AND IRANIAN ARMAMENT RACE

Turkey, also for the first time, tries to seem as if its option was not decided as was the case in previous times.
The Arab legitimacy of war seems unattainable particularly as the international legitimacy itself is not reliable and the EU stance is a clear sign of that. In terms of politics, Turkey, under the new government, adopted a line that tries to stand out from its repugnant American side by not ignoring the facts set out by its European and eastern sides at the same time.
Despite the far-sightedness expressed by Turkey under the Justice and Development Party, its reactions to the escalating Iraqi situation did not come out of the mentality of the post-World War One.
There is no doubt that Turkey is a big deep-rooted country in the region, but, alas, it managed its affairs with the mentality of an artificial country like Israel. Its aspiration has been to be at the same position of Israel in the eye of the US.

"They immigrated to different parts of the world but did not conceal their original country's culture even amongst the sons of the second and third generations," he indicated.

MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD CANDIDATE LOST ELECTIONS THROUGH THUGGERY!
Nor were satellite channel correspondents who recorded how voters were prevented from giving their votes, spared such harassments by security forces, which forced them to flee the scene.

Al-Gibali was one of the luckiest Palestinian workers because he managed to enter Israel to find a job though that job was even a temporary one. However, he did not find an appropriate job, so he headed for a Tel Aviv district, where he used to live and work in the "good old days" to quote his words.
He devised a new technique that does not lack innovation. He noticed a corner in Rothschild Street, downtown Tel Aviv, deserted because of refurbishment works. He put a banner written in Hebrew reading "Parking space". He parked cars for 10 shekels ($2) which is a convenient price in the market of that town.
It is unusual for the Arab and Muslim worlds to have a lady - specialized in Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and religious affairs - who is dedicated to defending women's rights and empowerment. However, this lady has turned up finallyit is Dr. Suad Ibrahim Saleh, who is head of the Fiqh Department, Al-Azhar University's Faculty of Islamic Studies, whose fame has reached the outside world thanks to her struggle to be a first lady mufti in Egypt.
Dr. Saleh has no problems with the state, but rather with the Islamic institution of Al-Azhar, in which she has been involved since the 1960s. Now that all Egyptian religious bodies, including the Dar Al-Ifta' (religious opinion authority headquarters) under the Ministry of Justice, are within the jurisdiction of this institution, represented by Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar Dr. Mohamed Sayed Tantawi, the post of lady mufti is contingent upon the accession of Sheikh Tantawi, who is in the belief that a lady mufti is unneeded.

Anyway, Abdulla Gul must take into account that the Turkish duality is present in the mind of the international public opinion. The stands he expressed and the questions he raised about the American war on Iraq may bear fears, concerns, and considerations that are uppermost in the minds of the military as much as they are of concern to politicians. It was the first time for Turkey, in almost one century, to find itself forced to think seriously and realistically giving weight to its eastern dimensions. It is Turkey that contented itself with its affiliation to the west and its burning desire to belong to Europe.
Therefore, the involvement of Turkey as well as Israel may constitute such legitimacy, which remains negative in form and content.
In this regard, Turkey may have realized at last that its negligence of its eastern relations, ignorance of the historical and geographical facts and turning a blind eye to the obligations of the future towards the neighbours led it to a situation that aroused all its fears.
The Kurds complex is still a password in the explanation of the political infertility in Turkey, which may even be ready to wink at the re-drawing of the map of the region unless the Kurdish card is touched as this would mean the re-drawing of the map of Turkey itself.
There might be loots, which Turkey could avail itself of, but, anyway, they would not be equal to the problems that Ankara along its neighbours would have to deal with whether in the presence of the Americans or after they do what they want and destroy the region. The Americans would then direct their attention to another area where they might find an enemy encouraging their war industry and allowing them to have a new training in arrogance.
The newspaper added that the fact that Iran's nuclear activity and development of long range ground-to-ground missiles constituted a tremendous threat to Israel. In contrast to Russia, which imposed restrictions on Iran regarding nuclear technology applications to prevent the development of atomic weapons, North Korea is willing to extend unconditional and unlimited support, which might shorten the schedule for the development of non-conventional Iranian weapons.
It added that Syria has also a myriad of ballistic missiles including 500 missiles with 300-700km ranges it had bought from North Korea which also provided it with technology to produce S.S.21 missiles which had been manufactured in the former Soviet Union.
The report concluded by branding the Syrian policy as "rogue" and demanding it be necessarily included in the "axis of evil" or forced to determine its position on the new regional map which might emerge after the imminent war on Iraq and to stop "jamming" the American military scheme in the region and stop backing terrorism in the Middle East.
He added that any movement of Sudanese government forces would run counter to the ceasefire agreement which forces both parties not to redeploy forces in military operation regions currently.
Rumours even had it that Saddam Hussein might choose to seek asylum in a number of countries after leaving Baghdad willingly.
In the beginning, President Bush roared himself hoarse warning against the dangers threatening America because of the nuclear, chemical and biological weapons Saddam Hussein was (allegedly) making in palaces, mosques, schools and bedrooms. However, a key-note American journalist who is highly esteemed by Arab monarchs and presidents admitted that the war was actually for petroleum which they did not want a ruler like Saddam to control!

HAMAS LEADER: DETAINING ISRAELIS MAY LIBERATE PALESTINIAN PRISONERS
He added that prisoners could be released only through the power of arms, stressing the continuation of resistance against Israel. "We've the right to defend ourselves as our people are being occupied. The Israelis destroy, kill and practise state terrorism."
We should seek to possess power in order to confront the enemy with all possible means.
ARAB INTERIOR MINISTERS LIST TERROR PROPAGANDA AS TERRORIST CRIME
HOLLAND RELEASES MULLAH KRIKAR
He added that his deportation from Iran on September 11th last year to the Netherlands was "a deal between Tehran and Jalal Talabani's group and the Americans."
In a press conference held before his leaving Ankara, Al Shar' emphasized that Syria and Turkey had a common attitude confirming that the region could not stand war and needs peace, stability and development.
A poll conducted by the "Iraq Institution for Democracy" in the governorates of Arbil, Dahuk and Zakhu, which are not subject to Baghdad's power, pointed out that most of the residents prefer an international mandate by the UN during the transitional period if Saddam is ousted.
In a new important development in Moscow-Baghdad relations, two Russian high level delegations are heading for Iraq today (15th January).
The source added that Sultanov would be in charge of political coordination, evaluation of the situation and setting a strategy and a tactic for the coming stage. He emphasized that Russia's goal was to "keep the issue within the political diplomatic framework."
Under this headline, managing editor, Amina Al-Naqash wrote a column on page 9, which ran to the following effect: Although I am one of those many Egyptians who believe in the ancient Egyptian bureaucratic proverb which says that setting up a committee for discussing a problem means that it will not be solved, I was delighted to hear that the Ministry of the Interior had set up a committee to search for ways and means to more effectively preserve human rights and look after penal institutions through setting policies and legislation that comply with international charters for the treatment and the preservation of the rights of prisoners.
Those who suspect government promises especially those made by the Interior Ministry argue that setting up such a committee had been the result of western pressure seeking to change the Middle East countries into communities whose systems are similar to those applied in theirs in a bid to preserve their own interests.
Under this headline, Abd Al-Wahab Badrakhan, deputy chief editor of Al-Hayat writes an article that runs to the following effect only in part: The escalation by North Korea in contrast to the Iraqi submission to international inspection inevitably calls for rumination especially about how the USA deals with these two cases in quite different ways.
Obviously, Washington's hurrying to the negotiation talk with Pyongyang only means that it still recognizes the regime in North Korea even though it wants to topple it. It especially means that Washington wants to defuse a crisis that has untimely erupted and would bolster the objections to a war against Iraq.
TWO ADVERSARIES MEET AND AGREE
Therefore, when the Arab Interior Ministers meet with Information Ministers journalists become dejected and their eyes express fear and concern.
Over the past years, the Arab Interior Ministers set an "Arab media plan for raising security awareness" to find a justification to interfere in the direction of the media. They have recently formed a work team (of senior security officials of course) to draft a second Arab media plan. The draft plan was approved in the 20th session of their council two days ago though media would be better if the grip of security was kept off it.
What is the concept of crime in the document, which the media men were not allowed to see?
Even more serious is the fact that the interior ministers intend to present a draft of the "Arab law for fighting the misuse of information technology" to the Arab justice ministers so that there may be cooperation in setting a model common law in this field.
It is noteworthy that the USAID has financed grants to two thousand persons who are considered leaders in the Egyptian social life. They include 291 young people from 17 governorates in addition to 1200 others from the countryside. Women got 58% of the previous grants. Some 610 sheikhs and bishops obtained training as well.
He, further, pointed out the project of judicial cooperation between Egypt and the American administration at a cost of $17 million per annum. This programme, he added, aims at training 6 thousand judges and personnel of the Ministry of Justice.
Official American statements made by Bush and his crew give no decisive answer that the attack against the enemy is inevitable, even after the international inspectors emphasized that they did not find any hiding places of mass destruction weapons. American Intelligence had submitted information about such hiding places to the inspection teams. However, military build-up is still flowing, details of an American-British forces deployment is still spreading everyday and predictions about the date and plan of the attack are deliberately leaked. Bush does not stop declaring that war is the last resort. At the same time, however, he stressed that Saddam possesses mass destruction weapons that must be disarmed either willingly or forcibly.
PRESIDENT BUSH IS SICK AND TIRED AND OUT OF PATIENCE!
He who saw the international inspectors searching the bags of the Education Faculty female students in Baghdad delightfully would know the meaning of provocation and evaluate the insults to which the magnanimous resisting Iraqi people are exposed at the hands of those under the cover of international legitimacy and its resolutions.
WARNING ABOUT STRIKING OFF 400 COMPANIES FROM STOCK EXCHANGE
Al-Torgoman will visit the Sultanate of Oman within a few days' time to discuss joint cooperation and activate the dream of the Arab unified stock exchange.
Furthermore, in the phase to come a new system of arbitration and dispute settlement in the Egyptian Stock Exchange would be announced, he revealed, making it clear that a fund for non-commercial risks regarding brokerage companies and financial institutions members in the Stock Exchange would be founded in cooperation with the Public Authority for Capital Market.
IMF and World Bank resumed their demands that the government reduce the Egyptian pound rate of exchange against the dollar.
Discussions also include the steps taken by the government to develop the banking system and restore dealers' confidence in it after uncovering corruption cases in which some banking leaderships were involved and were therefore referred to trial. Banking leaderships were also subjected to comprehensive changes.
The talks also included the measures taken by the government to streamline investment, increase exports, rationalize domestic expenditure and provide foreign exchange resources. Work has set off on the construction of special economic zones which provide advantages for Egyptian and foreign investors as well as measures to develop industrial zones in governorates.
The remarks were made by the Egyptian minister at the "Egyptian-Russian Trade Relations" symposium, organized by a Russian economic magazine. Foreign investments in the Middle East region will be negatively affected, and earnings from the Suez Canal, tourism and expatriate workers will fall, she said.
CBE governor Mahmoud Abul-Oyoon had asked bank presidents ten days back to procure pilgrims needs of the Saudi riyal and the dollar with a view to confining speculations on the black market.
Experts on their part asked the government to take the required measures to move the market, foremost of these measures is adopting a new policy of exchange rate especially after the big leap in the dollar exchange rate which remained fixed from 1991 to 1997, however local and regional developments led to an increase in the dollar exchange rate from LE3.50 to LE4.64 currently (according to CBE decision).
Al-Abyad mentioned he resorted to fax the message to the political leadership after complete ignorance of exchange firms' problems on the part of the government.
He laid it bare as well that the maximum volume of dealings for a company now does not exceed $100 per day versus $100,000 in the past, pointing out that this reflects the sagging financial positions of these companies and their ineluctable losses.
Dr. Khidr and the Russian deputy premier, who doubles as agriculture minister, agreed to execute deals between both countries under the offset system during next March, provided execution talks would be completed between technical committees. The Russian minister said that both countries agreed initially to complete the 5-year long-term agreement, pointing out that Russia actually needs Egyptian commodities such as citrus fruit, rice, onion, potato and other products. In addition, Egypt will import wheat, cooking oil, and maize, said the minister, pointing out that talks were positive indicators.
On his part, Egypt's ambassador to Moscow, Ra'ouf Saad said all agreements between both sides as well as the means to execute them will be followed up on all levels within the next weeks.
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Dr. Fayza Abul-Naga estimated Egypt's losses in case of striking Iraq at 8 billion dollars (40 billion pounds).
Egypt did not impose any charges on paper or billet, he said.
Two days ago, a protocol for exchanging Russian wheat for Egyptian products was signed on behalf of Egypt by deputy chairman of supply commodities Authority and on behalf of Russia by Russian deputy minister of agriculture, in the attendance of Minister of Supply and Domestic Trade Dr. Hassan Khidr and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Fayza Abul Naga. The agreement includes importing one million tons of Russian wheat at preferential prices, which the two countries declined to announce. Both the value and amounts will be defined in a few months' time. The offset deals will be carried out through the Egyptian Bank for Export Development and the Russian Agricultural Bank.
Registered real estate wealth, Abul-Enein expected, will be possibly benefited from through obtaining a credit under its guarantee to finance small projects, in addition to the stability of real estate ownership.
The "one-person" projects, which were funded by banks, have been doomed to failure, he pointed out.
These rules will be issued upon a decree by the prime minister after the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) presents its proposals concerning such rules, he said.
Any bank that gives loans in return for in-kind guarantees is a fiasco," he added.
According to a recent report issued by the "British national census office," the Egyptian exports to Britain covered imports by 97% in the current year against 87%, he pointed out.

CANADIAN MIGRATION MINISTER: PREPARATIONS FOR ESTABLISHING TRAINING CENTERS
The minister pointed out that the new program for developing skills which the Canadian embassy in Cairo is preparing now, the new Canadian school in Egypt, which he inaugurated, and the increase of the number of Egyptian students who study in Canada, will help shoring up cooperation between the two countries and preparing a new generation who will find it easy to work - if it likes - in Canada as it got certificates accredited on the Canadian market.
It is expected that MIB will play the role of loan investment manager in Egypt in agreement with the international banks contributing to financing the foreign part of the project's capital. These foreign banks are ANZ, HSBC, Barclays International, in addition to other 9 banks that will extend in the neighbourhood of $850 million for this giant project.

He pointed out that the added value hit LE1528 million versus LE1240 million, an increase of 23%.
Head of General Authority for Investment and Free Zones Dr Mohamed Al-Ghamrawi said that total Arab and foreign contributions to the capital of these companies hit LE1.4 billion at a rate of 36%, which confirms the influx of direct foreign investments into software and information technology in Egypt.
HAMAS AND JIHAD REJECT TEMPORARY ARMISTICE
They pointed out Egyptian-American contacts to ensure that Israel would not undermine the agreement that might be reached by Palestinian groups. It considered that such an agreement would bolster the PNA and its orientations towards the resumption of peaceful negotiations.

THE SAUDI INITIATIVE FOR REFORM
If external aggression against any Arab country is illegitimate and should, therefore, be resisted as the text of the initiative published on the Saudi paper Arab News said, it is advisable not to wait until next March to see that article put into effect. We should rather lose no time in translating it into reality as soon as possible as aggression on Iraq may take place even before that date.
We wish that Saudi Arabia would start with practically implementing this political participation and all its requirements, and to set the example for other Arab countries so that they might follow in its steps. If it did that, it would deserve to be the leader of the Arab world and would find all Saudi and Arab citizens rallying behind it in confronting any American media or political campaigns targeting it.
The Arab countries that received the invitation, namely Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Saudi Arabia dare not ask Iraqi president to step down and go into exile. So this demand is concealed behind the Turkish "Sublime Port," as such Arab leaderships are not reassured that they would remain in power, nor could they pledge to protect Iraqi president if he responds to their demands to step down.
The U.S. forces are too large to believe that they target the besieged and starved Iraq that belongs to the Third World countries.
As an Egyptian opposition Al-Wafd Party member of parliament recognized that a party colleague of his won a parliamentary seat through rigged voting, the Islamic-oriented MP Adel Eid tabled an inquiry to the minister of the interior about what happened in Damanhour Jan. 8th by-election, particularly its concomitant wrongdoings and police interference with the race in favour of Al-Wafd candidate Khairy Kalag against former deputy Gamal Hishmat, the Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) candidate, whose parliamentary membership was declared invalid mid-December. The Egyptian parliament is expected to set Jan. 25 as a date for debating the request for information on the allegedly fixed vote.
What happened in Damahour Ward is an "apostasy of democracy and a tremor that shocked Al-Wafd Party", said al-Shazly, calling on Gomaa to abjure his way of dealing with party members, to listen to counter-opinions and to reconsider the way of party practices within Al-Wafd in the future.
Al-Wafd Party recently grabbed a new parliamentary seat from the Muslim Brotherhood whose candidate Hishmat went down to Al-Wafd candidate Khairy Kalag in the by-election in Damanhour on Jan. 8 after votes were proven miscounted.
There is certainly no coincidence between the two views, but their approximation whatever its degree, is considered a step forward particularly in light of differences between the stands of the governments and the stances of their people in the recent years.
The criticism of the Arab reality did not go beyond the limits of special councils and meetings.
Before the satellite channels there was the phenomenon of publications issued outside the boundaries of the Arab world.
This crisis and its political repercussions laid bare Arab reality, which can no longer be covered.
In this sense, and within these limits, it can be said that decision-makers and opinion-holders unintentionally agreed on something they had not agreed on; the bad Arab reality and the possible criticism of this reality.
It is clear that the last week saw what can turn into a development in this relationship between the cultured and the man of power.
The domestic conditions of each country seem to be difficult and the governments seem also to be similarly weak towards them.
The most indicative point here is the Saudi initiative for the next Arab summit in Bahrain, which was published by Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper on the same day.
The third is abiding by resolving all inter-Arab differences in peaceful ways and banning the use of force among Arab states as well as taking one stand against any Arab country that assaults another country under any pretext or condition.
As well as being a key Arab state, Saudi Arabia is a socially and politically conservative country.
This strategy has something to do with the critical situation through which the region passes now due to the Iraqi issue.
This is confirmed by the fact that Saudi Arabia is the initiative-taker here.
It is true that the Saudi proposals came short and did not handle the political and legal mechanisms required to put them into effect.
The discussion of the initiative content requires a climate marked by freedom and transparency.
Is there in parallel to this an official readiness to shoulder the responsibility for the outgrowth of this reality?
Rather, they are the product of their societies and national cultures.
However, the role of the decision-maker and his conviction to take the initiative instead of leaving it for others as well as his awareness of the nature of the stage and its requirements can not be ignored.
POLITICAL ROLE OF MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD REJECTED IN FORM AND CONTENT: AL-ADLI
EGYPTIAN DEPUTY SUBMITS A BILL FOR RAILWAY PRIVATIZATION
The new railway authority to be set up under this bill will be authorized to exploit the plots of land it owned round the railway station campuses through setting up commercial activities, building a commercial building, a cinema or a theatre.
The bill has granted the new authority the right to exempt from customs, taxes and duties and equipment, machinery and spare parts which it imports on its own or via others' assistance provided they are checked and proven to belong to its projects.
Asharq Al-Awsat learnt that the meetings included open discussions between Welch and the attendees about the current positions and the developments of the Iraqi issue. U.S. media officials at the embassy denied reporters and representatives of any official media bodies to attend the meetings.
The meetings made the attendance feel that striking Iraq has become a decisive matter that is gradually prepared for and that there are expectations by U.S. intelligence bodies that the American interests in the world might be hit.
The new Palestinian draft constitution, a copy of which was obtained by Asharq Al-Awsat paper, set five years as a presidential term in office, which can be renewed just once.
But, should the majority vote against the decision, then the president and the government must quit, according to the proposed constitution.
State authorities' actions will come under legal and judicial examination.
Every Palestinian citizen should have access to politics, including candidacy, franchise, political activities and engagement in political parties.
LIEUTENANT GENERAL AL-AMARI: ALGERIAN ARMY WOULD RECOGNIZE THE COMING PRESIDENT EVEN IF HE WAS AN ISLAMIST
Al-Amari, the highest rank in the Algerian army, who undertakes the duties of Defence Minister, denied any deep differences between President Bouteflika and the military.
Defending the military situation, Al-Amari said, "We had only two alternatives, either accept a religious totalitarian regime like that which governed Afghanistan later on or save the State institutions, which we did."
CHRISTIAN CLERGY PRAISE MARTYRDOM OPERATIONS, URGE FOR SENDING HUMAN SHIELDS TO IRAQ
Father Attalah Hanna, the spokesman for the Orthodox Church in Jerusalem and holy sites in Palestine, said addressing the rally, "From the Easter Church, the holiest Christian place in the world, we express our churches' and people's solidarity with the heroic Iraqi people, who are now under daily provocative actions (by the U.S.)."
He called for honouring those martyrs and self-sacrificers by using their names for the streets, facilities and edifices of Palestinian cities, villages and refugee camps.
"We have formed a national delegation of Palestinian Muslim and Christian clergymen, who will head for Iraq to be human shields and to carry our messagea message from our Muslim and Christian holy sites and our struggling Palestinian people to the Iraqi people.
Observers in Beirut see that the timing of this announcement, which came from the Foreign Ministry, has many political indications on international and internal levels.
"Resistance forces are always militarily ready, and its main goal is to liberate Shebaa Farms," he said. What was said by Qusair means that Hizbullah fears that Israel may exploit the U.S. strike on Iraq to assault South Lebanon and, therefore, it would confront such aggression.
EGYPT: 5 MILLION EMIGRANTS & 10 THOUSAND POLITICAL ASYLUM SEEKERS
UN figures point out that the number of legitimate refugees in Egypt amounts to about 10 thousands besides 15 thousand holders of the yellow card waiting for their positions determination. However, there are about two million illegitimate refugees in Egypt, apart from the 3 million Sudanese residents whom Egypt refuses to deal with as illegitimate refugees.
They all confirm that every person has a right to seek political asylum so long as he is exposed to repression of any kind or for any reason.
Thirdly, the category of political refugees to Egypt which claims the largest number as they reach four times as many as the number estimated by the UN Commission on Refugees statistic. There are 30 thousand African students granted scholarships by the commission to continue their education after that proved impossible in their original country. They are looking forward to benefiting by educational utilities in Egypt. They are mostly from Ethiopia, Sudan, Djibouti, Somalia. They used to be top students in their original countries.
The official added that 400 refugees have no nationality. They originally came from various countries like Turkey, Russia and Poland after the Second World War but failed to acquire the Egyptian nationality. Some of their living requirements are now being provided by the Refugees Office.
In spite of the recession, liquidity shortage and all indicators of a difficult economic crisis in Egypt, figures testify to the contrary.
Expenditure on buying clothes, drapery and shoes rose by 67.6% in urban areas and 46% in rural areas.
Governorate capital cities dwellers expenditure on food came first as it hit LE5000 annually, followed by Lower Egyptian city dwellers spending LE3900, then Upper Egyptians LE3800, border governorates, LE5400 while rural family expenditure on food hit about LE3700.
They pointed out that that could be achieved through active diplomatic efforts by King Abdullah II, which yielded economically and politically positive results unconditional upon any Jordanian role in the war.
EU COUNTRIES CONSIDER EVACUATING THEIR NATIONALS FROM JORDAN AHEAD OF FEBRUARY 15TH
They will not compel any person to leave if he wants to stay.
Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) People's Assembly deputy, Hussein Ibrahim put in a draft law calling for banning TV competitions, which depend on luck, considering them some kind of gambling, which is religiously prohibited along the lines of lottery.
ISRAELI DIPLOMATS RELUCTANT TO WORK IN EGYPT, JORDAN
The Israeli ambassadors' families repeatedly left Cairo and Amman for Israel for fear of staying there, the sources said.
This came during the Shura Council session held on Monday, headed by its Speaker, Dr. Mostafa Kamal Helmi to discuss the problems that face small-sized industries.
At expanded debates on the Sudanese dossier, the committee urged Egypt to maintain coordination with the Sudan and the Nile Basin countries in a bid to resume works at the Jonglei Canal Project, which was about to be completed but suspended following the outbreak of the south Sudan crisis. The project is aimed to save the Nile river water, provide an additional quota of water estimated at roughly 9 billion cubic meters, equally shared by both countries, develop Nile water revenues for the time being as water needs are on the rise, and expand farmland in a bid to achieve self-sufficiency of crops, which is a pan-Arab food security strategy.
The South Korean embassy in Tel Aviv said it has reserved a suite at an Eilat hotel, while two European embassies neither denied nor confirmed reports that they had agreed with the Egyptian embassy in Tel Aviv to transfer their offices to the Egyptian Taba resort if the U.S. went ahead with its war on Iraq.
Algerian Army Chief of Staff, Lt General, Mohamed al-Amari said that he would accept the results of the presidential elections which are going to be held in the spring of 2004 no matter what they are even if the winner was an Islamist.
He, however, declined to give any further information preferring to talk about constitutional issues before he talked about presidential elections to be held in 2004.
To the highest rank military commander, the Islamic Front was just a terrorist organization.
Scores of clergymen and Palestinian Christians, together with a vast crowd of residents of the occupied city of Jerusalem staged a sit-in at the main yard of the Easter Church in the occupied Jerusalem on Friday morning to protest U.S. bellicosity and provocative actions against Iraq.
He went on to say, "These martyrdom self-sacrifice operations targeting the depths of Israel are pioneering and distinguished, and a deterrent to the Zionist enemy that knows only the language of force and believes that only force can bring peace. We say to the enemy: leave our territory, our Jerusalem and our holy sites for this is an Arab Palestinian land which has nothing to do with Jewry or Zionists."
Father Hanna further demanded those who are critical of this type of resistance to reconsider their positions, give top priority to national interest and realize that this occupation will come to an end only through resistance and martyrdom attacks.
It is a message of solidarity and loyalty, calling for thwarting the potential aggression and lifting the siege on the Iraqi people."
There is a semi-truce on the Lebanese-Israeli border and no indication of any security tension. Rather, the tension in the last period was confined to Israeli threats against Hizbullah and Lebanon, something that aroused fears of Israeli aggression on South Lebanon.
Does this mean that resistance operations would be suspended during the war on Iraq?
The phenomenon of illegitimate emigration to Egypt has increased and started to be a source of social and economic harm. Besides, there is also a number of refugees in Egypt.
This year 700 thousand persons of different nationalities illegitimately residing in Egypt have been repatriated. The number of Egyptians who reside in European countries amounts to about 3 million Egyptians with their biggest gathering in Italy.
His application is discussed in coordination with the UN bureau for refugees in Cairo so that each case is studied discretely.
After they finish their studies, they face a dilemma and have to decide whether to return to their original countries or stay in their asylum country or ask for settlement in an industrial country. Most of them choose the latter option and head for three countries: Australia, Canada and America. This applies to about 90% of African refugees students who studied in Egypt.
The official ascribes the low number of political refugees in Egypt compared with other African countries to the fact that its geographical position allows of no big waves of refugees. Sudan for instance has borders with several other countries which have political and economic problems in addition to torrential rains and droughts. This leads to huge groups of refugees leaving those countries for Sudan so much so their number reached about one million refugees who live in camps and makeshift houses. The commission offers them aid in housing, food and health services.
According to a report by a team of experts from the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics, the Ministry of Planning, National Investment Bank and university professors, there has been a one-third rise in the Egyptian family income in the last four years. The family average annual expenditure in cities used to be LE7640, but reached LE11585, while family expenditure in rural areas rose from LE5592 to LE7378.
Then came ninth on the list family average expenditure on food and drink an increase of 25.9% in urban areas and 19% in rural areas. After that, came expenditure on furniture, household utensils at the bottom of the list, thus being singled out as the only slow down in expenditure, a decline of 16% in urban areas and 35.7% in rural areas.
Cigarettes and hubble-bubble got the lion's share of average spending, LE759 for the family mobile phones constituted a burden for the family in cities as average spending hit LE1227 while reaching LE249 in rural areas.
One of those officials pointed out that the American understanding of Jordan 's internal and regional conditions had contributed to Jordan averting entering into deals and settlements about which three used to be much embarrassing talk in mid-last year.
Representatives of EU embassies held a meeting on Sunday in the Greek embassy headquarters in Amman, as Greece is current head of the EU.
It might be mentioned that European missions had taken the same step during the Second Gulf War in 1991 when they helped their nationals to depart in anticipation of random reactions especially as Britain takes part with the U.S. in building up military forces against Iraq.
After the success achieved by the Ikhwanite deputies in the last parliamentary session in getting the approval of the Proposals and Complaints Committee over considering a draft law presented by Ibrahim in which he called for applying the lashing punishment to intoxicant addicts according to the Islamic Law (sharia) Ibrahim also put in a new draft law providing for amending the Penal Code concerning criminalizing gambling and lottery. The draft law, which is expected to be discussed by the Proposals and Complaints Committee next week, stipulates he who prepares a place for or participates in organizing or supervising gambling would be punished by imprisonment.
Under the above heading, Yasser al-Zaatra, a Jordanian journalist with London-based Al-Hayat daily, writes a lengthy article on Cairo-facilitated dialogue among Palestinian factions, saying: If we want to list the three significant Palestinian parties engaged in dialogues, we can say they are Egypt, first, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and Fatah, second, and resistance (opposition) forces, mainly including Hamas and then Islamic Jihad, third.
However, this green light does not necessarily mean that Cairo brokered the dialogue to compliment "Israeli premonitions" inasmuch as it did so as part of its own vision to prove its weighty political presence in running the most intricate dossier in the region since it is the sole side that can bring together all Palestinian forces, including the PNA and opposition.
So, all Palestinian forces returned to the "elder sister" who can bring the ranks of Palestinians closer!
Egyptian efforts may be aimed to "rationalize" resistance by suspending martyrdom operations in the Palestinian territories which were occupied by Israel in 1948. Yet, Egyptian leaders may not be vexed, if they failed to notch up such an end, particularly if such an aim can be materialized in an undeclared way due to diplomatic failure to put the squeeze on Sharon to stop targeting Palestinian civilians and assassinations in return. This offer was presented by resistance forces, topped by Hamas, modeled on an earlier understanding in this spirit between Lebanon's Hezbollah and Israel in 1996.
The whole situation is largely contingent upon the Palestinian president for the will of calming, which was created recently out of fears of transfer and dismantling the PNA, pushed him to backtrack. But, this does not necessarily mean that he decided to give in to Sharon's preconditions since he knows very well that this will mean "suicide".
But, the political plank offered by some is similar to "political chatter" addicted by a well-known marginal faction that played a part in wording the 1974 program and wanted it to be approved by all.
But, the story of Israeli elections, Sharon and Mitzna does not concern Hamas.
This came during the Shura Council session held on Monday, headed by its Speaker, Dr. Mostafa Kamal Helmi to discuss the problems that face small-sized industries.
At expanded debates on the Sudanese dossier, the committee urged Egypt to maintain coordination with the Sudan and the Nile Basin countries in a bid to resume works at the Jonglei Canal Project, which was about to be completed but suspended following the outbreak of the south Sudan crisis.

On Jan. 27th, the dollar attracted attention locally and internationally in light of its continuous advance on the Egyptian unofficial market as its rate of exchange ranged between LE5.35 and LE5.38. In the meantime, the dollar retreated before the euro on the major capital markets to reach a level it hasn't reached for 3 years.
These banks committed themselves to showing on their screens that the dollar rate of exchange amounted to 464.5 piasters and that there are no dollar resources in such banks, something that blocked the way before clients' demands.
On the other hand, European currencies transacted in Egypt, went up yesterday on unofficial markets where the pound sterling rate of exchange jumped up to 870 piasters against 850 piasters late last week while the euro rate of exchange hiked to 575 piasters versus 566 piasters.
In his statements to Al-Alam Al-Youm the Dutch commercial attaché said the Egyptian exports to the Dutch market hit 93.6 million euros during the first six months of 2002 against 34.2 million euros during the same period in 2001 as the agricultural and industrial exports to the Dutch market amounted to 14.6 million euros and 79.3 million euros respectively.
Cairo is being visited by a commercial delegation comprising of 9 British companies operative in the field of water, experts in running water resources and sewage treatment as well as investors and specialists in the field of finance. This visit has been organized by British Waters establishment. A symposium is expected to be held on 28th Jan between the delegation and Egyptian officials to mull over cooperation in water sector.
On his part, representative of the British government in the visiting delegation said that Britain is executing public and private projects in Uganda, Nigeria and South Africa.
This was said by the new Japanese ambassador in Cairo.
He pointed out that the Japanese Government had resumed the programme of financial loans to Egypt extending a soft loan to the value of 5 billion Japanese yens or the equivalent of about LE2 million with a 10-year period of grace. The loan will be repaid over 50 years by the Japanese Government to the Social Fund for Development.
He said, "We support action to achieve the Road Map of the quartet."
Current Governor of the CBE pointed out that phenomenon in an interview a few weeks ago. He said that intensive efforts on all levels should be taken by the CBE and economic authorities in order to face it. Banks themselves have a role to play through creating new services and employments of the funds accumulated with them. They should also start with activating consumer credits.
In addition to that, the existing projects have numerous problems and are undergoing a stage of readjusting their positions with the banks. He pointed out that the banking system intervention through floating some projects does not lead to a big increase in credits. Some banks, furthermore, are keen on not getting so involved in the problems of projects that their funds and profits are affected as such funds and profits have already had enough retreat. Al-Barbari linked credit decline to the general climate of investment which needs a comprehensive reform to recover it through an integrated package of measures. Therefore, there must be a change in tax policy and the judicial system to cope with the new economic positions.

Former CBE governor and current Delta International Bank president, Ali Negm, says that the problem of the retreating demand for credit has also been aggravated by a retreat of foreign investment for several reasons including the following: -Foreigners deduced from the fuss made about faltering cases and businessmen trials that there were banking and administrative corruption cases, instability of the national economic climate and fluctuation in exchange rates and that the banks were affected by all such factors, which became evident in the retreat of profits made in 2002. Negm added that the effect of rates of interest was limited on the Egyptian market as the period that witnessed an investment boom were when the rates of interest were strikingly high. He added that the current economic policies would lead in the short run, to a way out of the current recession quandary.

CONTROVERSY OVER CAPITAL PUNISHMENT ABROGATION
The Fatwa Committee replied that the penalty was one of the Hudud (punishments) mentioned more than once in the Quran, "In the Law of Equality, there is (saving of) life to you, O ye men of understanding.."
This recalls to memory Turkey's position towards the same penalty when the European Union demanded that Turkey abrogate that penalty, thus using that card as European pressure on Turkey to get facilities on Turkish territories or perhaps logistical facilities.
Koranic verses are explicit on this point and the abrogation of this penalty is, therefore, out of the question.
Islamic philosophy professor, Dr. Zeinab Radwan, who doubles as People's Assembly member denied any arguments regarding the issue. She said she had no idea about that matter. She added that the Egyptian law provisions did not contravene Islamic jurisprudence which permits capital punishment only on the narrowest scale and only when there is solid evidence. She said: Islam which approved of capital punishment did so only to guarantee public interests and protect and upgrade society.
Al-Azhar professor of fundamentals of religion, Dr. Mohamed Abdel-Muneim Al-Barri told Al-Quds Al-Arabi that such matters do not stand hearsay.
Regarding rumours that had it that there was some intervention by foreign bodies to introduce an amendment to the Egyptian attitude towards the penalty, the same source said, "The government cannot be prevailed upon and this is a clear message which most countries get. The Egyptian political leadership is not so docile that it would bend to foreign wishes. If such a bill was subjected to argument, the People's Assembly would be the only body that would have a final say.
It is expected that Tel Aviv will inform Cairo officially of the appointment of Shekid who is considered the eighth Israeli ambassador to Cairo since the normalization of relations between the two countries for the first time after signing Camp David Peace Accord in 1979 under the auspices of former US president Jimmy Carter.

As the American attack on Iraq becoming imminent, Arab economic organizations have started to panic at the negative impacts of the potential strike on Arab economy and consequently on development and investment operations in all sectors especially as the theatre of military operations will be on territories whose main revenues come from petroleum, whose programmes might be halted till the end of the war, thus causing heavy losses.
He uncovered that unemployment rate would reach 20% in case of the war against Iraq, which would negatively impact on Arab countries' plans and lead to financial losses in employment costing $4-5 billion in the long run as a direct result of the war. In this framework, chairman of Arab Chambers Federation, Khalid Abou Ismail said Arab losses can not be estimated in figures, but the mere ebbing away of tourism, flight of investment, trade movement halt and dragging the region into destruction would cost us a lot.

Modifications made it incumbent upon exchange firms to apply the banks' posted rates of exchange and properly and clearly declare them in the branches that deal in foreign exchange.

EXPORTERS HAVE TO PRESENT THEIR EXPORTS FOREIGN EXCHANGE PROCEEDS TO BANKS
Gold experts and smiths expected new jumps in gold prices within the coming few years, particularly after the decision of deregulating foreign exchange. They stressed that the exportation of gold ore would stop for a limited period until the effects of the dollar deregulation would become clear. This, they argued, would definitely impact on the price of imported gold ore and increase the prices of gold works. Meanwhile, they added the market would suffer from hard recession in this field due to the continuous mad increase of gold ore prices worldwide, which hit six pounds in less than one month.
He, further, pointed out that these increases led to shutting down a lot of workshops in addition to 60% of traders quitting the market as they had sold all their stock when gold price went up to 46 pounds, hoping that they would make up for these quantities after the decline of prices. However, he added, they were surprised at the price increases. He warned against traders' refusal to purchase used gold under the pretext that they do not have liquidity, as the trader would not lose. No matter how high the purchase price was, he can sell what he has bought to the wholesaler at a higher price, at least one pound per gram, therefore he would make a reasonable profit without exerting great efforts, Al-Sergany added.
EGYPTIAN-MAURITANIAN FISHING COOPERATION PROTOCOL

In response to a question by Al-Ittihad about the outlook of the Egyptian pound rate of exchange against the dollar, treasury general manager of the International Bank of the United Arab Emirates said the pound rate of exchange is likely to stand, in the foreseeable future, at a rate near that available in the black market. However, fluctuations of the exchange rate in the medium run will depend on the pound status, money influxes and the country's income of foreign exchange, he said. He added that floating the pound would put an end to having two rates of exchange for it on the market.

MP Emad Al-Gelda warned against this phenomenon that claims the souls of citizens referring to the broadsides pressed by international organizations against Egypt.
MP Mahmoud Ri'faei asked for supplying expressways with roadsigns , while Mp Abdel Mun'eim Al-Oleimi asked for taking the required measures for facing this disaster referring to the fact that total accidents hit 24000 cases in 1999 and 31000 in 2000 of which 4000 citizens were killed and 18000 were injured.

Amid such a controversy in Kuwait, which will be the gate of the war the U.S. plans to wage against Iraq, Kuwaiti Information Minister Prince Ahmed Al-Fahd made statements in which he threatened to reconsider the concessions of newspapers, issue a law organizing the media and its performance and open the door for newspapers' owners to get new licenses.
For these reasons, the debate aroused by Al-Fahd will affect any attempts to construct an internal strong front in case war breaks out. The escalating debate in the parliament and mass media together with the growing commando operations against the Americans necessarily impact on the image of the ruling family.
Assiyasa newspaper said that minister of information's statements about "licenses of newspapers" would be the start of nationalizing the whole country, as this requires licensing banks and shops, something that would impact on the form of the state of establishments in Kuwait.
On the same occasion, he said the modernization drive, involving textile, iron and steel, medicine, grain mills, historical hotels and sea and overland transport sectors, cost some 150 million pounds. The drive is intended to help these sectors resume production, ease their financial burdens and convert them from losers into profitable businesses ahead of selling them off.
The industrial modernization is forecast to be completed within a couple of years at most, starting with the textile sector by raising output up to 170,000 tons of yarn in the future from 120,000 tons for the time being. This can be achieved by providing spare parts and subsidizing cotton prices, which hiked in recent years to account for 56 percent of production cost, while the workforce swallows the remaining percentage. Thus, the main obstacle facing textile company managers, shrugging off high-tech, was how to provide pays, sending weavers into a complete collapse notwithstanding available materials and well-trained labour, he added.
The grain mill sector can be revamped by replacing millstones mills with modern cylindrical ones, developing seven mills in Cairo and Alexandria, with a view to answering domestic needs.
American officials said that although most Iraqi immigrants belong to the Iraqi President's opposition and are supporters of the USA, the federal authorities are worried that some of those illegitimate immigrants who disappeared might be agents of the Iraqi regime or in league with terrorist organizations.

Their volume reached $345 million. In the second half it declined to $338 million with the implementation of the 12th stage.
He added, "This will streamline Egyptian exports and boost trade exchange."
Libya and Syria took the lead among the group exporters to Egypt. Their volume of total Egyptian imports amounted to about $40 million or 50.6% of total imports from that group.
He emphasized that the armed forces are on full alert to perform tasks assigned to them for the protection of the security and safety of Egypt and its great people.
Such a policy puts us in an embarrassing contradictory situation for while it persistently urges us to expedite modernization and democratic development which we have long omitted, it imposes upon us very difficult options including acceptance of new ruling regimes instead of the old ones, based on America's friends and those trusted by it even if they were militar y elites i.e. outside the conventional political elites.
On the other hand, it has become no secret either that the scenarios of Iraq 's future and the kind of the coming government there have become now the topic of conversation, research and rumination now that war has become, from the American point of view, in evitable. The American goal in Iraq is still the same goal in Afghanistan only with some differences.
Between the two contrasting types of American pressure, we lie captive.

The source, further, said if Palestinians agreed to stop all forms of violence for one year, the agreement would remain as a deposit with Egypt, waiting for Washington's approval. This stoppage would be on condition that Israel would implement its obligations to stop aggression on the Palestinian people and the Israeli military would completely withdraw to its positions before the intifada, the source added.
The memo was signed by more than one hundred political and religious personalities including ex-ministers, university professors, writers and businessmen.
Close sources to such figures said that Prince Abdullah listened attentively to them and said, "Your demands are mine." He added that he painstakingly does his best to make reform and stop wasting public funds.
"Much attention is paid by all the people and international organizations concerned, something that made the signatories express their deep anxiety about the goings-on, hoping that a drastic revision of the roots of such problems would be carried out with a view to stopping the current deterioration and putting the whole country on the real course of reform and progress," the memo said.
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL WAR!
It is a war motivated by ill-will and malicious intentions and hardly claims any degree of responsible feelings towards humanity.
The major dictator has got fed up with arguments and objections and is eager to hear only shouts of applause and approval, the same way a minor dictator might steam up if he just hears that somebody is still half-heartedly paying him allegiance and is delighted to hear epistles of devotion glorifying him or see his followers fully prostrate before his power.
A few months ago, many people in the West were busy trying to fathom the depths of the Arab streets' death and were greatly entertained to know that happy news! That street has already died.
Nor was it a matter of vying for supporting or criticizing Baghdad's regime as that was resolved in the 1991 war.
However, judging from all precedents, nobody should expect the Americans to act responsibly as the world has known them so well that reiteration of the same advice seems useless.
The other lie is trying to give the impression that the coming war would be just like computer games which bloodthirsty traders claim would be, contrary to all claims, a lightning war so that it would hardly be felt.
It will take place at the blink of an eye! However, the war-planning elite does not conceal worries about the shortage of plans after the strike.
The results of decontrolling the pound exchange rate against the US dollar created a state of caution not only among the economic circles and the business community but also among the ordinary citizens, state employees and the private sector. The state of caution involves the level of the real per capita income and the citizen's ability to meet his needs of commodities and services in light of the sudden decontrol of exchange rate and the poor level of wages and salaries.
Budget deficit Economics professor and deputy dean of the Economics and Political Sciences Faculty for Postgraduate Studies, Dr. Aliyah Al-Mahdi, expected that the government would not increase the salaries of the State employees to face the growing rise in prices and inflation rates.
The decontrol of exchange rate would take the prices of local products up as a result of depending on imported raw materials and product input, which would impact on the standard of living of citizens and the social status particularly of the low classes whose purchasing power is very poor.
It would have been better if the decision to reduce the interest rate had been delayed as long as the government was still considering the floating decision, she said.
This took place at the beginning of a series of meetings held by Shura Council's Health Committee during which it will open the file of cloning.
The Egyptian pound has been subjected to six consecutive reductions since the end of 1999 and prior to the Egyptian government decision to float the Egyptian pound rate of exchange before the principal currencies two days ago. Such consecutive reductions have led to a 23.6% retreat of the Egyptian pound value. Taking into account the latest reduction witnessed by the domestic currency after the recent floating decision, the Egyptian pound has retreated by about 40% since 2000, thus declining from LE3.85 per dollar to LE5.40.
In order to define the implications of such a decision on the Egyptian economy, it is necessary first of all to emphasize that the value of any floated currency relies on the ability of the external sector to generate constant inflows of foreign exchange into the country. This sector in the Egyptian economy is represented by tourism, commodity and service exportation sector, expatriates remittances, Suez Canal revenues and oil exports. The more the revenues collected from such channels, which represent the sources of dollar supply on the markets, the higher the dollar supply compared with the demand for it, thus consolidating the value of the domestic currency after floating and vice versa.
For the first time in 7 years Egypt has tabled a memo to the European Union (EU) to amend and lift the standing ban on Egyptian potato exports to EU markets.

The precautions adopted together with the European report suffice to lift the annual ban system on Egyptian potato exports to European markets.

Commenting on how far tourism in Egypt would be affected if a war broke out against Iraq, the minister said that Egypt is geographically away from the area of fighting.
Minister of Tourism said that such positive results reflected considerable international confidence in the safety, stability and attraction of the Egyptian tourism product. They also emphasize that in spite of the climate of the potential war in Iraq, international tourism is still booming and the tourists are still eager to move and travel.

For his part, Dr. Tharwat Bassili emphasized that the Medicine Division had some commitments that it would never deviate from. Such commitments, he added, are concentrated on the fact that price amendments would not by any means be a pretext to increase profitability, but only to cover cost increase. 80% of medicines at least would remain without increase in the current stage, he noted adding that regularly used medicines that affect the family budget such as blood pressure, heart and diabetes diseases would remain untouched. Prices of medicines that treat serious cases, such as tumor, immunity, renal failure and liver diseases and the like, would remain stable.

However, if such a war against that Muslim country and people were a religious war because it is a Muslim and a weak country or just for aggression unrightfully motivated, the infidel aggressor must then be resisted by all of us.
A: When we legitimized war against Iraq in 1990, the Muslim people of Kuwait was assaulted and robbed of honour and property by another Muslim aggressor - the Iraqis who fought Kuwait, robbed its land, honour and sanctities.
A: I think it is a war to root out religion as part of a war system including all Islamic countries, starting with Afghanistan, then Iraq and then Yemen and God only knows where else after that.
Q: What do you think of Muslim soldiers who fight in the American army in such wars?
The American intelligence sent me threats because of those fatwas. I was also contacted by the American embassy and by the Egyptian authorities asking me to avoid incitement.
A: The countries which help America fight a Muslim country and facilitate things for it whether through allowing the aggressors to use their territories or even through mere silence or acquiescence are apostate countries.
Q: Won't this anger the political leadership too?

Some people may defend such a step by arguing that the region is in for a state of war that might lead to a complete devastation of Iraq. It would not be unlikely either that Sharon's government would use that war as a pretext to displace the Palestinians or banish President Yasser Arafat and reoccupy Gaza Strip. The Egyptian-Israeli summit might lead to the prevention of such policies or at least alleviating their dangers.
The Egyptian people are against that invitation and see that Sharon's arrival would desecrate its land, dignity and history abounding in resistance of the expansionist Zionist project. The demonstration of hundreds of Egyptians on Cairo Book Fair margin shows only that honourable stand.
Many murder crimes are usually committed but this one is different as the perpetrator is a son and the victim is his own father and the reason is most trivial.

The report added that although there were no Hungarian capital contributions to investment projects in Egypt as Hungary is one of the countries attracting foreign investments, especially the direct ones, there are initial consultations and contacts to exchange ideas and feasibility studies over the possibility of setting up a number of joint ventures.

Well-informed sources warned that the American war might lead to launching a devastating strike at the Iraqi army that would divide it for regional, tribal or sectarian reasons, thus depriving the country of the only institution that ensures its integrity and prevent internecine wars and liquidations.
Regular forces: about 300,000 soldiers with old equipment and can hardly play an effective role in confronting any American attack.
Its morale allows it to fight so long as Saddam is alive and the relation with Qusi is not broken off.

TO FACE THE WORLD WAR!
In order to cut American ideas and projects to size, the Arabs should lose no time in forestalling (foreign plans) by putting forward political and economic reform projects and allowing intellectual and social elites to express themselves freely. An optimal climate should be created for political and social dialogue. This will protect reform steps from the charge of foreign intervention and save the Arab communities from ideological and political divisions. Furthermore, putting forward serious initiatives for reform at this particular time, together with implementation schedules, would help the internal front to unite against imminent developments and bolster the political regimes in the face of the current challenge!

"Egyptian inventors do rarely keep the accurate information on the implementation of the invention. Meanwhile, foreign inventors register data that do not show how the invention could be executed."
He pointed out that the main problem facing any Egyptian inventor lay in how to promote his invention, which would take place only through companies. There is a clear shortage in the number of real Egyptian inventors owing to lack of material aid, which leads them to leave the country with their inventions.

Heavy Losses Gulf countries would incur heavy losses in case war broke out in Iraq, the report noted, because they depend heavily on oil exports which are expected to decline during war in addition to the predicted negative impacts on the Gulf States labor estimating at 12 million; 60% of them are working in the service sector. Consequently, 1.4 million persons are expected to turn jobless, the report indicated.

PARLIAMENTARIAN REPORT: MOST EGYPTIANS KNOW NOTHING ABOUT PARTIES
The initial report, prepared by the committee on Human Force Development headed by Dr. Farkhanda Hassan, explained that the existing political parties in Egypt were not successful enough to attract the public and that they have a very limited presence in the political street.
The Shura Council's report ascribed the weakness of partisan participation to historical reasons, which include continuation of inherited customs of the one-party system and laxity of political awareness and education, which shows how far such participation is active. This, in turn, would diminish peaceful practice of political life and decrease rate of participation of partisan bases in decisions and affairs of some parties.

A dispute erupted between the two neighbours over drying the washing. When the dispute flared up the police stepped in. While a report on the incident was being noted down, the police force as well as the residents were surprised to see a representative of the Israeli embassy in Cairo.

He asked the newspapers issued abroad to seek the truth in their reports about Al-Azhar and check such news with Al-Azhar officials before getting them printed.
In his account, the minister said Israel used to collect water from the ends of spillways to use it in farming so some 40 earthen walls were built on spillways to hold and store water in 1,000 meter-deep wells in front of every dam.

Traders let gold or what's known as engagement jewellery provided the customer is well-known to the trader, and lives in the same part of the city. He is also required to bring two guarantors who have good reputation. The customer pays two pounds per gram of gold daily.

They called on the Arab summit to take decisive resolutions to drive out foreign forces from the Gulf bases. They demanded an Islamic Arab army be formed to liberate Islamic sanctities.
Ain Shams University students continued their demonstrations for the second day on end, calling for standing against the American threats to the Iraqi people.

The committee will hold their meetings on a periodic basis to follow up the situation on the Ethiopian plateau, which supplies Egypt with 85% of its water needs.

As Syria represents one side of the triangle of the Arab heart, we started our interview with Dr. George Gabbour who was adviser to late President of Syria Hafes Assad. He said the Arab regional order is facing a serious blow now that will certainly affect it but will not be able to eliminate it no matter how strong it may be. This is because the shake is not like the one that left a rift in 1977 and 1990, (an allusion to the Egyptian-Israeli talks and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait) particularly as after those two serious rifts the Arab nation developed ways and means to face such shakes.
Al-Barghouthi calls for examining how to activate the potential of the peoples and get them to participate in defending their interests. This, to his mind, requires a genuine democratic reconciliation between the governments and their peoples. This also necessitates a radical change to jump over side and petty contradictions and unite in one common will.
The Arab official order is a natural result of those structures. We are now witnessing the return of imperialism in a new form and slogans externally merciful but innerly hellish. The so-called Arab official order is responsible for this destructive and catastrophic result, which recalled the imperialist past.
Latif said the Arab official order undertakes the liquidation of the central Arab cause through stopping the uprising of our brave steadfast people in occupied Palestine.
The last alternative Chief of the Suez Canal University's Politics Department, professor Gamal Zahran says the Arab regional order is an ambitious idea but its effectiveness is tied to mechanisms, work programs, plans, and goals. He sees that the Arab regional order is existent in form, which is embodied in the Arab League and its affiliated organisations and the non-governmental organisations.
Concluding his talk, Zahran stressed that efforts made to activate the Arab regional order cripple its abilities and potential and hinder it from being an effective order like other regional ones.
In 1962, the government devalued the Egyptian pound by about 23% of the value, announced to the International Monetary Fund when it joined it. Since then the Egyptian pound declines have gone on in a row.
What is even graver is that the Egyptian economy structural reform is not a present option before the government as it can not frankly uncover to the masses what status the Egyptian economy reached as it is the one to blame for that status. Rather it would lie to tamper with figures and data to cover the truth and that the Egyptian economy might enter a dark area after the flotation of the Egyptian pound. With the people kept in the dark regarding truths, no structural reform of the Egyptian economy seems to be on the agenda.
MOVE TOWARDS CANCELLING STATE SECURITY COURTS & SETTING UP NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
Such a step is expected to be extensively applauded by the Egyptian opposition, which considered supreme state security courts "an assault at ordinary judiciary" as they are courts especially meant to examine state security-related cases.

He denounced the looting operations in Kirkuk and Mosul. This was carried out by the mobs who are given to crime and who also took the opportunity under slogans and flags, he said.
There was some sort of delay, I don't know whether it was intended or not but it led to exploiting this vacuum by the gangs who began to loot".
We abided by not entering Kirkuk, but what happened made me concerned with its future.
The KDP forces did not enter the city and aren't to blame for what happened.

The absence of Iraqi refugees seems to have caused a professional catastrophe to more than 1200 foreign, Arab, and local reporters who gathered in Al-Rewaishid border area to prepare tens of media programs about the refugees and their problems. They started to suffer from ennui because no Iraqi refugees have come and the authorities only allow them to see ordinary things in the area.
Therefore, foreign reporters find nothing but boredom, which pushed them to intensively gather to attend conferences by Jordanian officials where the same anti-war political clichés are repeated that the Jordanian borders play no role in the operations against Iraq.

While international organisations had not reported even a single case of Iraqi refugee until yesterday afternoon, the official Jordanian records said around 500 Iraqi citizens at least crossed the Jordanian-Iraqi borders heading towards Baghdad in a bewildering behaviour that needs much explanation.

An Egyptian would call 00964 then Baghdad code (1) then any random number provided that it would start with 443, 818 or 527. This way he would ensure that he is randomly calling an Iraqi household.

Al-Ahram Al-Arabi's correspondent in Moscow Abdel-Malik Khalil writes an article to the following effect only in part: The whole world is living a historical awful moment caused by the aggressive war launched by the U.S. and Britain on the Iraqi people at a time when the U.S. hurries up to disclose its aggressive plots which will also include Syria and Iran. Resorting to accusing Russia of offering military aid to Iraq makes it apparent that the world verges on a third world war, or, according to a Russian parliamentarian: "We live now in almost the harbingers of a third world war."
* Protecting the Russian interests in post-war Iraq, especially as President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov have articulately explained more than once that Russia has important interests in Iraq now and in the future.
However, Primakov explicitly told Saddam about this matter, even though it was not an easy one despite the friendly relations between Primakov and Saddam since the Soviet era when Primakov was former Soviet Union president Mikhail Gorbachev's envoy to Saddam Hussein to convince him of the military withdrawal from Kuwait and saving the Iraqi people, but the U.S.-led war machine imposed the withdrawal and sanctions for over ten years on Iraq.
Former chief of the national economic security body in the first main administration of the Russian intelligence spoke about the American aggression on Iraq. He said that what is going on now is not meant to promote democracy nor to make life go smoothly regardless of the U.S. efforts to promote such allegations. They speak about changing the regime in Baghdad. After such change, Iraq will be, then, ruled by a puppet government. Undoubtedly, it would be incapable of controlling the country without Western protection just as the case in Afghanistan.
Although the U.S. assault on Afghanistan was meant to eliminate Taliban, the real goal was its neighboring country - China. The Western military forces in Afghanistan seemed to have determined the borders on which China could extend its influence.
SAUDI BUSINESSMEN: READY TO COMPETE FOR RECONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS IN IRAQ
He added that British and US companies should not be let alone in that field, pointing out that Saudi businessmen should take well-studied and planned moves to win some of these contracts to "reconstruct a neighbour Arab country whose people would welcome us more than anybody else."
However, he said, US companies might depend on some Saudi businesses to provide their needs because of joint relations.
Al Azhar and Islamic Research Academy scholars' stance on that war goes in parallel with the Christian position declared by both Pope John Paul II and Pope Shenouda III, Tantawi said. Both stances are opposed to war and are calling for peace, tolerance and reconciliation, he added.
Jihad includes self-sacrifice, money-sacrifice and anything anybody can do to help what is right, Tantawi said in the conference.
When asked about the Palestinian cause, Tantawi said that the Palestinians should continue defending their rights by all available means and the UN should help them through subjecting Israel to its resolutions and forcing it to comply with them, otherwise, he went on, it could lose its powers as an international organization that has binding resolutions.
Deputy chairman of the institution, counsellor Ibrahim Bomelha told journalists yesterday that the aim behind the charity campaign was to help the Iraqi people in their distress and provide them, especially children, women and the old, with aid and basic needs.
On the contrary, the Jordanian-Iraqi crossing point witnesses the crossing of Iraqis heading back to their country, which baffled Jordanian observers. While international organisations had not reported even a single case of Iraqi refugee until yesterday afternoon, the official Jordanian records said around 500 Iraqi citizens at least crossed the Jordanian-Iraqi borders heading towards Baghdad in a bewildering behaviour that needs much explanation. Among those returnees are five Iraqi diplomats who quickly and "happily" left, to quote in the words of the Iraqi embassy spokesman in Amman Gawad Al-Hamad while speaking about a Jordanian decision that five Iraqi diplomats should leave Jordan.
It has been noticeable so far that big quantities of fresh meals have found no people to eat them near the Jordanian-Iraqi borders. Some of those who are there for whom the meals were not originally prepared get the meals free of charge now so that suppliers may not bear the cost of returning them to Amman.
It seems that foreign reporters know they have nothing to do in eastern Jordan for the Iraqis move in the opposite direction heading to Iraq and the people there are only truck drivers and customs and relief workers and there is no real way to know what happens outside the borderline.
Some local press expressions also entered the circle of fun. Arabs Today local newspaper carried on its front-page yesterday a word of advice to US President George W. Bush saying that he should receive lessons in geography due to his statements in which he said war would last longer because Iraq is a vast and "very rugged" country. The newspaper mentioned that Iraq is a plain and open country rather than mountainous and rugged, which requires that lessons in geography should be given to the ignorant president.
For his part, Dr Ahmed Mahmoud, the researcher at Cairo University and supervisor of the survey, said that excluding Maspero from the competition was not a surprise as there were former indications that confirmed that. At the last months, Maspero's following up of events was very poor.
Within the framework of increasing Egyptian efforts to support the Iraqi people, whether through invocation in prayers or internet, Alexandria University students have devised a new method to support the Iraqi people. This step is part of a project entitled "Wipe the Tears of Baghdad" which comes within a series of "wrath panorama projects" to support the Iraqi people. The idea in a nutshell is to call any random Iraqi phone number and talk to its owner to encourage him to face his distress and tell him that all Muslims are bolstering him and all the Iraqi people.
They also noted how happy the Iraqis are due to this good step that shows inter-Arab and Muslims cooperation at the time of distress.
Some others volunteered to transfer the idea outside Egypt through inquiring about the way how to make international calls to Iraq from different Arab and foreign cities.
She explains her experience saying "God is Greater... my whole body was trembling" due to her attempt to wipe the tears of an Iraqi citizen.
Naser wondered, "Who is speaking and how did you know the number?".
The Egyptian young lady Akdar says that her four-member family and she called four Iraqi families.
The idea of calling the Iraqi people came to be the most modern method of Jihad via phone.
2- "Calling Iraq and its poor people in order to encourage them. This, however, must be done in a reverse way, in other words calling random phone numbers in the USA and calmly telling them that their sons are dying in the Iraqi desert in a free holocaust in order for the masters of the White House to enjoy Oil and for the sake of Israel.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher expressed his country's rejection of America appointing an American general to govern post-Saddam Iraq and repeating the post-World War II Japan example.
Al-Fiqi warned Saddam Hussein against using weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in his war against coalition forces because such an act would be naive that would make him lose wide international sympathy and make the war against him legitimate.
I call for a new regional system that brings Israel to account after we let it go monstrous for the last 50 years."
Muslim Brotherhood Guide in Egypt, Counsellor, Mamoun Al-Hudhaibi warned that America was seeking to "control the fortunes of the world and infiltrate into the centers of power and leadership in the world through crime, terrorism, deception, bribery and debauchery.
He said, "Everybody must understand that our defence and support of the Muslim people of Iraq should not mean the Iraqi regime but rather the Islamic people, land, nation and sanctities and mosques where Allah's name is often mentioned. He went on to say that "The unarmed people of Iraq are standing against America and its allies' tyranny and, through faith, stubbornness and steadfastness can, God Willing, repel the aggressors. This means that any faithful people who believe in their right and sacrifice for their freedom can face oppression and tyranny.
The elections of the ruling party units and grassroots in villages and districts resulted in most old leaderships retaining their positions.
ISRAEL ATTACKS SHAABAN ABDEL-REHIM
The song refers to the fact that disarming weapons of mass destruction in "something good" but not in Iraq as inspection teams did not prove that it has such weapons, rather in Israel which possesses such weapons and whose soldiers kill the old and the young in Palestine without any consideration to the international community. If, moreover, talks about the tragedy which the Arabs started to live since the September 11th incidents in New York and Washington and about the Arab leaders failure to unanimously agree on unified resolutions owing to the surrounding changes.
The harbingers of this world war are represented in the ongoing war behind the scenes undergone by the three intelligence bodies of America, Britain and Russia in order to get the archive of documents of the Iraqi State, the Iraqi intelligence documents in and outside the country, and the Baath Party's documents.
Determining to what extent Saddam's regime has financed Russian political movements and parties.
Anyway, it was announced that Primakov's visit to Iraq in February 2003 was meant to convince Saddam to cooperate with the UN. So, the visit was meagerly covered by the media amid different interpretations and speculations.
Following Iraq, the U.S. will try to change the ruling regime in Saudi Arabia. However, the events will likely develop and take another course of action peacefully.
Consequently, the U.S. exerted its efforts to install "the Western rule" in Afghanistan as if the matter was to draw geopolitical interests.
Many Saudi businessmen said they were ready to compete with American and British companies for juicy contracts of reconstructing Iraq once was over. Other Saudi economists, however, were of the view of the necessity of forming a Saudi bloc and not moving individually to win these contracts.
Moreover, Head of Saudi Export Development Center Dr. Abdul Rahman Zamil pointed out that the geographical location of the kingdom, adjacent to Iraq, nominated it to be a preferable supplier of construction materials, foodstuffs and Iraqi market needs. Thus, the kingdom has a good chance to participate and win some reconstruction contracts.
When Iraqi money comes back home from abroad in post-war stage, he expected, Saudi businesses could stand much better chances of signing contracts with Iraqi partners in the medium range because the Saudi market is very close to the Iraqi one.
Tantawi said in a press conference held yesterday (April 5th) and attended by a constellation of foreign and Arab correspondents and reporters that Al Azhar never opposed those willing to fly to Iraq to help the Iraqi people, noting that doors of Jihad were open.
Asked about "martyrdom" operations targeting American targets in Iraq, the Grand Imam said, "Whoever blows himself up against the aggressor is a martyr."
Tantawi pointed out that the Palestinian people should be confident of God's victory, pointing out that responsibility for the present goings-on is borne by the Islamic world including rulers and Muslim scholars, everybody within his role and competence.
He said that before the war the institution had stored large quantities of dates in Iraqi mosques. About 500 tons of dates and 100 tons of medicine were stored in order to help the Iraqi people in case the war was aggravated.
Relief organisations had heavy presence in border areas with Iraq hoping to get cases of large number of emigrants, which has not taken place, to the surprise of these organisations along with the Jordanian authorities and hundreds of resident media men who hope to conduct interviews with supposed Iraqi refugees.
The absence of Iraqi refugees seems to have caused a professional catastrophe to more than 1200 foreign, Arab, and local reporters who gathered in Al-Rewaishid border area to prepare tens of media programs about the refugees and their problems. They started to suffer from ennui because no Iraqi refugees have come and the authorities only allow them to see ordinary things in the area.
Therefore, foreign reporters find nothing but boredom, which pushed them to intensively gather to attend conferences by Jordanian officials where the same anti-war political clichés are repeated that the Jordanian borders play no role in the operations against Iraq. Those reporters sit for hours in hotel lobbies and have tours among Iraqis in Amman and most of them feel that their information about what is going on is not more than that of an ordinary citizen.
THREE POUNDS FOR WATCHING WAR IN CAIRO CAFES
Maspero's adoption of the American point of view in many issues, especially that of the Iraqi crisis is one of the main reasons that made it lose its popularity, Mahmoud added, pointing out that the Egyptian TV viewers were disappointed when it broadcast a series of programs about the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
The new idea presented by the students via their website has proved a great success with their Egyptian relatives, who are searching for any means to support their brethren Iraqi people. They asked that that idea be generalized through electronic forums. This thought was adopted by many websites, which opened dialogue for it. The result was amazing.
The innovators of the idea said that it was discovered, through monitoring those who had called, that those calls made the Iraqis happy upon receiving calls. This had a great influence on raising the morale of the Iraqi people. They added that if each caller was keen on calling even for one minute and some 100,000 persons called, then they would boost the steadfastness of 100,000 Iraqi families.
Some other Egyptian youths made a proposal, via the websites that adopted the idea, to provide free international call cards to anyone who desires to call Iraq and has not enough money.
Another young lady called Mariam said that she succeeded in calling Baghdad after she had failed many times. She added, "I cannot describe to you the sincere feelings of the householder of the Iraqi family whom I talked to. He invoked blessing for me even more than I did for him. My tears betrayed me more than once when I was talking to him.
He quickly replied, "I'm an Egyptian and we here call random numbers to tell you that you are our brothers and we would never let you down. We will always pray for you and boycott your enemies.
"All of them expressed their happiness and surprise, emphasizing that their morale is high and asked us to sincerely and continuously pray for them. They told us they knew that our feelings were genuine and they were never angry about our stance," Akdar added.
Calling America as well On the other hand, Jihad through the internet forged ahead where some Muslim youths had innovated more thoughts for electronic Jihad, in reply to the call of many ladies through e-mail groups. The last of those calls was a message from a group of young people calling for escalating electronic Jihad. They said, "Dear members of Arab and Islamic e-mail groups it is necessary to coordinate efforts, unify powers and work together to uphold our poor brothers in Iraq and defeat the crusade criminal Anglo-American force." The new idea presents the following proposals:
This must be put in an easy, clear and brief English. Those who do not know English well, should read a text of a set of texts. We must ask them to watch a specific website or satellite channel in a bid to break the blackout of American disinformation offices."
This idea is not applicable for Iraq or its people because it was not defeated in World War II like Japan and because circumstances were totally different in both cases.
In a symposium at the Faculty of Economics and Political Science, Al-Fiqui rejected any criticism to be directed to the Iraqi regime now. He said that this would be "immoral" and would be considered in support of the aggression.
He set conditions for Israel to join that fresh regional system including reaching a just and comprehensive settlement for the Arab-Israeli conflict and subjecting all its nuclear establishments to international supervision and control.
He added that the present American Administration aimed at "crushing Muslims and seizing their fortunes and lands."
He added that Muslim Brotherhood expressed concern over the fate which has befallen everybody but regrettably no response was give by the governments to such sincere counseling. Instead they declared war on Muslim Brotherhood.
According to the reports received by the ruling party general secretariat, headed by Minister of Information, Safwat Al Sherif, the fact that the old cadres succeeded in retaining their positions points out their effectiveness with the masses.
Lots of the Israelis attacked the Egyptian pop singer, Shaaban Abdel-Rahim due to his new song "hitting Iraq". In his song he calls on the UN and the international community to necessarily look to Israel that possesses weapons of mass destruction, emphasizing that Iraq is void of such weapons.
In his article, the Israeli writer stressed the "naivety" of the Egyptian singer who, according to him, finds no difference between Sharon and Barak in his song "I hate Israel" of which he sold 15 million copies until now. however, he then described him as intelligent in dealing with some phrases that "tackles the fancy of the tense Arab street" when he described Bush as the leader of the Axis of Evil and Sharon as sitting in a Jacuzzi with Arabs blood dripping around him like rain.
A Russian newspaper points out that there are still Russian diplomats in Baghdad despite war dangers with the target of completing an important accomplishment carried out by some agents of the Russian intelligence with their Iraqi counterparts in Baghdad. This task is meant to obtain the secret documents of Saddam Hussein to protect and safeguard them so that his enemies could not get access to them in case the ruling regime in Iraq is endangered. The Russian intelligence men are keen on maintaining their relations with the Iraqi public and military intelligence alike.
The Russian intelligence body getting access to the activities of the Iraqi agents and their activities in other countries.
Some make it likely that the Iraqi side will choose Russia if the situation worsens in order to safeguard such documents no matter the price would be especially as the Russian intelligence maintains close relations with Baghdad and because the Russian leadership defends Iraq and is opposed to the military campaign on it out of a Russian strategic perspective.
The next goal, which is considered the most serious to the Americans, may be Iran, as the U.S. seeks to solve the very strategic tasks given the fact that the oil reserve decreases worldwide, he pointed out.
China now is exerting growing pressure on Kirghizia where there is an American military base. Why, then, do the Americans need military bases in Kirghizia, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan? It seems that such a step means nothing after its control of Afghanistan.
Saudi firms are expected to win some reconstruction contracts and practically participate in reconstruction, an official with Jeddah Trade and Industry Chamber said.
There is a growing sense of unease haunting countries about US's trial to corner and control the Iraqi reconstruction market, he concluded.
WHOEVER SETS HIMSELF OFF AGAINST ENEMY-RANKS IS A MARTYR TANTAWI
There is a big difference between Jihad and terrorism, he said, as Jihad was legitimized in Islam to defend soul, homeland, abode, liberty, humanity and legal values. It was also legitimized to help the oppressed to get their rights.
All wise men should stand by the aggrieved party until it takes its rights.
EMIRIAN DONATION CAMPAIGN TO HELP IRAQI PEOPLE
FOREIGN REPORTERS BORED WITH NON-EMIGRATION OF IRAQI REFUGEES TO JORDAN
The circumstances point to the fact that since the war started, only one Iraqi six-member family has arrived to the Jordanian borders but refused to live in the refugee camps and preferred to return the day following. Up to Sunday, 474 comers mainly including Sudanese people had arrived and stayed for some days and hours in the refugee camps before their departure to their countries.
Due to the media and press boredom, some issues have been much explored and what is broadcast by TVs from the area is only words of praise by Sudanese comers about the services offered to them on the Jordanian side. The majority of media men there feel disappointed as they expected mass emigration by Iraqis that would help them prepare live testimonies to part of what is going on inside Iraqi land.
This is not the Jordanian anomaly on the sidelines of war as in the angry Jordanian milieus there is an outstanding tendency to circulate meaningful political jokes about war through tens of cellular phones to the extent that cellular phone operators complained about the heavy pressure on their lines.
In a survey compiled by a number of students at the Faculty of Mass Communications, Cairo University, Abu Dhabi TV channel topped the list of channels watched by Egyptians, Al-Jazeera channel ranked second while the Egyptian Radio and TV Union, known as Maspero, was out of competition. The latter was described by hundreds of viewers as backward and far from events. The survey in which about 900 viewers participated revealed that due to its complete coverage of the Iraqi crisis before the outbreak of the war, Abu Dhabi TV channel has succeeded in increasing its popularity. It is to be mentioned that Abu Dhabi TV channel and Al-Jazeera channel exclusively covered the demonstrations witnessed by Cairo, foremost of which was that on Friday last (21st March). However, Al-Jazeera channel did not transmit the tragic developments of the demonstration before the headquarters of the ruling National Democratic Party.
In a related development, a lot of Cairo cafés posted placards on which they wrote the word "full up" due to the high turnout on the part of citizens to know about war news. Other cafés raised the price of watching Abu Dhabi TV channel and Al-Jazeera channel to three pounds, which is the same price paid by those who would like to watch the ciphered football matches which the Egyptian TV can not broadcast.
The idea is summarized that everyone would head to the nearest phone and calls a random phone number in Iraq and talk to the one who answers the call for one minute in order to encourage him. An Egyptian would call 00964 then Baghdad code (1) then any random number provided that it would start with 443, 818 or 527. This way he would ensure that he is randomly calling an Iraqi household.
Further, they called for not feeling disappointed if some attempts to call Iraq did not succeed owing to different circumstances and called on them to re-call before telephone lines are disconnected due to war.
Islamonline.net adopted the idea and presented it through dialogue channels in the website under the title "Alexandria University wipes Baghdad's tears". It started to receive the experiments of those who made phone calls with Iraqis to encourage others. The result was also amazing.
How come that he is more confident than me while he is going through such circumstances?
Just, dear brother, hold on and fight under the banner of "No God but Allah".
It is known that the Egyptian communication companies had devised many new methods for using the mobile phone in order to listen to certain songs, chat or listen to some Fatwas.
1- "Starting an intensified electronic Jihad through dealing media blows to the criminal American Administration by sending pictures of the criminal American build-up to the whole world and all American and British e-mail groups and dialogue groups. They also called for collecting the e-mails of as many American people as possible, including individuals, research centers, elites, magazines and websites. It is preferable to concentrate on the e-mail addresses of individuals, which are easy to be obtained.
3- Concentrating on electronic Jihad via a set of websites and develop these proposals by our computer professionals.
Consequently, Egypt categorically rejected that idea, he said.
"I don't defend that "blood-stained" regime due to all its bad record and the catastrophes it has caused for the region and its peoples," he said. "However, I'm against the brutality and genocide that our brotherly Iraqi people are being exposed to."
Talking about the Egyptian regional role in formulating the prospects of the region, Al-Fiqi called upon Egypt to formulate a new role that is based on educational, democratic and political reform model after Egypt lost its pioneering role in different fields especially education.
In a message he addressed to Muslim Brotherhood, Al-Hudhaibi hailed a fatwa (religious opinion) passed by Al-Azhar two weeks ago regarding Jihad (holy struggle) as an obligation upon Muslims in support of the Iraqi people and to repel aggression.
If those rulers had listened to Muslim Brotherhood's opinion and prepared their peoples for Jihad and brought them up on faith and sacrifice, the Jews would never have thought of sweeping Palestine nor would America have acted so preposterously nor would it have threatened the world, especially the Arab and Islamic worlds or tampered with its destiny and future, killing and capturing, detaining and torturing at will. It is America, after all, that now backs Zionism in Palestine and declares war on Iraq's Muslim unarmed people.
The elections were held in 6700 party units nationwide and ended yesterday after a span of 6 days to renew 25% of the members of those committees in accordance with the party's new constitution.
Lots of those writers think that the "troublemaker laundry worker' is striking the sensitive note for hundreds of millions of Arabs, i.e hating Israel.
DESTROYING IRAQ IS PRELUDE TO BESIEGING CHINA
The Russian newspaper sees that such documents are of a very importance to Russia in three aspects:
Some make it likely that such matters have been discussed between President Saddam Hussein and former Russian prime minister Yuvegeni Primakov when President Putin commissioned him a task last February ahead of the start of the American war on Iraq.
If the American and British intelligence bodies rely on their spies, the Russian one depends on the Iraqi-Russian cooperation as well as the previous and accumulated experience since the Soviet Union and its current inheritor: "the department of the Russian and international intelligence."
Here, we can reach a new issue emerged apparently. This issue envisages confrontations between the U.S. and China, which is the only power that can vie with the U.S. as the Chinese economy develops dynamically while the country suffers great oil energy shortage.
Of course, there is almost a need to such bases not to confront terrorism but to dominate the northwestern part of China. Surrounding China gradually depends on the American military bases in an indirect way.
Saudi businessman Abdullah bin Mahfouz told Al-Hayat that he was on standby to partake in Iraq reconstruction projects and compete for post-war commercial contracts and transactions.
The primary contracts would be exclusive to US companies, which would lead the reconstruction process, Saudi businessman Hussein Shobokshi said, pointing out that Saudi and other companies of different nationalities would come second to American ones.
Grand Sheikh of Al Azhar Muhammed Sayed Tantawi called for putting an end to the current war against the Iraqi people as soon as possible because they are a war-torn people.
To the contrary, he indicated, terrorism aimed at killing innocents, occupying lands and transgressing against freedoms and honour. There is a general legal rule terming as "terrorist" whoever transgresses, without a legitimate right, against others whether s/he be Muslim or Christian and Islam has clean hands of them.
Commenting on boycotting foreign goods, he said that fatwas must not be issued in that regard without reference to competent bodies to underline to what extent that boycotting is useful and whether it could harm individuals or the society.
Israeli sources spoke about Israeli-American "deal" concerning the issuance of a "Road Map" that would take the reservations of Ariel Sharon's government into consideration. On the other hand, France tries to get involved in the peace process as it proposed a plan similar to the "Road Map" one consisting five phases and including an international presence to sponsor its implementation and holding an international conference to be hosted by France.
The French peace plan synchronized with an Israeli delegation heading for Washington conveying 15 reservations about the "Road Map", which the U.SS promised to announce following the formation of a Palestinian government.
Addressing public figures and officials in Al-Fasher city, the capital of North Darfur, Bashir said his visit to the province in the presence of the Chadian president was meant to settle the security issue in Darfur.
The U.S. ambassador informed the Egyptian authorities that most of the Egyptians enlisted were arrested in Basra and Salman Bak camp, 25 km south Baghdad, the sources said. Some of those volunteers have Egyptian passports proving that they entered Iraq 10 days ahead of the war. There were also entry visas from Iraqi embassies on which "a struggler to visit Iraq" was written, the sources pointed out. The U.S. administration has information linking between some Egyptian volunteers and extremist Islamic groups, they added.
REVIVAL OF MOSUL-HAIFA OIL PIPELINE PREJUDICES OUR ECONOMIC INTERESTS
Regardless of such a controversy based on mere speculations about the future, experts have unanimously agreed that such a project would be extremely dangerous to Egypt and the Egyptian economy.
He pointed out that we have just begun a new historical epoch which is reminiscent of the colonialist epoch, but this time under an American cloak and hoisting slogans like freedom, democracy and liberating peoples from their arrogant rulers, which would be different in form from the old colonialist cloak represented Britain and France.
Undoubtedly this new Arab setback is due to our failure to take into account the current situation and the fact that we, as Arab countries, have spent our lives fighting, plotting and threatening each others driving some of us to seek the help of aliens who have an eye on our sovereignty and resources.
We should endavour to integrate, rally our strength, cooperate with one another even before we cooperate with aliens who are never interested in our progress.
A number of Jewish rabbis handed down a religious opinion declaring that Iraq is part of the land of greater Israel!
President Hosni Mubarak's Political Advisor Osama al-Baz forecast that the Arabs would take a single position on the current developments in the region in the coming seven or ten days.
The Arab attention is now riveted on an Iraqi, not American, government, he said, believing that the U.S. would not establish an American government, but a military administration, in Baghdad. Iraq should be ruled by its people themselves or it will be a matter of occupation, which is opposed by the Arabs and the international community.
U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said the U.S. was deliberating on imposing sanctions on Syria for its anti-war position.
He claimed that Iraqi nuclear scientists fled to Syria, warning it not to use them in developing weapon programs.
Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz re-accused Syria of having provided what he called "effective support to the enemies of the U.S." He claimed that Syrian weapons were offered to Iraqi forces.
The committee under the chairmanship of Mohamed Ali Mahgoub said in its report due to be mooted in the assembly's coming session that the best way to better the religious discourse was to hold "a dialogue with followers of different religions and concentrate on the points of convergence between religions because they came from one source - God.
FOREIGNERS TOOK OUT 584 PATENTS IN EGYPT OVER A YEAR
MUBARAK CALLS FOR CHANGING ARAB LEAGUE CHARTER
Efforts should be exerted to establish a common Arab market so that development may prevail in the entire Arab world and that the common Arab defence agreement can be put in place, he said.
In a seminar which lasted for about 3 hours in the Press Syndicate headquarters on Monday last, about 150 Egyptian intellectuals held a lengthy debate that showed a tendency to adopt a project for public freedoms and establishment of a civil society and democratic institutions based on the sovereignty of law that permits rotation of power. The new project was seen as a substitute for the State's proposed visualization of the society and the fundamentalist discourse. The intellectuals, who belong to different intellectual schools, launched a debate aiming at formulating a "fresh national project" based on liberal background to develop the political discourse and democracy in the country and embrace a regional and local vision vis-à-vis the consequences of war.
The debate, which called for a fundamental democratic change in the country, synchronized with a conference held a few hours before that debate by parties and opposition forces. The conference reiterated the necessity of achieving a broad-based political reform that unleashes freedom of expression, ensures democratic rights and integrity of general elections.
QATAR DECLARES ITS PERMANENT CONSTITUTION
The new constitution grants the Qatari woman full rights, as citizens are considered equal in rights and duties before the law. There should be no discrimination among them on the basis of sex, origin, language or creed. It emphasizes that personal freedom is ensured under the law and cannot be restricted. Torturing is a crime punishable by law.
PA SPEAKER: AMERICA DISPENSED WITH SADDAM
Special American-Israeli relations are based on interests, Sorour said, pointing out that if we want America to be just towards the Palestinian cause and not to be biased in favour of Israel, we should have interests with America and strong inter-Arab relations. What Israel did against Egyptian prisoners of war would not be forsaken and Israel would be tried for these crimes which don't drop by limitation.
Abdel-Hamid said funds would give the authority much more flexibility to choose the country of origin of its imports but he did not give any further details.
"Local saving and direct investment rates retreated," revealed Minister of Planning Dr. Othman Mohamed Othman, making it clear that the annual rate of local saving ranged between 12-13%, whereas the development process required for such rate should increase to more than 20%. Achieving the targeted growth rates requires the availability of foreign investments to make up for the shortage of the volume of local savings that might be directed to productive activities in different sectors, added the minister, pointing out that the volume of production is limited due to the retreat of saving and investment.
There are big opportunities to set up a joint project on the grounds that Egypt is considered a gate to many Arab and African countries. We can make full use of the privileges of the production of Egyptian origin in exporting to Arab and African countries without customs duties according to the agreements of the Arab Customs Union and the African COMESA, he added.
Encouragingly, there is a bill before the parliament at present and will be passed shortly. It provides for breaking the government monopoly of importing oil and gas and giving the private sector the opportunity to deal in them and activate and implement a previous agreement signed between Egypt and Turkey but has not been put into force yet, the minister pointed out.
TOURIST RATES DOWN 22.4%
However, he said, more retreat of occupancy rates is expected during April.
The extension of the free zone service to include construction companies aims at attracting scientific expertise in this field, increasing the Egyptian companies making full use of such expertise and transferring their experience in a way that helps set up Egyptian giant entities in this field that can face international competition and urge smaller entities to amalgamate to form overseas companies and big entities, GAIFZ chairman, Dr. Mohamed Al-Ghamrawi said.
He pointed out that that leap was attributed to the efforts made by President Hosni Mubarak, which had led to the exclusion of Egyptian steel exports to the American market from the protectionist measures which had been imposed on such imports.
The Japanese ambassador and Egyptian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Faiza Aboul-Naga have signed the memos under which the Japanese government would offer the Egyptian government a grant to the value of 968 million yen or about LE44 million allocated for the project for increasing wheat production in Gharbeya and Munoufeya governorates.
Head of the General Federation of Egyptian Chambers of Commerce, Khalid Abou Ismail said it was necessary to set up a joint Egyptian-Russian Business Council to overcome the obstacles between the two countries especially as there was a strong tendency to rely on the private sector.
The Ministry of Foreign Trade is currently discussing the establishment of storehouses and permanent exhibits in four African countries in the wake of the success of the Senegal experiment in promoting and selling Egyptian goods in Dakar and neighbouring countries.
He pointed out that exports to Senegal had notably increased. Now there is an airlift that transfers Egyptian commodities to Senegal on a monthly basis besides there are storing sites that can, at any time, provide goods, mainly including rice, legumes, foodstuffs and engineering goods.
The transaction was scheduled to be signed by both countries last March, but was put on the back burner due to the war on Iraq.
About $150 million has been extended by the Dutch side for that project in the last 15 years.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture and Land Reclamation Dr. Youssef Wali said the ministry adopts a strategy that is aimed to take the agricultural production annual growth rate up to 0.4% during the current 5-year plan.
Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) governor Mahmoud Abul Oyoun disclosed that $1.1 billion had entered the banking system and exchange firms since the creation of a free foreign exchange market on January 29th, pointing out that the pound value depreciated by 8.86% only during this period.

Some 35 dollars were added to the freight value of a 20-foot-long container. This price is doubled for 40-foot-long containers to hit $70 per container. These prices are applicable in the ports of Bahrain, Qatar, Dubai and Saudi Arabia that look over the Persian Gulf, the report noted.

The gross revenues are expected to hit 116 billion pounds, thus increasing the net deficit in the new budget to 27.6 billion pounds, i.e. 6.4 percent of the GDP against 4.3 percent only in the current budget.
The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) said a decline of 272 million dollars occurred in Egypt's international foreign exchange reserves late last January, after a 6-month period of steady rise.
On the other hand, the CBE reported a remarkable increase in the volume of deposits at banks amounting to more than 18 billion pounds in a month as they hit 374.9 billion pounds late January 2003 against 356.6 billion pounds late December 2002.
Some analysts see that the rise in facilities is not genuine in light of the reservation of most banks to extend new loans to their clients and hesitant leaderships of banks. The analysts stressed that the rise meant that the burdens of the loan service suffered from defaulting cases. These burdens contain the original debt and the interest rates.
The report underlined that the volume of debts due on the public enterprise sector amounted to 28 billion pounds, a rise of 1.6 billion pounds. The total debts due on the private business sector ran to 157 billion and 609 million, a rise of 4.1 billion pounds in 9 months.
The report revealed that the production of cement during last January hit 2 million and 801 thousand tons while local sales amounted to one million and 818 thousand tons. Cement exports volume amounted to about 223 thousand tons.
Mikkawi added that the company was in search of potential opportunities to discover petroleum through winning new concession areas and using state-of-the-art technologies. He pointed out that for the first time in 12 years, the oil production in GAPCO stays stable without declining due to the continuous extraction operations and the continuous development operations of the fields.
CHINESE RESIDENTS IN EGYPT HIT MARBLE EXPORTS

So far, the government, which deregulated the rate of exchange, did not move a muscle nor did it find a solution to this problem.
The Egyptian Industries Federation formed a committee chaired by Eng.

EGYPT INFORMS EU OF ITS LEGAL PRESERVATIONS ABOUT IMPOSING DUMPING CHARGES ON ITS STEEL
The memo also confirmed that the EU decision would conflict with the ambitious Egyptian government program to achieve economic reform. The success of this program needs satisfying growth rates which provide new job opportunities, complete the program of modernizing the Egyptian industry and free the trade in the framework of Egypt's international commitments.
The Arab region in toto had also to witness one of its biggest historic setbacks that could only be matched by Palestine's calamity.
The Arab political regimes that have so far failed to develop their political techniques and practices or lead their people on the road to freedom and democracy should ask themselves rather than anybody else about the reasons of the political and economic deterioration which eventually led to such weakness.
The history of the Iraqi Baath Party which was once helped by America to step to power and then was swooped in on by the same country 35 years later is solid evidence to the truth!
The plan shouldn't be given due attention as it was meant to resume peaceful negotiations between the two parties, he said. Should dialogue between both sides commence, reins of the matter would be in their hands and the march would continue dynamically without need for the "roadmap".
"It is a chance which I won't miss," he said, claiming that he is making indirect contacts with appointed Palestinian Prime Minister designate Mahmoud Abbass (Abu-Mazin). Sharon waits for formation of a Palestinian cabinet in order to start negotiations.
Legal sources assured Asharq Al-Awsat that Barbari confessed before the judge that he had run over American soldiers late last month after he was "influenced by some satellite channels." In answer to the judge's question about the reasons behind committing the accident, he pointed out that he regarded such an act as "some kind of jihad." Meanwhile, he emphasized that he did not intend to kill the Americans, adding that he had no driver's license when he committed the accident.
The Bush Administration has repeatedly said it has a new strategy for the Middle East centred on the abandonment of tyrannical and corrupt regimes, which used to constitute the key to its influence in the region. It found that these regimes were the cause of instability in the region and the growing hatred of America. The Administration even decided to adopt an offensive policy towards these regimes. The war on Iraq represents the beginning of this policy, which aims to take Iraq as an alternative base through which attacks would be launched against Syria, Iran, and Saudi Arabia and pressure would be exerted for changing the regimes of these countries or at least weakening them.
Beri's regime was also a revolutionary regime that started as a leftist pro-Soviet Union regime and ended as an American agent.
This tension mounts up even before the beginning of the stage of resuming the formation of the state institutions including government, police, army and others. The conflict is expected to enter a new stage with the approach of the stage of power division. If it was possible, despite difficulties, to build a government where the key powers share authority, the building of a unified army from scratch in a society with such sharp divisions is almost impossible. This means that the stay of the American army in Iraq will be long and the coming Iraqi army would be borne from the womb of occupation forces rather than opposition meetings in Nasiriya and other cities.
Al-Quds Al-Arabi learnt that Lucy said to her husband, "It is not proper for you to keep the nightclub open for those sowing their wild oats and having fun whereas warplanes and missiles are claiming the lives of Palestinians in villages and towns."

Ferry owner hajji Lotfi Abdul Sattar told Al-Quds Al-Arabi, "We used in ordinary days to make three voyages to Al-Kanatir Al-Khirya (The Barrages) with each consisting of 100 passengers.

Kuwait flatly refused any press or media statements that do harm to the AL secretary general or Kuwait itself, he said. He pointed out that his country was getting ready to play an active role within the framework of joint action in the coming period. He pointed out the role required of his country in order to deal with the repercussions of the war running on in Iraq.

HIZBULLAH: LEBANON WILL BE NO PICNIC FOR AGGRESSORS
Asked about the negative fallout of Iraq war on Lebanon, Kasim said, "America planned to commence with Iraq and then penetrate into other areas to change the political map of the region and give full support to the Israeli project versus the Palestinian uprising and the rights of the Palestinian people." We are likely to face many repercussions that would differ according to the outcome of the current war, he said.
PALESTINIAN 2003 BUDGET DEPLETED BY EXPENSES OF PNA CHAIRMAN'S OFFICE
The Interior Ministry, which includes the preventive security, police and civil defence was granted 49 million U.S. dollars or 4.7 percent, up 100 percent compared to the 2002 budget's 23-million-dollar allocation, 2.2 percent of the budget, the senior Palestinian lawmaker said.

He pointed out that the previous obstacles, which urged Muslim Brotherhood to boycott the 1997 elections, had not been removed especially as an election act had been laid down to minimize the Islamists' presence in the parliament. "However, the 120-member Shura Council was strongly urged to take the majority participation decision."
The sources pointed out that the Islamic Movement would run the next elections in all constituencies without exception in a bid to occupy the biggest possible number of the parliamentary council's 110 seats and in order not to pass about 150 temporary laws passed by the government in the last two years.
824 THOUSAND EGYPTIAN EXPERTS, SCIENTISTS ABROAD
EMIRIAN DONATION CAMPAIGN TO HELP IRAQI PEOPLE
FOREIGN REPORTERS BORED WITH NON-EMIGRATION OF IRAQI REFUGEES TO JORDAN
The circumstances point to the fact that since the war started, only one Iraqi six-member family has arrived to the Jordanian borders but refused to live in the refugee camps and preferred to return the day following. Up to Sunday, 474 comers mainly including Sudanese people had arrived and stayed for some days and hours in the refugee camps before their departure to their countries.
Due to the media and press boredom, some issues have been much explored and what is broadcast by TVs from the area is only words of praise by Sudanese comers about the services offered to them on the Jordanian side. The majority of media men there feel disappointed as they expected mass emigration by Iraqis that would help them prepare live testimonies to part of what is going on inside Iraqi land.
This is not the Jordanian anomaly on the sidelines of war as in the angry Jordanian milieus there is an outstanding tendency to circulate meaningful political jokes about war through tens of cellular phones to the extent that cellular phone operators complained about the heavy pressure on their lines.
In a survey compiled by a number of students at the Faculty of Mass Communications, Cairo University, Abu Dhabi TV channel topped the list of channels watched by Egyptians, Al-Jazeera channel ranked second while the Egyptian Radio and TV Union, known as Maspero, was out of competition. The latter was described by hundreds of viewers as backward and far from events. The survey in which about 900 viewers participated revealed that due to its complete coverage of the Iraqi crisis before the outbreak of the war, Abu Dhabi TV channel has succeeded in increasing its popularity. It is to be mentioned that Abu Dhabi TV channel and Al-Jazeera channel exclusively covered the demonstrations witnessed by Cairo, foremost of which was that on Friday last (21st March). However, Al-Jazeera channel did not transmit the tragic developments of the demonstration before the headquarters of the ruling National Democratic Party.
In a related development, a lot of Cairo cafés posted placards on which they wrote the word "full up" due to the high turnout on the part of citizens to know about war news. Other cafés raised the price of watching Abu Dhabi TV channel and Al-Jazeera channel to three pounds, which is the same price paid by those who would like to watch the ciphered football matches which the Egyptian TV can not broadcast.
Within the framework of increasing Egyptian efforts to support the Iraqi people, whether through invocation in prayers or internet, Alexandria University students have devised a new method to support the Iraqi people. This step is part of a project entitled "Wipe the Tears of Baghdad" which comes within a series of "wrath panorama projects" to support the Iraqi people. The idea in a nutshell is to call any random Iraqi phone number and talk to its owner to encourage him to face his distress and tell him that all Muslims are bolstering him and all the Iraqi people.
They also noted how happy the Iraqis are due to this good step that shows inter-Arab and Muslims cooperation at the time of distress.
Some others volunteered to transfer the idea outside Egypt through inquiring about the way how to make international calls to Iraq from different Arab and foreign cities.
She explains her experience saying "God is Greater... my whole body was trembling" due to her attempt to wipe the tears of an Iraqi citizen.
Naser wondered, "Who is speaking and how did you know the number?".
The Egyptian young lady Akdar says that her four-member family and she called four Iraqi families.
The idea of calling the Iraqi people came to be the most modern method of Jihad via phone.
2- "Calling Iraq and its poor people in order to encourage them. This, however, must be done in a reverse way, in other words calling random phone numbers in the USA and calmly telling them that their sons are dying in the Iraqi desert in a free holocaust in order for the masters of the White House to enjoy Oil and for the sake of Israel.
Egyptian speaker Dr. Fatehi Sorour referred to Parliament's Education Committee an urgent statement tabled by Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) deputy Ali Laban regarding the Education Minister's attack on Katatib (Quran memorization schools) before Shoura Council holding them responsible for increasing illiteracy in Egypt.

Al-Fiqi castigated the decrepitude of the present Arab regional system terming the Arab League as "paralyzed" and a sort of "useless folklore" that has failed to be effective."

In an article entitled "in the face of mass wrath" published in Israeli Yediot Aharonot an Israeli journalist said that the song which made great sales, more than 4 million copies, in Beirut, Damascus and Amman in addition to its sales in Cairo.

He, further, pointed out that official TV channels in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and some Gulf countries ignored the song in accordance with what he described as "high level orders".
Boastfully, the Iraqis talk about a brigade of Arab volunteers including Sudanese and Jordanian nationals led by an Egyptian commando. The brigade inflicted heavy causalities in lives and machinery on American and British forces during clashes in the southern front under the command of Ali Hassan Al-Maguid.
(Front page)
A Russian newspaper points out that there are still Russian diplomats in Baghdad despite war dangers with the target of completing an important accomplishment carried out by some agents of the Russian intelligence with their Iraqi counterparts in Baghdad. This task is meant to obtain the secret documents of Saddam Hussein to protect and safeguard them so that his enemies could not get access to them in case the ruling regime in Iraq is endangered. The Russian intelligence men are keen on maintaining their relations with the Iraqi public and military intelligence alike.
* The Russian intelligence body getting access to the activities of the Iraqi agents and their activities in other countries.
Some make it likely that the Iraqi side will choose Russia if the situation worsens in order to safeguard such documents no matter the price would be especially as the Russian intelligence maintains close relations with Baghdad and because the Russian leadership defends Iraq and is opposed to the military campaign on it out of a Russian strategic perspective.
The next goal, which is considered the most serious to the Americans, may be Iran, as the U.S. seeks to solve the very strategic tasks given the fact that the oil reserve decreases worldwide, he pointed out.
China now is exerting growing pressure on Kirghizia where there is an American military base. Why, then, do the Americans need military bases in Kirghizia, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan? It seems that such a step means nothing after its control of Afghanistan.
Saudi firms are expected to win some reconstruction contracts and practically participate in reconstruction, an official with Jeddah Trade and Industry Chamber said.
There is a growing sense of unease haunting countries about US's trial to corner and control the Iraqi reconstruction market, he concluded.
WHOEVER SETS HIMSELF OFF AGAINST ENEMY-RANKS IS A MARTYR TANTAWI
There is a big difference between Jihad and terrorism, he said, as Jihad was legitimized in Islam to defend soul, homeland, abode, liberty, humanity and legal values. It was also legitimized to help the oppressed to get their rights.
All wise men should stand by the aggrieved party until it takes its rights.
MISR BANQUE STUDIES EXPANDING FINANCE OF INVESTMENT PROJECTS
"The bank linked its system with Network 123 to facilitate withdrawal and depositing operations for clients through Automatic Teller Machines (ATM)," he said, adding that cardholders could use any ATMs linked to the network to encourage youth and other brackets to make use of this service. Barakat indicated that the current circumstances undergone by all Egyptians necessitated joint work to boost bank savings of hard currencies, spur exporters and Egyptian expatriates to deposit in the Egyptian banks in foreign currencies to consolidate bank resources of these currencies; hence banks would have the ability to grant facilities and open documentary credits for exporters in hard currencies.

"Local saving and direct investment rates retreated," revealed Minister of Planning Dr. Othman Mohamed Othman, making it clear that the annual rate of local saving ranged between 12-13%, whereas the development process required for such rate should increase to more than 20%. Achieving the targeted growth rates requires the availability of foreign investments to make up for the shortage of the volume of local savings that might be directed to productive activities in different sectors, added the minister, pointing out that the volume of production is limited due to the retreat of saving and investment.
There are big opportunities to set up a joint project on the grounds that Egypt is considered a gate to many Arab and African countries. We can make full use of the privileges of the production of Egyptian origin in exporting to Arab and African countries without customs duties according to the agreements of the Arab Customs Union and the African COMESA, he added.
Encouragingly, there is a bill before the parliament at present and will be passed shortly. It provides for breaking the government monopoly of importing oil and gas and giving the private sector the opportunity to deal in them and activate and implement a previous agreement signed between Egypt and Turkey but has not been put into force yet, the minister pointed out.
TOURIST RATES DOWN 22.4%
However, he said, more retreat of occupancy rates is expected during April.
The extension of the free zone service to include construction companies aims at attracting scientific expertise in this field, increasing the Egyptian companies making full use of such expertise and transferring their experience in a way that helps set up Egyptian giant entities in this field that can face international competition and urge smaller entities to amalgamate to form overseas companies and big entities, GAIFZ chairman, Dr. Mohamed Al-Ghamrawi said.
He pointed out that that leap was attributed to the efforts made by President Hosni Mubarak, which had led to the exclusion of Egyptian steel exports to the American market from the protectionist measures which had been imposed on such imports.
The Japanese ambassador and Egyptian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Faiza Aboul-Naga have signed the memos under which the Japanese government would offer the Egyptian government a grant to the value of 968 million yen or about LE44 million allocated for the project for increasing wheat production in Gharbeya and Munoufeya governorates.

"In the new text, we only required candidates to be of Egyptian nationality originally. We did not talk of single or dual nationality," he concluded.
It is common knowledge that the People's Assembly has revoked the membership of two deputies, namely Egyptian-French Rami Lakah and Egyptian-American Talaat Mutawe', and is now preparing for adopting a resolution to drop the membership of a third member, Mohammad Ahmad Saleh, a.k.a. the German.
An official source with the Customs Department revealed that all outlets were informed of the new rate to be applied as of 15th April. In the wake of pound deregulation, the Ministry of Finance started mid-last month to apply the monthly average system in lieu of the daily rate of exchange of the dollar used for customs purposes in response to the exporters' demand.

The European Commission is currently considering Egypt's request to implement the trade aspects of the Egyptian-European partnership agreement without having to wait until nine European parliaments endorsed the agreement. Greek ambassador, whose country currently chairs the European Union (EU), said that the request was being carefully studied due to the status which Egypt had as a basic partner of Europe.

Egypt has given cautious welcome to the call of the American President George Bush to establish a free zone between the USA and the Middle East. Meanwhile, there were various responses from organizations and businessmen as some regarded it as good and asked to be acquainted with its details, while others considered it part of the American quest for promoting "good intentions" after the war on Iraq.
Head of the Egyptian side in the Egyptian-American Business Council Galal Al-Zorba said, "The statement was understood as an American attempt to give up setting up the zone with Egypt, which is untrue."
Egyptian experts ruled out the possibility that the USA would fulfil its promises to the Arab countries to set up the free trade zone in 10 years' time especially as Bush's call for setting up the zone was conditional upon the establishment of political reforms as well as the denouncement of violence and clearly open recognition of what he called Israel's right to live in peace with its neighbours.
The signing ceremony will be attended by Minster of State for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Fayza Abul-Naga, Minister of Housing and Utilities Mohamed Ibrahim Solyman and Chairman of the Egyptian Federation of Industries Abdel-Mon'em Saudi.

The big increase urged many speculators to hoard the euro in a bid to activate dealings in the black market that suffered recession for two months. Speculators bet on the possibility of a continuous rise in the euro rate before the dollar and the increase in the demand on it. This will result in a gap through which they can gain profits. Some dollar holders started to change from the dollar to the euro to get a higher advantage hoping that the euro value, which increased by three pounds in less than three months, would continue its increase.

In a step that reflects the positive development witnessed by the Egyptian-American commercial relations, the volume of Egyptian exports to America during last January and February recorded an increase that hit 103% while imports nosedived by 40%. Egyptian exports to the US hit $242 million $69 million of which are the value of garment exports, and non-petroleum exports hit $237.45 million against $115 million during the same period last year, i.e. 106% increase.
He added that Egypt was the fourth trade partner of the US in the Middle East as it ranked 60th in the American list of exporting countries and 33rd in its list of importing countries during the year 2002. The volume of bilateral trade with the US hit $4.22 billion versus $4.66 billion during 2001, i.e. 9.42% retreat. Egyptian exports to the US hit $942 million against $878.7 million in 2001. Petroleum exports on the other hand hit $197.3 million against $158.9 million in 2001, i.e. 24.7% increase.
The whole loan should be used for buying the project's equipment which has no local alternative, he added.
President Mubarak asked for submitting the project to him to give his approval of starting negotiations on the loan and that the President will issue a draft law concerning loan to be submitted to the People's Assembly.
Al Said Qassim said that the Egyptian Commercial Authority was currently making intensive contacts with Egyptian companies which export that product to study ways and means of meeting all the requirements of the Japanese market and urge such companies to directly contact the Egyptian commercial bureau in Tokyo or Asia Department in the Commercial Representation Authority in Cairo to be acquainted with available export opportunities in that field.
With regard to the American additional assistance worth $300 million to compensate Egypt for the economic harm done to it as a result of the war on Iraq, she pointed out that the government would determine the fields of its expenditure in consultation with the American party.
Two days ago, the final agreement with HSBC (formerly Egyptian British Bank), Misr Romania Bank, International Arab Bank and Egyptian Gulf Bank after the agreement was endorsed by the General Authority for Investment a few days ago.
The Egyptian government opts for canceling direct subsidy offered to oil products.
He pointed out that the investment budget for 2003-2004 relied on giving priority to production, displacement and renovation projects as well as the completion of the projects under implementation.
An agreement has been initially reached for setting up a new Egyptian-Belorussian company to market agricultural products.
Qassim pointed out magnificent opportunities for exporting citrus, fruits and some kinds of vegetables to Belorussia and its neighbouring countries.
Such an easy fall of Baghdad signals the start of the fall of the "Baath" ideology with all its symbols, intelligentsia, poets, advocates and history smeared with blood and corruption. Such a fall, would, furthermore, stop the tide of all political trends and "revolutionary" parties that have long promoted slogans and ruled their peoples through emergency laws.
Arab governments should be more interested in national solidarity than Arab solidarity, which turned out to be out of the question under any Arab regime that would reduce the concept of the state to just an individual or a party.
Q: Could the U.S. onslaught extend to include other countries?
Fiqi: All that is going on now is aimed to protect Israel which principally fears Iran and Iraq for allegedly possessing weapons of mass destruction.
Fiqi: What is going on in Iraq is a jump-off to liquidate the Palestinian issue. Both dossiers are organically connected.
The current Arab picture is not the true one as many anti-U.S. policy countries deal with such policies covertly. Pondering on problems unilaterally, Arabs sit on the fence.
Q: Will the Egyptian role retreat?
It ought to be a pacesetter in the region, opening up to democracy. It should focus on human rights and reflect on an essential reform in the entire region.
An integrated Middle East vision should be used to address the world.
Q: The current Arab position shows that the Arab world split in 1977 and has not ever since come together once more, with no Arab leadership having the ability to bring it together, is it true?
The picture is bleak. There is a state of Arab splitting, but this does not mean that Arabs can not have a role to play. We can remember that it is Egypt which defused the Turkish-Syrian tension following the Turkish military edict (to execute PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan whom Syria declined to hand over to Ankara). Egypt still can play a role.
Q: But, your talk is contradictory.
Here, Egypt needs a balance between two contradictions; national loyalty and international commitment.
Pressure within the UN is of no value.
AMERICA'S NEXT GOAL, ENABLING ISRAEL TO GET THE NILE WATER BY FORCE
Egypt is suffering from geopolitical weaknesses, the most serious of which is the fact that the Nile sources lie in neighouring countries that are hardly on good terms with it. If they are not open enemies to it, they, at least, do not refrain from cooperation in the field of water with its open enemies especially Israel.
Israel and Water: If we have a cursory look at Israel's water problems, we will find out that the USA's next goal in the region will be to secure Israel from the point of view of water through a re-ordering of the Nile Basin countries positions. This is highlighted by the fact that Israel's own water resources represent only 44% of the total resources available to it now. If it, however withdrew from the occupied territories, it would lose 56% of its water resources, thus bringing down its water per capita from 943 cubic metres to 416 cubic metres only, which is the level of thirst and abject water poverty. Israel controls 86% of Palestinian water resources and the Israeli settler's per capita consumption of water equals four times as much as that of the Palestinian citizen.
The question is: if the Ethiopian plateau terrain currently impedes the implementation of Israeli-Ethiopian ambitions, what would the government do about the Nile basin countries tendency towards irrigated cultivation, which would require their use of their water quotas?
Al-Mussawar learnt that the presidency term of office of Dr. Ahmed Omar Hashem in Al-Azhar University will come to an end next September. The most prominent candidate to succeed Hashem (whose term in office is not likely to be renewed) is Dr. Abdel Mou'ti Bayoumi, MP and former dean of Religion Fundamentals Faculty.
The sources added that this month (April) might witness changes including a number of the party secretaries in governorates such as Qena, Alexandria and Mersa Matrouh as well as changing some governors among them a governor of one coastal governorate at least in addition to changing a minister in charge of an important ministry in the state.
PULPITS ROLE
Such concern was concentrated on construction and services with no parallel keenness on the kind of preachers and the methodology of religious discourse on Friday sermons or its relation to religious principles. In the wake of September 11th incidents Saudi officials discovered that some of those mosques turned into sheer political platforms and some pulpits turned to political discourse that often depends on incitement.
CONTACTS BETWEEN IRAQI OPPOSITION AND ZIONIST LOBBY TO HOLD DUAL PIVOT
After Israel showed contentment about the results of the American-British war on Iraq and its implications on the military balances of power in the Middle East and Syria's loss of its strategic background, its appetite for economic benefits improved whether through buying Iraqi oil or through Israeli companies participation in Iraq reconstruction projects.
The sources mentioned that major Israeli companies in the fields of construction and technology find in the rehabilitation of Iraq an "outlet to opportunities" to take part in reconstructing Iraq and to get its quota of profits estimated at billions of dollars.
U.S. SOLDIERS ENJOY DEER MEAT FROM SADDAM'S HUNTING PRESERVE
With the disappearance of Saddam, the U.S. soldiers are hunting his deers with their guns or even by throwing stones because they are almost tamed and feed fodder offered by humans.
Egyptian parliament speaker, Dr. Ahmed Fatehi Sorour refused on Friday the accusations raised by the European parliament against the Egyptian government of violating human rights, describing them as "interference in the internal affairs, which is categorically rejected by the parliament."
JORDAN INTRODUCES LEGAL CHANGE TO CLOSE CHALABI'S MISAPPROPRIATION DOSSIER
Chalabi was charged with doctoring documents and misappropriating public funds. As he fled the Jordanian kingdom, he was then sentenced to 22 years in jail with hard labour in absentia in 1992.
We have read the students' opinions on W.C.'s doors which turned into post boxes or Internet sites for self expression.
In Al-Azhar Science Faculty, a third student wrote a big sentence between two brackets: "O Saddam our dear strike, strike in Tel Aviv".
A third bolder student wrote "If you have a man among you, let him come and seize me, yes, I'm a martyrdom seeker, sons of dogs."
A forth student confirms the idea of the impossibility of Saddam's return "You are right, the time lost can never be regained."
The student, again, seems to have failed to chant it in his demonstrations as he went on writing it on the bathroom walls for more than twenty times so that every body might see it.
In the Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University a student commented on security assaults on the students during that demonstration that took to the streets in denunciation of the ferocious American attack " Habib (dear) Adli (just) [the Interior Minister] you are neither dear nor just."
A female student in the faculty of Mass Communication for example wrote," What a shame on Arab men! They should be clad in women's attire just like us."
IRAN MOVES AT MILITARY, RELIGIOUS, AND MEDIA LEVELS TO INFLUENCE IRAQI INTERNAL SITUATION
The reply came two days after the fall of Baghdad in the words of supreme leader Ali Khameni who put it in plain terms that the Islamic Republic of Iran will not sit on the fence when it comes to the fate of the Iraqi people and their right to resist the American occupation. He considered that a Sharia-ordained duty and one of the principles of the Islamic Revolution. He pledged to help the Iraqis resist the American occupation should the US forces engage in a conflict with the people after the removal of Saddam's regime.
Reliable sources said Zalmay's message came one day after the fall of Baghdad and the entry of US forces to spread their control as an occupying force on the Iraqi capital. The message showed clearly that US Administration did not want the Iranian-backed factions to play an influential role in the shaping of post-Saddam stage in Iraq.
In this regard, Iranian President's adviser Saeed Higarian said, "The important point in our stand and performance as far as the future of Iraq is concerned, is the basics related to our influence, which had been in Iraq before, such as our relations with the Shiite majority of the population and the Supreme Council of Islamic Revolution in Iraq along with the presence of the religious authority in Najaf, let alone our historical relations with the Kurds".
This view, proposed by reformists in Iran, strikes a chord with the conservatives' tendencies to contain the Shiites in Iraq and lay a basis for a strategic relation with post-Saddam Iraq though the two trends adopt different approaches to the American factor interference into the thorny fil e of the Iraqi problem.
They pointed out that the broadcast began to be received one day after the fall of Baghdad (10 April) and that the programs focused on calling on the Iraqis to support the Islamic forces and reject the US hegemony projects.
However, these Iranian bets, even though they were based on objective elements, face many challenges some of which are related to the American military presence and political influence in Iraq and others to the multiplicity of the Shiite residential structure visions of the doctrinal and political loyalties.
Although the trend of Imam al-Sadr started early to express its rejection of the American presence and political projects, this did not prepare the ground for convergence between this trend and the supreme council, which announced a similar stand.
Key leader in the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) Abdel-Aziz Al-Rantissi emphasized that his movement called upon the Iraqi people to take up the course of resistance and martyrdom operations after they were exposed to the US occupation so as to put an end to such occupation.
In a step regarded by observers as a prelude to the second round of the war, the Washington Post closely related to the American Intelligence alleged that Egypt had exported mass destruction weapons to some countries, thus posing a threat to security and stability in the Middle East region.
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD IN EGYPT EXPECT FURTHER SECURITY CRACKDOWNS
Muslim Brotherhood sources pointed out that none of those arrested in the last few weeks owing to the clashes between the police and the demonstrators during the war belonged to the group.
Under this headline, veteran writer of Al-Hayat, Dawoud Al-Shuryan writes an article, which runs to the following effect: These days, some Kuwaiti writers are launching an organized campaign against the Arab League (AL) Secretary General accusing him of overstepping his limits and comparing him to a party leader who has run amok. They consider Amr Moussa's position towards the occupation of Iraq and his demand to resist the American presence mere political speculation.
The campaign led by Kuwaiti politicians and writers has used the personality of the Secretary General, his style of talking and acting as open means to pass an old Kuwaiti wish which we have known since 1990.
Consequently, we can safely say that to reduce such Kuwaiti war on the AL to the personality of Amr Moussa and to regard what happens as the result of incongruence with the personality of the Secretary General would be an over simplification of the grave situation. This would eventually serve the purposes of Shemon Berez who thinks that Israel cannot be politically accepted in the region unless the pan-Arabism concept is destroyed and the AL charter is reformulated so that that organization would become "the Middle Eastern countries organization".
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Justice started introducing amendments to the provisions of the Egyptian penal code to cancel the cases of open-ended or recurrent custody and to restrict protective custody cases.
HIZBULLAH DENIES SENDING SUICIDE BOMBERS TO IRAQ
EGYPTIAN-ARAB MOVES TO ABORT REVIVAL OF MOSUL-HAIFA PIPELINE
In his statements to an Arab newspaper, the Egyptian official refuted the Israeli ideas, pointing out that the pipeline's previous capacity had not exceeded 5 million tons annually. It was designed to answer the demands of the British mandate era on Palestine. It needs fresh and unrecoverable investments due to the fierce competition with SUMED and Suez Canal, which can turn such a pipeline a dead loss in case of operation, he made it certain.
This came in the Eighth Conference of Islamic Philosophy in Cairo University.
JEWISH LOBBY WOOS U.S. CONGRESSIONAL BILL TO PENALIZE SYRIA
The pro-bill congressmen set six stipulations for Syria to fend off the draft; to abjure allegedly backing international terror, pull its troops out of Lebanon, stop developing and deploying ballistic missiles and chemical and biological weapons, suspend Iraqi oil imports, help bring about peace progress between Israel and Damascus on the one hand and Israel and Lebanon on the other hand, and respect Lebanon's sovereignty and independence.
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitag said Lebanon's Shiite Hezbollah would be a next target of the U.S. military campaign.
Hezobllah may attack the U.S. and its citizens, he claimed.
New Iraqi political organizations, which have never been heard of before, started to emerge in the Iraqi capital. Their streamers are, nevertheless, seen hoisted in the streets and their slogans written on the walls such as "The Republican Party", "National Unity Congress" and "Free Officers and Civilians Movement".
According to an Egyptian diplomat in Baghdad, "In light of the absence of mass media in Iraq, especially the capital, the Islamic trend has a strong mass medium which has influence over many Iraqis - mosque pulpits.
Another leaflet, entitled, "Don't make friends of them," addressed to those agents who befriend the Americans and their allies. It described the Americans as "played havoc with the land" and "slaughtered Muslims, profaned Baghdad, Basra and Najaf."
An agreement signed yesterday (April 21st) between EgyptAir and the NBE stipulated that the value of a ticket on a domestic flight would be paid by installments on 5 months while that on an international flight would be on 11 months.
11.2% OF EGYPT'S POPULATION LIVE IN CAIRO
Gihad Al-Khazen, Al-Hayat former chief editor, wrote his daily to say: Suppose Abu Mazen, Palestinian prime minister-designate, could a government which survived a vote of confidence of the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLO), a question remains: Would this government be able to assume its duties in the coming stage?
The Americans and Israelis want a government headed by Abu Mazen and comprising Mohamed Dahlan as Security officer, Salam Fiadh as finance and economy minister and other ministers far from corrupt officials.
Rather, it was created to implement a security program and put the "road map" plan into force. We are totally against the idea. The security responsibility of the fresh government is meant to incite an internal strife between the Palestinians themselves.
After all, there is a Palestinian feeling that the Americans who introduced Madrid Conference after 1991 Kuwait Liberation war and came victorious over the Arabs in the last battle feel that the Arabs have to pay for their defeat through entering into negotiations with Israel.
FRESH BILL FOR PA ELECTIONS PREPARED BY MINISTRY OF JUSTICE
Al-Mussawar also learnt that the desire to lay down basic controls preventing capital domination of the election process through buying votes was amongst the most urgent motivations behind the fresh draft law. The phenomenon of buying votes emerged during the last two parliamentary elections. It was also discussed by the ruling National Democratic Party's (NDP) 8th conference, which underlined the necessity of laying down certain controls to prevent buying votes. Actually, when any party interferes to arrange its candidates' priorities this phenomenon will be curbed.
If expectations come true, the elections may be conducted next October for three weeks so that full judiciary supervision could be achieved, especially as the number of polling stations might be reconsidered so that every polling station will include no more than 500 voters to facilitate the election process for citizens. Besides, once the number of judges are in the neighbourhood of only 8,000 the election process should necessarily be conducted on three stages just like the last elections.
The peculiarity of oppositionists' scramble for State-owned buildings was crystal clear upon hanging the banners of Islamic parties on artistic and recreational institutions. Rabat Hall, which used to be connected with the Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra and exalted classical music, has become the headquarters of the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SAIRI). The building of Baghdad Music and Expressionist Arts School (previously known as Music and Ballet School) has become the headquarters of an Islamic movement, whose representatives were absent there. They only put a banner referring to the unity of the Islamic nation.
The INC headquarters were spread among houses of former regime's leaderships and premises of newspapers and clubs of the ruling elite, such as Shooting Club, which used to be the nest of love affairs of Saddam's two sons, Udai and Qusai. The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) headed by Jalal Talabani comes second to the INC with respect to spread of possession of governmental buildings.
Drawing upon the latest American military experience in Iraq, Israeli Army Command announced it would carry out several cuts in its forces' size including the air corps, the navy and the army, the army top brass said.
Focus, they said, in this war was on heavy bombers, assault helicopters and guided missiles.
The new economic plan that the government would table to the Knesset (Israeli parliament) on next Wednesday (April 30th) stipulates a significant cut in the military budget ($2 billion).
In case this did not happen, this aid is returned to the American treasury again.
Imagine you had been in a dark cellar for 30 years and then went suddenly out of it to see light, what pain would befall your eyes?
The scene in Baghdad is a mixture of falsity and truth; astonishment and confusion. Christians burn their candles in churches and open windows widely without fearing anybody. Shiites swarm around the Imam Tomb to commemorate religious rites without being prevented by anyone. Communists hold their convention in the center of Al-Ferdous yard in Baghdad and distribute their 70-year old paper "Tareeq Al-Sha'b" (People's Way), which disappeared for thirty years.
NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN TEL AVIV AND BAGHDAD
The paper said it telephoned an Iraqi businessman who said that the Iraqi side was exerting many efforts to create free trade relations, pointing out that the Iraqis were keen on cooperating with their Israeli counterparts. He added that he would do his best to reach that end, the paper said.
DETAILS OF FIRST EUROPEAN INTERVENTION IN EGYPT'S AFFAIRS
The European parliament emphasized that respecting human rights including freedom of mass media, expression and the formation of unions and societies is a basic value highlighted in the partnership agreement between Egypt and the European Union, which also includes giving precedence to the sovereignty of law and basic freedoms.
AMERICAN PLAN TO STRIKE SYRIA, SAUDI REGIME & ISOLATE EGYPT
Surprisingly, one of those reports basically relies on a study prepared by Israeli former premier, Benjamin Netanyahu. It quotes Netanyahu's strategic principles so often that it can hardly be discriminated between the American and the Israeli perspectives, which are so identical in regard to the Arab World affairs.
Immediately stopping the material and Wahabite support of the fundamentalist groups anywhere in the world and stopping building schools, institutes and mosques and producing scholars who promote fundamentalist ideas.
The report points out that all oilfields in the Kingdom now are under American forces protection brandishing the Shiite card as most oilfields are located in Shiite rather than Wahabite districts.
The report, then, mentions a set of abuses like dishonesty, treachery, etc...
The report pointed out that unseating Saddam Hussein's regime was only a tactical step to the axis of American strategies in the region.
The paper said that the idea was hit on by Shamoil Bin Neftali, a specialist in training tourist ushers from the Hebrew state to work in Iraq.
The "First Military Statement," issued by "Resistance and Liberation Organization in Iraq" claimed responsibility for a number of military and suicide-bombing operations against US occupation, pledging to keep on resisting till the liberation of Iraq.
In Downtown Cairo, precisely near Abdel-Mon'em Riyadh Square, lies the building of Egyptian Radio and TV Union known as "Maspiro". If you entered that building and took the lift to the eighth floor, you would find a set of rooms affiliated to the international relations department where you could see Zaheera Zaki working silently with her staff in preparation for the inauguration of the second annual competition to invent a robot "Robocon Egypt 2003". The festival is expected to be opened tomorrow (April 25th) and will last for three days till April 27th to encourage and support the scientific inventions of university students and qualify the winning team for the championship of "Robocon, Thailand, August 2003" It is to be mentioned that "Robocon" competition is a Japanese brainchild that has been holding since mid-1990s in the countries marked by a distinguished scientific record in the field of inventions.
During his meeting on April 22nd in the royal palace with the Muslim Brotherhood general mentor Abdel-Maguid Zonaibat, King Abdulllah II paid tribute to the role played by Muslim Brotherhood Group in Jordan regarding national issues. Zonaibat presented a memo to the King about the Islamic movement viewpoint of how to square up to the current situation in the country and the region.
In a related development, Islamic sources told Al-Hayat that there is a predominating tendency in the group's branches in Amman and different governorates to participate in the elections under the umbrella of "Islamic Action Front," the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood group. The sources considered that it is more likely that the Shura Council decision would support this tendency.
On Wednesday leaders of Al-Wafd, Nasserite, Labour and Tagamou'h (Grouping) parties met in the latter's headquarters.
Hinting at a consensus reached by opposition party leaders on a common vision for the popular move in the coming period, Abdel-Raziq said the party leaders would hold a meeting within two weeks so as to mull over the ways and means of converting the salvation from a political document into a request to be put forward before candidates in different governorates through joint activities between parties.
Hezbollah will broach Al-Hariri's call during the discussion of the ministerial statement in the parliament next Tuesday, Ra'd said.
The Turkish Ministry of Treasury has almost worked out a plan to sell the new bonds, allowing foreigners to get returns in lieu of interest, Turkish sources said.
NO INTENTION TO DISSOLVE PARLIAMENT, PA SPEAKER
They belittled the constitutional establishments and tried to frustrate the MPs.
Denying any relation between regional events (Iraqi war) with the continuation or even dissolution of the PA, Sorour said, "Egypt is a state of institutions and takes accurate decisions in accordance with the public interest and the Constitution."
For his part, Al-Gadir uncovered Arab countries' support of the political platform of the Iraqi independent block, adding that the Independents' platform relied on some basic principles especially the return of normal life in Iraq, establishing democratic rules, holding free elections under the supervision of the UN and the AL, partisan plurality, respect of all the spectrum of opinion, release of freedoms especially the freedom of expression and publication of newspapers, and honouring international human rights agreements, which Iraq had once signed but failed to implement due to lack of transparency.
He criticized the USA's attempts to monopolize reconstruction of Iraq "This is rejected and wrong." He said, "It is the Iraqis who will reconstruct their country as we do not accept the idea of the US deciding for us.
JEWELLERY FROM SADDAM'S PALACES SOLD IN TEL AVIV
An Israeli who introduced himself as a journalist returning from Baghdad had had a site on the Internet, offering to sell some stones he had bought from one of Saddam Hussein's palaces as "souvenirs".
Yesterday, Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood group decided to join the parliamentary elections to be held on June 17th under the umbrella of its political front, "Islamic Action Front", thus giving considerable momentum to the first political elections in the reign of King Abdullah the Second.
Thanks to such a decision, the Islamists will return to the front of political action after a 6-year absence due to their boycott of the 1997 elections in protest against the "one vote per voter" system introduced by the government to the election act.
Last week, Jordanian Premier Ali Abou-Ragheb pledged that the elections would observe the rules of integrity, transparency and complete detachment. He called on partisan forces to join it for the sake of developing the political life in the Kingdom.
Thus, he decided to send them to administrative tasks and threatened to force them to go on indefinite leaves if they stuck fast to their position by declining to take off their veil.
They also planned to resort to court if their pursuits ended in fruitlessness.
The constitution states that Islam is the state's religion and the main source of legislation so the ban on veiled announcers is illegal, she argued. She expressed hope that Minister of Information Safwat al-Sharif could help her and her colleagues regain their jobs as broadcasters.
The terms used by the American and Iraqi sides during the war on Iraq are now used by Egyptian citizens, sports critics and journalists in tackling the daily political, artistic and sports affairs.
When deputy chief editor of Al-Mussawar magazine, in its issue last Wednesday, was speaking about the Egyptian government's failure to deal economic crises it faced including the increase of the dollar rate of exchange he used the term "friendly fire" to describe the government's way of dealing with such crisis on the ground that it was the government that was behind such losses, so most of the government losses came from another government "friendly fire," too.
ISRAEL HOSTS JORDANIAN TEACHERS
Members of that mission were guests of the Israeli government in the non-governmental Berl House College (named after Zionist Berl Katzenelson).
Some 27 Israeli teachers participated in the "peaceful" meetings while no Arab teachers were allowed to take part, the sources added.
Meanwhile, Israel summoned most of its staff in the Israeli embassy in Amman for fear of being subjected to "terrorist" acts in view of the Israeli support of the US-British aggression on Iraq.
This means that the Iraqi opposition to such presence is mighty enough to prevent the Americans from installing an alternative and acceptable regime after toppling Saddam Hussein's regime. On the other hand, the feeling that a nightmare has gone away from Iraq is still dominant.
Such indicators come from Iranians and Arabs, especially Iraq's neighbours, and even from Iraqi Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish parties whether civilian or religious.
The Arab role, especially that of Iraq neighbours, is absent, or seems to be so, concerning the attempts of drawing the future of Iraq.
Its domination cannot be spared by seeking protection of any other major country.
In Iraq, there are unprecedented political freedom, political division and mistrust among opponents including the Americans themselves.
The U.S. presence-related parties, such as Ahmed Chalabi, do not enjoy any Iraqi nor Arab legitimacy.
There appears to be a unanimously agreed political conviction in Iraq that a solution to the country's political row should exceed communal and ethnic frames and restrictions, with the congruence and success criteria to be a stern national test for all Iraqi forces.
Key Shiite and Sunni leaders markedly caution against engagement in communal stands and options under the pressure of the impalpable and instable political situation and power vacuum. Those leaders underscore that it is necessary under the current circumstances to segregate between takeoffs and religious convictions, and political goals, reflecting an automatic consensus.
He then went too far when he said "religion can be separated from the state" in Iraq.
The declared stances of these sheikhs are nothing but a dare reflection of a new political Islamic trend in Iraq.
It might be said that these stances are not necessarily agreed upon by Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq.
It reflects a spontaneous convergence of interests imposed by the sensitive situation there.
To the contrary, political goals, especially when detached from religious commitments, are usually capable of gathering extremes and finally causing national unity.
Therefore, secularism is the valve of this independence.
According to Saudi diplomatic sources in Cairo, such meetings may be held at the end of May (this month) in Cairo under the chairmanship of the two countries foreign ministers, Ahmed Maher and Prince Saud Al-Faisal. Contacts between officials in the two foreign ministries are underway to decide when the Egyptian-Saudi Committee would finally meet. The previous date was March 22nd, but it was adjourned.
It is noteworthy that the volume of trade exchange between the two countries is constantly declining and that is why the two countries are seeking to remove the obstacles to the achievement of a trade leap that would run parallel with the political and historic relations between the kingdom and Egypt.
The report stressed that the plan included 8 pivots represented in the presence of flexibility in pricing systems in order to move the prices in a way that agreed with the change in cost and standard figures of prices without affecting the limited-income category. This is meant to strike a balance, rationalize consumption and ensure social justice through the preferential price policy according to the slices of consumption and the financial ability of consumers, according to the plan.
There is also a shortage in resources and failure to cover the uses of these organisations. Therefore, they have difficulty arriving at the point of equality between investments and the net final accounts achieved, let alone the implementation of great deal of investments with no available sufficient self-resources in return.
Egypt jumped from the fifth rank to the fourth among the rising countries, as it reported an inflation rate of 3% preceded by China, Malaysia, and Thailand which made rates of annual inflation of 0.2%, 1.6% and 1.7% respectively.
Regarding the local economic indices, the report registered a rise in the total deposits with the banks other than the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) from 318.70 billion pounds during January 2002 to 374.90 billion pounds during the same month of the current year, as the government deposits hiked from 48.40 billion pounds to 61.13 billion pounds. The non-governmental deposits soared from 270.30 billion pounds to 313.77 billion pounds during the same period.
As for the bankruptcy decrees, the report pointed out a retreat from 442 appealable rulings during March 2002 to only 23 during the same period this month, while final bankruptcy decrees retreated from 167 to 9 only. Bankruptcies of companies and individuals also decreased from 4592 cases to 1408 cases only during the same period.
The report pointed out that the Gross Domestic Product at the end of June 2002 amounted to some 299 billion pounds with a growth rate of 3.1%. The private sector quota amounted to 228 billion pounds with a growth rate of around 3.5% while the share of the public sector hit 71 billion pounds with a growth rate of 1.8%.
The government local debts also represent 84% of the total, which stands at 221 billion pounds while the local debts of economic organisations represent 16% as they hit 41.14 billion pounds.
The report revealed that the commodity exports represent the most important dollar resources as they realize 28.8% of the total of these resources followed by expatriates' remittances and grants with a rate of 17.6% followed by tourism with a rate of 14.8% while the direct investments do not exceed 1.9%.
The report added that the volume of exports during the period from January to October last year rose by 28.5% compared to the corresponding period in 2001. Total exports reached about LE17 billion and 855 million against LE13 billion and LE890 million.
The report said that the list of commodities whose import value increased include wheat, maize, timber and its by products, iron, steel, chemical substances, medicines, pharmaceutical products, tanks and pipes and their requirements, meat, tea and tobacco.
THIRD MOBILE COMPANY IMPLEMENTATION DOUBTED!
Regarding reports about the two existent mobile companies' intentions to monopolize the market and exert pressure on the Ministry to get the third web licence, Nazif denied that and confirmed that the government would not let the market fall as victim of monopoly, which would basically be unthinkable.
Within the framework of this agreement, half a million tons of wheat will be imported from each country. This quantity will be increased to 1.5 million tons. The total of wheat imported from the two countries will, therefore, reach 3 million tons by end of the 5-year agreement, she added.
During his meeting, Ebeid discussed the agreement's articles with Ukraine after a protocol with Federal Russia was signed, she added.
The prime minister stressed the necessity that the local component of such silos should reach 80% provided that such a percentage should be a condition when the project is put up in a tender, Khidr said.
The new law aims at facilitating the procedures of founding companies and avoiding any defects in the previous laws in order to simplify those procedures for investors and save both time and effort and direct them to the productive process.
The new law deals with the issue of individual (one person-founded) companies' foundation as that used to take place according to special procedures.
$69 MILLION EGYPT'S EXPORTS OF DRAPERY TO USA
The study also discussed the customs duties imposed on linen exports in detail. Some of such exports, such as some kinds of carpets are tax exempt, while the customs charges range between 0.7% and 21.5% on the rest of other linen exports.
Importers emphasized that the customs dollar increases by 17 piasters monthly, thus leading to heavy losses and stoppage of transactions on the local markets due to instability of costs.
U.S. CAPITAL MARKET OFFICIALLY ENDORSES EGYPT'S STOCK EXCHANGE

Although there are many bilateral agreements between Arab countries that are meant to remove customs obstacles and boost the volume of trade exchange between Arab countries, the inter-Arab trade exchange does not exceed 8 percent of the total, he added.
However, Egyptian economic sources said that U.S. trade representative Robert Zoellick would visit the Middle East region, including Egypt, June next.

500 EGYPTIAN VOLUNTEERS DISAPPEARED IN IRAQ
Gamal told Al-Majalla that his brother had telephoned him from Baghdad four days before the war and assured him that he and his company were good and informed him that he was staying at Meridian Palestine Hotel.
"At that very moment, some asked Aziz to be volunteers and he welcomed them. Some of them were distributed to popular military units, while others were under the chieftains' supervision. Those chieftains gave them up after the downfall of Baghdad. Up till now, we don't know anything about them especially as the Iraqi borders with neighbouring countries have been closed."
A Middle East churches delegation wanted earlier to travel to Iraq for the same purpose, but Pope Shenouda turned down their request too.
This "reality" was discovered by U.S. National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice who played with the radicals of Bush administration a prominent role in intimidating and threatening the "rogue" countries, which refused to succumb to the White House commands ahead of Iraq disaster.
So long as the record of the U.S. administration is known and its goals topped by Israel's security, which it shamelessly speaks about, are evident, it will be naivety to be optimistic about the discourse of dialogue, which Damascus adheres to, at least because Bush and the symbols of his administration will not backtrack on their dictations.
It is no secret that some sort of literal translation of the "positive" role is to sever relations with the Palestinian opposition factions, extend facilities to U.S. project in Iraq and not only withdraw the Syrian forces from Lebanon to avoid sanctions that may be imposed by the Congress but also prepare the Lebanese arena to what Powell called comprehensive peace: disarming Hizbullah and the rest of arms in the refugee camps to pave the way for "magic" negotiations - each party will be on its own track.
Nor will it bet on the justice of the UN, which has been changed at the hands of Bush administration into a blind perjurer or the power of the Palestinian opposition or Hizbullah while the borders are gripped by the Pentagon at a time when Europe itself has joined the (pro-U.S.) chorus after it had learnt the Iraqi lesson!
What is the price of any option?
Sudanese sources close to the Sudanese opposition said the relations between the National Democratic Gathering (opposition alliance) and Egypt is experiencing remarkable retreat and tension following President Hosni Mubarak's visit to Khartoum during which integration steps were declared between both countries.
They, further, laid it bare that the reason behind the tension in Cairo-Gathering relations was that Al-Mirghani used to pressurize for years to convince Cairo of the Southerns' right of self-determination, but he failed. However, Garang, in his last visit, alluded that the Egyptians had changed their minds regarding self-determination and became more flexible. "In a few hours Garang succeeded in what others failed to do over years," the sources revealed.
In press statements following his arrival in Egypt yesterday returning from London, Al-Baz said it is not the suitable time to talk about this visit especially after the invasion of the Israeli forces of Al-Shigaeia in Gaza City.

Some of these laws that have been abrogated were put in force for over 10 years. This caused a lot of troubles to those people who were tried and harmed by those laws. They might file new lawsuits asking for their rights wasted by rescinded laws that proved to be unconstitutional. It is to be mentioned that this increased the period of examining cases before courts and obstructed justice, as some lawyers tend to postpone their cases several times when the law is being challenged waiting for a rule of its unconstitutionality to absolve their principals.

ISLAMIC LAWYER TO SUE INTERIOR MINISTRY FOR CANCELING RELIGION BLANK IN PERSONAL DOCUMENTS

Under this headline, Abdel Wahab Badrakhan of Al-Hayat wrote an article, which ran to the following effect: This postwar Arab climate of daily conflict between what is right and what is wrong is both intelligible and unintelligible.
If the "losers" have already ascertained that they had betted on the wrong horse, the "winners" are still away from any feeling of certainty that they have "won".
Did "Baath" as typified by Saddam's regime still mean something in the quest for Arab nationalism?
In the context of war on Iraq, its results and complications, we can safely say that the debacle is comprehensive and neither it nor its responsibilities can be shirked by any of us.
They have been betrayed by their knowledge as most of them are knowledgeable indeed as such knowledge had just fallen short of realizing that such required changes could only be attained through human approaches.

The following are my conceptualized points necessary for the reform movement that should be spearheaded by Egypt in the coming stage since it is considered the "role model" for other sister countries thanks to its position, standing, history and pioneering role: First: Unlike most countries in the region, Egypt is marked by a special status that requires a role from the people and their civilian foundations, and the government, along with its official agencies since the Egyptian society abounds with a large stock of values and traditions, and a huge heritage of successive civilizations. So, an influential Egyptian character appears to be required at present. Influence, here, should be based on education, culture and media.
This was not made under foreign pressure as Egypt wanted to cope with times and new developments. Fourth: National sense, Arabism and opposition to foreign presence are all components of the collective conscience of the Egyptian people. Such matters will be reviewed because if this Egyptian feeling calms down, other Arab peoples may follow suit. What should be done is to get acclimatized to the new reality and coexist with a political and religious culture based on accepting the fait accompli, stop rejecting the other, give up sensitivity to foreign hegemony and postulate that we are living in the American age with its givens and fallout!
Third: The so-called "cold peace" between Egypt and Israel is one of the reasons of pent-up vexation at Egypt whose people declined to go ahead unilaterally with full normalizations of ties with the Hebrew state notwithstanding abidance by contractual commitments and international accords.
MODERATE REGIMES HAVE TO "ADJUST" THEIR POSITIONS!
We do not want what ruin coups bring about!"
Now, let's deal with the crux of the matter which really concerns us as Arab communities in the whole of the Arab world.
However, having admitted to such a case being realistic, according to the Arab citizen's mind who prefers evolution to revolution, we have to quite unabashedly argue that the "moderate" Arab regimes had milked such a preference dry and would have, therefore, to unhesitantly take the initiative to reform their positions radically and comprehensively before it is too late! History will never have mercy upon an official who is either idle or hesitant especially as fossilization and corruption had already accumulated in our veins so much so that there is a need of a leadership boldness in reform and to new pure blood that would give life to that frozen and flabby body!
The majority of the citizens are still looking forward to the steps of real reform in all Arab communities. Moderate regimes, therefore, have to "adjust" their positions before it is too late to avoid giving the pretext to putschists for a new wave of violence and loss and to evade the catastrophic historic error committed by parliamentary constitutional monarchies in the middle of the twentieth century when they fell short of self reform, thus making coups inevitable!
Adnan Pachachi, leader of the Gathering of Iraqi Independents, and Barham Saleh, leader of Iraqi Kurdistan Province Government, visited Egypt last month and then the SAIRI accepted an Egyptian invitation to ponder on the future of Iraq.

Under this headline, chief editor of Al-Quds Al-Arabi Abdel-Bari Atwan writes an article, excerpts of which run to the following effect: After George Bush's administration managed to put an end to the Baath rule in Iraq militarily, it seems that it is trying to end the other branch of the party or its remnants in Damascus through political pressure.
Such concessions, albeit important, are not enough from the U.S. administration point of view after it won the war on Iraq (the victory is temporary from our perspective), as Powell's demands to Syrian president seem to be unattainable.
Some may argue that such a proposal may run counter to logic and variables of the reality and spur to adopt stances leading to suicidal, unequal and untimely confrontations with the United States in a way that its results will seem inevitably predetermined because what happened in Iraq should be a lesson that the Syrian regime should thoroughly come up with and behave in light of.
What we want to say is that Washington doesn't have any "formal" reasons that might provide enough pretexts to invade and occupy Syria the same way as it did with Iraq. There is no oil nor gas or weapons of mass destruction in Syria. Its front with the Israeli enemy was quiet for the last thirty years. And there is no sign proving the opposite.
Will the unseated Iraqi regime start a secret war directly led by Qusai Saddam Hussein?
In this context, three thousand officers were selected from security bodies, intelligence department and "special security" units.
The 3 thousand elements were withdrawn in batches and subjected to strict training under Qusai Saddam Hussein in addition to their 3-year original training as they were regarded as commandos who were well versed in guerrilla war, urban warfare and terrorist operations. Their training lasted from 1998 to 1999 in Al-Tharthara and Basra as well as inside cities like Al-Sowaira.

The study included a comparison between activities of the government bonds and those of companies as it showed that the governmental bonds registered in 1995 hit 3 billion pounds and went up in 1996 to 4 billion pounds. No bonds were registered in 1997 but in 1998 they hiked to 4.5 billion pounds and then went down in 2000 to 3 billion pounds.
As for circulation of bonds in the securities market in light of the rise in bonds issue in main markets, the study noted that the volume of bond circulation recorded an increase as it hit 95 million pounds in 1995, 379 million pounds in 1996, and 330 million pounds in 1997, down 13%. Nevertheless, it hiked again to reach 1.100 billion pounds in 1998, a growth rate of 233%.
This was announced by Minister of Housing Ibrahim Sulayman following his meeting with ministers of planning, finance and enterprise sector.
LE158.6 TOTAL BUDGET
The targeted development rate of the draft plan is 4.5%, added Ezz, pointing out that investment size hits LE70 billion.
Dr. Atef Ebeid's government had frequently announced its ability to settle the interest of government treasury bonds and bills. It, further, underestimated the domestic debt which amounted to about LE230 billion alleging that it has enormous assets to the value of hundreds of billions of Egyptian pounds.
This comes at a time when the government failed to achieve a real development that would increase the state's public sources.
This has raised questions about the destiny of some government buildings, which have become antiquities.
On the other hand, sales of local cars, whose prices went up by 20%, increased to 8,500 cars against 9,350 cars during the same period last year.
As for pick-ups and lorries, the Association's figures indicated a retreat in production to 4,480 cars, i.e. 13% compared to the same period last year. Bus sales also went down by 5% to hit 1,445 buses.
In spite of expectations that no big rises would take place in new car prices, second-hand cars market would witness a boom due to the fact that a large number of purchasers prefer to buy used cars, whose prices are still low regardless of the rise in their prices.
This, consequently, caused a recovery in the Egyptian market especially due to some Arab bourses being subjected to growing concern owing to the region's circumstances and the still lurking sense of instability.
The level of foreign including Arab dealings have also risen to the value of LE99.42 million representing 35% of the total value of Egyptian pound circulation on the bourse. This was especially so because of the growth in the number of operations where foreigners took possession of Egyptian companies particularly in the food sector last month. High liquidity stocks like Mobile, Oriental Weavers and International Trade Banks stocks claimed greater demand. Dollar dealings hit 5456 thousand stocks i.e 30% of the volume of dealings for dollar stocks, to the value of $184.98 thousand, the equivalent of 30% of the total volume of dollar dealings.
DEMANDS FOR BOLSTERING ARAB ECONOMIES BEFORE GETTING ACCESS TO AMERICAN-MIDEAST FREE TRADE ZONE
In his speech, Arab Exchange Union Consultant, Dr. Solaiman Al-Monzeri pointed out that the idea of setting up an American-MidEast free trade zone doesn't fit the Arab economy which is suffering from several problems foremost of which is the lack of coordination which was crystallized in the failure to establish an Arab common market.
For his part, professor of economics, Ain Shams University, Dr. Reda Al-Adl cast doubts on the American intentions to actually implement this zone as, according to him, it will be difficult to be achieved. Raising such an idea comes within the framework of the American public relations following its invasion of Iraq, Reda added, pointing out that even if this idea was effectuated, we would have no Arab economic potentialities that can cope with the huge American economy.
In spite of the current circumstances, Reda said, the Arab economy now is better than it was five decades ago, as there is a noticeable growth in the inter-Arab investments as well as wide room for cooperation between the Arab industrial federations, something which creates a state of Arab harmony.
Al-Zorba pointed out that the agreement does not have any political or military dimensions, nor does it seek to interfere in internal affairs as it talks about the same reforms talked about by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
The Egyptian project also included the negative list of goods including several products that represent special sensitivity like textiles and cars of all types as well as steel products. The Egyptian party also asked that Turkey should increase its contribution to investment projects in Egypt and act to replace industrial competition with integration between the two countries especially in textile and spare part and consumer commodities, where Turkey has advanced expertise. The Turkish party promised to study the Egyptian party's proposals in those negotiations including free access of agricultural goods to Turkey regardless of the sensitivity constituted by these goods to it.
Egyptian imports mainly include various components and spare parts. Cotton and blended yarn, ready-made clothes, iron and steel products, capital equipment and their spare parts, plastic products and raw materials and various glass and chemical products.
The monthly reports issued by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) disclosed the retreat of free trade zones exports to abroad during the second quarter of the current fiscal year to $311.2 million against $345.5 million in the first quarter of the same year. Imports, such as production requirements, capital goods from abroad to the free trade zones declined to $359.6 in late of the second quarter versus $383.1 million in the first quarter. Observers attributed such a decline to the weakness of production of free zones projects.

A recent study pointed out nascent opportunities for the Egyptian exports of competitive edge to penetrate the Japanese market provided that they meet the conditions and quality standards.
It attributed such a decline to the decrease in Egypt's petroleum exports, which hit 37 million dollars in 2001 against 124.4 million dollars in 2000, down by 50%, whereas non-petroleum exports went up from 32.3 million dollars in 2000 to 39.1million dollars in 2001.
Egypt's Ambassador to Japan Mahmoud Karem estimated Egyptian exports to Japan at around 157 million U.S. dollars on an annual basis. Egypt seeks to diversify its trade with Japan by raising food and unprocessed food exports to it, he said.
Egyptian-Japanese relations have been further reinforced since the historical visit by President Hosni Mubarak to Japan in April 1999. In this tour, a partnership agreement was signed between both countries. It is based on developing and reinforcing five main axes, including the development axis, which aims to reinforce Egyptian-Japanese cooperation, especially among NGOs.

In an exclusive interview with Al-Quds Al-Arabi, leader of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) Sheikh Ahmed Yassin said the Palestinian National Authority should protect the Palestinian people from aggression rather than extend services to Israel and America.
Can the cart be put before the horse? It's unreasonable.
A. We said before that so long as the government surrenders to the enemy and waves the white flags, it is unacceptable. But if the government sides with the people to defend them, resist the occupier and liberate the land, the whole Palestinian people will support it.
A. Our conditions are explicitly understandable. We will stop the Intifada only when there is no occupation and when settlements are removed. But, so long as there are settlements and occupation, there is a need for self-defence and repulsing the enemy from our land. The equation is very obvious: no occupation in return for stopping resistance.
Will our people's case, then, be solved?
A. All such agreements are in favour of Israel, which goes back on agreements. Israel violated international laws and agreements but neither American nor British forces struck it in order to implement the UN Security Council resolutions. Iraq was bombed in order to have the UN resolutions put into effect.
Truce for the "road map" Q. In order to implement the "road map", however, Abu Mazin and the new government will at least call a truce for a certain period of time?
It was the right number of course, but, some how, I could not be put through.
That notification might come in the form of such Palestinian leaderships exit from Syria to any other country or perhaps what other measures and implications the situation might require!
Damascus, left it to the Lebanese government to tackle the matter on its own under the pretext that it is a Lebanese party operative on Lebanese territories and Syria, therefore, cannot be held responsible for it and even if it had been so in the past, it would not retain the same role at present!
It also has deputies in the parliament.
This, therefore, means that Hassan Nasrallah is regarded as a political cadre, besides being a struggle project and a struggler who was able to inflict a military and political defeat on Israel and force it to quit the South of Lebanon.
Will Hizbullah have to face friends treachery?
It should beware of America's anger and should, therefore, respond to some of its demands and conditions.
Both Syria and Lebanon are therefore in an extremely embarrassing situation which is the gravest danger to their national security.

The memo, which Asharq Al-Awsat was given access to, stated that the U.S.-British occupation of Iraq without any move by Arab countries means that the AL has become unqualified to protect and defend the Arab interests especially as some Arab countries had collaborated with the occupation forces through extending military and logistical facilities to help the American and British armies invade Iraq.

It appears that the erection of this system will be as difficult far as the war was easy.
Quite a few American officials and experts have admitted the absence of a clearly defined project for the future of Iraq.
This menace is not a novelty, nor is it a monopoly for the Iraqis: it has existed since the advent of political Islamic movements, and actually loomed over Algeria in 1991, casting its shadows on other countries, including Egypt, Jordan and Tunisia.
One of its most advocates was Prince Talal Bin Abdel Aziz Al Saud of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
The second thing to do is to "coach" the Iraqi military in the principles of democracy, multiplicity and human rights.
But what is required in Iraq is to have the constitution stipulate that the Armed forces are the guardian of democracy and human rights according to the principles that will be agreed upon at the time of formulating this constitution.
If we look at the Iraqi military from the same perspective, we will see a history full of coups, from the day the military brought down the semi-democratic regime in 1958 until the Army became a tool for the Saddam Hussein regime to use against its own people.
So, the Iraqi parties and political figures and movements, regardless of their colour, may find it useful to look into the idea of assigning the Iraqi military the mission of protecting democracy, which would assure those who are apprehensive of the consequences of building a fully democratic system on a foundation of open, unrestricted multiplicity, free elections that will be the sole tool for rotation of power and respect of political and civil freedoms and human rights.
An army that is rebuilt on a foundation of democratic culture should see in assigning it such a great mission an honour in which to feel so much pride that would preclude the emergence of any ambitions for staging military coups.
On Wednesday Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Al-Than held a press conference in Paris with his Israeli counterpart Silvan Shalom. "Forging the Qatari-Israeli relations is contingent upon the progress of the peace process, which necessitates that every party should recognize the other party's right to exist," Hamad said, considering the Palestinian-Israeli conflict as a standoff.
He told reporters that the situation needs serious action and the distinguished relations between Qatar and the Palestinian Premier Mahmoud Abbas Abu-Mazin doesn't mean that the latter can relinquish political affairs.
He continued to say that sitting with an Israeli at a table doesn't mean ceding everything, but the important thing here is to return to negotiation. Qatar looks forward to good relations with all countries including Israel, but there are many things to do to reach that end, said Hamad.
He said his meeting with Qatari foreign minister shows Qatari positive dealing with matters and urges other countries to adopt the same method. The meeting also helps improve and promote bilateral relations.
The Foreign Ministry turned down the US protest, considering it interference in the Egyptian internal affairs.
The establishment of the human rights council and its terms of reference would be issued by a law rather than a presidential decree, said Minister of Justice Councilor Farouk Saif Al-Nasr, confirming that its task would be receiving and following up complaints as well as helping to solve human rights-related cases and issues. In addition, the minister added, the council would give its opinion in relevant draft laws and decisions before being referred to competent authorities.

However, all this did not satisfy the opposition who described such measures as "incomplete".

ISRAEL: SECRET TALKS WITH IRANIAN OFFICIALS IN GREECE
According to the data published in Israel yesterday, the Israeli and Iranian officials had met together on the margin of the conference and held a lengthy sitting where they dealt with bilateral relations in various issues raised during the conference including the security aspect.
An Egyptian official who asked not to be identified said that the Egyptian political leadership had asked that such a humanitarian issue be given the utmost care in order to enable scores of Egyptian families to get acquainted with the destiny of their relatives who they lost contact with long years ago.
Asharq Al-Awsat, learnt that Egyptian foreign minister had asked his American counterpart, Colin Powell, during his latest visit to Cairo to assist the Egyptian authorities to find out the destiny of hundreds of Egyptians whose relatives lost contact with them a while ago and to get information about the Egyptians who were injured or killed during the American and British military operations in Iraq.
ISLAMIC, DEMOCRATIC AND NATIONAL EPITHETS DOMINATE PARTY AND MOVEMENT NAMES
Anybody can simply get access to such parties' headquarters in Baghdad where they used the former regime's government and partisan premises. You may find more than three premises for three different parties in the same street, which makes such a tour far from inconvenient. In such premises, people would receive you with due care as they are eager to be acquainted with and talk with everybody. Nor will anybody find it hard to break the ice and start a conversation as the old regime had left thousands of copies you can easily choose from to breach the subject of the 35-year suffering!
Will democracy here prove no difference from that envisioned in books and theories? Or will it take a difficult form after oil starts to flow abroad and when Iraq turns into a table for which the whole world will have an eye to seize a handout or just to accept an invitation to the feast whether they were originally invited or not?
The deputy pointed out the success achieved by the experiments of several Egyptian television channels, as well as Arab satellites, which arrange for an interpreter for the deaf and the dumb on the screen whether during news bulletins or religious programmes, which encouraged many of them to pose questions to such programmes' guests and, therefore, become better acquainted with matters of their own religion.
Under the above heading, Al-Ahram Al-Arabi correspondent in Beirut writes a news analysis about Colin Powell's visit to Lebanon and Syria and what this has to do with Hezbollah to say: Powell was so frank when he clearly demanded the deployment of the Lebanese army to the southern border instead of Hezbollah members. For its part, Hezbollah dealt adroitly with this American pressure. Despite the statements of all Hezbollah leaderships that rejected the American dictations, Hezbollah made a wide margin of maneuver that focussed on two pivots. The first is the non-performance of any military operations against the occupation sites in Shebaa Farms for a long time and the second is the maintenance of stable calm on the Lebanese-Israeli borders, the essential aim sought by the US and Israel.
At the same time, Hezbollah was keen to show its political characteristic through a group of visits and intensive contact with different Lebanese political figures and parties including Maronite Patriarch Nasrullah Botrous Safir to coordinate positions and exchange consultation.
He demands Hezbollah should hand over their weapons to the Lebanese army, so should Israeli aggression take place, the weapons will be distributed to all not to a particular group so that no party or sect will monopolize the word "Allah".
As for the other pending issues, they have become almost settled even if this was not officially announced. Syria and Lebanon agreed to deal with Abu Mazen-led government on the basis that the Palestinians are free with regard to their stands. Syria also closed its borders with Iraq fully and abided by not interfering into its affairs. Even the Syrian Trade Minister said frankly that Syria would deal with any coming Iraqi government.
In a meeting with a number of Tunisian thinkers and intellectuals during his visit to Tunisia, Gaddafi analyzed the current situation witnessed by the Arab region, saying, "The Arabs are now living in a new age with a new approach. The old ideas of the past have become like old coins, a thing that is inconvenient for this new era. It is backwardness to adhere to such ideas."
SYRIA CANCELS MILITARY EDUCATION FROM PREPARATORY AND SECONDARY CURRICULA On Friday, Syria decided to cancel the military education courses from its educational curricula.
YEMENI PRESIDENT, SOCIALIST PARTY RESTORE PARTNERSHIP RELATIONS
This came within the framework of the President's orientations to fold the file of conflicts and turn over a new leaf of political amity and achieve a national closing up the ranks to face challenges in light of regional and international variables.
Although the Yemeni Grouping for Reform (opposition Islamic) has issued a statement regarding the amnesty decision as an achievement of the alliance it held with the Socialist and opposition parties within the framework of the joint meeting parties, the "Reform" fears that the decision might have been meant to impose a kind of political isolation upon it and an attempt to dismember the alliance (joint meeting) and, therefore, lose any efficiency should the state of reconciliation and amity are restored by the unity makers.
Al-Hayat learnt from well-informed sources that the President had proposed the idea of the amnesty decision to officials and main military and security leaderships who approved and supposed it within the public orientations of the political leaderships. The friendly meeting held with the socialist leadership two days ago was attended by a number of political and military leaderships, besides the main leaderships in the General Popular Congress.
In a message to all Ikhawnite elements all over the world, of which Al-Hayat obtained a copy, Hudhaibi stressed the necessity of adhering to the constants of Islam laid down by God and his Prophet - God's prayers and peace be upon him - concerning the explicit difference between the land occupied by the enemies of Islam and the unoccupied one.
Hudhaibi called on Arab and Muslim rulers to review their stances and give the Islamists the opportunity to take part in the political action.
After backtracking on amending an article of the law on practicing political life in Egypt, which was supposed to allow those who had evaded the military service to contest parliamentary elections, 22 deputies who turned out to have evaded military service started a campaign to put off broaching the problem of dodging the draft and postpone dropping their membership till the expiry of the legal term of the parliament in November 2005.
He added that the report of the State Council Commissioners' body upheld the decision to drop those deputies membership as they were considered deficient in one of the conditions required for eligibility for candidature - performing military service or being equally exempted from it without trial.
Hamas informed Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazin) of its willingness to stop its operations against the Israeli civilians if Israel stops the killing Palestinian civilians and all forms of violence and reprisal such as besiege and bulldozing lands in addition to releasing captures.
"For our part, we explained our point of view to Abu Mazin in a way that serves the Palestinian supreme interest. Talking about our alternatives, we also pointed out an opportunity to avoid killing Israeli civilians if the Israelis stop killing Palestinian civilians and lift blockade.
He added that the inter-Palestinian fighting is a red line that should not be transgressed.
There is a feeling in the Palestinian political milieus that Israel hides something for President Arafat and that it will seize the appropriate opportunity to encroach upon him and liquidate him whether directly or in a way that seems as a mistake or expel him.
Terming illiteracy eradication as an issue of the entire society, he called on all the cabinet ministries to devote their potential to the issue in order to notch up such an end.
Minister of Education, Hussein Kamel Baha'eddin termed untrue reports that the U.S. had asked Egypt to amend or change curricula.
In the field of education in particular, Egypt has a great role in repulsing extremism and terrorism, he said. "We developed our curricula seven years ago without any request from anybody."
"All religions call for amity, peace and security all over the world. However, there are even some Muslims, Christians and Jews trade upon their religions. Islam is opposed to the conflict of civilizations theory because it is based on cooperation for the benevolence of humanity."
Tantawi declined to consider such blasts as reaction to the U.S. aggression on Muslims. "The reaction should not include the killing of innocents but rather through other approaches," he said, adding, "We agree that the reaction should seek practical and legal approaches through which the countries that see that America had transgressed can attain their rights, not through killing innocents or causing havoc."
The Group warned that such explosions would "serve the ends of the enemies of Islam and the Islamic nation who are subjecting it to the severest types of terrorism in Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan."
Holding an extended meeting with his top aides yesterday (May 17th), Minister of the Interior Habib Al-Adli made emphatic "the necessity to maintain the good performance of the Egyptian security bodies while dealing with terrorism", considering that " the latest acts of terror in Casablanca and Riyadh reflected a more growing terrorist activity on the global level and that necessitated more vigilance and efforts".
Egyptian cotton export contracts maintained rising in the 29th week of the present-day cotton export season.
BANKING PLAN TO CONVERT TO SMART CARDS
He called on Egyptian banks to hasten to use smart cards especially in credit and debit as the internationally set period for converting to smart card system would come to an end late 2005. He pointed out that the banks that couldn't use smart cards would face risks emanating from card counterfeiting operations, which have been on the increase during the last period and going rampant in the countries lacking this new system.
Commenting on MPs discussions over the plan and budget of the new FY 2003/2004, Prime Minister Dr. Atef Ebeid exploded a number of surprises in figures, which were enough to respond to the whole inquiries that were raised during the discussions.
Amid the MPs' surprise of such figures, Ebeid added that the new plan and budget reflected a social perspective adopted by the government and that 80% of the budget resources were allocated for the low-income categories.
He added that a contract of a new company for real estate would be concluded on June 14th, with contributions from the New Urban Communities Authority, Housing and Develolpment Bank, insurance and enterprise companies as well as the Egyptian Authority of Wakfs (religious endowments).
INCREASING POTABLE WATER PRICES CONSIDERED
PA APPROVES NEW STATE'S PUBLIC BUDGET OF 2003/2004
The total deficit in the public budget aggravated to reach LE33.5 billion during the first 9 months of the fiscal year 2002-2003 compared with LE27.6 billion in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.
Such a decline is ascribed to the decline in executed investments in the public and private enterprise sectors by LE6.5 billion while executed investments by the government and economic bodies increased by 1.6 billion.
The report admitted to achieving less than 1.9% of the rate targeted in the plan (4.6%), as it is expected that the real growth rate will not exceed 2.5% at the end of 2002/2003.
Thus, the current deficit hit 7.1 billion pounds versus 2.6 billion pounds in the previous period.
Meanwhile, trade balance deficit improved by 5.3% to hit 972.4 million dollars against a deficit of 1027.1 million dollars in the same period last year. This improvement is ascribed to the increase in commodity exports by 6%, petroleum exports by 16.3% in light of oil price rises internationally and agricultural and industrial exports increase by 1%.
This was said by head of the Spinning and Weaving Subsidy Fund's Permanent Committee Eng. Mohsen Al-Geilani who also doubles as head of the Cotton, Yarn and Textile Holding Company.
Wages in the country have hiked by 10 percent over the last three years, while inflation stood at 3 percent, he said, noting that the bold decision on the exchange rate deregulation was made by the government following in-depth studies, denying that it could have come under pressure to take the action.
The IMF delegation which visited Egypt lately conducted a regular review of the performance of the economy. The delegation stressed the importance of the procedures taken by the monetary control authorities for deregulating exchange rate, which was previously demanded by the IMF.
IMF pledges This confession also represents commitment by the IMF to accept its pledges declared in the conference of donor states and institutions in Sharm El-Sheikh early this year. It was agreed that the IMF would offer a credit batch at a value of $500 million.
He told reporters that the conference comes within the framework of preparations for the fifth extended ministerial conference of the organization, which would be held next September in Canc?n, Mexico.
He explained that participation of developing countries like Senegal, Kenya, Mauritius and South Africa reflects Egypt's role in closing standpoints between the developing and the developed countries as far as the issues put up in Canc?n conference are concerned.
FROZEN VEGETABLE EXPORTS ACCOUNT FOR 6.6 MILLION DOLLARS
CONTROVERSY IN PA ABOUT BENEFIT FROM AFRICAN EXPORT &IMPORT BANK
Economic Committee head Said Al-Alfi stressed that the committee will issue a recommendation about whether Egypt would continue contributing to the bank and whether it was possible to maximize the benefit gained from it or not.
"CBE contributes 5.6% in the bank's capital, in addition to the contribution of the four major Egyptian banks, namely National Bank of Egypt, Banque Misr, Banque du Caire, and Bank of Alexandria, as well as Export Development Bank of Egypt and Arab Investment Bank," Farag said, adding that the bank has no objection to deal with institutions and individuals in Egypt. "The problem," he continued, "lies in the fact that 85% of its loans are facilities and of short term, repayable over 6 months." Chairman of Exports Development Bank of Egypt Sherief Sharaf said, "Even though Export Development Bank is a contributor to African Export and Import Bank, it does not benefit from it and does not get any facilities from it, as the bank does not grant facilities to its contributors. Furthermore, he added, its short-term loans make the biannual export rotations finance a difficult task.
NBE ASKS CBE FOR LE2 BILLION TO BUY AL-TEGARYOON"
The Bank of Commerce and Development "Al-Tegaryoon" capital reaches LE200 million. The NBE is one of its most prominent contributors in addition to the contributions of governmental banks, mainly including Misr Bank, Banque du Caire, Bank of Alexandria and National Investment Bank.
The rate of software piracy in Egypt went down to 52% in 2002 against 58%, in 2001, the report said.
INFLATION IN EGYPT UP 3.6 PERCENT
A sensation in Egyptian economic milieus was created when the USA announced its wish to conclude an agreement with Egypt.
However, he categorically rejects any American tendencies to integrate the Israeli economy with the region's economies. He, therefore, objected to the American condition that Egyptian products exported to American markets should include 8% Israeli components.
Political Gains: According to a study prepared by director of Egyptian Centre for Economic Studies, Dr. Ahmed Galal, and economic expert in Harvard University Dr. Robert Laurence, the USA's goal behind the conclusion of free trade agreements with Middle East countries is to achieve political gains in return for those countries making economic gains out of those agreements.
The study, therefore, adds that Egypt's influence is strong outside its borders as it is the country that led Arab peoples' liberation movement from imperialism and is a basic partner in any peace process in the region.
The agreement will be increasingly needful for Egypt when the export quota system currently in use is cancelled in 2005 as that will increase the competition which Egyptian products have to face in the American market.
Al-Zorba, who was addressing a seminar on trade agreement with the USA recently held by the Egyptian Centre for Economic Studies said that the agreement did not involve any intervening in Egypt's internal affairs nor is it a military alliance nor will its signature be a betrayal of the Arabs or the Palestinians!
Egyptian exports reached 1.1 billion euro last year against 1.08 billion euro in 2001, up %3.6, he said.
FRANCO-EGYPTIAN PARTNERSHIP IN AFRICA MORE IMPORTANT THAN PARTICIPATING IN RECONSTRUCTING IRAQ
As for the finance of the third line of the underground, he said he preferred joint finance on the grounds that it needed huge funds that could not be afforded by a single country especially as there were other bodies that could offer loans such as the European Investment Bank.
The EFTA agreed to rescind all customs duties on Egyptian industrial exports to its members, and to grant customs privileges to Egyptian farming produce, mainly potatos, oranges, tomato, flowers and bulbs, said al-Said Fuad Qassem, first undersecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and chairman of the Commercial Representation Sector. The EFTA will also cancel all duties on Egyptian fish and sea products, said Qassem, who headed the Egyptian delegation in the negotiations, which were held in Geneva on June 2-7.
EGYPT WITHDRAWS ITS SUIT AGAINST EU CONCERNING GENETICALLY ENGINEERED PRODUCTS
The message pointed out that the decision was made after a thorough review of the EU's stance regarding the production and marketing of the genetically engineered foods and food components.
-Lack of interest taken by Egyptian exports in the Japanese market due to the long distance and the high expenses of travel and accommodation and their inability to adapt to the Japanese style of treatment which is characterized by collective decision making as well as its extreme slow procedures. Besides, the Japanese government has imposed a ban on importing some Egyptian agricultural goods from Egypt under the pretext that they are infected with agricultural pests and the inability of some Egyptian companies to ensure commitment to regular delivery of goods, which does not suit the style of the Japanese companies in dealing with external markets.
-The Japanese importer's preference of importing from East Asian region as a strategic region for Japan whose products are highly competitive in the aspects of quality, price and punctuality in delivery, the cost of freight and the productivity of labour, let alone geographical and cultural proximity, which led to Japanese companies hesitance in granting the Egyptian exporter confidence regarding his compliance with the contract conditions, regularity of delivery and maintenance of the same quality levels.
The Egyptian companies should directly contact the branches of major Japanese trading companies in Egypt and constantly benefit by the programmes offered by Japanese Foreign trade authority to help Egyptian exporters penetrate the Japanese market, especially Export to Japan Study Programme and the centers for supporting businessmen, affiliated to JETRO. They should constantly keep in touch with the Commercial Representation Bureau in Japan to make use of its services and contacts in the sphere of promoting Egyptian exports. They should also contact the bureau a sufficient time before the visit to provide the data beforehand about the competitive situation of the commodity, the channels of distribution and the arrangement of required encounters with potential importers.
The set of goods and raw materials include: cotton, crude oil, linen fibers, metal ores, agricultural and food goods such as fruit, jam, frozen vegetables, medical and aromatic herbs and plants, spices, dried onions, processed food items, waifers, corn flakes and pet fish.
The JICA chief said his country was willing to cooperate with Egypt in the reconstruction of Iraq, the minister said. Once they return home, the Japanese delegation will work out a plan to materialize joint cooperation in this respect. The Japanese team also expressed Japan's interest in aiding Egypt in the establishment of a new major museum in the country, he said.
A private company has been licensed to organize the Egyptian pavilion in the exhibition on an area of 500 square meters, said Athens-based Commercial Representation Office chief Counsellor Alaa Qenawi.
Egypt's imports from Greece went down by 23% in 2001 to hit 59 million dollars, he said.
As for the joint projects, which were set up in the free zones, Qenawai pointed out that they are 7 projects at the beginning of the current year with investments amounting to 17.2 million dollars and registering an increase by 100% in comparison to last year.
Qenawi stressed the importance of operating a maritime route between Egyptian and Greek harbours so as to boost trade exchange between the two countries.
Eshra told Al-Alam Al-Youm that the meetings showed the possibility of cooperation between Egyptian and Romanian contractors in Iraq's reconstruction as Romania is forecast to participate in the reconstruction of Iraq. He pointed out strenuous efforts exerted to restore the East European market, which was a traditional market for Egypt years ago, but the change of economic and political conditions there led to remarkable impacts on the level of cooperation with such countries.
He added that the office prepared a plan of action to develop exports. This plan depends on determining five goods of high export value that are included in Czech imports list and out of Egyptian exports which are actually being exported there. These exports, which are furniture, shoes, plastics, tomato and flowers, can be marketed by the office in cooperation with the Egyptian productive companies, he said.
It has been agreed to set up a standing trade center for Egyptian products in Minst, the Belorussian capital, so that the Belorussian party would offer the required facilities in that concern. Ways and means of exporting a number of Egyptian products to Belorussian markets were also probed, such as citrus, vegetables, fresh fruit, medicine, ceramics and clothes. It has also been agreed that it was of paramount importance to exploit the available capacities in both countries for manufacturing and assembling tractors, trucks, motorbikes, bicycles, motors, electricity equipment and electronic components instead of importing them from abroad. Domestic components for the products which are being assembled in Egypt should be enhanced in order to be exported to the markets of Arab and African countries with which Egypt has preferential customs treatment agreements.
Dr. Ghali stated that the two sides work to reinforce the bilateral commercial cooperation as the Egyptian exports to Belarus in 2002 amounted to about 4 million dollars, a quantum leap if compared to the exports in 2000, which did not exceed 40 thousand dollars.
Being probed also is intensifying contacts between the Egyptian concerned companies and the Belorussian companies that produce agricultural equipment, tractors, motors and electrical equipment in order to set up joint ventures in Egypt to produce such equipment locally rather than import it, establish a joint company to market Egyptian exports and mount an Egyptian week in Belorussia.
This comes within the framework of the meetings of the Egyptian-Belorussian committee currently in session in Cairo.
MALAYSIA TO PARTAKE IN PETROCHEMICAL PRODUCTION IN EGYPT
"The project will be established in Alexandria in conjunction with Egyptian, British and Malaysian investors and will start next month," Malaysian Ambassador to Cairo Abu-Bakr Dawoud said during a meeting between the Egyptian Businessmen Association chaired by Gamal Al-Nazer, and 22 Asian ambassadors.
For his part, Afghan chargé d'affaires Abdel-Ghaffar Karazi affirmed that there are great chances for Egyptian the construction companies to participate in reconstruction of Afghanistan, pointing out that there are indeed Egyptian companies that partook in the reconstruction operations.
EGYPTIAN HERMES RUNS FIRST IRANIAN INVESTMENT FUND
Norten Rose will discharge the responsibility for the fund's legal investments. Iran's first investment fund allows investors from outside Iran to take part in the Iranian capital market which is regarded by many financial experts and economists as a promising investment market.
It is to be mentioned that the Kuwaiti fund extended 25 loans to the tune of 7 billion dollars to Egypt over the past years so as to finance development projects including projects for reclaiming 400 thousand feddans in Sinai and financing the Arish-Aqaba gas pipeline.
An analysis the trade movement between the two countries from 1997 to 2002 would show that there was a state of fluctuation as the Egyptian exports to Syria plummeted to 41.8 million dollars in 1999 against 45.6 million dollars in 1998, a decrease of 3.8 million dollars or 18.3%. In 2000 Egypt's exports to Syria hiked to 48.2 million dollars, up 6.4 million dollars or 15.3% over the figures registered in 1999. Such an increase is ascribed to the fact that the volume of some Egyptian exports to the Syrian market went up. Rice and grain exports increased by 37.4% and aluminum and its byproducts exports surged up by 64%.
Efforts are being exerted to increase the Egyptian-Sudanese trade exchange up to one billion dollars annually, said Essam Eddin Al-Tashi, head of the Sudanese delegation now on visit to Egypt.
The visit comes within the framework of boosting Egyptian exports to Sudan and assuring that Egyptian products meet international standards and that the value-added doesn't exceed 40 percent. The 6-day visit includes factories of airconditioners, refrigerators, butane gas cylinders, lubricants, power generators, cosmetics, detergents, foodstuffs and household appliances.
"This agreement shows that Egypt is on course to continue meeting the power needs of its people, and the US remains a committed partner to Egypt," said Welch.
EGYPTIAN-EUROPEAN CONSULTATIONS ON EXPORTING GENETICALLY ENGINEERED PRODUCTS TO EU
The two ministries announced as well that they made an urgent request for consulting with the European commission on the decision taken by the EU Thursday last banning Egyptian potatoes getting access to EU markets due to some cases of brown rot, a procedure that was seen by Egypt as unjustifiable on the part of the European agricultural quarantine authorities.
In a meeting with a Japanese delegation from Japan Bank for International Cooperation, Japan International Cooperation Agency and the Japanese Embassy in Cairo, the minister said his ministry was seeking to meet the needs of Japanese tourists by introducing Japanese to sound and light shows, raising tour guides who can speak Japanese, and releasing tourist guides in Japanese.
A report by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology mentioned that the total investments of the company hit 2.8 billion pounds in 2001, while they didn't exceed some 800 million pounds in the FY 1996/1997 before the operation system of the company converted to the Gregorian calendar system as of 2001. There was an increased demand on the part of clients to subscribe to the fresh phone services such as the number of subscribers to the local and international call service reached more than 2.5 million; caller ID, 3.2 million; call barring, 407 thousand; call waiting, 272 thousand; follow-me service, 73,905; conference, 13 thousand; wake up, 8,186; don't disturb service, 5,677 and the hotline service, 4,430 subscribers, the report pointed out.
The Ministry of Agriculture plans to expand cotton-cultivated areas to make up for the hairy cotton shortage in the coming cotton cultivation season, economic sources said.
The German government approved to extend a 4.4-million grant to the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture with a view to implementing a cotton sector development project and supporting research work aiming at raising productivity, improving quality, and producing new hybrids.
The government failure to pay contractors' dues on schedule has led to accumulated interest on their debts, becoming higher than the original debts, the report said.
NO INTENTION OF INCREASING PETROLEUM PRICES
"We've pure Egyptian projects, such as Damietta, Rosetta and Alexandria projects where their products are exported to 39 countries," he said.
This sector now includes 68 thousand jobs. There is a plan for providing about 4 thousand jobs annually for the new companies and projects affiliated to the ministry, he said, pointing out that his ministry trained 12,500 graduates who are being employed at present.
The gas was found out in the well at a depth much deeper than what was expected at the beginning of digging.
Petroleum sources described the discovery as a big victory for the petroleum sector, which achieved a big leap in the number of successful discoveries in the last three years, thus raising Egypt's reserve of natural gas to 60 trillion cubic feet.
On the other hand, the World Bank agreed to secure 400 million dollars to finance the establishment of fresh projects to develop civil aviation in the country. The World Bank agreed to secure 250 million dollars instead of 150 million dollars as a soft loan to finance development-related projects. In addition, it helped borrowing 150 million dollars from the African Development Bank, said Minister of Aviation Dr. Ahmed Shafik.
"We'll seek to establish some sort of cooperation concerning the operation, management and marketing of Upper Egyptian airports, mainly including Luxor, Aswan and Abu Simbel airports, through cooperation with a foreign partner who is interested in the archaeological culture," the minister said. "Cooperation with the World Bank comes within the framework of the Ministry of Aviation's keenness on relieving the State of the costs of the aviation sector projects through repaying the value of such projects in return for our services," he added.
Efforts are underway to resume Osaka flights, while Beijing flights will remain put on hold till next August until the health circumstances of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) disease is improved, he indicated.
These remarks came at the inauguration of the Egyptian Company for Mineral Resources as the first holding company for managing mining.
The Premier approved allocating 10% of quarries' revenues to the Geological Survey Authority to boost its role, Abdel Qader said.
The training program, which is part of Japanese technical assistance to Egypt, will be beneficial to 5,000 Egyptian trainees.
NATIONAL FRONT WAY OUT OF EGYPT'S CRISES: LABOUR PARTY LEADER
He also called that the single party idea should be jettisoned, the devolution of power principle be put in place, the president of the republic be elected and the emergency law and extraordinary legislation be scrapped.
The current situation in the region and the ramification of policies of a single party that has been wielding influence in the country for three decades in succession have led to a grinding political predicament, unstudied economic policies, economic deterioration, price mark-up, increased trade and payment balance deficit, knotty social problems and rampant corruption.
Interviewed by Al-Wafd, the opposition daily leader said national security was the first step in the program of political reforms, direly needed by the country.
The proposed social decade will lead to a better about-face, he said, noting that democracy is based on the respect of people's rights.
Furthermore, the national front idea is based on free and clean elections, prosperity and respect of human rights, he said.
The poverty rate in Egypt plummeted from about 30% in 1999 to about 17% in the year 2000. The literacy rate rose during a period, almost more than a generation, from 43% in 1985 to 65.5% in 2001.
The rate of families enjoying electricity reached 98.7% of the total Egyptian families. Hence, the rate of families obtaining TV sets soared to 89.4%.
There is also a discrepancy between the urban and rural areas. Most of the non-urban governorates lie in the category of low human development.
It should be noted that there is a relation between illiteracy and poverty. They are associated with a high population growth rate. Therefore, the report is of the view that the quality of educational system should be improved in Egypt. Good education requires good teachers and revision of curricula and teaching methods. It also requires limitation of class rooms density.
TO GET REWARD, EGYPTIAN GUARD ALLEGES AMERICAN COMPANY HE WORKS WITH ATTACKED BY TERRORISTS
Having moved to the company, the police were taken aback by only watching a number of panicked workers climbing the walls of the company to escape the illusive attack. The guard was taken to the State Security Investigation Police for further investigations.
A draft bill in the same respect would be presented to the People's Assembly within days.
On the other hand, the Press Syndicate decided on a meeting held on Tuesday under the chairmanship of incumbent chief of journalists, Ibrahim Nafei, to take steps necessary for holding the syndicate elections and electing a new chief.
Egyptian and Palestinian sources laid it bare that there is a sharp difference in views between the Egyptian authorities and a number of Palestinian radical groups that had been responsible for a series of martyrdom operations against targets inside Israel. This difference may bar the holding of the third round of national dialogue sponsored by Egypt since last year.
The broadside was pressed by the experts at a symposium organized by the National Planning Institute on Tuesday. The development issue was affected by the crisis-finessing approach.
A relevant national panel has been made up to set up a crisis-managing mechanism involving 29 cabinet ministers, he said, adding that it could convene within half an hour.
Most Jordanian mass media ignored publishing the statements of Israeli minister of tourism Benjamin Elon, reported by Israeli Haartz, where he asked for not setting up a Palestinian state and ending the problem of the Palestinian refugees through Jordan.
Elon is leader of the extremist party Moledet.
It is noteworthy that Elon, who took over after former minister of tourism had been killed, had proposed to the Knesset in mid last year, a plan known as the "transfer" where he said, "We should solve the refugee problem by optionally displacing the Palestinians and transporting them to Arab countries and settling them there. Let's start with the Palestinians inside the I948 territories." Such proposals have been escalated after the Iraqi war.
He emphasized Israeli government rejection of offering any capitulation related to the Israeli citizen's security.
The minister ignored that the risk of injury or death in operations in Israel would be in proportionately greater than that of falling a victim in Morocco.
Such an invitation alarmed the Israeli right as its concerns aggravated as numerous Moroccan Jews showed willingness to return.
Shiite authority, Mohamed Hussein Fadhlallah gave a religious opinion to the effect that the blasts targeting civilians like those that took place in Morocco and Saudi Arabia were religiously impermissible.
He emphasized that Islam bans assaulting innocents or people in general regardless of their religions or ethnics or even identity or nationality.
IRAQI TRADERS SWEEP JORDAN MARKETS
The American thoroughly studied action resulted in three quick results. The Iraqi warehouses have been dumped with stored commodities. A class of senior Iraqi traders and trade agents - who were found out to be millionaires - emerged. It also caused a state of trade panic in Jordan, which witnesses unprecedented competition over exporting all that can be exported to the Iraqi market in transactions worth tens of millions of dollars.
The matter is not confined to storing cars in Iraq but a new class of Iraqi local agents has emerged. They buy everything for the Iraqi market via closed-door meetings and tours on markets resulted so far in great transactions to transport huge quantities of sugar, rice, cooking oils, café and tea.
To ensure full exploitation of the situation in favour of its national commercial sector, the Jordanian government granted the Iraqi traders special facilities giving them an easy access. It set up many offices meant to immediately endorse their purchases and imports. Experts say that special transactions have been clinched through Jordanian agents to import a large number of tractors. It was said that the Americans support such a deal in particular for unknown reasons. Hundreds of petrol tanks are also transported from Jordan to the Iraqi market although Jordan is not an oil-producing country.
MAP OF ISLAMIC GROUPS IN MOROCCO
There are two movements that separated from one group established under the influence of the Iranian revolution. They are "The Movement for the sake of the Nation" and "The Civilized Alternative", which became maturer and less adherent to Al-Khomeini's slogans.
Islamists managed to enter the parliament in 1997 with 9 deputies, but their deputies in the current parliament are 42 including 6 women.
Morocco has witnessed in the recent years a religious tide among the youth and ordinary citizens. One can hardly find a street in Morocco where there is no house in which young men gather every Saturday to read Qu'ran and study jurdisprudence.
The relation between the Moroccan authority and the Islamic organisations is a very complicated one. The king is the commander of the faithful and therefore these organisations do not try to hurt him. The authority does not try to bring about any violent confrontation with these organisations, which raise Allah's Book (The Holy Qu'ran).

WAVE OF BLASTS, THEIR IMPLICATIONS!

More importantly even, the principle of accountability or reckoning should be established. In semi-civilized countries, the minister in charge resigns as soon as he commits an error. We have seen examples of this in China and Taiwan where ministers resigned because of the spread of SARS, and in Portugal owing to the collapse of a bridge. However, we have never sensed that the Saudi Minister of the Interior is thinking of resigning his 30-year held position in the aftermath of the Riyadh explosions simply because he had not been brought to look after any previous disasters during Haj (pilgrimage), Al Akhbar blasts, Riyadh blasts and Alcoholics Mafia.

FOLLOWING DEREGULATION: ABUNDANCE OF DOLLAR, EXORBITANT PRICES Five months have elapsed since the pound was deregulated against the dollar.

* What are the aspects of difficulty?
Therefore, only the Ministry of Industry has to be responsible for the modernization programme. Some people sometimes ask me: How many institutions are you going to upgrade?

We need Egypt to be a financial gateway to the Middle East. When I met with Minister of Industry Ali Al-Saidi, he told me he had a carte blanche from the president to provide all facilities to render the programme a success. The president gives it special interest. We have to be up to that interest.

PALESTINIAN CAUSE: THE COMING SETTLEMENT A TRUCE RATHER THAN PEACE
Also, the logic of superiority and force tempts Israel into using military force for the settlement of all its causes with Arabs.
He affirmed the Palestinian people's continuation of their struggle leveled the balance of power for the mileage of all parties of the region and gives some justice to the march of Arab-Israeli conflict. The pursued struggle also opens the door for all Arab and Islamic parties to reconsider their assessments, stances, and plans particularly where resistance and boycott are concerned and supports them as along as the Arab nation stood by the Palestinian people in resisting occupation, liberating Jerusalem, and building the independent Palestinian State.
Al-Digani sees that the future of the Israeli entity depends on the contradictions inside this entity which can be categorized into a religious-secular conflict, a conflict between Eastern Jews and Western Jews, conflict between the rich and the poor, and a conflict between the 1948 Arabs and the Jewish majority inside Israel.
Cold peace He stressed that the settlement that can be reached in the short run will not bring the aspired-after peace but it will bring a state of cold peace at best and a state of no-war in most cases. Therefore, the need to find a correct solution to the conflict and effective remedy for dealing with the Zionist imperialist alliance remains an imperative and urges a crystallization of a vision to be adopted by the Arab nation.
Basiouni affirmed that the uprising stopped economic growth, hindered tourism, increased unemployment, and brought recession to the Israeli economy. Also, the Israeli people live now in a state of fear and depression and more than 425 reserve soldiers and officers refused to join the service because they see that fighting an unarmed people is not of the ethics of war, he noted.
Awni Farsakh, a Palestinian researcher in the Arab Unity Studies Centre, said that peace has become the strategic option for the Arabs but the balances of power would not generate equal settlements. He pointed out that unequal settlements have always been nothing but pacification between the parties involved in the conflict that delays rather than ends it.
Amgad Gebreel, a Palestinian researcher, said that it is the Jerusalem issue that opens or closes the road before the other causes in the settlement between the Palestinian and Israeli parties because the Palestinians are determined to have full-fledged sovereignty over eastern Jerusalem. What we should do is to employ well the tools of power that we have and win international public opinion to our side to get legitimate Arab rights.
The right to return, the future of the occupied Jerusalem and Jewish settlements are three core issues to be negotiated in the third stage of the roadmap in question.
Now the question is: What will Abu Mazen say about the roadmap to the people of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, mostly living at refugee camps, after his ally and partner Sharon totally dropped the Palestinian refugees' right to return.
Today, the dropping of the right to return comes in compliance with Israeli demands on the grounds that it is an "unrealistic" right and menaces Israel's demography. Tomorrow, occupied Jerusalem will be conceded since Sharon vowed in his campaign to maintain Jerusalem as a single and eternal capital of the Hebrew state. The day after tomorrow, "openhanded" Palestinian negotiators will understand Israeli security considerations and accept some Jewish settlements!

Following the September 11th incidents, he managed to enhance such an alliance.
Tomorrow Sharon, for example, could order his army to evacuate some areas and stop assassinations. Will Abou Mazin, for instance, get Hamas and Jihad to take a decision to stop operations especially suicidal ones inside Israel?
Oil official sources told Al-Hayat that the Syrian Oil Ministry would conclude a 15-year contract for exploring and developing oil and gas northeast Syria with two American oil companies.
The compound 26 covers an area of 11 thousand kilometers that had been provided with an infrastructure for production, refinement, storage and transport which is currently used by the Syrian Oil Company to export oil via the Mediterranean ports in Baniyas and Tartus.

Al-Hayat got access to a memo submitted by 45 foreign airlines two weeks ago asking for urgent intervention to solve the difficult problems faced by those airlines.
A-Considerable sums will accumulate in those airlines accounts in the range of LE20 to 125 million in some cases, which is not proportionate in size with the aforementioned sums, the remittance of which could be tackled.
3-The memo broached the subject of the high rent of rented offices at airports where the only option for the airlines is acceptance on the pretext that it is usufruct which gives the owner party " Civil aviation" the right to decide the rents and the areas of those offices even though tourism in any country is a system where all the state bodies integrate through the decisions that each issue with a view to reaching balanced decisions that eventually serve public interests.
It hopes the biggest emphasis will be given to the issue of remittances. Should an approval be secured from the state banking institutions, of the remittances of 15% of the value of those assets in accounts (in any available currency), it would be a viable approach to solving most of the difficulties that negatively affect the airlines and impose a reconsideration of their operational policy which, in all likelihood, would reflect on the frequency of flights and a smaller size of aircraft type, which would lead to reconsidering the status of labour and pay due to the decline in the number of passengers they cater for and deal with Civil Aviation Law Airlines presidents criticized civil aviation law which has recently been referred to the parliament for endorsement.
The president of one of those airlines who refused to be identified, wondered how the decision of deregulating the rates of exchange was taken and the civil aviation law was discussed without sufficiently studying market conditions.
The airlines presidents emphasized that the crisis should not be blown out of its proper proportion, as the government should seek to solve it especially as the crisis effects extend abroad. The country can, therefore, seriously improve its image by convincing international institutions and companies of the importance of the decisions taken.

He said he was of the opinion that the party should not take part in any administration of that kind, which was under American supervision. He said he had informed his brothers inside Iraq of that position.
The common thing between us and the Americans now is this aim after whose achievement they are supposed to leave and let the Iraqis manage their own affairs. But, if they wanted to impose on Iraq their culture and policy, we would adopt another line.
"Violence is the last resort of the Muslim if he is beleaguered in an escapable way.

He said, "The American officials did not care to conceal their goals and ends behind their fierce campaign on the world of Arabs and Muslims, for which they built up hordes and state-of-the-art weapons and technology for the devastation of Muslims.
However, the nation on the level of peoples all this notwithstanding, never resigned to submission or abandon unity and identity as a means to achieve impregnability power and dignity. Nor did it fail to declare anger in support of the Palestinian, the Iraqi and the Afghan peoples and indignation about what is inflicted on oppressed Islamic peoples.

AUC: NUMBER OF BEARDED, VEILED STUDENTS DOUBLED
The securing of a place for prayer and the realization of the desire to raise the voice with the call for prayer (even without an amplifier) on the university campus did not necessitate noteworthy battles. Rather, this came as a natural result of the growth of the "Religious" university youth groups.
Director of Public Relations in the AUC, Nagwa Shuaib says "If security men see a veiled student, they have to drive her out of the university campus.
Radwa is one of four veiled girls facing the danger of being dismissed if they hold to wearing the face cover on the university campus.
The university was established for specific reasons that can not be achieved in light of the Islamic awakening.
We did not imagine the matter would develop to this degree.
The common denominator between all the religious, females and males, is their recognition of the key role played by the religious lessons and meetings of preachers in forming their Islamic awareness.
Muhannad, 21, one of the muezzins who lead their colleagues sometime in prayer sees that the American University has become closer to the status of the Egyptian society, "As money is no longer monopolized by a single class as was the case before".
Most of the interviewees met by Al-Hayat are unanimous that the performance of prayer and raising the voice with the summons for prayer in a university, even if it was an American one, on the land of an Islamic country is regarded as something natural.
The administration also seeks to break the same aspect, which dominated some of the clubs established under legitimate slogans such as the charitable action slogan, through the preparation of a working plan that ensures a balanced racial, religious, and gender representation inside clubs during the coming years.
He says, "In this case, opposition becomes extremism because prayer is performed in mosques and everything is done according to rules. So why does opposition take up the name of Islam?"
"Why do not we have a chapel to gather in?" wonders Riham, one of the signatories of a plea submitted by a number of Christian students demanding the establishment of a chapel on the university campus.
Anticipated American pressure (in respective to an Israeli request) to reopen the file of a Mossad agent has been forestalled by Egyptian authorities. They reemphasized that they had no intentions to release the spy detained 7 years ago even in the case of personal mediation by the American President George W. Bush.
In the last seven years, the Egyptian President has refused to respond to Israeli successive governments, let alone American Administration pressure to release Azzam.

Minister of Finance Dr. Medhat Hassanein surprised Egypt's people by announcing that selling part of the government property was being considered in an unprecedented bid to liquidate the people's property and announce the government inability to settle its debts.
Hassanein's estimates indicate that the government sources had dried up, which made it think of selling its property (the People's property), even government buildings, plots of land, etc.
There is a tendency to sell some of those assets and rent others.
These hints were made by IDF Chief of General Staff Moshe Ya'alon, who said that Israel would agree to enter a truce agreement with the Palestinian factions.
SHARM EL-SHEIKH...CCOMBATING "TERRORISM"
Yet, no Arab leader voiced any reservation about this point.
SAUDI BUSINESSMAN SPONSORS EDUCATION OF PALESTINIAN, ISRAELI STUDENTS IN LONDON
"Means of resolving disputes and effecting reconciliation between opponents come on top of the subjects that would be taught to those students in London," he said, pointing out that that would be a cornerstone in establishing a new community on the sidelines of the conflict, which loves life and deals flexibly with its challenges, thus making one care for having a discussion with the other in lieu of killing him.

He described the two summit meetings as the "summits of American dictation, where the American teacher, or master, President George Bush, gathered a number of heads of state to give them his orders." Sheikh Nasrullah commented that the stopped transmission from Sharm El Sheikh was caused not by a technical glitch, but rather by a desire to deny the peoples of Arab States the chance to hear George Bush's tone and the orders he gave to their leaders.
What actually happened at Sharm El Sheikh was somebody saying, 'Stop your support to terrorism, hold terrorist groups at bay and so and so, and we promise you that we'll discuss, negotiate and give, blah, blah, blah.'
He affirmed that the calls for Palestinian and Arab recognition of Israel as a Jewish state revealed a constant aspect of the doctrine of that Zionist entity, namely ethnic cleansing. "This is quite evident in the 'transfer' project, under which the Palestinians of 1948 would be deported.
Those who have supported the resistance in Lebanon and Palestine have never given it orders.
Moroccan political researcher Mohamed Darif said the Moroccan authorities are responsible for the expansion of the Jihad Salafi trend as they had employed it for facing the Islamic trend.
Some people argue that Morocco's case is becoming almost identical with the Algerian one.
Q: What about official dealing with the Islamic trends?
This is a reality created by preachers who consider their acts as a religious duty. We cannot link those preachers with organizations by any means.
Mixing Between Islamic Trends Q: There is a political and media mix-up against Islamists although all the Islamic organizations denounced the incidents.
I don't think that all the Islamic trends are primarily targeted. Nor do I think that such a campaign is directed, for instance, against Al-Adl Wal Ehsan (Justice and Charity) group.
Exaggerating the Islamic characteristics of the Justice and Development Party was a mistake. This means that the Islamists of the party had to realize an important fact; they are working in a country that bans the establishment of Islamic parties.
The Moroccan Justice and Development did not learn the lesson of the Turkish Justice and Development. Although the Turkish party attracted overwhelming Islamic majority in the elections that have nothing to do with the Moroccan party, it is not considered an Islamic party according to statements made by Turkish Prime Minister Recib Tayeb Ardogan on many occasions.
In Morocco, as in Mauritania, security clampdowns and media onslaughts are being staged on Islamists in the midst of the repercussions of the latest terrorist attack in Casablanca.
Contrary to the sympathy that the successive US administrations had shown towards political Islam over the past four decades on the ground of its being a spearhead of the efforts for undermining leftist and nationalist currents that had acted as a substantial ally to the former Soviet Union during the Cold War, the current American officials make no secret of their suspicions of any movements that follow an Islamic line.
Therefore, the antagonizing of moderate Islamic currents by Maghreb governments that have started new wars with these currents is a dead end that will only drain the strength of those who seek to work in the legitimate field and call for political participation, and will also give more strength to the hardliners, particularly as that current is being encouraged by the Americans, both covertly and overtly.
Under a law passed on Sunday by Qatari Prince Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Than the two bodies of "General Investigation" and "State Security Intelligence," were cancelled.

Local public debts hit 351.2 billion pounds, a hike of 21.4 billion pounds, in the first nine months of the elapsed fiscal year. They involve those debts of the government, economic authorities and the National Investment Bank.
The slump is due to the growing withdrawal of governmental assets from banks, and the continued rise in their debts to the NIB, hitting 49.4 billion pounds against 47.1 billion pounds in the same period last year.
He added that if such inflation of debt is continued the fund's financial position would be affected as it would be deprived of these sums' investment returns.

The foreign debt hiked by 31.6 million dollars during the aforementioned period to reach 28.7 billion dollars late last March.
Minister of Industry and Technological Development Dr. Ali Al-Saeedi said a comprehensive review of auto manufacturing in Egypt was of paramount importance because the Egyptian auto industry was mostly an assembling one under strict protectionist measures.

A report issued by the European Commissioner in Brussels stated that Egypt decided to backpedal on genetically modified produce case, thus implicitly indicating that Egypt backtracked on supporting the USA in its commercial dispute with the European Union (EU) in this regard.
It is noteworthy that a dispute was raised regarding the Egyptian stance towards the genetically modified products case between the ministry the Foreign Trade and the Foreign Ministry. It seemed that the former tends to support the US in its commercial dispute with the European Union. On the other hand, the Foreign Ministry preferred not to get Egypt involved in such a dispute.
The Egyptian delegation, under the chairmanship of Foreign Trade Minister Yousef Botrous Ghali, will propose to the European side the holding of consultations on the rules and arrangements governing the entry of the genetically engineered agricultural products into the EU countries to make use of the exportation of products accepted by the European market, the sources said.
This demand is due to the fact that it turned out that the European parliaments endorsement of the partnership agreement takes a long time that will extend until 2005, which requires Egypt to use the advantages of the commercial side pending endorsement through the phased agreement.
Ghali had discussed with Pascal Lami, the EU commercial delegate, during their meetings on the sidelines of Sharm El-Sheikh conference, the idea of a visit by an Egyptian technical team to Brussels to examine and finish this issue with the European Committee official before the start of the beginning of the next exportation season.
The conference seeks to achieve the desire of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership countries in implementing one of the most important goals of Barcelona process in 1995 in establishing a free trade zone in the Mediterranean basin by 2010.
Among the important issues to be raised by the Egyptian delegation headed by Minister of Foreign trade, Dr. Youssef Botrous Ghali with the European party participating in Balermo conference is Egypt's demand that the European Commissioner (EC) for trade hold consultations about the criteria and arrangements that govern access of genetically engineered agricultural products to the European Union to benefit from exporting products acceptable to the European market.
The issues to be raised by Egypt also include expediting the conclusion of the phased-in agreement with the European Union to implement the commercial side of the Egyptian-European partnership agreement so that the agreement might be valid by the beginning of next year and to ensure that the Egyptian exports, especially agricultural ones, enjoy the customs advantages provided for by the agreement.

Egyptian commercial office in Pretoria, South Africa, called on exporters to pay attention to the South African market, not to miss the chance of getting access to such market, and make use of the potentialities available there.
Egyptian exporters did not avail themselves of the depreciation of the pound against the dollar, a thing that should have been exploited by exporters to boost Egypt's exports in general and to South Africa in particular, the office added. It called on Egyptian companies that are keen on and interested in South Africa's market to support the Commercial Office's campaign for participating in the exhibition for Egyptian products, which will be set up in the second half of this year.

EGYPT-AFRICA TRADE HITS 560 MILLION U.S. DOLLARS
Obstacles impeding trade with Africa include transport, freight, lack of banks that are adept in deals, dearth of an all-out insurance system and control by Lebanese and Indian middlemen and agents on trade in Africa.

Exports of oil and its byproducts achieved a mammoth increase last March hitting 252.9 million dollars against 176 million dollars in February 2003.
The total deposits amounted to 379.4 billion pounds last February, the report said. Governmental deposits with the banking body other than the CBE hiked to 62.4 billion pounds last March against 50 billion pounds during the same period last year. The government deposits hit 62 billion pounds last February, it added. Non-governmental deposits with the banking body other than the CBE hiked to 321.7 billion pounds last March against 275 billion pounds during the same month last year.
However, such attempts did not succeed in curbing such an increase due to the different prices among various exhibits, not to mention the low quality of a large number of commodities and their non-availability in rural areas. This was considered by observers as a fiasco on part of the government to manage such a crisis.
Even though the government denies the price increase, the latest report by the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMS) recorded a 6.5% increase in the prices of food, drinks and cigarettes last May compared to the same month last year in urban areas.
The report averred that the main food commodities whose prices have increased are dried legumes, fresh vegetables, oils and fats. Meanwhile, fresh and dried fruits retreated in cities by 2.7%.

This came in a statement by Sherif Abdel-Khalek, member of Tenth of Ramadan City Investors Society.
The report, compiled by Ministry of Foreign Trade, declared that the Egyptian private sector obtained 2.7 billion dollars in addition to 692 million dollars from the Social Fund, i.e. 16% out of the $20 billion.

Deputy head and new general manager of Visa International-Egypt, Tarek Al-Husseini said that the value of expenditure through Visa cards exceeded the mark of one billion dollar late March last, 18% increase in comparison with 2001.
Al-Husseini pointed out the low number of Visa cards in Egypt in comparison with other Arab countries like Saudi Arabia and Jordan. The number of circulated cards in Egypt, whose population hit 70 million citizens, does not exceed 800 thousand cards, however the number of cards hit 1.5 million in Jordan, populated by 5 million citizens, of which Visa has around one million cards.
So most of the Egyptian people do not deal with banks as they depend on banknotes and other means like bartering for getting commodities and services.
Mona Yassin declined to uncover the names of those institutions, but just said they were Gulf institutions and that a meeting was going to be held in a few days' time to agree on the deal details and to task a certain consultant body to prepare a technical probe of the bank according to which a fair value of the share will be estimated.

The programme value amounts to $60 million and its beneficiaries comprise five banks: Misr International Bank, Commercial International Bank, Egyptian-American Bank, National Bank of Egypt and Export Development Bank.
Al-Alam Al-Youm learnt that the estimated budget of the bank relied on a number of basic axes including the sustenance of sharing up the Egyptian company for guaranteeing exports in order to play its role while ensuring its entire independence of the bank in a bid to avoid terms of reference conflicts. A strategy should be adopted aiming at preserving the bank's development role and its non-involvement in trading banks activities.

Cotton and sunflower oil production constituted some 81% of the total vegetable oil production in Egypt in 2000/2001, followed by palm oil, 10.9%; maize oil, 6% and soya beans oil, 1.6%.
Sunflower and cotton oil imports constituted 64% of the total vegetable oil imports in 2001 compared to 32% for palm oil and 3.2% for maize oil.
EGYPT HAS 14 MILLION POOR PEOPLE
Norway came first in the report, followed by Iceland, Sweden, Australia, the Netherlands, Belgium and the USA, while Sierra Leone, Niger and Burkina Faso were at the bottom.
Egypt has between 13 and 14 million poor people, reaching 20 percent of the country's population. There are notable imbalances in development levels between north and south Egypt, and even between townships and villages in the same governorate, the report showed.
The time wasted, estimated at 1.2 billion hours, in government offices costs ten billion pounds annually.
The field study unveiled that the number of employees skyrocketed from 441 thousand in 1951 to 5.5 million in 1998.
* The governmental body in Egypt inflated and largely expanded during the period from 1974 to 1985 which witnessed intensive calls for openness, using market mechanisms and abandoning planning.
Consequently, operation costs of the Interior Ministry increased. Thirdly, the legislative and statute frame, under which the governmental administration in Egypt works, went up to more than 24 thousand laws and statute decrees (presidential, prime ministerial and ministerial decrees), thus creating a state of chaos in the whole governmental administration and making it difficult to settle disputes between administrative bodies and citizens.
The study pointed out that the governmental sector provided services running into 728 services in 1999, of which 186 services are in the local administration, 201 for investors and 341 in the administrative and service bodies.
2. Fixed and semi-fixed storage assets such as office equipment, means of transport and durable and consumed effects, which hit some 21 billion pounds on 20/6/1999.
Oppressed public servants project such oppression on the public especially in local administration units where pay and incentives are meager.

28 minutes of work a day Agricultural economies professor and member of the specialized national councils Dr. Fawzi Halim confirms that an international report pointed out that the Egyptian worker works for only 28 minutes a day.
Generally speaking, the work in the government is valued by the number of employees rather than its quantity or quality.
Under the above heading, Sudanese writer and researcher Abdel-Wahhab El-Afandi who resides in London writes to say: Sharm El-Sheikh summit reminds us of another larger summit that was held in the same place in the summer of 1996 and was accompanied by larger hype.
The friendly governments also tumbled down mainly including the governments of Peres and his successor Ehud Barak in addition to Yasser Arafat who has become like Mullah Omar and Saddam Hussein but he can not move freely like those.
Some of these countries particularly Saudi Arabia gave credibility to these accusations when some Saudi figures announced new steps would be taken to fight terrorism after Riyadh attacks last month.
The whole matter is that these governments say truthfully that they had fought the people of violence before Washington fought them and suppressed their freedoms before this became an American demand. These governments essentially suppress every thought whether it advocated or opposed terrorism and muzzle every freedom of the pacifists and the people of violence alike.
Hopes related to this project should not be blown out of all proportion as it was tried before in Arab countries mainly including Iraq whose government combined both attributes as it was superior in the application of Arab suppression, which bans expression unless men of power allow, which was followed by the Israeli technique of mass punishment and mass displacement.
The Syrian regime, in turn, did not fall short of adopting the same superior techniques, but, unlike the Iraqi regime, it is proud that it had managed to eliminate terrorism, strengthen the pillars of the regime, and pass it down from one to another.
Politically, the Muslim Brotherhood Movement is still present as a political force, if not the first political force as is the case in Egypt. Other countries alleged they had eliminated political Islam but feared that their claims would be tested in free elections with their Islamist foes.
Terrorism is a modern international phenomenon that erupted in the West essentially and its roots date back to the presence of the modern state and its huge suppressive potential that no oppositionist can confront without terrorism.
He is a big American terrorist called Erik Roodwolf who committed a series of terrorist explosions mainly including Atlanta incident in 1996. He has been on the run for five years inside America itself, an achievement that he could not do unless he had partners and advocates inside his country.
DIMENSIONS OF U.S.-MIDDLE EAST PARTNERSHIP PROJECT
The project, therefore, has many implicit economic, political and cultural dimensions. At its economic dimension, the project is meant to have the Middle Eastern countries involved into inter- as well as trans-Arab partnership. Given the fact that this matter already exists among Arab countries through the free trade zones whose agreements were concluded in the last few years with countries including Iraq, Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen within the context of the "oil-for-food" programme, which has become ineffective following the downfall of the Iraqi regime, this will be inadequate or even undesirable according to the new American project. This is because President Bush wants to link the Arab economies in a new economic system, i.e. the Middle Eastern economy so as to ensure the partnership of the Hebrew state in it on the one hand and link such economies to the developments of the American economy on the other hand. This means that the Arab open-door economy policy will deal with two economic referentialities; an Israeli and an American. Both of them are based on the free economy and the new capitalism of the hegemonic globalization.
As for the U.S., the Arab partnership countries have no other alternative but to involve in the new American policy whose features were characterized following the September 11th incidents; the emergence of a new pre-emptive war theory, relinquishing any policy that is opposed to the new sole hegemony, the Arabs' integration with the U.S. partial policies concerning undermining terrorism and opening Arab security institutions to the U.S. security data bodies, uncovering financial capabilities, subjugating scientific cadres and suspending financial aid as far as extent the Arabs could comply with the political stands of Washington. So long as the situations in the region are so deteriorating in everything, their capabilities to bargain or oppose Israel and the U.S. are too weak to influence the movement of the partnership of this project. This means that they will be subject to the logic of power, hegemony of wealth and the centralization of values of those two parties.
The project looks at the values of the Arab partnership countries as marginal and peripheral referentialities that are meant to be subordinates. The national peculiar values of the Arab partnership countries will, therefore, be undermined as a prelude to cultural integration.
Second, Israel has to implement the "roadmap" and prove its good intentions towards the region's countries.
Martyr Ezz Eddin al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades claimed responsibility for killing an Israeli intelligence officer in Netanya Jewish settlement in Jenin, the West Bank, late Thursday.
Hundreds of Israelis expressed concern over threats by Hamas that it would step up its strikes against Israeli occupation forces wherever they are, and liquidate Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.
The comprehensive war plan that was announced by Israel on the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) was laid down months ago, said identical press sources, pointing out that the implementation was put off due to preoccupation with the "roadmap" and Aqaba conference.
The Israeli Army Radio quoted military informed sources as saying that the Israeli war would not be confined to targeting the movement leaders but rather include incursion into the depth of the West Bank and Gaza Strip amid expectations that Hebron would be on top of the targeted cities.
Israeli education minister called on Arab Israelis to emigrate to Syria. Addressing the Arab MPs in the Knesset, she said, "They (the Arabs) should understand that Israel is a Jewish state rather than a state for all citizens." She called upon them to leave for Syria.
According to mass media sources, over 50 Iraqi Jews, accompanied by their children had arrived in Baghdad coming from Israel for the first time since 1948.
Addressing the People's General Congress (Parliament), Libyan leader, Mummar Gaddafi called for the cancellation of the public sector as that sector needs people who are highly efficient, patriotic with a high moral sense and keenness on the interests of society.
IBN KHALDON CENTER EXPANDS ITS ACTIVITIES, CONCENTRATES ON DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS
In regard to the issue of democracy, Ibrahim saw most proposed initiatives as based on researches and stands he had presented to the center in the last years and, together with his companions, was tried for.
An Egyptian high-ranking delegation will head on Sunday for Gaza Strip to hold a chain of meetings with Hamas leaders to convince them of an Egyptian amended project to sign a conditional truce between the Palestinians and the Israelis to stop mutual violence for 6 months in order to render successful the effort exerted by Egypt and the U.S. to implement the roadmap.
Ebeid said that the per capita quota in the new budget hits 6.2 pounds daily. The government produces 200 million loaves of bread every day. There are 20 million students, including 15 million in pre-university stages and 5 million university ones, he said.
LAWSUIT, CAMPAIGN IN EGYPT: U.S. AMBASSADOR HAS BECOME REPRESENTATIVE OF TWO STATES
The plaintiff seemed to take care he would not be charged with developing personal attitudes against Welch. Addressing the ambassador, he said, "You're welcome as guest in Egypt and as a human being who should be given every respect and consideration. However, you aren't welcome here as an ambassador of America whose ambassador here has for years been regarded as an extension of the racist Israeli entity."
This was evident in the fars bela gawad (a Horseman without a Horse) serial and then in ayez hakki (I Want my Right) film. We'd like to ask you quite openly to stop your inquisitiveness and blatant interference in our internal affairs."
"We turn down the offer as it serves Israel's interests.
Dr. Sadd Eddin Ibrahim, chairman of the Ibn Khaldoun Center for Development Studies, a civil society organization, told U.S. officials at recent meetings with them in New York "Undemocratic regimes in the region hide behind the Palestinian issue and use it as an excuse to procrastinate democratic reforms." He added, "Regimes like the deposed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's regime spur radical fundamentalist movements to step up their activities, and force youths to resort to extremism." On his meetings with U.S. officials, especially U.S. National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, in his recent tour in the U.S., Ibrahim discussed with them American plans to bring democracy to the Middle East region, the future of Iraq and the Arab-Israeli conflict. In the meetings, he told the officials that the U.S. administration would not have to play a direct role in imposing democracy on others, advising them to give U.S. and Western NGOs the opportunity to coordinate common efforts with their Middle Eastern counterparts to carry out such an assignment instead.
Ibrahim said he had had a 2-hour meeting with members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, and held talks with Rice and assistant secretaries of state.
Concerning the role he played in the dialogue between the Muslim Brotherhood group and representatives from Western embassies in Cairo, Ibrahim said, "The dialogue was made upon a request from the Muslim Brotherhood through leading figures I met when I was still in pickup. The Europeans then welcomed it.
It is obvious for the whole nation, peoples and leaders alike, that no hopes can be pinned on any initiatives with this enemy who is intent on usurping right and land and goes to extremes in destroying every sign of life of our Palestinian people," the statement said.
In a statement, Hezbollah said, "This crime reflects the failure of betting on any commitment by Sharon government in anything related to the just cause of the Palestinian people whether under the name of 'roadmap' or any other proposals, which are a mere surrender to the American and Zionist schemes aiming at obliterating the Palestinian identity, attempting to avoid tackling Jerusalem as a central issue and canceling the right of the Palestinian refugees to return to their homes."
Gamal Mubarak will start his itinerary in Washington on June 26th by visiting the Centre of Strategic and International Studies in Washington as well as visiting a number of other centers specialized in Middle East and international issues as well as academics in American Harvard University.
Well-informed sources with the party pointed out that the visit aimed at intensifying the Egyptian presence in the USA through the NDP in particular. The Egyptian embassy in Washington prepared a full programme for Gamal Mubarak to introduce him to American public opinion, which requires urging People's Assembly deputies to pose questions about the source of financing such tours: is it the NDP or the government in the form of the Foreign Ministry?!
Gamal Mubark told reporters yesterday (June 10th) that these proposals would be mooted by the NDP Policy Secretariat to turn later on into recommendations and orientations for the party.
"During the last three years, bhang, rather than hashish, was ranked first in terms of drug taking," it pointed out.
JAMAA ISLAMIA IN EGYPT CHANGES COURSE, ADOPTS MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD'S BOOKS
He added, "The Group's shifts were not only academic but also methodological, which was prominently shown in its latest review books."
COPTS MARINES IN WATANI NEWSPAPER!
We have, first of all, to admit to the fact that there are problems that cannot reach the level of persecution at all, which is largely due to accumulations of sectarian practices throughout history, a diseased isolation and inclination to seek refuge in the Church thus creating the spectre of sectarian duality in the Egyptian society.
Is Egypt a sectarian society?
What then is the solution they are promoting?
An example to be cited in this regard is Saadeddin Ibrahim who was received in America as if he were a liberation leader like Mandela.
Such an extremist who lives in America works among the Egyptianized marines and writes for that newspaper (which falsely alleges that it represents the Church and Christians) in Al-Mahgar (Exodus) supplement, which means that he addresses Coptic expatriates to arouse their feelings and pave the way for the intervention of his American masters!
If so, why do you defend the Coptic epoch when it is overlooked under the pretext that is common property to all Egyptians without exception?
Did Islamic persecution at some epochs reach the level of that of the Romans when its era was called the era of martyrdom?
Little does he know either that senior advocates of nationalism were Christians.
Will American intervention in Egypt's affairs under the pretext of protecting the Copts through imposing the American agenda on the Egyptian government prove to be in favour of the Copts?
To what effect, which is another matter.
He asked the government to revitalize the file of indemnifications for the Egyptian resources looted by Israel during its occupation of Sinai in 1967, which reached $2 billion, saying that that figure could double at the present time as per the provisions of the Camp David peace accords. Abdel Alim expressed surprise at the Egyptian hushing up that file, not resorting to the International Court of Justice or blaming these violations on Israel.
He also urged Arab peoples to exercise a lot of pressure on Arab rulers and close in on the "usurping" Zionist entity together with preparing the nation for a bloody confrontation in defense of its presence, sanctities, security and freedoms.
"Moreover, the US trials to finish off the Palestinian cause through an endless series of negotiations, deals and the so-called political solutions under divers slogans and titles, including the roadmap, should also be met with abhorrence and rejection from our leaders as this is a historic duty," he opined.
WHAT DOES THE AMERICAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE DO?
The ambassador unfolded that Mohamed Mansour had financed a big number of the activities of the Future General Foundation headed by Gamal Mubarak besides chairing another society (LEAD), which works, in coordination with the Future General Fundation, with USAID.
Mansour uncovered that the visit delegation included 10 figures (5 Egyptians and 5 Americans) who presented, according to Mansour, the achievements of the reforms which had been demanded by Washington such as the passage of bank laws, intellectual property laws, Unified Work, besides the flotation of the pound (January 29th during Gamal Mubarak's first visit to Washington). They also presented the changes that took place in a number of major Egyptian banks.
It was commended by Israeli political and media milieus, but was blasted by many Palestinians.
Asked why there should not be a return visit to the Palestinian refugee camp of Jenin, he said: "Up till now, neither we nor leftists in Israel could affect the Israeli public opinion so the idea of the visit was developed.
However, the other members of the group declined to comment on the tour.
Statements issued on Friday by the Islamic Movement said the British-American invading forces adopt a plan to ban Muslims from reciting certain verses of the Quran which are related to jihad and some others that urge Muslims not to take the Christian as protectors.
The Information Committee of the Islamic Movement in Iraq issued a statement accusing the American-British invading forces of adopting a plan to prevent Muslims in Iraq from "reciting God's Book wholly in mosques and schools especially the jihad verses that expose the Jews and urge Muslims not to take the Christians as protectors," according to the statement of which a copy has reached Al-Quds Al-Arabi office.
The term "kabsalah," which has spilt over into Iraq and which means the taking of narcotic capsules, is no longer a banned term. Rather, it has become more common than any other terms. As soon as you see anyone lurching in the street people will inform you that he is bombed (Mekabsel).
The spread of this phenomenon pushed some Iraqi newspapers to sound the alarm of its dangers and future results that may turn the youths of the country into addicts together with the spread of anarchy. They called on the Americans to necessarily fight such a phenomenon the same way they fight Al-Qaeda Network all over the world. Muslim clergymen also warned and threatened drug-vendors to make their blood shed permissible if they continue selling them.
Al-Majalla published a study conducted exclusively by an expert in fundamentalist groups, Dr. Ref'at Sayed Ahmed running to the following effect: Since the departure of Saddam Hussein, Iraq has been living in an explicit political vacuum. Many political forces, especially the secularist ones and those that coordinated with the U.S. before the downfall of the Iraqi regime, tried to fill such vacuum but to no avail. The U.S. itself tried to fill this vacuum through Jay Garner plan, which was based on the visualizations of the Pentagon.
What about their future under the vague relations with the U.S. occupation forces and its demands in Iraq and the region?
1. The Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution, led by Mohamed Baker Al-Hakim 2.
Baghdad Scholars Group 7. Islamic Da'wa (call) Party 8.
Islamic Liberation Party, Abul-Hassan Al-Ansari 13.
Islamic Arab National United Movement, Dr. Ahmed Ebeid Al-Kobeisi 17.
Islamic Union of Kurdistan, founded in 1994 21.
Jond Al-Imam (Soldiers of Imam), a Shiite group 25.
A profound look into the reasons the diversity of such groups confirm that we are before a natural social output that came on the heels of long political repression and autocracy (35 years) practised by the former regime.
American equation There is a conflict between revolutionary Islam and the current American pressure on political Islam organizations.
The constant U.S. political attack at present at Iran, Hezbollah and Syria is meant to crumble away such semicircular resistance front before it is completed. The U.S. and its new general, Bremer, live now a moment of real anxiety and try hard to straighten it out whenever possible, but we think it will be to no avail. Foremost of such means is the continuous assault on Syria, Iran and Hezbollah. To this should probably be added the statements made by U.S. Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfel in Doha a month ago and by Congressman Tom Lantos (known for his pro-Israeli attitudes) a few days ago in Damascus moments after his meeting with the Syrian president in violation of all diplomatic etiquettes. His statements against Syria, Hezbollah and Palestinian factions together with the successive statements by the U.S. ambassador in Lebanon in which he called for disarming Hezbollah reflect the U.S. perplexity towards the escalating political vacuum in Iraq.
It is the duality of "religion" that can burst and change into a political banner in the face of the "world" when it is turned into a vital interest for the people.
In a nutshell, the Islamic organizations in Iraq have become a digit that cannot be cancelled from the equation of rule, administration and future of Iraq. Of course, as such a trend was a surprise to the U.S., it is also a complicated problem at present to the extent that we do not exaggerate if we say it is not so easy to solve, if not impossible. The story of political Islam with its current and upcoming complications is one of surprises and wonders of Iraq whose results we should wait for.
The Islamists decided in April last to take part in the elections, which they boycotted in 1997. Nonetheless, they stressed that they are going to reconsider that decision, if the government proved unserious in holding fair elections. This happened before they declared last month a 30-candidate list in the Kingdom's 45 constituencies.
He called upon the government to put an end to these practices, warning that the front would reconsider its stance towards participation in the elections.

FOUR SUGGESTIONS TO INCREASE FLOWER EXPORTS
The study compiled by the commercial representation, and submitted to Minister of Foreign Trade Dr Youssef Botrous Ghali, criticized the dearth of Egyptian flower exports that did not exceed neither 0.0003% of Dutch total imports nor 0.006% of Kenyan total flower exports to Holland, highlighting the fact that there is still a chance to increase our flower exports.
Thirdly, developing means of production by using modern technologies in the field of farming, irrigating, greenhouses and packaging in order to keep abreast with the successive developments in this field.
The government has ignored its promises to advertise for the appointment of 150 thousand graduates of the year 2001 and of the years preceding it as of July 1st.
The report emphasized certain negative points in the programme such as the exclusion of those who had been insured even for one day from candidature and some government bodies refused to admit those commissioned to work for it under the pretext of having certain statutes for nomination.
Egypt and the U.S. succeeded in overcoming "Zoellick crisis" as it was dubbed by economists, pertaining to U.S. commercial representative Robert Zoellick who triggered a crisis two weeks ago when he criticized Egypt. Last week, talks were held at a high-ranking level to determine the general framework of the free trade agreement whose talks are expected to start next month.
Cairo, therefore, will understand the whole situation and will not be hasty in judging things even if the same criticisms were launched by Bush himself, as the relation with the U.S. has many axes," he pointed out.
Egyptian experts said politicians' talk about the U.S.-Middle Eastern initiative seemed lukewarm versus the enthusiasm of businessmen and private sector.
400-MILLION-POUND EUROPEAN UNIVERSITY TO BE ESTABLISHED IN EGYPT
Once the sum reaches 30 million pounds, a company to be in charge of the university erection will be launched.
Meanwhile, Ministry of Education Undersecretary Gamal Hassan said a European university in Egypt could save hard currencies as the state spends around 2 billion US dollars on post-graduate study students dispatched abroad.
The EIB's participation in bankrolling oil projects in Egypt shows the international confidence in Egypt's investment atmosphere and economic, political and investment stability, said Petroleum Minister Sameh Fahmi.
The talks also broached the new exploration company that was approved by the Cabinet with capital of 300 million dollars, Fahmi said.

400 TEXTILE PLANTS THREATENED WITH CLOSURE
Deputy head of textile industries division with the federation Mohamed Al-Morshedi said that the problem lies in the fact that all yarn had been exported and farmers, moreover, did not grow enough cotton.

Yarn price increased from 600 to 1000 pounds per ton in less than one month, Al-Morshedi added.

There has been an unprecedented terrible hike in Egyptian imports.
On the other hand, exports were mainly in the sphere of traditional exports where Egypt enjoyed a relative advantage like petroleum products, raw cotton, textiles and yarns, while Egypt's exports declined in the sphere of aluminum, medicines and even books and newspapers from LE11 million to LE8.2 million.
Egypt is renowned for such kinds of minerals through its monuments spread worldwide. Thus, Egypt is qualified to be on top of the region countries in terms of exporting such kinds of minerals.
Egypt is also rich in raw materials used in building, foremost of which is limestone, which required for cement industry. Limestone extends along the two banks of the Nile from Cairo to Idfo, in addition to Suez Canal governorates and Alexandria. There is also gypsum with a reserve estimated at 20 million tons.

Investments in that development plan would reach 7 billion pounds, he said.
Legal measures were taken to transfer water systems management and maintenance to the private sector through water users associations.

INCREASE IN EGYPTIAN RICE EXPORTS TO EUROPE
JORDAN: FIRST FEMALE ISLAMIST CANDIDATE FOR PARLIAMENT
Asharq Al-Awsat interviewed Al-Masimi. The interview comes as follows:
A: I appreciate the government's standpoint in this regard as the government is entitled to verify the voter's identity. However, the government's condition to remove Niqab while voting may close in on a large number of female candidates and voters alike. It will be easier if the government appoint women in supervisory committees to verify identities of the veiled voters, or through allocating ballot boxes for women wearing Niqab.
And what if he refused?
Q: On what bases did the party field you in the elections?
Q: Who do support you and finance your electoral campaign?
Does this mean that rivalry will take place between Islamists in this constituency?
Q: What is your opinion about proposals regarding woman's obtaining an independent passport and children's making use of their mother's retirement salary?
A: My blueprint is based on constants and concepts of the Islamic movement rejecting normalization with the Zionist enemy, refusing peace treaties concluded with it and working to liberalize Palestine from the river to the sea in addition to meeting demands of Al-Zarqaa inhabitants, particularly intensifying health services, keeping the environment clean, curbing pollution and providing cultural and recreational centers.
Q: Are you the first female Islamist to run parliamentary elections in Jordan and the Arab world?

The AL Secretary General will submit a report to the coming summit regarding the proposals, ideas and a future plan of action reached by the committee. Furthermore, a committee of jurists, formed by the AL Secretary General, will be held to study the papers submitted by many Arab countries to develop the AL and Arab action mechanisms and formulate a unified project to be referred to the next summit as well.
Dr Al Qaradawi starts by saying, "Those who wish to know the good teachings brought by Islam to reform, renew and refine the rules of jihad and combat that had existed in older religions and nations only have to look at the contents of the current Torah, which Jews and Christians alike believe to be the Holy Book that God sent down to Moses.
Q: How does the Torah prescribe treatment for the peoples of the area called the Promised Land?
In fact, because the Children of Israel failed to completely eliminate those evil peoples as instructed by God, they have always suffered persecution, bloodshed and destruction, more than what they would have suffered if they had obeyed the commands of God before everything else." Where do these teachings of the Torah stand in relation to the teaching of the Holy Quran?
Q: How does the Holy Quran treat this point? A: There is a big difference between these teachings and what the Holy Quran says: "Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress limits; for Allah loves not transgressors.
A: In his book "Izharul Haqq" (unveiling right), Indian writer Sheikh Rahmatullah, quoted stories from the Torah, or the Old Testament, about the genocide committed by the Prophets of Israel, telling of most horrendous things. In Exodus 32, 25 onwards, the Torah says on worshiping the Golden Calf: "Moses saw that Aaron had let the people get out of control and make fools of themselves in front of their enemies.
He also took a large amount of loot from the city and put its people to work with saws, iron hoes, and iron axes, and forced them to work at making bricks. He did the same to the people of all the other towns of Ammon. Then he and his men returned to Jerusalem." These words were taken verbatim from the Arabic translation of the Torah that was printed in 1831-1844.
Now that the Middle East region has a bad reputation regarding human rights and physical torture, the public opinion should be allowed to play a role to resolve this issue in a drastic way and through democratic principles, he argued.
But, my personal purpose is something else."
In an interview with Asharq Al-Awsat, Ismail pointed out Khartoum's readiness to consider the US request if it was proven that Hamas is practicing non-political activity in the country.
US CONFERENCE TO REFORM ARAB JUDICIAL SYSTEM

NEWLY ELECTED JORDANIAN ISLAMIC MPs SET PRIORITIES IN NEW PARLIAMENT
Observers regarded that "the Islamic priorities in the parliament constitute difficult conditions for granting confidence to any coming government." The Islamists are likely to enter into an alliance with independent Islamists and opposition members to make up anti-government front.
The Islamic deputies have won over 139,000 votes in the recent vote against around 81,000 votes in the 1997 balloting, a hike of around 40,000 votes, he said. This showed that the front enjoys a large-scale popularity and credibility, he said, noting that if free and fair elections are held, the Islamists will win an easy sweeping victory.
Glimpsing the Islamists' current elections campaigns, one can notice soft-worded Islamic slogans devoid of calling for the Islamization of the society. Other public issues emerged such as fighting election bribes, criticizing the government performance and some service-related topics like the employment problem, housing services and the government loans to citizens.
The spread of devoutness among Kuwaitis together with their sympathy with the Islamic concepts in general are the main resource of the Islamist candidates.
An example for the big difference among the Islamists was what happened between the "Constitutional Movement" and Salafi Minister of Wakfs (Islamic endowments) Ahmed Baqer who refused two weeks ago to renew the term of office of the ministry's Undersecretary Abdel-Aziz Abdel-Ghafour, who is considered member of the Movement because it turned down a demand (by Baqer) to withdraw its candidate Dr. Hamad Mater who contests the elections against Baqer at Al-Qadissiya constituency.
The Movement also has 16 candidates in the current elections. Half of them have reasonable opportunities for winning the elections.
The traditional Salafi deputies are accused of being subordinates to the government, especially after Baqer had been appointed as minister and clashed with the Islamic Constitutional Movement. After MP Al-De'eij had supported the government in most issues that were put up in the parliament, especially as far as interpellating former minister of finance Dr. Youssef Al-Ibrahim was concerned.
IRAQIS SHOULD SPEED UP!
For a sound Iraq, such an incident means support and distribution of roles called by some Westerners "offering an alternative for the rest of the Middle Eastern countries."
First: Because Iran, in this case, will have got rid of its despotic regime in its own right and will have not been, consequently, beholden to the Americans, (in fact the American way of interfering in the Iranian affairs may impede such a change).
There are institutions to some degree.
Many Shiites and Sunnis of Iraq, which went through a political nihilism, want to plunge into the quagmire that will be left by Iran.
Therefore, the strategic and economic roles linked by some observers to the U.S. occupation of Iraq can be secured through Iran with taking barefaced pro-Israeli stands.
Furthermore, the calls that ask for giving much heed to Iraq are ebbing away. Those who did not pay attention to Afghanistan after liberating it from Taliban may be encouraged to apply their policies in Kabul to Baghdad (especially if the U.S. sustained more killings).
President Mubarak urged young people to work hard to earn a livelihood, as government departments would not provide jobs for every citizen or appoint them in offices.
Egypt decided to participate in the economic forum slated to be held in the Jordanian capital of Amman during the period from 20th to 23rd of the current month in spite of Israel's participation in this forum and the deadlocked peace process.
Cairo was intent on not participating in the forum due to the deadlock of peace process and Israel's unchanged situation and policies towards the peace process, while another team called for the necessity of Egypt's participation in the forum by a limited number of representatives to satisfy Jordan whose king officially invited President Hosni Mubarak to attend the forum.
The delegation will start its 5-day visit on 23rd June. It will arrive in Washington on 24th June to resume its activities on the following day.
The third axis is represented in participating in symposiums and forums with a number of intellectual and political institutions and research centers that have a big role in the US decision making.
The conference would be organized by the National Council for Childhood and Motherhood in conjunction with "the Italian Association for Women in Development (AIDoS)", the Italian "no peace without justice" organization and the Egyptian association for Preventing Harmful Practices against Women's and Children's Health the health of woman and child from harm practices.

Secretary general of the Front Hamza Mansour attributed the low Islamic representation in the parliament to governmental measures that targeted the 30 Islamist candidates in all constituencies.

Leftist and nationalist opposition parties, united in the "National Democratic Trend", failed to win even one seat as its list, which comprised 13 candidates, suffered a crushing defeat in the elections.
AMERICAN FORCES IN IRAQ BUILD ESPIONAGE BASE NEAR SYRIA'S BORDERS
The correspondent pointed out that should the need arise for any further forces, the Northern region command would ask for reinforcements from the military units in Tikrit to the South of Kirkuk.
The reality on the ground has uncovered genuine obstacles that were simply unthinkable and have, therefore, surprised the White House leaders. This was especially so due to the rapid rise of the Iraqi armed resistance against the American forces inflicting on them a loss of one death per day, synchronizing with popular uprisings in some cities where the arbitrary occupation measures have added fuel to the fire.
So far, the new administration under Bremer has fared no better than its predecessor. The new administrator has failed to find Iraqi facades to run Iraq's affairs, together with the occupation authority. He had to put off holding the Iraqi National Congress sine die and decided to nominate an advisory council to assist him in ruling Iraq instead of forming a government following Washington's failure to find an Iraqi Karzai!
Since it was officially announced that Iraq had been occupied, hardly a day passes without some military operations against the American forces claiming deaths and casualties in their ranks. Such daily escalating military operations have coincided with a popular uprising in some cities, which suggests that the Iraqi resistance is on the threshold of an armed popular revolution, a stage which used to take occupied countries years to reach (although some people think that this talk is still untimely or premature).
- The size of popular participation in protests staged against occupation because of the dissolution of the state apparatus and causing millions of Iraqis to lose their jobs and enter the circle of poverty.
KUWAIT: RULING FAMILY REFORM FOCUS OF ELECTION RALLIES
The fact that the ailing Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdullah al-Sobah still delegates his first deputy and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sobah al-Ahmed to act as a premier was one of the main ruling house questions that should be addressed, with some having viewed it as a stumbling block to a more harmonious government.

It is experiencing a critical time that requires consistency and unity so that problems can be solved judiciously and deliberately."
Spanish prime minister said on Sunday that the world would be safer after overthrowing the Iraqi regime. However, facts confirm the opposite of such statements whether inside Iraq or in the neighbouring area.
Such missiles target Lebanon's stability and security as well as the freedom of expression that started to reemerge gradually.
The dictatorship of the former Iraqi regime, together with its violation of human rights, is indisputable. However, the price that is being and will be paid by the region due to the U.S. military interference is too exorbitant.
Sudanese President Omar Bashir ripped opposition leaders to shreds and accused them of relinquishing their religion.
He expressed his happiness for signing an agreement in Cairo between head of Nation Party Al-Sadeq Al-Mahdi, head of the Unionist Democratic Party Mohamed Othman Al-Merghani and head of the Sudan Popular Liberation Movement (SPLM) John Garang.

He also expressed his happiness for signing another agreement was considered in London between Garang and the Popular Congress Party headed by Dr. Hassan Al-Turabi.
"We want to confirm that this is a war against sharia. I just want to expiate my sins and meet my God as a martyr." Bashir disclosed that he refused to be director of ex-president Gaafar Numeiri's office prior to applying sharia in 1983. However, he desired to be a bodyguard to Numeiri when the latter applied sharia.
Nevertheless, he said the hindrances facing the peace process cannot end up talks and peace endeavours, emphasizing his government's keenness to put an end to war, effect peace and achieve unity obediently.
This system is considered an important qualitative leap in the history of the Saudi capital market. It aims at restructuring it with a view to gaining confidence therein in a way that ensures more transparency and protection for clients.
The system concentrates on the importance of transparency, provision of data and dealing with the issues of fraud and circulation according to internal information, as such works are banned on the market such as the dummy transactions that do not lead to real transference of securities' ownership with the target of affecting the prices of circulated securities, thus doing harm to both market and dealers.

Polish minister of economy paid a special visit to Israel early this week for the same purpose, while Israeli minister of trade and industry tries to get a reasonable quota of Iraqi projects.
However, thousands of simple Cairenes wished to be released from the embassy's captivity as they were besieged in the capital's streets which had been closed to them so much so that they had to stay inside their cars unable to reach their destinations! Their capital was suffocating and traffic came to a halt.
The liberty, human rights and democracy enjoyed by America and which are hoped to be enjoyed by America's friends were not won dirt cheap.
Artist Libliba, however, attended the festival and her dress caught everybody's eyes. In the small hours of the night, thousands of Egyptians were still in their cars unable to go back home, but wistfully glancing at the green-plate diplomatic cars which belonged to diplomats or the elite getting out of the embassy through the roads that were vacant of curious eyes!

The mediators made up their minds to give the southerners one third of power with Garang being the only vice-president of Omar Al-Bashir and the SPLA ruling the South.
As for the nationalism of the capital, the paper proposed that non-Muslims will be excluded from being subject to Islamic laws.
Al-Assad's remarks came following his meeting with UN peace coordinator in the Middle East Terje Roed Larsen on Tuesday.
Syria has some reservations as far as the roadmap is concerned and these reservations were based on the exclusion of the Syrian and Lebanese courses. For his part, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq Al-Shar'a said, "Even if the roadmap includes both courses, it marginalizes them and this is not acceptable at all".
Iraq's top US civil administrator Paul Bremer is trying to pacify Iraqi clans through organizing tours to meet clan leaders and tribe chiefs and enjoy their hospitality and food.
Even though Bremer was keen on showing understanding of domestic customs, he made an error. After Beni Hassan clans' chief gave a speech recalling to memory the clan's role in the establishment of modern Iraq, Bremer thought he could pacify the audience by assuming the role of the friend rather than the occupier.
He added, "Regarding intermarriage, you are a Christian, which would not allow you to marry any of our women.
RESISTANCE FOR THE SAKE OF SADDAM!
However, the state in pre-war and postwar Iraq is not subject to the logic of international laws as much as sovereignty, self-determination right and compliance with international conventions are concerned.
Reconstruction of Iraq, installing a legitimate government and spreading democratic ideas would be shrouded in mystery and talk about liquidating resistance pockets in the restive country would come to the surface.
The Iraqis, on the other hand, might be seething against remnants of the ousted regime instead of asking questions about the future of their country.
Under this headline, Egyptian assistant Foreign Minister Dr. Abdullah Al Ashaal wrote an article which ran to the following effect: It was hardly difficult for anybody during the American campaign on Afghanistan to see that Israel has got its own general scheme to destroy the Islamic world.
Israel's second aspect emerged in the form of strategic alliance with India in a bid to back India in keeping down Kashmir's Muslims, exterminating the resistance movement there and transferring Israeli expertise in repressing the Palestinians to India.
The second time was when Washington decided to eliminate the Taliban regime in Afghanistan in 2001, which was, in fact, part of an American wider vision in Asia and the Middle East.
The third goal is undoing that link between Pakistan and the Arab world, tearing the Islamic world apart and watering down the Islamic character of the state, which has turned into an international American policy practiced against Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Indonesia and others.
The fifth goal is depriving Pakistan of its nuclear capabilities, scientists and scientific base by tantalizing it and tempting it to take the bait. It would be given to understand that the nuclear bomb was linked to its confrontation with India, and would be superfluous once that confrontation was over. Development, after all, together with a reformulation of society would be a much worthier task!
It may be wondered why Pakistan should not establish diplomatic relations with Israel so long as that was in its interest according to Pakistani leaders just as Arab leaderships in Egypt and Jordan etc, saw such relations are important, without Pakistan minding?
We think that Israel will manage to establish diplomatic relations with Pakistan and other countries. It may also manage to implement its scheme and achieve its five goals we mentioned above while the Arab world looks quite non-chalantly.
US SHIFTS AMBITIONS TO AFRICA
The Pentagon's plan includes plane refueling agreements with countries like Senegal and Uganda, the paper added. However, US military sources were quoted as saying that the blueprint did not envision permanent military bases in Africa.
It is noteworthy that the Egyptian embassy used to give that party on the occasion of July 23rd and to invite most Israeli political leaders every year. The number of those invited in the last years has amounted to about 3000 personalities including hundreds of Arabs (1948 Palestinians). The embassy cancelled that party last year due to the Israeli sweep of the Palestinian cities. Asharq Al-Awsat learnt that the Egyptian embassy in Tel Aviv had cancelled the regular reception party organized every year to mark the anniversary of the July 23rd, 1952 Revolution.
In spite of some violation of the agreement by some individuals, the general trend is committed to the truce.
The number of those invited in the last years has amounted to about 3000 personalities including hundreds of Arabs (1948 Palestinians).
In his petition, Ramadan said the Egyptian natural gas is owned by all the Egyptian people. Consequently, the property of the Egyptian people cannot be disposed of by any means, according to the constitution unless they give their consent, especially as Israel can make use of the gas pipeline project later on.
Therefore, it would be unfair to expect that Egyptian educational services would equal those provided by other countries as each service would have to have a cost. The Minister of Education added that the basic education budget in Egypt had hit LE5.23 billion and is steadyily increase annually as education has come to be a national security requirement. He emphasized that the Ministry had carried out plans for training teachers. Egyptian Minister of Education Dr. Hussein Kamel Baha'eddin said that Egypt spends 1% of the expenditure of other states on basic education.
Since the outbreak of the crisis and a concomitant series of civil wars between northerners and southerners, which have so far claimed over 1.5 million lives and displaced 5 million others, the warring parties have been hurling accusations at each other, with the southerners labeling the northerners as "persecutors" and the latter designating the former as "insurgents".
Such impressive steps are an integral part of other steps enshrined in the recent initiative made by the Inter-Governmental Authority for Development (IGAD) at a meeting held in the Kenya city of Nakoru early July, involving two governments in north and south Sudan during the pre-self-determination transition, which is not intrinsically rejectable, he added. During the transitional period, a local government should run southern affairs in the central governmental framework.
The Sudan is facing a major conspiracy, he said.
On meeting the university official, he refused to utter a word unless he was given the sum by President George Bush.
Al-Azhar scholars confirmed that these researches and confabulations on religious discourse are a kind of ignorance and an invitation to "liberate" Muslims from Islam, adjusting religious education according to the American vision and revoking jurisprudence heritage, Sunna and Prophet's traditions.
Ministry of Local Development is considering the possibility of establishing an integrated city for arts and traditional crafts with a view to preparing new generations of technically qualified youths to work in its different activities, in addition to developing its productive systems so that its products could compete on foreign markets.
300 THOUSAND EGYPTIANS JOIN UNEMPLOYMENT QUEUE ANNUALLY
However, the statements of Dr Atef Ebeid, Egyptian Prime Minister, and his cabinet members are still optimistic and speak about that hardly anybody can detect achievements on the ground.
The category of businessmen is meagre as it hits less than 1.5% and is inclined to take risk or saving. The majority of its elements seek quick profitable activities such as real estate trade and fleeing with bank funds. This means that the value this category adds to the Egyptian economy is meagre and insignificant as its work in industry and productive activities is very weak.
Dr Ahmad Geweili, secretary general of the Arab Economic Unity Council said, "There is no difference between all previous periods in planning. Over half a century the key factor for planning was that the state was strong in terms of authority, policy and potential and would intervene at the appropriate time.
Dr Mansour Meghawri, expert with the Egyptian National Center for Sociological and Criminological Research discussed the effect of social changes in Egypt over the last half century on the workers in the agricultural sector which represent 27% of the total workforce.
The time wasted, estimated at 1.2 billion hours, in government offices costs ten billion pounds annually.
The field study unveiled that the number of employees skyrocketed from 441 thousand in 1951 to 5.5 million in 1998.
* The governmental body in Egypt inflated and largely expanded during the period from 1974 to 1985 which witnessed intensive calls for openness, using market mechanisms and abandoning planning.
Consequently, operation costs of the Interior Ministry increased. Thirdly, the legislative and statute frame, under which the governmental administration in Egypt works, went up to more than 24 thousand laws and statute decrees (presidential, prime ministerial and ministerial decrees), thus creating a state of chaos in the whole governmental administration and making it difficult to settle disputes between administrative bodies and citizens.
The study pointed out that the governmental sector provided services running into 728 services in 1999, of which 186 services are in the local administration, 201 for investors and 341 in the administrative and service bodies.
2. Fixed and semi-fixed storage assets such as office equipment, means of transport and durable and consumed effects, which hit some 21 billion pounds on 20/6/1999.
Oppressed public servants project such oppression on the public especially in local administration units where pay and incentives are meager.
The annual office hours stood at 1560 hours for every employee and the time wasted constitutes half of these hours.
28 minutes of work a day Agricultural economies professor and member of the specialized national councils Dr. Fawzi Halim confirms that an international report pointed out that the Egyptian worker works for only 28 minutes a day.
Generally speaking, the work in the government is valued by the number of employees rather than its quantity or quality.
Muslim Brotherhood General Guide Counsellor Mamoun Al Hudhaibi emphasized that Jihad sacrificing property and self is an obligation on Muslims to restore and liberate the land and to avenge honour and for the return of a Muslim Arab people to all their territories and homes, and to achieve security and freedom for Arab and Islamic peoples.
Al-Hudhabi showed understanding of Hamas' decision to suspend its operations against the Israelis as that could avert internecine strife among the Palestinians. He added that he was convinced that the American policy, through its various schemes, aims only at "anaesthetizing" minds on the Arab and Islamic arena to facilitate cutting off heads and necks, liquidating the Palestinian cause, gobbling Palestinian lands and moving from the stage of the state to the stage of a national home.
JAMAA ISLAMIA PROHIBITS HARMING MUSLIMS
Sho'aib was one of the defendants of the "Jihad" case in 1981 which was examined by a civil court in parallel with late president Sadat assassination case. He uncovered that members of the Jamaa Islamia who were sentenced to capital punishment also supported the peaceful attitude even when they were on their way to execution.
Among the candidates are Al-Wafd Party leader No'man Gomaa, Tagamo'h (Grouping) Party Secretary-General Refaat Al-Said, Bar Association head Sameh Ashour, Fawzeya Abdel-Sattar, former chairwoman of the parliament's Legislative Committee and renowned academician Mona Makram Ebeid.
It is the president of the republic who will appoint the council chairman and his deputy, who will remain in office for three years, as per article 2 of the law. The council will include several committees of civil, political, social, economic and cultural rights, legislative affairs and international relations.
Press circles in Cairo nominated Salah Montaser for the position of the chief of Journalists succeeding Nafi'e who officially apologized for not contesting the coming election. The sources linked between the government nomination of Montaser and the desire for settling the argument about the person who will succeed Nafi'e's position in the new round in a clear indication to avoiding conflict with any party in the competition circle, if any.
A cooperation agreement has been inked between Egypt's National Council for Women (NCW) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) on establishing a new center aiming to qualify Egypt's women to have a political participation.
The UNDP commended the "distinguished" results made by the NCW in the previous agreement, spurring it to show willingness to pursue bilateral cooperation for a further two years, she said. The NCW seeks to shore up positive points in the coming stage by drawing upon previous experiments.
Members of the Syndicate called for pressurizing the government to put a stop to receivership.
For his part, former secretary general of the Syndicate Mohamed Al-Samman said the legal council made seven trials in the period between 1993 and 1995, when the receivership was imposed, to hold elections but no date was set for this very purpose.
Egypt was preceded by several developing countries in the development area, which included health, education and income levels, the report said.
Illiteracy is still high at 44 percent; over 56 percent among women, it said.
Efforts should be exerted in order to alleviate sufferings at the economic level. The present-day economic deflation has been triggered by the 1997 Luxor terrorist massacre, the September 11th events and lastly the Iraq war.
The committee, moreover, asked the secretariat of the meetings to prepare a report on the Palestinian archeological and cultural sites in the occupied territories, he said, noting that the Israeli project aimed at playing a regional role in the UNESCO's International Heritage Committee and attributing Arab and Egyptian opposition to that role to Israeli heinous practices in the occupied territories and Israel's violation of the committee's regulations and agreements banning destruction of archeological sites.
The sources recalled to memory the promise made by former US President Bill Clinton during the signing ceremony of Wye Plantation Agreement six years ago when he promised Polard would be released and then broke his promise.
The Lebanese capital city of Beirut has received more than one signal indicating that Israel is starting to wage a war against Lebanon under the pretext of obtaining some Lebanese water.
The proposal angered the Lebanese hosts, to the extent that Prime Minister Hariri countered to Issa's statements by saying that Lebanon needed all its water and had been unable to make use of it as it was supposed to because of reasons related to the country's poor capabilities for building dams and the size of the operations required for pumping water to high mountain areas, particularly to the villages of southern Lebanon.
Perhaps the thing that alarmed the Lebanese most was the timing of Fischer's declarations, which coincided with the world Economic Forum that was held in Jordan, making some interpret them as clear signals that go beyond the limits of mere proposals by either Issa or Fischer and could be reflections of actual intentions that had begun to impose themselves with apparent Israeli pressure. Some other countries may also pressure Lebanon within the context of the schemes concocted for this region, so as to force Beirut to accept these plans, with Israel eventually landing a part of Lebanon's water.
This is a new battle that the Lebanese will fight. According to Lebanese officials, Lebanon will fight a fierce war that may not be easy under the prevalent conditions in the Middle East. Anyway, the statements that try to promote the principle of Israel's control of part of Lebanon's water under the conditions that prevail in the region at present must not be taken lightly.
He added that international agreements and treaties regulating water distribution banned transporting water outside the rivers basins and prevents any country where the river does not pass from getting water from it.
Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) stressed its commitment to the truce it declared jointly with the Islamic Jihad Movement on 29th June last.
"We told them (the delegation) that we will bear and seek patience, but our patience has limits," said Yassin, in a threatening indication that the movement may resume its commando operations against the Hebrew state which procrastinates the POWs issue.
The sources added that the aim of the visit is to firm up the armistice initiative declared by five factions so far, namely Fatah, Democratic Front, popular resistance committees, Hamas and Jihad.
Eyewitnesses told Al-Hayat that workers of Gaza municipality, accompanied by scores of policemen, spread in the main streets of Gaza city yesterday (6th July) and started to paint the walls of installations and houses in white to cover the graffiti written by activists of Palestinian resistance factions and political parties who used bright colours or their official colours.
It is worth mentioning that different Palestinian factions used the walls as 'wall magazines to inscribe graffiti on neatly or sometimes in bad handwriting. Such graffiti used to declare the stances, slogans, declarations and activities of different factions.
The story starts when Gordon invited a group of Saudi figures, including Dr. Abdel-Rahman Al-Tawaijeri, Osama Al-Kurdi and Hisham Ali Hafez (well-known publisher and writer) to a dinner party to discuss developments in the Arab countries in general and in Saudi Arabia in particular.
Some of the attendance, who were shocked by the surprise, believed that the U.S. ambassador might be drunk, but this surprise vanished when Gordon repeated the same words again in another dinner party.
Well-informed persons in Saudi Arabia emphasize that the ruling family is unanimous that Prince Sultan will be the coming crown prince.
Saudi forums talk about many other candidates. Some put up Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal. However, although he is a highly qualified figure and has experience in Arab and international fields which he gained from his position over a quarter of a century, he suffers from pains in his spinal column.
An expert in the Saudi affairs told Al-Quds Al-Arabi that it is wrong to exclude King Fahd's sons from the competition over this position.
Minister of Culture Farouk Hosni challenged an American Jewish organization to prove that an anti-Semitic book had been issued through the Reading For All popular books series, which are issued by the Egyptian Culture Ministry and sponsored by Egypts first lady Suzanne Mubarak.
MP ATTACKS USA TRAINING NEW ADMINISTRATIVE LEADERS
He, moreover, pointed out that the USA had financed the first conference for Egyptian leaderships that was held in Ain Sukhna on 19th June. The conference, in which American Ambassador to Egypt David Welch participated, included leaderships of both public and private sectors.
Guarantees will be provided to protect those leaders against any harassment to make sure that the march of reform and human development is forging ahead, especially as the experiment is still at its beginning, Abu Amer noted.
Addressing a meeting yesterday, Al-Sherif emphasized that the annual congress of the ruling NDP slated for 27-28 September next, under the chairmanship of President Husni Mubarak, will be held to follow-up the performance of the party.
The presidential advisor made it certain that America is a "pivotal country at the international level," considering maintaining a dialogue with it necessary. He added that this does not mean to submit to American desires.
He added, "The wrong notion that was put forward by some American milieus is that American democracy is the system that must be applied worldwide, neglecting the special circumstances of every state."
This bilateral agreement was signed without fanfare, within the context of the rush to jump on the American bandwagon and the diplomatic bids by many countries to be nice to the Sole Superpower in the wake of the Iraq campaign.
Given the large-scale American military adventures that are based on preemptive strikes, the United States has threatened to halt its military and economic assistance programs, thus resorting to arm-twisting to realize its objectives.
Needless to say that the United States, under the Bush Administration, does not want a permanent international justice system to be established, for it encourages the creation of selective justice that protects American nationals from prosecution, which Israel has been trying to copy and has already succeeded in doing, as the Belgium example has shown.
Poverty is one of the most dangerous problems that face the Egyptian society, said professor of International Relations Mohamed Saad Abu Amoud. According to the World Bank Report early this year on poverty in Egypt during 1995-2000, Abu Amoud added, poverty rate retreated from 20% to 17%. This means that there are 11 million Egyptian nationals suffering from poverty including 7 millions in Upper Egypt only.
Professor Abu Amoud stressed that Egypts resources had been corroded in the last years and that a big fortune was lost through money investment companies. In addition, shareholders in companies and investment funds sustained heavy losses after speculating in the stock exchange, no to mention the escape of a large number of businessmen with banks funds, which are estimated at 37-53 billion pounds.
Charge daffaires of the consul in Alexandria and chief of the Center told the embassy two days ago that she hit upon a powder suspected to be a harmful chemical substance, something that worried the ambassador and the missions members.
CAIRO LINKS IMPROVEMENT OF RELATIONS WITH TEHRAN TO HANDING OVER WANTED ELEMENTS
Egyptian-Iranian relations are expected to witness great improvement that may include full resumption of diplomatic relations in case the current contacts resulted in handing over the fundamentalists, who are detained in a prison in Tehran, to the Egyptian authorities, the sources said.
Minister of Wakfs, Dr. Mahmoud Zakzouk said that this years plan included holding seminars and open dialogues aiming at correcting faulty ideas and upgrading the intellectual cultural and religious standard of youth. It also included intellectual caravans that pay visits to 654 youth centers and summer clubs in all governorates of Egypt. They will be made by two scholars: one from the Ministry of Wakfs and the other an Azharite preacher who is a university professor.
He added that football drains enormous sums of money that must be made use of in order to restore Egypts status on the regional and international levels in that sphere through winning championships.
Yesterday (2nd July), Iraqi sources uncovered that there are Israeli officers and soldiers in North Iraq under the pretext of training the Kurdish Peshmarga forces of Masoud Barzani, head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party.
The sources added that the Israeli military, including paratroopers, trained the Peshmarga forces before the war within the framework of planning for military operations against the Iraqi army.
BY FORCE Israeli Internal Security Minister defended an Israeli police decree allowing non-Muslims Jews and foreign tourists to enter the campuses of the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque. He threatened to re-open the holy shrine to all by force and without waiting for the approval of the occupied citys Department of Islamic Wakfs.
It is noteworthy that Islamic Wakfs Department had decided to close the shrines gates after Sharons provocative visit and the concomitant massacre committed by the occupation forces against worshippers, which signaled the outbreak of the uprising on September 29th 2000.
The Palestinians, who hold Iraqi travel documents and reside in Al-Rawaished refugee camp affiliated to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), recently refused an American offer with respect to their returning to Iraq in return for buildings and compensationd for them, Palestinian sources mentioned.
CATHOLICS REPRESENTATIVE: NO NEED TO OPEN CHURCH IN SAUDI ARABIA
Qatar was the last Gulf state to allow the establishment of churches, while the first country was the United Arab Emirates (UAE), establishing the first church in 1965. There are 8 churches in the UAE now.
Islah took part in the parliamentary elections held last April in an attempt to form a government. Surprisingly, it won by a majority in the constituencies of the capital Sanaa, which was unexpected even by optimists as the bet was always on remote villages and provinces.
Generally speaking, the Islamic movement in Yemen, like any other political faction, was practising its activities clandestinely for many years and was not accused in the process of adopting any violent actions.
It is true that we took up arms in the early 1980s (1981-1982) in the face of the communist expansion in the northern Yemeni provinces, but we were fighting side by side with the Yemeni Armed Forces under the command of the President of the Republic.
We are part of these movements. However, our methodology and conduct in dealing with the other and the others acquaintance of us helped us weather this watershed.
On the contrary, we know our reality, size and the area available to us to move in. We also dont banish the other from our minds, so we managed to maintain our political ties with others after the 11 September incidents. Moreover, we reinforced these ties and cooperated with each other to weather this ordeal.
Q: Does this mean that the rule in Yemen is Islamic?
A: The most noticeable feature in our political program is the economic one, which deteriorates day after day in our country. The citizens standard of living gets worse.
Q: Some see that your economic proposals have nothing to do with reality and they are just slogans that cannot be easily accomplished, such as increasing pay by one hundred percent and raising the value of the Yemeni riyal, what is your comment?
Is it right to boost the rich, monopolists and usurers or to use such funds in solving the problems of the poor?!
Relations with America Q: Would you follow the suit of the Turkish Justice and Development Party, renowned to be Islamic, with regard to cooperation with the United States?
The most important thing here is to respect the others, so that they would respect us and if we have national interests we should respect the interests of others. Our commitment to these interests is not political speculation, but rather a pure Islamic method for Islam makes it incumbent upon you to be committed to what you have agreed upon as Allah Almighty says in the Holy Quran: O, believers fulfill (every) covenant.
Western forces, through Zionist media, and official media of many Islamic countries that wish to defame Islamic movements, presented such movements to the other as a bugaboo.
A: This issue was exaggerated a lot and, alas, some Yemeni politicians did so for several purposes. Yemen is the only country that declares it has terrorism therein.
Power rotation Q: Does your conception of democracy comply with its Western form which relies on power rotation and civil community institutions?
This denotes that Muslims at any time or place are able to adopt a method by which they can select a ruler through acknowledged rules that are characterized by justice and nondiscrimination, as it is a right for all Muslims. Shura is supposed to be the root in the nation.
While the U.S. campaign on Iran escalates after accusations by U.S. President George Bush of developing nuclear weapons, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi announced its country's new and controversial stand to the effect that the acquisition of a nuclear weapon is prohibited in Islam.
In this respect, other Islamic countries announced their possession of nuclear weapons, forefront of which is Pakistan.
The prohibition here is meant to refer to a jurisprudential rule prohibiting the use of lethal weapons by Muslims. Muslim jurisprudents unanimously prohibited the use of any means of mass destruction such as poisoning the enemy's water or exposing civilians to danger except in case of legitimate self-defence in the face of an attack by the enemies of Islam. However, if the Muslims signed international agreements banning the acquisition and use of nuclear weapons they should commit themselves to such agreements, a thing that is typically applied to Iran, which signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. In this case, the commitment to such agreements is legal according to international conventions, and concurrent with the sharia and jurisprudential constants.
A- Such strategic decisions are subject to timing and place considerations and the kind of treaties concluded by Muslims with others or the agreements they signed after endorsement by the UN.
Q- According to the considerations you referred to in the exceptional case, can Iran use the nuclear energy in military purposes if it is exposed to aggression or an invasion?
Q- In your opinion, what does the U.S. want to do through such attempts? A- The U.S. wants to dominate the capabilities of the whole Islamic region. It considers the Islamic Republic of Iran as a strong shield in the face of this project. So, the U.S. exerts pressure, from time to time, on our country with a view to weakening not only the Islamic Republic of Iran but also the whole Muslims.
A- If such a supposition came true, Islam would prohibit the possession and the use of such weapons worldwide. It is common knowledge that Islam rejects double-standards and calls for the rule of fraternity principles and peace. Islam has its own constants in respecting human rights even in case of war. I reiterate that if Muslims were a great power, the whole world would live in a state of prosperity, stability and peaceful coexistence.
In an indirect reply to Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi's statements, Pakistani opposition Islamic Group deputy leader Prof. Khorshid Ahmed told Al-Majalla that the use of nuclear warheads is not an easy matter.
"The Islamic sharia bans the production of such weapons due to its mass destruction impact. However, the Pakistani nuclear weapon is considered exceptional. From the sharia point of view, it is considered a sort of deterring the enemy and preventing it from using this weapon. It is also used in self-defence because Pakistan's enemy is in possession of such weapons," he added.
If such a weapon, which is mostly meant to deter and strike a balance of terror, provides security for the country that possesses it and some sort of deterring the other who wants to assault it, it may be necessary because it is the power called for by the Quran. But, it may be also impermissible if it leads to evil, international boycott, troubles and unrest for a country that is incapable to defend itself.
In this case, according to jurisprudents, necessities will be contrasted with obstacles and rulers should, consequently, decide on one of them, he pointed out.
However, the matter is that you aren't the only one in the universe and that the other may threaten you. To my mind, a strong Muslim is better than a weak one."
However, the Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh pointed out that Islamic countries should deal with this issue in a more rational way so that this issue may be carried out in secret, citing Pakistan as an example, which possesses a nuclear bomb. By so doing, we will not stimulate the world against us as the commando operations in Palestine do, he added.
The new budget, which is supposed to be put into effect early last April, included a deficit of 2.625 billion Kuwaiti dinars (about 8.663 billion US dollars). Total revenues are estimated at some 3.555 billion Kuwaiti dinars (about 11.732 billion US dollars) about 5.355 million Kuwaiti dinars (1.173 billion US dollars) of which were allocated for the Coming Generations Reserve Fund.
Dr. Tareq Rezouki, the ambassador at Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry, visited Iran two days ago and delivered Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi a message from first deputy Premier and Foreign Minister sheikh Sabal Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah.
The movement suggested acting for including Yemen in the Gulf Cooperation Council so that all Gulf and Arab Peninsula states may be included and relations with future Iraq and the Iranian Islamic Republic may be developed.
Syrian milieus monitoring the internal Syrian affairs revealed Syrian political leadership's orientation to separate the partisan work from the government one in Syria and define the relation between the Arab Socialist Baath Party (leader of the state and society according to the eighth article of the Syrian constitution) and the government.
He, further, pardoned the full punishment of those who committed smuggling crimes except for smuggling drugs and weapons as well as smuggling cases accompanied by resisting the competent authorities using arms.
"I think that a fresh reserve of about 60 million barrels at least will be discovered, thus increasing the daily production from 20,000 to 25,000 barrels." Oil production, according to the old contract with Shell and Petro, hits over 250,000 barrels daily. The new contract was concluded after long years of different points of view. During the last and current years, gradual steps of cooperation have been laid down which resulted in this agreement, the minister pointed out.
MUSHARRAF INSISTS ON CONSIDERING RECOGNITION OF ISRAEL
The Pakistani President reiterated his call for considering the establishment of relations with Israel. After his visit to the USA which promised him $3 billion economic assistance over the next five years.
Islamic Group leader, Qadi Hussein Ahmed had warned against offering any capitulations to the Hebrew state while leader of Islam Scholars Assistance Sami El Haq preferred the dissolution of parliament to the establishment of any kind of relations with Israel.
Yesterday (2nd July), well-informed sources uncovered that the US Department of State decided to launch an Arabic-speaking TV network similar to its Arabic-speaking 'Radio Sawa' radio station that is guided to the Middle East countries.
US Department of State did not give any details regarding the TV network which would be directed to the largest category of people in the Middle East.
Arab diplomatic sources said Sulaiman's arrival in Palestine means that Cairo still fears that the truce would collapse, pointing out that Egyptian officials raised recently their concern over any potential internecine dispute between the Palestinian factions.
WASHINGTON: "GOVERNING COUNCIL" IN IRAQ DE FACTO GOVERNMENT
An American delegation comprising military personnel and Congressmen left Cairo yesterday morning (11th July) for the USA. They were coming from Baghdad and stayed just 9 hours in Cairo, during which they discussed with Egyptian officials bilateral affairs.
Egyptian deputies asked the Egyptian government to pressurize Israel in order to recognize the right to the families of Egyptian POW's who were killed by Israel to have compensation and not to allow Israel to search for the corpses of the Israeli MIAs in Sinai unless the Egyptian demand was met.
The deputies said, "If Israel argued that such a search was provided for in the peace accord, it is still procrastinating the payment of other financial compensation estimated at over 10 billion for its draining Sinai resources during the Israeli occupation even though the compensation principle was also provided for in Camp David Peace Accord.
The meeting will touch upon the possibility of cutting down the interest rates on loans set aside for the housing units of no more than 80 meters from 12% to 5%.
Head of Insurance and reinsurance sector Hosni Hamed said the housing unit owner would pay a single premium upon clinching the contract of each policy.
It is based on the Article 139 of the Egyptian Constitution which says, "The president of the republic may appoint one vice-president or more, and identify their competence. They will also be subject to the rules of accountability of the president of the republic."
However, Mohamed Al-Merghani, a professor of constitutional law, said that the article shows that the appointment of one vice-president or more is not obligatory as it contained no obligation meaning.
It will be concurrent with the Constitution and will not marginalize independents, as rumours have it because the independents represent a political force that cannot be ignored, they pointed out.
Al-Arabi raised the same question once again: Does Gamal Mubarak represent the new generations in Egypt?
Those who talk in the name of the new generations are unfortunately a selected group that is afflicted by the curse of rejecting the other.
Secretary General of the Labour Party Magdi Hussein said that the NDP call for regeneration, which started last year, was simply a ploy to let Gamal Mubarak rise. No regeneration of youth capacities took place whether in partisan life or executive affairs. The call rather focused on the President's son who did not emerge from any youth movement (Islamic, national or liberal).
He should have realized the nature of youthful political forces that call for a society dominated by stability and social justice.
Dr. Al-Eryan also showed surprise, as Gamal's statements did not broach any issues related to Egypt's Arabism or the nation's causes, which could never be ignored. He pointed out that when Egypt's position was robust, the nation's causes were its primary concern and Egypt acted, therefore, as its main mover and primary supporter.
PA deputy, Mohamed Abdel-Alim thinks he does not mind anybody performing a political role provided that such a role would meet the demands of the masses. Any talk about one particular person representing a generation or leading a reform movement necessitates that such a person live the causes of the society especially the youth. He should also reconsider his entourage and talk to the Egyptians even before he talks to foreigners.
He also needs some assistants and he could propose genuine solutions to the unemployment problem and the reevaluation of governors and ministers' performance. There are crucial issues like farmers and water problems, he added.
You have a right, therefore, just like any other citizen no matter from what trade or what social class, to stand for presidential elections so that the arbiter would eventually be the people through a free plebiscite without rigging suspicions and under complete supervision by the judiciary.
Secondly, your acquaintance with the Egyptians and their acquaintance with you are still rather new.
The president and his son have been assigned that responsibility, the former in his capacity as President of the Republic and the latter as chairman of the ruing party's Policy Committee!
We would not exaggerate if we describe America's ambassadors in some Arab capitals as virtual rulers of those countries for each of those ambassadors behaves like an American high commissioner!

FOR THE FIRST TIME, EGYPT ALLOWS AN ISRAELI DOCTOR TO VISIT AZZAM

He added that the return of the ambassador, who had been recalled to Cairo two years before in protest against the excessive use of force by Israeli occupation forces against the Palestinians since the outbreak of the second uprising in September 2000, was an Egyptian sovereign decision taken according to the special data taken into account by the Egyptian decision-maker.
There are another 300 thousand persons who claim to be able to treat people by using the Qur'an or the Bible. For every 240 citizens, there is, therefore, a quack or charlatan, a Qur'an using quack for every 240 citizens, but one doctor for every 480 citizens out of a total of 150 thousand doctors. For each dentist there are 3600 citizens. Each doctor, especially, is counterpoised by two charlatans and each dentist is offset by 15 quacks, which emphasizes the abundance of quacks whom the state utterly failed to face, according to a study conducted by the National Centre for Criminological and Sociological Research.

Al-Abyadh emphasized his refusal to apply the law retroactive on the existent companies. He pointed out that 95% of the current companies would not be able to increase their capital.

PRIVATE BANKS RACE TO RAISE DOLLAR'S EXCHANGE RATE
City Bank, Egyptian American Bank and Societe Generale faced the same accusations.
The answer of course is "no".
A foreign investor aims at bridging the gap of price in supplying the dollar inside and outside the banking system, he added.
An official source with National Societe Generale Bank (NSGB) pleaded that NSGB had to resort to raising the dollar exchange rate to the limits of 6.24 pounds. The bank had witnessed in the last period a high demand for the American currency, a thing that forced the bank to raise purchasing prices to collect the dollar and make it available to clients at a reasonable profit margin. This, the source pursued, does not represent a speculation as much as it is an exception to cover the short positions of the bank.
The Federation of Industries, Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Businessmen Association collectively laid down a plan to activate local markets. Such a plan will be an alternative to the personal loans plan that did not achieve its targets.

It is noteworthy that many agreements with a number of Arab countries had caused a crisis for some factories that produce ready-made garments and electric devices as well as printing houses.
Some governmental solutions are not earnest in activating the market as they are not carefully studied and are based only on inaccurate information and reports. While the government confirmed that it was supporting local industry, it imposed a tax on capital equipment and exorbitant customs duties on production requirements - contrary to the duties imposed on finished imported goods, the duties imposed on some of which are less than those imposed on raw materials by some 50%.
He, further, pointed out that exchange rate decontrol is not the only action to be taken to energize industrial exports, but it is part of other actions that are supposed to be taken such as lifting the increasing burdens imposed on manufacturers, i.e. high taxes and low customs duties on imported goods and exorbitant taxes on raw materials in addition to providing correct information about the foreign markets through the studies to be concluded by Egyptian Commercial Representation abroad.
RELATIVE BOOM IN REAL ESTATE MARKET
A resident of a housing unit at Giza desert resort said he noticed for the first time a high turnout of intermediate class people to buy units in such areas, mostly people who are over 50 years old. He pointed out that the resort became more attractive after its good appearance was evident and the trees had flourished. "I spend the whole summer here although my work is in the heart of Cairo. I no longer wish to go to any coastal city as I enjoy fresh air, quiet and the swimming pool here," he said.
Nonetheless, construction, building and marketing companies raised their concern about the expected demand in the future given some economic hardships and involvement of North African countries, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Dubai in the fierce competitions over marketing posh real estate.
The ventures set up in Arab countries would not affect the Egyptian market, Zakaria said, adding that specific months, namely June, July and August, witnessed a big rise in sales volume every year. He expected that the sales volume would not be affected by competitive markets, noting that the real estate finance law might help increase the number of customers in the future.

However, Al-Abiadh pointed out that the dollar exchange market is currently witnessing a rise in its rate of exchange inside banks, something that may lead, accordingly, to an increase in its rate of exchange outside official dealings.
This will, eventually, lead to a rise in its rate on the black market, he added.
Several exchangers are threatened with shutdown due to the fresh bank legislation, increasing brokerage on the free exchange market, said chairman of the division of exchange firms Mohamed Hassan Al-Abyadh.

All these elements of the certificate would be the basis on which the payable 75% of the foreign exchange intake of a contractor or consultant will be determined.
It is to be mentioned that, last week, Egypt issued a decision to the effect of transferring the interim dumping charges imposed on Saudi exports including polyethylene plastics and polyester fibers to final charges for five years to come. The imposed dumping charges will hit 35% for polyethylene and 52% for polyester fibers. A similar decree is expected to be issued later on imposing final charges on polypropylene exports which are currently subject to provisional dumping charges by 28%.
CONSTRUCTION OF NEW COMPANY FOR RISK CAPITAL PROBED TO BUY FALTERING DEBTS FROM BANKS
He added that five companies had permits to operate in risk capital activity, but only a few of them have opted for buying faltering companies and even failed to achieve real breakthrough due to lack of bank flexibility in selling such debts at their real value.

Meanwhile, the government is firmly seeking to reform all troubled textile companies as part of a plan that will last until the first half of the coming year as a first stage.
Minister of Public Enterprise Mokhtar Khattab ascribed the rise in sales to an improvement in the exchange rate, reforms at these companies, high quality levels, improved sale rates and the fight against illegal trade in textile imports.
The ministry is currently seeking to write off part of the debts owed by these companies, while the state plans to comply with the enterprise sector's calls on it to bear the cotton price differentials to ease the burdens on public and private firms.

This will aggravate the situation, not to mention the big rises in the bill of imports which edged up by 1.5 pound for every dollar since the start of the year till now and is expected to increase by 22% on exchanging them for local currency.

In response to the farmers' pressure and their constant demands for water and crops being exposed to drying up at the end of canals in Al-Sharqeya, Dakahleya, Kafr Al-Sheikh and al-Gharbeya governorates, the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation increased the water released from Lake Nassser to 260 million cubic metres daily.

He went on saying that the attacks launched by Muslims including those launched against Israelis were unjustifiable and were, therefore, wrong.

Deputy head of the Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs Dr Abdel-Sabbour Marzouq held several consultations with Islamic Research Academy members and a number of thinkers, including Dr Mohamed Omara, Dr Ahmed Kamal Abul-Magd, Dr Mostafa Al-Shak'ah and counselor Tarek Al-Beshri, with the aim of forming a front reply to the lies of the participants forefront of whom are Ahmed Abdel-Mo'ti Hegazi, Gamal Al-Banaa, Syrian poet Adonis, Dr Hassan Hanafi and Dr Haider Ibrahim, professor of philosophy in Khartoum University.
These statements made by Gamal Mubarak, who is in charge of the ruling party Policy Committee, were meant to dispel recent fears that the state might venture to cancel free education which has thousands of Egyptian families as beneficiaries.
They pointed out that when Abu Mazen visited Cairo he carried specific demands from the Israeli premier Ariel Sharon and the American envoy in occupied territories, John Stern Wolf to release Azzam in return for 3 thousand Palestinians POW's during a period ranging between 3 and 6 months. The consummation of such a deal would, according to the deal promoters, bolster Abu Mazen's position in the eyes of the Israelis and the Americans on the one hand and the Palestinian people on the other hand.
Only four days ahead of the Press Syndicate elections, a map of the alliances and political forces started to emerge amid expectations of a growing Islamic presence at the syndicate at the expense of service providers and governmental candidates.

70 IRAQIS PROTEST AGAINST ARREST OF THEIR FATHER
The boys and girls, together with some students of Sheikh Qaisi toured the city where an American force center is located.
Such deprivation was ascribed by the researchers to many factors including political and military disputes as well as economic fluctuations, especially the rapid growth of urban population.
The WB linked between the emigration and the problem of deprivation and pointed out that the exodus to cities did not always manage to put an end to poverty as the poor in rural areas usually took their poverty with them to urban areas with the result that enormous populations would have to live in squalid unchartered districts which barely provide the minimum basic services. The WB added that 70% of Casablanca's population, 60% of Cairo population and 34% of Tunis population live in that type of districts where children are obviously the most liable to deprivation.
AMERICAN MONOPOLY OF EGYPTIAN WHEAT MARKET BROKEN
According to the latest report, after the policy of the diversification of imported wheat sources, France occupied a distinguished status in the Egyptian market for the first time during the season 2002-2003.
NILE WATER NOT TO GO TO ISRAEL: MINISTER
On Nile water pollution, he said, the Ministry of Public Works and Water Resources has worked out a blueprint to eliminate pollution of the Nile, canal and ditch water. The meeting was attended by Cairo University Naguib Al-Helali land Vice-President Hamed Gawahar.
Zaqzoq defended his ministry's mission confirming that the Ministry of Waqfs bears over 165 million pounds every year to execute plans for remapping, modernizing, maintaining and restoring existing mosques. There are over 73 thousand mosques affiliated to the ministry, he concluded.
Scores of other women also work for the prosecution and administrative courts. Hundreds of the faculty of law female graduates, however, seek to work in the judiciary career just like their male colleagues, especially in executive judiciary field, being appointed to the bench and not confining their roles to advisory opinions in specialized courts.
The work of such courts is primarily based on starting with good offices to mediate between the couple to save the family from collapse, then resorting to a judiciary settlement if mediation proved valueless.
In case the first option proved to be fruitless, the second option will be calling for holding an extraordinary general assembly for the party with a view to expelling Goma'a from his post as chairman of the party, a thing that is difficult to be effectuated in light of the enforced constitution.
Abdel-Maguid added that efforts are underway to start a dialogue with all members to solve the outstanding issues. Ousting Goma'a from party chairmanship or freezing the party are out of the question for the time being, he noted, pointing out, "We all care about the Wafd Party and seek to reform it internally".
"TAGAMO'H" PARTY TO CONSIDER CONSTITUTION CHANGE
In its last meeting the politburo of Tagamo'h Party endorsed the political report that would be submitted to the general congress. The report was referred to the Party's General Secretariat to be considered on 30th July instant prior to presenting it to the general congress.
The party highlighted its stance towards the groups of political Islam that is based on evident distinction between Heavenly religions and the opportunist mixing between religion and politics.
Safwat Al-Sherif said that the demands of some partisan trends to amend the constitution were both destabilizing and harmful to national unity. Then, he announced his initial rejection of such demands. I wonder who has given the NDP Secretary General the right to confiscate thinking of Egypt's future and present. How can the minister draw an analogy between the call for political and constitutional reform, a call which has been advocated by Egyptian political forces for about two decades, and lack of national allegiance and to whose interest may a call for political and constitutional reform be regarded as a violation of national constants?
The political and constitutional reform has been delayed for too long. Stability and national unity will be realized as soon as this reform has taken place, when the powers and the term of office of the President are defined, when the terms of reference of each estate are clearly defined so that no encroachment is allowed, when Egypt turns from a country which combines both the presidential and parliamentary systems without enjoying any of their benefits into a parliamentary system where people choose their deputies without election rigging, and when the government is brought to book for its actions. Stability can take place when the President of the republic is elected from among more than one candidate and when any official who has power will be answerable to the parliament for the way he exercises that power!
The unemployment that runs rampant in the Egyptian cities and villages in addition to the growing number of those who live under poverty line to an unprecedented level, led to an increase in the phenomenon in which some of the gifted and holders of rare qualifications and specialties accept low-rank professions foremost of which are serving in houses, taking up cleanness jobs and working as vendors.
He said that those servants usually hide their qualifications from their employers in order to avoid questions about the reasons that forced them to do this kind of work.
Fatima confirmed that she had been exerting herself in that job for two years and that she hid her qualifications from her employers lest she shall be exposed to insults from the illiterate wife she was serving or her sons who held medium qualifications. Fatima serves a family for about 15 hours per day and she does not tell anybody about her job. She does not deny that she might be forced, daily, to lie if anyone asked her where she works, as she replies that she is an expert with the National Center for Social Research.
A statistic by the National Centre for Social Studies unveiled a rise in the rate of spinsterhood among university female students in Egypt. The study uncovered that 50% of university graduates suffered from spinsterhood and that some of them preferred to delay matrimony till they got the highest scientific and occupational degrees.
Ibtisam who is 42 years old admitted to the fact that she was not getting any younger but she cannot be called really a spinster. To prove her argument she said she had turned down one of her colleagues' proposal of marriage as she thought there was a better life than of marriage- knowledge and making new acquaintances everyday. That was, according to her, the reason why she felt happy about her life and refused to marry at that stage of her life.
The same opinion was given by Dr. S.A., a 43 years old female, who said, "I devoted all my life to my job and studies in the university. I traveled to many countries and worked there. I made a lot of money and believed that marriage would restrict my freedom and undermine my ability to stand by and work and therefore rejected the proposals of colleagues and bridegrooms who had very good social positions.
Former dean of Arab Language faculty in the South Valley, Dr. Al Badrawi Zahran emphasized that delaying marriage till a late age runs counter to both Islamic religion and human nature. Marriage is a grace. The holy Koran says: "And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy.
This type of swimming costumes for women is highly demanded by veiled women, while other unveiled women do not prefer them as, they said, it is illogical to put on a veil while swimming but take it off while walking in the street.
Although going swimming is a way to a means of entertainment and relaxation, it sometimes turns out to be a sort of suffering and trouble. On a Mersa Matrouh beach, a tragic divorce case took place recently when a husband from Cairo found out that his wife was used to getting up early to go swimming for hours, while he was still sleeping.
Men's Islamic beach wear is also on sale, covering the body from the navel to the knee.
It is important, therefore, that the Palestinians review their positions as most liberation movements in the world have reviewed their positions, he said.
The lawsuit filed by lawyer Nabih Mohamed Al-Wahsh is based on the pretext that setting up that committee contravened the articles 138 and 156 of the permanent Egyptian constitution passed in 1971.

A Jewish attempt to control one of the Egyptian parliament premises after South Cairo Court refused to pass a ruling in favour of some families belonging to Jewish organizations in France which had filed a lawsuit claiming the ownership of the premises under historical pretexts.
The Egyptian Parliament defense, however, assured the court that Rimon Gaddaa's allegations were lies as no requests had been made by the French ambassador, nor had the PA set up any committees to check the villa, nor had any offers been made. The compliant, Gaddaa failed to present evidence to his or his French Jewish principals ownership of the villa. Nor could he prove that he was one of the heirs of Victoria Garboua who brought the villa on behalf of her husband Jacques Levie during his life. The court headed by Justice Ali Emara decided to turn down the lawsuit and confirm the Egyptian parliament's ownership of the villa.
For his part, General Director of Misr International Bank, Ahmed Abdel-Wahab said that there are no indices of the dollar's ability to exceed this limit in the current period as the unofficial market is not so capable of controlling foreign currency dealings any more as it used to be in the last last five months. The black market's quota of foreign currency do not exceed 20% of the available liquidity while the remaining quota is obtained by banks, he said pointing out that it is not in favor of banks to waive their quota to mediators and speculators.
Sources with Israeli Premier Ariel Sharon's bureau quoted him as rejecting any initiative to open a peaceful track with Syria.
Sharon was quoted in that regard as saying that he was not interested in opening the Syrian track for the time being as the Palestinian track is the more important and the more urgent. He said, "We should intensify pressure on Syria and Iran in order to stop supporting Hizbollah and other terrorist organizations.
In a talk to Monte Carlo and Radio France Internationale RFI, Powell said, "The Americans had set an integrated agenda for Syria".
Behind the scenes, Sharon entourage, from defense and foreign ministries, were preoccupied with studying the second developing project for cooperation in the field of arms industry. It is the hushed up file between the two capitals in spite of the international broadsides of that illegal cooperation.
These rockets are considered the backbone of this official military Israeli institution, Raphael, that makes Israel one of the world arm-exporting countries. The reports of the organizations that oppose the military relations between London and Tel Aviv point out that head of anti-tank rockets department with Raphael Company of Afraham Mazor kept his finger crossed that new rockets promotion campaign will succeed, a thing that will yield about 2 billion sterling for Raphael Company in the coming five years.
Israel is currently the fifth biggest arms exporter in the world following the USA, the European Union, Russia and Japan.
Next to the USA came Asian countries, then Europe and then Latin America.
The Executive Commission of the Iraqi Christians Democratic League (ICDL) welcomed in a statement issued yesterday (July 22nd) the formation of the governing council. The ICDL's cautious welcome said the council was a right step in the right direction for the Iraqis to run their own affairs.
And that's why the league though welcoming the council, does not think it expresses the aspirations of most Iraqi Christians.
Maher said that the university started to witness a new kind of brokers or procurers whose job was to persuade some girl students to head for the American soldiers' rest houses. Those girls who fell victim to the power of the dollar can easily be recognized.
We, frankly, are Sami's group. We came here to take part in parties for the soldiers and spend the night here. In the morning, Sami comes to give us our dues in full, but he is late today. He is head of a ring of women who procure beautiful girls from markets or the universities secretly rather than the way we have been brought here."
American forces are stationed inside the university campus without permission from the university rector.
It was noticeable that the students of Political Science Faculty expressed their anger in their own way trading insults with American forces, while Islamic Science Faculty students refused even to greet or talk the soldiers. Female students refused to let themselves be searched by magnetometer.

A recent report prepared by the research department with the Chamber of Commerce in Cairo emphasized that there is no real auto industry in Egypt for 60% of energy are idle, which affirms that it is an illusionary industry that doesn't serve economy.

The pipeline can carry a maximum of 10 billion cubic meters of gas on an annual basis, potentially to be raised through another neighbouring pipeline with increasing global needs.
It should not be regarded that the gas pipeline runs from Taba in Egypt as far as the Aqaba Gulf in Jordan for it starts from the Mediterranean Sea and brings natural gas from deep water and then Al-Gamil Station, crossing the Suez Canal, Sinai as far as Jordan at heights of 850 meters atop hills and depths of 850 meters under the Aqaba Gulf water surface, carrying clean energy to Jordan, Syria and Lebanon in the coming stage and Turkey and Europe later on.

EGYPT'S REVAMPED INDUSTRY MAY HAVE STRONG PRESENCE ON TURKISH AND EUROPEAN MARKETS: TURKISH MINISTER

Egyptian banking milieus are witnessing nowadays a heated debate over a fresh mechanism reported to be activated by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) to control foreign exchange market, especially in light of some special transactions recently concluded by some private banks, re-rise of the dollar rate of exchange on the unofficial market to 650 piasters, and the growing gap between the dollar rate of exchange in the CBE and the unofficial market to over 35 piasters after it had narrowed to less than 3 piasters.
Former Planning Minister Dr. Ahmed Al-Darsh supports the interference of the CBE through fresh mechanisms to monitor markets and control dealings. He indicated that there were some reasons for such interference which does not run counter to the liberalization of the rate of exchange, including unjustifiable and unexpected rises of the U.S. currency in spite of the increase of its supplies due to tourist inflows and the return of Egyptian expatriates, and the revitalization of the dealings of the unofficial market. The creation of a communication network among the government, the CBE and banks will protect the monetary policy, ensure its application in a better way, and eliminate the unofficial market, he added.
"The new mechanism isn't an administrative interference in the foreign exchange rates controlled by a rate of exchange liberalization system, but rather a means to coordinate between the CBE and the government and banks, which can energize a mechanism to exchange dollar surpluses among banks and at the rates that are considered by such banks as suitable," Economic Advisor to Prime Minister and CBE board member Dr. Hatem Al-Qarnashawi said. This system will remove any suspicion of speculation from the banks that achieve dollar surpluses. It will also bolster the financial foreign exchange positions of other banks and alleviate pressure resulting from any potential rise in demand for opening documentary credits, he pointed out.

IGAD MEDIATORS SUGGEST SUDANESE CAPITAL CONSISTING OF GOV'T PREMISES PARLIAMENT HQ
The proposal suggested that the national capital be a symbol of unity reflecting national diversity and that area be secular as, according to them, religion should not be used as a tool for disputes.
Such districts would have special status in the capital so much so that none of them would be a province or part of a province.

Under this headline, Syrian writer and researcher Sobhi Hadidi who resides in Paris writes an article in Al-Quds Al-Arabi to the following effect: A story is being circulated secretly by the Syrians saying that a short note was put on Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad's desk a few weeks ago to the effect that a governor (a retired officer who has been a governor of a major Syrian governorate for decades, but we cannot mention his name here for legal reasons only) collected an unimaginable amount of money from tributes, bribes and commissions.
The rest of the story says that the young president remained silent for a short time and said that this governor in particular was favoured by "his father's will" and that he would not offend that will by any means.
Tens of similar stories are circulated among Syrian citizens from time to time. They are meant to draw the citizens' attention away from other secret stories.
In Syria nowadays, there is a handful of gangs, who personify the "will of the father" according to Al-Assad junior, who are less than ten in number. Their number, together with their sons, may reach thirty at most. They are simply the army of the Syrian mafia.
Forefront of such reasons is "the entourage" around the president or the higher hierarchy of power where the final resolution can be taken. In 1973, or even immediately after October War, Hafez Al-Assad organized his ranks and forces and excluded the politicians and officers who stood with him and there was no need to them any more, or they became an obstacle in one way or another. He kept those whose services he needed or whom he could not oust for reasons related to security, military or sectarian balances after imposing an authority over anybody who had an authority.
It might be mentioned here that Hafez Al-Assad continued for three decades to establish a dictatorial, security, military regime as accurate as a spiderweb, whose threads are connected with the center where the heart of the web is making final decisions and drawing up policies.
So, some political Syrian forces, including secular and Islamic oppositionists alike, were deceived by the illusion of the "national reconciliation" with the regime on the grounds that the country is exposed to external dangers threatening its independence, sovereignty and security.
Recently, Bashar issued a decree to have a large number of criminal prisoners released. However, he did not take the next necessary step of releasing the prisoners of conscience (or the ten persons who became nine after releasing Riyadh Al-Turk) although their "crimes" can by no means be compared with currency and smuggling crimes or drug trafficking.
The disaster is that this single step forward can imply some other sorts of development such as importing the worst traditions of the familial mafia.
Wolfwitz's statements followed talks he held in Saladdin town (north Iraq) with Masud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party as well as other Kurdish leaders two days ago.
Kuwaiti Premier, Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed said that Kuwait and the Gulf region were facing security, political and economic challenges adding that the Kwaiti new National Assembly was acting in a situation quite different from that in which previous assemblies acted. International circumstances are in a state of change and the regional conditions are no longer the same as the previous ones. He added that the domestic arena is no longer away from the events in its vicinity and the world. Consequently to deal with the new reality using the previous concepts and techniques would not create optimum conditions for the achievement of hopes.
Jordan Company for Manufacturing and Developing Aircraft discharged the task of assembling and manufacturing Jordanian airplanes, he added.
Al-Zahabi, added that a number of Jordanian engineers were sent to Canada to be trained in aircraft assembly. The new factory will manufacture metal sheets used in aircraft, while engines and other aviation equipment will be imported and installed to airplanes in Jordan as the manufacture of engines and other equipment is not profitable for its high cost, which, consequently, will lead to the rise of the product price.
The crucial point of this issue, which pushed security bodies to interfere and send this memo is that the governor's external relations have gone to extremes to the detriment of the state's security.
The second story is being publicly circulated by the regime's newspapers and mass media by day and at night. They say that the authorities have arrested 39 civil servants working in the Agricultural Directorate in Idlib Governorate on charges of corruption, receiving bribes, issuing forged invoices, distributing expired agricultural products and being negligent in their work duties, according to official Teshrin newspaper.
Both secret and public stories sum up the Syrian question in the third anniversary of Bashar Al-Assad reign after artificial rigged elections, preceded by the farce of amending the constitution (which was laid down by Hafez Al-Assad himself) in a way that seems suitable for the illegal age of the son who will succeed his father and in a way that turned the Syrian regime into a hereditary republic or dictatorship.
The killer went unpunished. Corruption the mafia way coloured the last two years of Bashar Al-Assad's reign and it seems likely to colour the coming era.
The second reason is that the young president is lacking in the human experience which urged most world countries constitutions to stipulate that the candidate for the presidency should be over forty years old.
The catastrophe is that if Bashar Al-Assad wanted to rule with a new team and different approach, he would have to practically form counter-networks that outweigh the other networks. This will put him in an expected confrontation - may be permanently - with the old guards who have not died yet.
The fourth and most important reason, "the mother of reasons," is that the regime is structurally unable to make a reform or an essential change because its structure is too solid and inflexible to bear the shock of changes. It repeats itself and stems the causes of survival from the same causes that are totally contrary to the concepts of democracy, partisan multiplicity, respect of freedoms and human rights.
The farce reached its climax when it was said that the decree implied the release of Riyadh Al-Turk (who was released more than eight months ago).
Jordanian Minister of Transport Nadir Al-Zahabi said an Arab investor applied for a plot of land in Jordan to erect an aircraft plant.
The approvals were referred to the cabinet, which, in turn, approved the establishment of that giant investment project, said Eng.
The report said the actually cultivated areas don't exceed 38 million hectares annually, whereas the agricultural lands in Arab world are estimated at 603 million hectares. It explained that 91.8% of Arab agricultural lands are not exploited for they are uncultivated.
Israel would not content itself with what it usurped of Arab water but it would try to get fresh water resources and would resort to war, especially as two previous experiences encourage it to do so, namely the 1967 war which provided Israel with half a million cubic meters of Jordanian water and Lebanon's invasion in 1982 which provided it with 800 million cubic meters of Litani river water.
IRAN'S MISSILE!
By choosing this particular timing to announce its new missile, the Iranian government might have meant to reply to the escalating American threats to topple it.
The Iranian regime tried to resort to discretion as the best part of valour and in an attempt to fend off American anger, tried to strike a happy medium by exercising pressure on Iraq Shiite leaderships affiliated to it not to get involved with the resistance and even to join the governing council. Such a policy which failed in Afghanistan started to fail too in Iraq as some Shiite groups started to show recalcitrance to Iranian counsel to abide by the rule of self-control. They have even prepared to joint the resistance in a bid to acquit the national Arab Shiite group of the charges of collusion with occupation while their Sunnite brothers were valiantly forging ahead with confronting the American project.
The question is: What about Arab military armament industry! Where are the billions spent in that context? When will the Arabs possess missiles or a nuclear programme?
He told Al-Hayat that the Americans showed lack of confidence in Shiite parties and hence their forces attacks on those parties premises and detention of Shiite political cadres now jailed in American and British prisons called the "Docks."
"We are constantly harassed by the Americans," he added.
The only outlet of these regrettable conditions lies in an Iraqi authority assuming responsibilities as soon as possible provided that that authority is elected by the people and is highly qualified to restore civil life to that sisterly Arab country.
No new projects or dams in the Nile Basin countries were established, which, if set up, would negatively affect Egypt's annual water quota of 55.5 billion cubic meters, he added. The most serious challenge facing Egypt in the water area is overpopulation, which means more water needs, the minister said.
The committee had approved the appointment of women in all judiciary bodies and parliamentary deputies criticized confining the nomination of women to certain judicial circles as failing to ensure the implementation of the principle of equality. It is noteworthy that one of the constitutional court members is a woman - Tahani Al-Jibali.
The Ministry of Justice pointed out that such courts would be independent and chaired by specialized justices capable of understanding such types of problems, and presenting proper solutions to them.
A statistic issued by an association interested in woman and child field revealed that there is an increase in the number of female servants in spite of the fact that some of them hold master's degrees in various domains.
Replying to a question about the most prominent specialties whose holders ask for a job, Hassan revealed that most of those who ask for a job are bachelor or master's degree holders in the field of social sciences in addition to graduates of other faculties. Hassan pointed out that he once received an application from a servant holding a master's degree in the field of political sciences. She was sent to a Gulf family, but she left work after less than a month, as she got tired of serving a 12- member family.
Fatima uncovered that she knew some female servants working in affluent suburbs such as Maadi, Garden City and Zamalek. Most of those servants, she added, are university graduates.
A researcher with the center, Dr. Azzah Karim warns against the dangers of that rise in marriage age for both sexes. She thinks that marriage at a late age leads to anxiety, tension and depression besides the creation of many family problems during engagement and after marriage for many social and family reasons.
H.KK (35 years old) is an employee and thinks that her devotion to her work and being constantly preoccupied with her job's responsibilities were mainly to blame for not marrying till that age especially as it was she alone among her colleagues that was promoted several times.
To my grief, I, all of a sudden, discovered some gray hairs on my forehead and wrinkles began to creep to my face I began to suffer from self-pity especially as some of my age-mates had children in the university.
Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who reflect". Dr. Al Badrawi rejects the pretexts under which some girls refrain from marriage like self-assertion through a job or a study. He says, "The woman can continue studying as that does not run counter to marriage. Islamic history events confirm such an argument as some Muslim women proved to be geniuses in science although they were married.
However, husbands tell their spouses to wear such an Islamic swimwear or they can not go swimming, but only sit under the umbrella. Women's Islamic swimsuit shops mainly include Al-Tawhid and Al-Nour, owned by businessman Ragab Al-Swirky alias Shahriar, who is currently serving a sentence in prison. Such shops have started to sell such swimwear upon a fatwa (religious opinion) in this spirit.
One day, he got up early to surprisingly find his wife mobbed by a group of young men while swimming in the sea. Putting a pair of pajamas, the husband got his spouse out of the sea and divorced her in front of beach-goers.
AL-FIQI: AMERICA DROPPED ISRAELI EXPANSIONIST PROJECT
There should be a new Arab discourse that would clarify the truth to the Americans and the West. The international community has got fed up with the Arab traditional discourse and wants one with new vocabulary based on acceptance of coexistence, regional cooperation and willingness to create security arrangements between Arab countries and Israel provided a comprehensive just peace is achieved and that Israel agrees to nuclear inspection, he added.
The lawsuit said that the Policy Committee came to being through a caesarean in contravention to article 138 of the construction which provides that the President of the Republic may set the general policies of the state in coordination with the Premier.
A Zionist organization demanded that Egyptian officials be put to trial before the International War Criminals Court. The Israeli President met a number of American and Canadian delegations to pressure the Egyptian government into setting up a joint committee according to Camp David Accords to discuss compensations for the Jews who were expelled from Egypt at long intervals.
A an official report recently issued by those Zionist bodies accused the Egyptian officials of hostility to religions and depriving the Jews of exercising their religious rights and beliefs.
Egyptian premier Dr. Atef Ebeid will not taste his gift of Sudanese mango as 300 mango boxes were confiscated immediately after his return from Khartoum two days ago, according to Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture report yesterday (21st July).
Egyptian Public Enterprise Sector Minister Mokhtar Khattab and Egyptian Minister of Petroleum Eng. Sameh Fahmi had a similar experience two weeks ago on their arrival at Cairo Airport from Sudan. In spite of their objections, the Sudanese mango amounts presented to them there were confiscated.
This announcement coincided with American and Israeli intensive pressure on Iran to force it to unveil its nuclear programme.
The American Administration feels that the gravest danger to its forces in Iraq and the Gulf region in general comes from two countries Syria; and Iran, as their borders with Iraq are both long and of difficult terrain and are therefore so difficult to control.
Israel has panicked at such missiles just as it had panicked at Al-Hussein Iraqi missiles. It would never feel safe unless such missiles were destroyed or unless the regime in Tehran was changed just as it had done to Iraq.
WASHINGTON COOPERATES WITH IRAQI INTELLIGENCE ELEMENTS OF "IRAN" AND "ISLAMIC MOVEMENT" SECTIONS
He stressed that the contacts between the two sections leaderships and the American Intelligence were underway and their elements were well-known to them. The exchange of information between the two parties was on in order to undermine the influence of Shiite parties in the Iraqi street, he added.
SHARON TO BUSH: IF PALESTINIANS WERE REPLACED WITH MEXICANS, I WOULD SCRAP SEPARATION FENCE Yediot Aharonot correspondent who escorted Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in his visit to the USA quoted the dialogue that took place between Sharon and US President George W. Bush. He added that the dialogue was not fully earnest but half kidding.
Expressing reservations, Bush said, "Your problem is different. You have to decrease the Palestinians' desire and drives to take actions against you." "But if you guarantee that the Palestinians be replaced with Mexicans, I would be ready to scrap the separation fence," Sharon replied.
Mofaz's statements were based on a report compiled by the chief of General Intelligence stating that the Palestinian factions have no intention to abandon arms.
This came during king Abdullah and his wife's meeting with two U.S. Congressmen. "We will keep supporting the roadmap and exert every possible effort with different Arab and international parties to reach just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East," Abdullah noted.
The young journalists complain about their newspapers' board chairmen and chief editors retaining their seats for periods that sometimes exceeded 20 years, which, according to some, was the mainspring of the problems due to which press institutions suffered such a recession and lack of new blood in its leaderships. The journalists seemed to be eager to launch messages to the state through selecting their syndicate's chairman and majority of members from among the opposition in order to achieve a press reform including lifting the restrictions on the press trade and canceling the laws restricting freedom of publishing and improving the journalists' living standards. Election bribes were abolished and the new young journalists were given a chance to lead professional action in press institutions.
The new syndicate chairman, Aref describes himself as an independent chairman. He had, more than once, contested the elections in the last years, but without success. This is, however, the first time for Montaser, who is an Al-Ahram writer and former chief editor of October Magazine to contest these elections.
In spite of Egyptian journalists' keenness on keeping their syndicate away from the spectra of political and partisan currents, the political analysis of the syndicate council formation pointed out the council's division into three equal slashes: four seats for each slash (Muslim Brotherhood, the Nasserites and independents), which would create a quandary whether in the formation of the council's supreme body or the course any syndicate crises might take. This would also require that the chairman should take account of the balances especially as he is regarded as an affiliate of the Nasserite trend even though he had abandoned its membership since he contested the elections for the first time 15 years ago.
The sources pointed out that the Americans turned down Saddam's offer, detained Hammoud and killed Saddam's two sons. The Americans believe that Saddam's offer indicate that he began to lose hope and felt that the American forces is about to arrest him.

The second draft law deals with amendment of the local administration law. It provides for returning the denied right to interpellate to members of local councils, which prevented to a great extent the spread of corruption inside localities. They (oppositionists) mentioned, as a proof, the accident of criminal investigations with some governors and passing imprisonment sentences against them, the last of whom was Giza governor counselor Mahir Al-Gendi. The bill also stipulates electing rather than appointing governors provided that a republican decree is issued to appoint the elected governors.
American sources told Asharq Al-Awsat on Saturday that US State Department plans to convene an "extended conference" in Cairo next year to assess the initiative of partnership and democratic reform.
The sources did not rule out participation of senior officials in the American administration topped by Powell, assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs Liz Cheney, who is the initiative supervisor, and the officials in charge of cultural interchange programmes at the State Department in addition to the bodies which made use of the initiative over the last two years.
The conference, according to US sources, is expected to focus on the ways and means of women's participation in political life and the support needed by women and civil community foundations and NGOs to activate women's participation in the decision-making process and the democracy initiative.

Provocative statements He is also criticized by Egyptian public opinion due to his provocative statements in the press about the importance of reforming Egyptian education and his frequent meetings with the Egyptian Minister of Education as well as his visits to Al Azhar Grand Sheikh, Dr. Mohamed Sayed Tantawi and his interference in the Egyptian television and cinema which he accuses of having anti-American or Israeli policy as was the case with a television serial presented by Egyptian Television last Ramadan (Muslim's fasting month) under the title Knight Without a Horse which dealt with Protocols of the Elders of Zion.

Deputy chairman of Engineering Industries Chamber Mohamed Al Muhandis, who doubles as member of the 10th of Ramadan City Investors Society said that the losses incurred by aluminum factories amounted to about LE10 million in the last two weeks alone due to the sharp rise in prices and the factory owners having to buy the raw materials at any price and from anyplace.
Aluminum factories had recently asked Misr for Aluminum as one of its key suppliers of raw aluminum to be committed to providing the quotas agreed upon beforehand. The company, nonetheless, refused to meet the factories needs under the pretext of being committed to foreign export contracts which brought about a severe shortage in aluminum capacity on the markets. The factories, therefore, could not find the raw materials and production capacity, consequently, retreated to its lowest since the raw material shortage problem came to the surface four months ago, thus sending prices up to their highest rates.
Ibrahim Hussein said it was necessary to open the door to raw aluminum imports and to cancel customs on the imported raw materials so as to achieve a balance in the aluminum sector and to ensure that the companies would work to their planned capacities.

Britain is considered one of a few countries whose balance of trade with Egypt is balanced. It is also considered the biggest foreign investor in Egypt, Nuseir noted.

Q: What will the Egyptian group living in Switzerland do in that regard?
A: The details were mentioned by Dr. Zaki Hawwas, professor of architecture, relying on historical truths. He says that Egypt's Pharaoh was one day surprised to find thousands of Egyptian women screaming below his palace's windows asking for his succour and complaining about their jewellery being stolen by the Jews in the biggest operation of fraud an collective swindling in history.
A: In the morning, the Egyptian woman discovered that her neighbours' houses were empty and so started screaming for help. The rest of the theft stories unfolded and is just one night Egypt lost all its gold and culinary utensils as well as water pots.
A:Yes, they were. The Pharaoh, then, ordered that a military campaign be immediately prepared to pursue the thieves before they could escape (according to an investigation memo by the Pharaoh's palace guard leader).
Q: Did they leave singly or in groups? A: They left in a caravan of 600 thousand persons, i.e. about 120 thousand families led by some vehicles and a long line of donkeys loaded with the stolen things heading for he north at Al Manzallah, then for the south before Suez. They crossed the desert in the heart of Sinai in an attempt to deceive their pursuers.
A: Of course the Jews may throw doubt on that story, but their arguments might be refuted by citing verses from their Torah texts from the Exodus Book. These verses say: "And I will make the Egyptians favorably disposed toward this people, so that when you leave you will not go empty-handed.
A: Firstly, such texts prove that the Jews had taken the Egyptians' gold, silver and clothes.
A: There are two kinds of arguments: one religious and the other legal. As for the religious side, all heavenly religions advocated honesty in dealings and banned theft. They promoted other virtues in dealings among individuals. This is quite clear in the ten commandments where the Jews are ordered not to steal and hence their religious obligation to return what was stolen if available.
Q: What next action will be taken regarding the case?
A: As a compromise, repayment of the debt could be paid by installments over one thousand years with the interest that would accumulate during that period.

Conservative as they were, these officials had to modify their previous ideas about how to run the educational sector in Iraq after they listened to the explanations given by Iraqi experts about the reality of the Education Ministry which they had been tasked to supervise.
The Education Ministry is supervised by an American expert, who is a minister in the civil administration and is in charge of signing all dealings and resolving issues. That expert was originally a consultant, but was assigned her present job due to the lack of a minister.

So, we said the pages omitted in the Congress report would help us, too, in that war by providing more assistance for the Americans," the Saudi source said.

She said more than 15 employees run the international veterinary hospital and most of them are veterinarians experienced in treating pet animals and birds particularly hawks of which the Gulf people take remarkable care vis-a-vis the Europeans and westerners who take care of raising dogs and cats in general.

Companies are ready In light of that, tens of businesses in Israel presented requests to the Israeli Ministry of Finance to be licensed to work and invest in a "hostile country," according to the office of the Ministry's spokesman.
In his report about what took place in the World Economic Forum in Jordan, he emphasized this argument, quoting statements made by Iraqi Chemical Industries General Director Faisal Qaidari. "Don't seek mediators from Arab countries but rather go directly to the Iraqi business community which highly evaluates the economic and investment abilities of the Israelis. Iraqi businessmen still have good memories of the Jewish minority that played an important role in the Iraqi private sector.
Other ten Israeli companies (in the spheres of medical services, medicine, project management, planning, consumer materials, and developing security examination-related devices) are considering their participation in reconstructing Iraq. This will be achieved through "Ament" group and "Watherpol" that are represented by lawyer Galaad Shir who was a prominent member in the Israeli delegation that held negotiation with the Palestinians in former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's government.
This American-Israeli plan was confirmed by the spokesman for "Zim," the biggest sea and land transport company in Israel who said to Al-Majalla, "It's true that we look forward to achieving huge investments in Iraq. We've obtained the required licenses, but we are still awaiting some arrangements with an Arab agency that is on its way to complete contacts with American and Iraqi bodies in this regard."
We haven't, therefore, taken any practical steps, as it's too early to talk about this matter."

The Jordanian parliamentary campaign, which requests the Interpol to extradite Head of the Iraqi National Congress Ahmed Chalabi to Jordan so as to stand a trial anew for the financial corruption case in which he was involved in 1990, augurs that an imminent crisis would take place between the parliament and the government. It is to be mentioned that the parliament opposes the Iraqi Governing Council and the government seeks to effect a legal settlement in Chalabi's case without any pressure from the US, which is enthusiastic for his role in the future of Iraq.
There was a general desire in the parliament to arouse Chalabi's case and compel the government to take quick and serious actions, Abu Al-Sukkar pointed out, considering that such a move would enforce the official stance, as it conveys a message to Washington about the critical situation which the government faces in the Jordanian street due to the US support of Chalabi.

It has been customary for Tantawi in dealing with controversial issues where Al-Azhar is involved to distance himself from angry reactions by some bodies as was the case at the outbreak of the Anglo-American war against Iraq when the Islamic Research Academy issued a statement branding the war as a "Crusade", which angered European countries, as well as Egyptian official circles. Tantawi, then had to issue a statement denying any intentions on the part of Al-Azhar to prejudice the Christian religion or any European country.
It seemed that Tantawi's position had created a sensation among Al-Azhar scholars themselves. Islamic jurisprudence professor in Al-Azhar University Dr. Sabry Abdel Raof said to Al-Hayat, "Nobody in the world can ever claim ignorance of what happened to noble Iraq.
Such interference on the part of Al-Azhar has prejudiced its independence and neutrality as well as its task and status so much so that the officialdom in Egypt has either controlled and neutralized it or just exploited it in supporting its political line, which entirely runs counter to Al-Azhar's function as a religious spiritual authority which cannot be similar to the Vatican.
The sources pointed out that the new assistant ministers for parliamentary affairs would be responsible for replying to the deputies querries either before the parliament or its ad hoc committees should the minister be too busy to do so.

Emerging from the meeting, Tantawi and Welch issued press statements that did not touch upon the controversial fatwa.
Welch also confirmed that the American Administration advised the Israeli government not to prejudice Al-Aqsa Mosque and to avoid any harassment against the Palestinian Muslims.
"Sheikh Nabawi did not know that his fatwa would be published online," Abu Agour said, adding, "A representative of 'Sawt Al-Azhar' (Voice of Al-Azhar) newspaper asked him about the religious opinion regarding dealing with the Transitional Governing Council to be published in the paper. However, the editor published the fatwa in an Islamic website online and other newspapers quoted it, thus causing the current problem."

Hassanein said that that came within the framework of the financial reform programme carried out by the Ministry pointing out that that would start with referring the bill on income taxes to the People's Assembly new session next month.
It was decided to refer the final form of those rules, which had been endorsed yesterday by the cabinet and the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), to the next meeting of the CBE's board of directors in preparation for launching the new mechanism.
Through this amendment, the CBE wanted to avoid imposing any difficult conditions on banks in penetrating dollar interbank market but to encourage them to deal with an amount that exceeds foreign exchange liquidity on the market. It also aimed to not give international institutions an impression that dollar rate fixing system is being adopted in case a limited number of banks have control on the new market.
The new amendments allowed the CBE to carry out direct transactions on the dollar interbank market with any of the banks participating in the system at the exchange rate of the other party of the transaction with a minimum of 5 million dollars or their equivalent in foreign currencies.
The committee shall undertake considering all foreign exchange related complaints submitted to it by banks participating in the system. It also shall investigate the bank referred disputes that might result from foreign exchange transactions.

TRADE BALANCE DEFICIT DOWN LE4 BN
Imports, moreover, increased from LE27.2 billion in January-June 2002 to LE30.5 billion during the corresponding period this year, it added.
Some banking leading figures also said that the banks did not have a dollar surplus to ensure success for that mechanism to relieve pressure on banks that suffer from a dearth in foreign exchange resources. Speculators, too, are betting on the CBE failure to continue intervening as a seller on the foreign exchange market at the expense of the foreign reserve which it has, especially as it has strict instructions not to touch that reserve. Furthermore, the sum pumped by the CBE into some banks ($400 million) would meet only part of importers' demands, something which would eventually make them return once again to dealings with the unofficial market so as to secure their foreign exchange needs.
Economist Dr. Mohamed Abdel Fadhil expects the state of instability to continue in the foreign exchange market unless the government secures free currencies needs. He pointed out that reliance on the reserve would be an impractical measure especially as the implementation of the development plan and raising growth rates would require further free currencies. In addition, we cannot go on drawing from that reserve. He suggested setting up an operation room to follow up such matters on a daily basis and to recommend the appropriate rectification measures to avoid the dollar uncontrollable hike once again.
This step was taken through the French group subscription in increasing the capital of BNP Paribas Le Caire recently by 21.3 million dollars (about 130 million pounds), he said.

A report by the Holding Company for Cotton Weaving and Textile uncovered that prices of cotton allocated for domestic spinneries increased by over 70% this year in comparison to last year. This increase included Qebli (Upper Egyptian), Giza-85 and Giza-89 cotton brands. Medium-staple cotton on international markets also increased in the last few weeks by over 20%.
However, the problem lies in the fact that banks do not provide the allocations required for importing cotton while the affiliates of the Holding Company had supplied more than 200 million dollars to the Central Bank of Egypt and commercial banks out of the revenues of cotton exports and weaving products.
The bidding companies are divided into two groups: the first includes a number of individual companies of different nationalities (Turkish, English, Japanese, Italian, Korean, Chinese and French), while the second group includes participations with Egyptian companies at the forefront of which are the Arab Contractors with the two Spanish companies of FCC and OHL, Orascom with Japanese Tatsei, Saudi "Bin Laden" with an American company, General Nile for Roads and Bridges with a Turkish company, Lebanese "Arabian" with a Dutch company, in addition to two companies from Britain and China.

He pointed out the importance of considering the formation of joint service entities affiliated to the council with the capacity to submit marketing studies and do translation work as well as other services in return for some charges to contribute to meeting the needs of businessmen in the two countries.
Member of the Egyptian-Russian business council, Ahmed Salem Mashhour emphasized that it was necessary to expedite setting up the trade center in Egypt and Russia to play an important role in solving the problems that face businessmen in Egypt and Russia and to transcend the obstacles to getting entry visas to Russia as well as bank dealings.
The meeting will also review the situation on the exchange market following a week of relative stability.
For their part, economic sources disclosed the reasons behind the inconsistent statements by both the Egyptian and Syrian sides regarding the deal of importing 150 thousand tons of wheat on which Egypt negotiates with Syria.
GOVT INTENT ON PUMPING INVESTMENT VALUED AT $13.6 BILLION TO ACTIVATE REAL ESTATE MARKET
It was agreed that the General Authority for Urban Communities would obtain 10% of the unit price as a down payment in case the lessee desired to possess the unit, said a Housing Ministry official. Such a system would impose low interest rates on the remaining installments, he said, pointing out that that would activate the real estate market, especially in new cities.
The plan also aims at developing the potable water sector by taking daily production volume up to 20,402,000 cubic meters with investments valued at 30 billion pounds, thus increasing the per capita quota of water to 275 liters daily in all governorates; 215 liters in small cities; 125 liters in villages whose population is more than 10 thousands and 100 liters in villages where population is less than 10 thousands.
Food and beverage inflation rate recorded in July last increased to 7% against 6.7% in June. Clothes and garments inflation rate also surged up to 1.8% in comparison to 1.3% in the reporting period, the report said.
Under the nose of the bodies concerned in Egypt, a security company in Alexandria, in cooperation with its branch in Cairo and several other labour recruitment companies, has been implementing the biggest conspiracy against the Egyptian youth and the Egyptian security alike.
The salaries have been fixed as follows: $500 for intermediate qualifications, $1000 for university certificates and $2000 for police and army retired officers. The contractor would get $1000 for each person sent to work without having to offer any compensation in case of death. The contractees will be assigned the job of guarding Iraqi oil installations and oil pipelines in the Iraqi desert which are exposed to sabotage operations at the hands of the Iraqi resistance. They will also be tasked to spearhead the American forces during storming Iraqi commando houses or inspection operations which are carried out inside various Iraqi homes and sites.
Such a crime is regarded as one of the gravest crimes facing Egyptian national security as anybody who would sign a contract would not be able to object to any task assigned to them by the American forces regarding such dirty jobs.
Engineer Mohamed Abdel-Gawad, head of the Central Administration for Locusts Affairs, emphasized that heavy rainfall threatens a strong flood, thus allowing locusts to reproduce and spread on southern Egyptian borders.
FAO presented a report pointing out that the locust threat to Egyptian borders was not certain at present as the neighbouring countries - Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Sudan and Libya - are free of locust swarms.
On the other hand, reports on bin Laden's family projects in Egypt point out that they possess major construction as well as import and export companies in addition to large cultivated areas and horse farms.
GARANG VISITED EGYPT, HIS FORCES RECEIVED $50 MILLION WORTH OF ISRAELI WEAPONS
The Israeli official vowed to provide all kinds of assistance for the southerners to achieve their political and military goals.
The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) will hold a seminar in Cairo in two days' time to discuss ways and means of confronting torture in light of international covenants as well as the legislative shortcomings in Egypt regarding protection from torture crimes and the penalties connected with it besides the legal protection from torture crimes in Egypt in light of the emergency law and the Egyptian Judiciary verdicts in torture cases.
Barakat added that the participants in the seminar would seek to offer proposals to amend the current legislation in light of the Egyptian constitution as a first step to promote the document which the organization would act for presenting it to the People's Assembly and Shura Council deputies as well as those concerned and civil society institutions.
According to Dr. Amr Hashim, an expert with Al-Ahram Political and Strategic Studies Center, the ruling NDP, Tagamo'h (Grouping), Al-Ahrar (Liberals), Al-Wafd, Labour and Nasserite parties can be called major parties, while small factions include Al-Ummah, Young Egypt, Justice and Solidarity, Democratic People's, National Concord, Generation, Greens, Misr Al-Arabi and Misr 2000 parties. The political factions have been cut down to size due to the nature of the electoral system, which does not stimulate political parties and makes small ones unable to win parliamentary seats in elections. Furthermore, party members are appointed or selected in unfair elections, with no fresh blood having been injected.
Their outdated planks cannot meet the requirements of this age.
Legal provisions are still a stumbling block to judicial efforts to soften such restrictions.
The third scenario is erosion and disintegration on the basis that being marginalized by main parties, small parties' sustained weakness and inability to do any effective political activity, will send them into erosion and disintegration.
The party system is not reliant on any unequivocal criteria, and the NDP noted that it has no ideologies though it has been founded for 20 years, Diaa Eddin Rashwan, a researcher, said.
Faruk al-Ashr, a member of the opposition Nasserite Party secretariat, said the multiparty system in Egypt is not a real one as it stemmed from the authority, rather than the political street to show a cultural diversification or interest connection or contradiction. Estates should be separated and the constitution should be amended, he said.
This has expressly appeared in the structure of prestigious clubs, in addition to the emergence of new clubs.
Such shifts have accordingly forced old members to flee to other new clubs that include specific society categories.
The club consists of three storeys; the first houses a meeting hall where pictures of all former club presidents, including Prince Muhammad Ali, Prince Muhammad Toson and Dr. Naguib al-Alaili, were hung.
There are special coffers on all storeys for members to keep their belongings such as cigarettes, drinks etc.
Applications should be recommended by two board members. An applicant's name is hung on the club walls for one month to give other members time to okay or oppose his application.
The club, he maintained, seeks to slim its membership so as to keep its high level, with no more than 30 members admitted on a yearly basis.
Ministers and ambassadors meet foreign delegations at the club.
Members should put on uniforms while they are in the club, except when they are on the rooftop. Accompanying children is not allowed. Wedding, engagement, and birthday parties are not forbidden. But, brides are not allowed to wear a wedding dress, and loud music and trilling are tabooed.
It embraces swimming pools, jacuzzis and green land for diverse sports such as racquetball, football, golf, squash and water ball, in addition to Al-Mahrousa Island where wonderful parties are thrown.
It gives high levels of freedom. Furthermore, different clubs have recently emerged, largely relying on opulent members.
It also allows an annual temporary membership for 4,600 pounds per individual, 5,700 pounds per couple and 6,900 pounds per family.
A date for activities should be set in advance, and honourary memberships are forbidden.
The fatwa barred Arab and Muslim countries from dealing with the IGC or any country cooperating with it.
It, further, called on Muslims to get united to establish a legitimate Muslim government to be selected by the Iraqi people themselves in a bid to keep the Muslim identity of Iraq intact and bring stability there.
The Al-Azhar Fatwa Committee is one of the most august Islamic bodies worldwide, chaired by Sheikh Mohamed Ibrahim al-Fayoumi. Supervised by the Islamic Research Academy, the panel has a secretary-general and 7 members of
The committee called for cooperation between Health Ministry, Agriculture Ministry, Veterinary Services Authority and the ministers of environment, local government with the aim of besieging the disease as a prelude to putting an end to it.
For his part, Health Committee Chairman Dr Hamdi Al-Sayed criticized the government in this respect.
TEL AVIV RE-PROPOSES REVIVAL OF KIRKUK- HAIFA PIPELINE
EGYPT AGREES TO SELLING GAS TO ISRAEL FOR 20 YEARS
The Palestinian government, headed by Mahmoud Abbas (Abou-Mazen) has met the Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's decree to promote former chief of Protective Security in West Bank Jibril Al-Rajoub to a higher military rank with complete silence. Meanwhile, intensive negotiations and meetings in the Palestinian leadership were being held at various levels to endorse the appointment of Major General Nasr Youssef as Minister of the Interior within the framework of the efforts made to unify Palestinian security bodies under one umbrella, which Arafat seemed to oppose.
It seems that the Palestinian President's decree had come within the framework of his vision of the way the Palestinians ought to face American and Israeli pressure in light of his objections to abandoning the control of some of the state's security bodies including general intelligence department and Palestinian security forces neither of which is subject to the Palestinian Interior Ministry's authority whose internal security affairs are now the responsibility of Al-Dahlan.
In a videotape shown on Israeli Television, veiled members of Al-Aqsa Brigades who were carrying rifles pledged to kill Israeli premier Ariel Sharon as target No. 1.
The issues that will be probed mainly include ways and means of improving America's image in the Arab world through that dialogue, the last meeting of which was held in the Syrian capital in the period 6-8 January last. Results of that meeting were constructive and fruitful, according to the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The most prominent participants in these talks, who participate in their personal capacity as was the case in previous rounds, include Syrian deputy Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mu'allem and director of the External Media at the Syrian Foreign Ministry Dr. Buthaina Sha'ban in addition to a constellation of Syrian academicians and media men.
Oil, which constitutes 96% of America's imports from Saudi Arabia, and petrochemical products, though modest, played the key role not only in improving the bilateral trade exchange but also in achieving a unique surplus for Saudi Arabia to the value of $7.5 billion, which is tantamount to the surplus that Saudi Arabia achieved through its trade with America in 2001. This figure also equals 89% of last year's trade surplus.
DOUBTS ABOUT INTERBANK ABILITY TO ACCOMMODATE DOLLAR CRISIS
Al-Alam Al-Youm learnt that members of the Economic Group are in disagreement about the date when the dollar interbank mechanism would be launched. Some members of the group stress the necessity of launching the mechanism quickly, considering it one of the most important mechanisms to organize exchange rate because Egypt is in dire need of an organized market to deal in foreign exchange between banks. Other sources proposed that the interbank be delayed.
According to a chairman of a major investment bank, who asked for anonymity, a mechanism without goods would fail to work efficiently. Accordingly, launching the dollar interbank without providing foreign exchange liquidity would lead to nothing.
Egypt's foreign exhange resources are around 2 billion U.S. dollars more than spending rates, he told reporters. The country's foreign currency income totaled 22.1 billion U.S. dollars while sending did not exceed 20 billion U.S. dollars.
While officials defend the decision as an impressive step towards an adjusted and stable monetary market, some experts view it as untimely as no hard currencies were available to fend off the relevant fallout.
On the other hand, Dr. Mohamed Rashad Mosa, head of the economic committee in the Shura (Advisory) Council emphasized that the new government decree forces anybody inside Egypt to deal with the Egyptians in only Egyptian pound, which is a brave decree that could soon reflect on ensuring the heavy demand on the dollar and the pressure on the exchange market. This would be represented in the dollar rate of exchange retreat and evaluating it in Egyptian pounds within its real framework. The mechanisms of abidance by the implementation of decree 506 which forces travel agencies, hotels and dollar resource owners to deliver 75% of export proceeds would achieve the dollar reduction purpose and minimize speculations and all harmful practices and shrinkage of the black market.
Head of Egyptian Capital Market Authority Abdel Hamid Ibrahim said that a number of studies are being done to establish a private stock exchange where Cairo and Alexandria stock exchanges as well as 18 other institutions participate. He pointed out that the private sector would run that stock exchange which will be entirely subjected to the supervision and control of Egyptian Capital Market Authority.
The Authority prepared a number of organizational rules for the entry of the new shareholders at the beginning of the implementation of the new system on the bonds market. A mechanism to resolve disputes more easily and speedily, besides protecting dealers from non-trade risks was endorsed. There are also procedures to set up a fund for the same purpose aiming at making investment on the stock exchange safer and less risky.
A recent report released by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) showed on Monday that bank deposits surged up by 7.3 billion pounds over one month to 409.6 billion pounds in both local and foreign currencies.
The report ascribed the hike to growing credits given to the governmental sector, recording a rise of 4.7 billion pounds, up 4.6 percent, last June.
The proposed increase in interest rates ranges between 0.5% and 1%, they said, according to the cash liquidity and deposits of each bank.
Earlier, the CBE pumped half a billion dollars on the market, thus taking dollar's price down on the black-market, the noted, however, it went up once again to hit more than LE7 now.
The deposits in foreign currencies increased in all sectors, as the private sectors deposits increased by 1.39 billion pounds, while the public enterprise sector's deposits increased by 57 million pounds. The deposits of the family sector in the foreign currencies have also climbed to 79.8 billion pounds versus 77.1 billion pounds, a rise of 2.74 billion pounds.
An official banking source, on condition of anonymity, said that the retreat is basically due to Egypt's repayment of 70 million dollars of the external burdens that was due on an Egyptian major bank to an international bank as well as CBE paying 800 million dollars as due installments to Paris Club countries and the International Monetary Fund.
Thus, the trade balance deficit dwindled during that period from 19.2 billion pounds to 14.3 billion pounds.
The report warned that some 17.1% of the country's imports were consumer, luxurious, durable and non-durable commodities, whereas investment commodities constituted 12.5% and intermediary commodities, 39.8%.
The new factory, which cost 15 million pounds was set up in 6th of October City, produces CDs and DVDs with a view to meeting the domestic market's needs and exporting to Arab countries, as this is a main goal of the factory, Ibrahim told Al-Alam Al-Youm.
11 years have elapsed since the law no. 203 of 1991 was passed concerning the application of the privatization program. What has this program, then, achieved?
It is worth mentioning that three ministers ran the privatization program. The first is former premier Dr. Atef Sedqi, as the Ministry of Public Enterprise Sector was directly affiliated to him, then current Premier Dr. Atef Ebeid who was occupying the post of Public Enterprise Sector minister, and the third is the incumbent Minister Dr. Mokhtar Khattab. It is to be noted that 27 companies were put up for sale in the beginning and then they were reduced to 17 companies and then 10 companies.
The same thing happened with Qaha for foodstuff industries, as the government regained the company after its new owner, businessman Hassan Awf, stopped paying the installments due on him as well as workers salaries. The government also cancelled the contract of leasing the Rolls Factory to a German company after the latter violated the provisions of the contract.
Those who are responsible for the privatization program went through several conflicts with other ministries. Premier Atef Ebeid went into a conflict when he was a minister of Public Enterprise Sector with the then minister of supply Dr. Ahmed Geweili over the affiliation of consuming compounds. Dr. Geweili, however, managed to make these consuming compounds affiliated to his ministry.
Secretary General of Businessmen Association Dr. Ismail Othman said that the privatization program was forging ahead but it was suffering from sluggishness due to some local and international conditions. Some of these strategic hazards are related to social security inside Egypt. There is no doubt that the early retirement system led to the aggravation of the unemployment problem which is most serious for the Egyptian society in spite of all efforts.
According to a Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) report, the balance of bills and bonds hit 153.212 billion pounds, and the net balance of treasury bills amounted to 55.318 billion pounds, while the government's aggregate balances with the banks reached around 85.579 billion pounds.
Meanwhile, official economic sources warned against the risks of continuously rising debts and government's failure to restructure local debts.
The remarks came following a ministerial meeting with Premier Dr. Atef Ebeid on Monday in this respect.
LE151 BILLION INDUSTRIAL INVESTMENTS INSIDE THE COUNTRY & FREE ZONES
EGYPTIAN-JAPANESE PROGRAM TO TRAIN AFRICAN EXPERTS IN RICE CULTIVATION TECHNOLOGY
The program includes theoretical lectures on the methods of cultivation, high yield technologies, improving brands, the means of applying research results and technology transfer through agricultural extension bodies in Egypt.
A governmental report issued by the Foreign Trade Ministry said the number of projects financed by the CAID over the last five years amounted to 53, i.e. 57% of the total projects presented to the CAID by the Egyptian side to be financed.
Egypt is no more included in European Commission's list of main textile exporters to the EU countries. Tunisia and Morocco were the only biggest Arab countries in terms of textile exports.
Egypt and India will sign a memo of understanding between the ministries of agriculture in both countries to resume importing Indian meat according to specified standards that ensure meat safety and livestock health.
A protocol for cooperation in housing, reconstruction and planning was signed with Angola.
The Angolan minister called on Egyptian contractors to play a main role in reconstructing his country and training engineers.
AOI TO CONCLUDE IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS
In exclusive statements to Asharq Al-Awsat, Hussein added that Iraq needs projects in all fields and that Iraqi industrialists and businessmen welcomed the AOI projects and were asking for minute details.
OUR EXPORTS TO MOROCCO RISE
The current reduction rate between Egypt and Morocco, according to the Great Arab Free Trade Zone Agreement, hits 60% as both countries are members of that zone. Morocco, nevertheless, stipulates for granting the discounts provided for in the agreement a previous approval from Moroccan Ministry of External Trade according to competition conditions of the domestic market and the degree of production sufficiency, which is regarded as an impediment to the Egyptian exporter.
It also highlights the importance of an Arab free trade zone in embodying several economic alternatives that promote ability to protect Arab economic interests and resist pressures exerted by international monopoly centers.
Partnerships signed by Arab countries are still incapable of securing fair access of Arab-made products and services to foreign markets, especially for Arab products enjoying a highly competitive edge such as petrochemicals, ready-made clothes, farm produce and some foodstuffs, the report indicated, adding that the foreign partner takes advantage of open Arab markets in light of existing partnerships.
These remarks were declared during the meeting of Syrian Minister of Higher Education with head of James Baker Institute for General Policy (JBIGP) who doubles as chairman of the consultative group for general diplomats of Arab and Islamic worlds.
The Arab Biophysics Conference held in Cairo on Monday warned against growing Israeli nuclear power and the threats it posed to the balance of power in the Middle East. Participant scientists called Arabs to exert great pressure on international community to impose international law, promote standards of justice and stop double-standard policy in international relations.
The Participants also recommended that the Arab Foreign Ministers Council should deal seriously with this case through starting an international investigation, especially as this radioactive contamination constituted a flagrant violation of relevant international laws.
Official sources with the Arab League (AL) and the American Embassy in Cairo denied rumours circulated about a US request to attend the official meetings of Arab Foreign Ministers Council as an observer.
NO FUTURE WAR ON WATER: MINISTER
Egypt will never allow the passage of polluted water in the Al-Salam (peace) Canal. Sustained efforts are exerted to thwart the passage of polluted water from Delta to Sinai, he added.
JEWISH COUNCIL: PILGRIMAGE TO AL-AQSA A RELIGIOUS DUTY
In their new religious opinion, the rabbis call upon Jews to perform pilgrimage to the Al-Aqsa Mosque with guidance from "the rabbis of the Temple, considering entering the sanctity as a Jewish religious duty.
Before the war, Rumsfeld had put it at a couple of years at most. Now, however, dates have become open and vague.
He, nonetheless, had to carry the military the good news which he had scarcely wished to carry. He told them that international forces would come to their succor, adding that international financial contributions to the reconstruction process have become likely.
According to him, everything would have been alright but for foreign interventions in Iraq!
While the Americans are now seeking the UN's help, France and Germany seem quite satisfied with these developments which confirm that they were realistic in objecting to the war.
One of the most important points Rumsfeld aimed at is to closely examine the feasibility of activating the role of Iraqi forces to help the American forces. Even optimistic estimates can see no feasibility of such a move until next spring, which means that the need to international forces and funds is ineluctable.
Well-informed sources said that anybody who received judicial sentences at the beginning of the new sessions of those councils would have his membership dropped in respect of the judiciary verdicts and the binding constitutional court explanation and in confirmation of the equality of all elected or appointed members of those councils including the Shura (Advisory) Council.
On the other hand, legal sources emphasized that the administrative court verdicts are regarded as legal and constitutional pretext, especially as those courts announced that the local council member who proves to be a draft dodger cannot retain his seat in those councils as his membership would be null and void.
Although the American sources stressed that the American ambassador's meeting with Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh had been scheduled 3 weeks earlier, Sheikh Al-Esh's fatwa imposed itself on the ambassador's meeting who thought that Al Azhar's Fatwa Committee wanted to undermine the American efforts to maintain peace in the Middle East.
In an attempt to find a way out of the crisis and to avoid embarrassment before the American ambassador, Al Azhar Grand Sheikh emphasized that the "fatwa" did not represent Al Azhar in the least, simply because no Egyptian schlolar is entitled to talk about any country. He added that he is the only authority who is entitled to talk on behalf of Al Azhar, but he could not meddle with the affairs of Iraq's scholars.
The quandary embarrassed Al Azhar Grand Sheikh Dr. Mohamed Sayed Tantawi especially before the American ambassador who lost no time in visiting the Grand Sheikh to inquire about the truth. The Grand Sheikh, then, denied that such a fatwa represented his point of view, God Forbid, but was rather a personal opinion of one of Al-Azhar Fatwa committee's members and therefore had nothing to do with Al Azhar official point of view. Immediately, a decree was passed warning against giving religious opinions of political matters. The warning was addressed to all members of the Fatwa Committee and the Islamic Research Academy.
Because the Sheikh was at his car's door (a black Mercedes) ready to head for Munufeya governorate, he was in such a hurry that he allowed me to ask one question only: Do you think that resistance operations against American occupation which took place in Iraq are commando operations and jihad (holy struggle) in the cause of God and their Iraqi victims, therefore, are regarded as martyrs?
A: To pass a fatwa on that issue is regarded as interference in Iraqi affairs. Iraq has erudite scholars who can pass whatever fatwas they want to pass. Fatwa Committee is responsible for the jurisprudence affairs of Egyptian Muslims. If, however, a question was posed by any Muslim from outside Egypt, it is the Islamic Research Academy rather than Al Azhar Fatwa Committee which is responsible for replying to it.
Q: Iraq's people are repressed, crushed and occupied.
Q: The matter does not need being in Iraq as mass media and satellite channels conceal nothing so much so that anybody who wants to know will certainly know.
A: If Al Azhar Grand Sheikh's reactions were against the content of the fatwa, Al Azhar scholars are supporting it full-heartedly in form and content. Eminent Islamic thinker, Dr. Abdel Sabour Marzouk says: I've told members of the IGC that they are traitors and agents and came on the point of American gun wishing to rule Iraq.
Well-known Islamic thinker, Dr. Ahmed Kamal Aboul Majd thinks that the IGC did not represent the Iraqi people.
Thirdly: the increase of the economic cost of the American presence in the region.
Apart from arguing that the IGC lacks religious legitimacy, isn't it the natural procedure for the people to choose with absolute freedom those who are going to rule it rather than just have them appointed by an occupation power that has no legitimate presence. Any practices by such a council will, therefore, be illegitimate.
I think that by boycotting the present conditions we would be committing a sort of political cowardice as occupation is there and it is we who have caused it through our weakness and disunity. America, after all, has not occupied Iraq against the Arab rulers' will. If America is the sponsor of Arab rulers why is that fear of the council?
Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) General Guide Ma'moun al-Hudheibi welcomed a growing attitude within the Egyptian opposition left-wing Tagamo'h (grouping) Party towards supporting the right of Islamic groups to establish political parties.
A religious party in the sense of the European concept during the Middle Ages when the church acted as a legislate no longer exists, he said. He added, "There is no Islamic party, but it can be said that there are people who have a religious term of reference.
Raising his eyebrows at Sharon's call for Egypt's cooperation in squaring up to border drug running and illegal activities which now harm the Israeli government, Bassiouni said, "Now and after they made sure that such tunnels are used in arm smuggling and anti-Israel activities, they are calling for cooperation, even though they didn't used to cooperate as it is the Egyptian side which was affected by such activities. I basically have reservations about the idea of using the Egyptian borders in smuggling arms to the Palestinian side as Egypt can never be engaged in such activities. Events of the past years refute Sharon's claims. Egypt takes immediate moves when the Egyptian government suspects border illegal activities.
Senior researcher with Land, Water and Environment Research Institute of the Egyptian Agriculture Ministry Dr. Mahmud Helmi told Asharq Al-Awsat that Cairo produces 15,000 tons of refuse daily. A ton of rubbish could provide eight job opportunities in refuse collection, sorting out and manufacturing, he said. Small yet civilized countries such as the Vatican and Luxembourg tag refuse as " urban mines" due to its richness in several useful materials used in processing industries.
As regards organic components such as animal bones, he said, they are frozen and sold at high prices as organic fertilizers for newly-reclaimed lands. Animal bones are sold at LE350-450 per ton. Fats and lubricants are extracted from animal bones and then used in producing soap, detergents, and glutinous substances. Residues are taken and ground to be used as fodders or in bleaching crude sugar.
Several members involved had obtained court rulings giving them the right to contest any elections. But, the court's recent interpretation came to escalate the legal debate on the issue.
Egyptian Minister of Social Insurance Dr Amina Al-Gindy criticized an EgyptAir official at Cairo International Airport for preventing her from travelling to Germany on flight 773 heading for Munich because the visa the minister had would start on September 14th.
The signing ceremony was attended by premier, Dr. Atef Ebeid.
EGYPT TO SUPPLY ISRAEL WITH NATURAL GAS
Maariv noted that that company was scheduled to supply Israel with some 1.7 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually.
The BMW group has decided to invest 60 million U.S. dollars in the Egyptian market following 18 months of hard circumstances that undermined its competitiveness at the market.
Certain milieus, including the BMW represented by Abul-Fotouh as of early 1980s, helping him win much fame, riveted their attention on the economic aspect of the issue.
An official of the Bavaria for Cars stressed the necessity of regaining the confidence of the Egyptian market first and then other markets in the region.
Following his return from a visit to Syria, Dr Hassan Yunis said that in activation of bilateral relations between Egypt and Syria in the fields of electricity, it was agreed to set up joint projects to manufacture electric equipment in Syria and to encourage the Egyptian private sector to set up specialized companies to produce transformers and electric cables in cooperation with both public and private sectors in Syria.
The sources said that what Israeli Exportation Institute mentioned last week regarding cooperation with Egypt was untrue, adding that there were no Israeli exports in the official commercial sense but only individual exports which could not be subjected to accurate stocktaking.
Data also showed a rise in Israeli exports to Jordan by 24%, thus reaching about $60 million compared with the corresponding period.
FRESH TAX ACT IGNORES MERGED BANKS
However, he expected that it might come to light and be strongly put forward with the increase of the probability that a big number of banks might merge in view of the enforcement of the fresh banking act provision.
Commercial private sector banks had already completed preparing a conception about their possession of a number of joint banks. A plan had been already proposed to the CBE, as the Egyptian National Bank of Egypt proposed to purchase the Commercial Development Bank (Al-Tegarioun). Banque Misr proposed to buy Misr Exterior Bank, whereas Bank of Alexandria offered to buy the Islamic International Bank for Investment and Development. However, the three banks linked between the possession of the joint banks and granting them certain financial advantages, which has not been decided upon yet,
Minister of Information Safwat al-Sharif said the cabinet touched upon the price balance of several commodities, mainly chickens and meat, whose prices have recently shot up.
The Federation of Industries has set nine main points to develop its activities until June next year through its multi-activity drive.
Meanwhile, the blueprint provides for boosting the federation's relations with strategic allies at the internal, Arab and foreign levels, and establishing an advisory industrial council involving influential institutions specialized in industry and relevant services, whether they are financial, political, economic, research or tax bodies, with a view to introducing fresh mechanisms to serve industry, boost the industrial community's political role, support resources, optimally use the federation's available capabilities and set a temporary organizational structure for the federation to put the urgent drive in place.
Only one month earlier, he decided to stop exporting rice. The latter decision is still valid even though the new crop has been harvested and piled in stores.
He added, "Exporters whether from the private sector or the enterprise sector have made untiring efforts to open such markets and it would be difficult to restore them once they are lost."
Non-governmental deposits in Egyptian pound are distributed, according to sectors, as follows: Public Enterprise Sector, 12.7 billion pounds; private business sector, 30.2 billion pounds; familial sector; 188.3 billion pounds; and foreign world (non-residents) sector, 466 million pounds. As for non-governmental deposits in foreign currencies, they are distributed as follows: Public Enterprise Sector, the equivalent of 2.9 billion pounds; private business sector, the equivalent of 26.6 billion pounds; familial sector, the equivalent of 79.9 billion pounds; and non-residents sector, the equivalent of 866 million pounds.
He emphasized that the volume of dollar deposits with banks increased from 17.5 billion dollars in 2000 to 21.6 billion dollars till last August due to the so-called dollarization phenomenon.
"We should not be hasty in gathering the fruit of deregulating the pound rate of exchange. All economists expected the depreciation of the pound, but it is difficult to guess how long this situation will continue.
BANKERS REPLY TO CBE ACCUSATIONS
It is estimated that the pound has lost 81% of its value in the last three years.
He added that from the time of the deregulation till the end of October, the banks and the exchange companies proceeds of foreign exchange hit $4.376 billion, 13% more than the proceeds achieved in the corresponding period last year.
Aboul-Oyoun emphasized the importance of restoring confidence in the pound. Any decision, however, should be carefully studied such as the amendment of interest rates which could reduce the dollarization process, but would reduce the volume of business and cause too heavy pressure on businessmen.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES, CUSTOMS DOLLAR CONFINED CAR MARKET
Such an increase is attributed to the rise of customs dollar and the rise of other foreign currencies like Japanese yen, sterling pound, euro before dollar. Additionally opening credits in banks focuses on strategic goods, while banks consider car as luxury goods.
In the last month, each 100 yens equaled 5.25 pounds while now each 100 yans equal 5.52 pounds, a differential of 25 piasters, thus leading to a differential of 2000 pounds in car customs, Al-Gheriani said. The euro, in its turn, affects the increase of car prices, as the euro equals to 1.18 dollars. The rise of foreign currency rates such as euro and yen before dollar as well as customs are the two reasons behind the rise of cars prices, he said. The following are some examples for car price rise, the price of an automatic full-option Toyota increased from 110,000 pounds two months ago to 139 thousand pounds nowadays. The price of a fifth generation full-option Toyota whose price was earlier ranged between 120,000 and 124,000 jumped to 139 thousand pounds and the Toyota with air conditioner and power steering soared from 102 thousand pounds to 121 thousand pounds, he said.
Al-Basioni expected that car prices would witness stability in the coming two months.
This coincides with the invitation of a number of Arab and Egyptian banks to contribute to funding the foreign trade of Iraq through a consortium formed by the Iraqi Foreign Trade Bank including a number of international banks such as American GB Morgan Chess Bank, Standard Chartered Group and the National Bank in Kuwait.
Despite the risks that impede the entry of Egyptian banks at present, Hisham Hassan thinks that such entry would later on represent support of Egyptian companies and investment opportunities or they would contribute to financing the Iraqi trade.
For his part, Hilmi Al Said, director of Investment Trustees in Misr Banque said that theoretically, Egyptian banks were ready to enter the Iraqi market due to the needs of such a market at present regarding competition and reconstruction.

Under this headline, Ghassan Sherbel of Al-Hayat wrote an article on page 9, which ran to the following effect: There has been a spectrum of angry, denouncing and condemning reactions to the assassination of Ayatollah Mohmed Baker Al-Hakim.
The massacre is a warning that the disputes that take place on their land might undermine their country's unity or awaken the tangential lines between different sects and nationalities.
I do not think that the Americans can prevent the Iraqis from such agreement or from exchanging concessions and the guarantees to shorten the span of occupation and close the arena.
This means that the region's countries should avoid adding fuel to the fire and ought, therefore, to urgently support every effort to shorten the occupation span and close the Iraqi arena.
The region cannot stand a bloody Iraqi chaos and Iraq should, therefore, be prevented from committing suicide.
They emphasized that such a matter had hidden motives related to the heinous campaign against Saudi Arabia daily. They said they would have preferred to throw such a form away in the face of the American embassy officials as the matter was so degrading to the citizens as Saudi Arabia was the location of revelation. They wondered how the American Administration would react if such questions were included in the visa forms which Americans coming to Saudi Arabia had to fill in. They called for stopping that incitement as well as other provocative procedures like the print and the intensified control as if everybody were regarded as terrorists until the reverse is proven. The form includes other tiring questions about social and financial positions, relatives and bank accounts.

MOSSAD IN BAGHDAD FOR SECURITY COOPERATION WITH AMERICANS
Earlier this week, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameni noted on the sidelines of his meeting with military and political leaderships that an Israeli delegation had visited Baghdad. However, he did not underline the mission or nature of this delegation.
From among such political and sectarian spectrum, which constitutes Iraq, came the formation of the first Iraqi cabinet after Saddam Hussein's regime had been toppled. The new cabinet was announced in Baghdad yesterday (Monday).
Correspondents and mediamen know Zibari as an open-minded personality who runs press conferences tactfully. Observers in Baghdad, nonetheless, think that some Arab ministers might find some embarrassment in his capacity as an Arab country's foreign minister. A source close to Zibari emphasizes that the latter "will not represent the Kurds or his party" but will represent Iraq and take care of the interests of all its sects and nationalities.

IRAQ AND SYRIAN PRAGMATISM
Syria can also say it will not receive any representatives of Iraqi authorities born under occupation.
Syria may not have any interest in the success of the American original programme that assumed the ability to change the region through the construction of an Iraqi democratic model, the rays of which would infiltrate into neighbouring countries.
It could also have paused at the Iranian pragmatism in dealing with that council..

ISRAELI SOURCES TALK ABOUT PLAN TO EXPEL ARAFAT TO LIBYA
- Expulsion: storming his office after the complete siege and occupation of the Palestinian presidency headquarters and the attempt to arrest him in person and then expelling him to an Arab country.
The plan was prepared in April, 2002 or rather four months after the Israeli air forces bombed Arafat's headquarters all over the Palestinian territories and destroyed two helicopters which he used and Gaza International Airport.
However, they ordered the army to implement it piecemeal.
After apparently feeling the pulse of such countries, no approval was granted to the idea and there was, therefore, a shift to imposing it upon an enemy state like Lebanon, Sudan, Libya or Algeria.
Al-Azhar announced intentions to hold an international conference to bring Islamic sects together during the period from October 4th to 6th this year.

The British market's complaints about Egyptian exports concentrated in the issue of specifications and delivery dates.
Concluding his interview with Al-Alam Al-Youm, the ambassador appealed to the Egyptian businessmen not to hesitate to contact Egyptian embassy in London and its specialized departments and to contact him personally to maximize economic cooperation and trade exchange between the two countries.

The Egyptian delegation congratulated the Russian party on having Russia's name removed from the list of non-cooperative countries in anti money laundering.
BUSINESSMEN AND LOST RUSSIAN MARKET!
Despite the growing improvement in Egypt's exports to Russia during the period January-August 2003 where they are valued at about 29.7 million dollars, such figures are still meager.
The decision taken by the Egyptian-Russian Committee, which was held in Cairo late last October, should be put into effect, especially as far as the establishment of an Egyptian house in Moscow and a Russian house in Cairo was concerned so that the two parties could be familiarized with their products and facilitate contracts and transactions, Sheha added.
Direct contact between businessmen is considered an important means through which Egyptian commodities and products could access the Russian market, in addition to other possible means and mechanisms, Bata said.
Al-Menoufi stressed the necessity of coordinating the efforts of governmental or private sector organizations to face such problems and create suitable solutions.
The study compiled by the Egyptian commercial representation office in Tokyo, Japan, offered five proposals to increase our aluminum and stainless steel pots. The study calls for abiding by the Japanese laws organizing importation of these products and that a clarification of the product's specifications, advantages and means and privileges of usage should be attached to the product. The study also proposed the provision of a guarantee to multilayer stainless steel pots ranging between 5 and 15 years and presenting export offers that suit the competitive situation on the Japanese market on one hand and price, quality and the way the Japanese citizen uses them on the other hand.
The study also uncovered the desired specifications according to the input of this industry and according to the needs of the Japanese consumer. As regards the aluminum pots, they should be of light weight, thermal conductivity, reasonable price and they should not be easily affected with acids..
The JETRO suggested a set of proposals to boost Egypt's exports to Japan including permanent participation of Egyptian companies in international specialized exhibitions held in Japan and sending well-prepared commercial promotional missions there, the study pointed out.

The fatwa added that Islam had made it impermissible to seek medical treatment or cure by using substances made impermissible by God Almighty as the Prophet P.B.U.H. said, "God Almighty has not let your cure be in things made impermissible for you." So it is only logical that the same rule applies to cosmetics containing lard as eating pork was prohibited in the Holy Koran. The same also applies to lipsticks that contain alcohol. All such innovations have been made by companies that operate against man honoured by God Almighty and given the best form and shape.
He went on to say that instead of responses of joy and support, no attention whatsoever was given to the matter by any Arab radio station or newspaper In his word, Gaddafi emphasized that his country did not need to make any mass destruction weapons or intercontinental ballistic missiles or atomic, chemical or microbiological bombs.

AMERICAN PROGRAM FOR TRAINING ARAB JOURNALISTS
Pope Shenuda III, Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of Saint Mark Episcopate, unveiled that during his visit to Australia he received threats of assassination by organizations defending perversion.

SON OF EGYPTIAN ANNOUNCER KILLED ON LIBYAN PLANE DOWNED BY ISRAEL INTENDS TO ASK MUBARAK AND GADDAFI TO STEP IN
"We want to tell everybody that the Egyptian and Arab blood is not cheaper than the French or American blood", he added.
"I expected that the official bodies in my country would summon me and help me as a citizen who is entitled to restore a lost right. But, this has not taken place and they officially ignored me though ordinary people volunteered and provided me with all information and official documents related to the stricken plane incident", he said.
Well-informed and official sources in Al-Azhar told Al-Majalla that Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh, Mohamed Sayed Tantawi decided to decrease the number of Fatwa Committee members from 23 to 7 members only who will be changed on a weekly basis. Tantawi also decreed that the Fatwa Committee members should not issue any fatwas as far as political issues are concerned, confining their fatwas to personal status only. The committee members should not, under any circumstances, give statements to mass media especially newspapers. The only one who is entitled to give statements to mass media is Secretary General of Da'wa (Islamic Call) and Religious Media Sheikh Sayed Wafaa Abu Aggour, who doubles as Board Chairman of Fatwa in Al-Azhar.
IRA member for economic affairs Dr Shawki Al-Fangari said, "No one can say that if Tantawi is of that opinion then we can safely say he does not know the role of Al-Azhar. Islam is not such a national religion that there can be a fatwa for Egypt and another for Iraq.
Fatwa Committee will not be disbanded, but its members were firmly asked not to speak to mass media as far as political affairs are concerned, as this should be left to Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh."
The society which has been recently set up under the pretext of the preservation of Jewish heritage filed a request to that effect with the Foreign Ministry via Egyptian embassy in France.
The participation of any foreign body through any operation will be considered, discussed and probed into to know how far it complies with that law. According to information to which Al-Ahram Iktissadi got access, the society's request did not as much aim at the Jews' contribution of any financial support to protect their alleged heritage, antiquities or property in Egypt prior to their exodus as they aimed at contributing to excavation expertise by participating with their Egyptian counterparts in renovation processes.
It seems that Israel has not been convinced of the Peace Accord it signed with Egypt and even fears of what happened and will happen in this large Arab country. Therefore, it has been collecting data, monitoring and following up all that has to do with Israel or with Islamic groups.
Diplomatic representation between Egypt and Israel is quite strange, which urged some People's Assembly deputies to ask the government to put an end to the dubious role practised by the Israeli embassy. They also called on the government to explain why there are a large number of Israeli diplomatic corps in Cairo that equals the number of the diplomatic corps of five Arab countries.
Espionage The accusations leveled at the Israeli embassy in Cairo are mostly attributed to its role in espionage operations with regard to the large number of its diplomats.
Stepping out of line "The Israeli embassy stepped out of line, transgressed its role as diplomatic representation and contact bridge between the two countries only to be a source for many special reports on different political aspects in Egypt," said former Egyptian Ambassador to Tel Aviv and head of the Shura Council's Foreign Affairs and National Security Committee Mohamed Bassouni. "Some Israeli diplomats in Cairo may even suspiciously visit a number of Upper Egyptian governorates."
In his memoirs, Sassoon tells a story about his meeting with an extremist bearded youth at Al-Eskandarani's store.
A report issued by Cairo-based Middle East Studies Center points out that all Egypt's sectors have become targeted and that the Israeli embassy has become preoccupied with monitoring everything in the Egyptian society.
Hashish came second by 8.11 percent out of a total of around 1080 kilograms of recovered drugs, a hike of 122 percent over 2001, followed by heroin, 7.5 percent, and depression tablets and opium came fourth and fifth respectively, it said.
In his lawsuit to be heard by the State Council Administrative Judiciary Court on October 5, he said Minister of Wakfs Mahmoud Hamdi Zaqzoq and Gamal Abdel-Nasser, who is in charge of endowments in Helwan, persistently poked their noses in his speeches and lessons though he is an emeritus professor of Al-Azhar University.
An official source with the Foreign Ministry told Al-Hayat newspaper the ministry " did not want Al-Ashal's resignation to be a front page news". "However, he insisted on making himself a hero and a victim though he is not," the source said.
"There was nothing personal between Maher and Al-Ashal," the source added, noting that the Diplomatic Corps Affairs Council had imposed a penalty on Al-Ashal during Amr Moussa's term of office.
In case they disregarded his views and he felt conscience-stricken, he should hand in his resignation, the source said.
It also came to show that the government is still keeping its several-year policy based on dealing abortive blows to the group and its activities, restricting its moves to unions, unofficial media and parliament.
MP ASKS SENIOR OFFICIALS TO ANNOUNCE FINANCIAL POSITIONS
"My proposal is not meant to embarrass political leaderships but rather set an example for the whole society to restore financial and administrative discipline in a new fashion," he added, noting that investigations carried out in the last couple of years have shown rampant administrative corruption and practices; a thing that necessitates bringing officials to book and putting emphasis on the transparency principle.
In the Holy Council's meeting chaired by Pope Shenuda, tension seemed to dominate the meeting not because of the Red Sea Monastry but because of a decision taken by the episcopal church in New Hampshire in America to appoint the homosexual bishop Jane Robinson as bishop.
He pointed out that the church in Egypt adhere to the injunctions of the Holy Bible and declares that homosexuality is a sin and debauchery.
AL-AZHAR DENOUNCES ATTEMPT TO ASSASSINATE SHEIKH YASSIN
The sinful deplorable aggression, which was perpetrated by Israeli fighters to assassinate Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, violates the teachings of divine religions and is punishable by all positivist laws, he said.
On September 23rd, Al-Arish Court will examine a lawsuit filed against Israeli Premier Ariel Sharon for his responsibility for torturing Egyptian POWs, killing and burying some of them alive during the Israeli occupation of Sinai in 1967 and asking him to pay a civil compensation to the value of LE60 billion.

Saudi Arabia is famous for producing and exporting high-quality dried dates. The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is discussing with its embassies in European countries measures that can be taken against Israeli forgers in line with international trade regulations.
The Palestinian green light to Europe was made under American pressure and Palestinian desire to push the movement into a tight corner in order to end its resistance acts through denying its elements access to finance, the sources said.
Such an option will never be dropped by Israel with Abu Alaa at the head of the new government, which would return the negotiations once again to start from scratch.
Even Sharon will not take the initiative of feigning a bet on new Palestinian partner, as he did very maliciously with Abbas in order to distance him from Arafat while accusing the latter of conspiring against the Palestinian premier to abort his efforts to turn a new dialogue's leaf with Israel.
Nor did his Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom feel ashamed when he talked about the Hebrew state "ethics" as it tried to avoid hitting civilians during Yassin's hunt!
4 REASONS BEHIND ABU MAZEN'S RESIGNATION
Second: After accepting the resignation, Arafat will assign another person to form a new government. The new Palestinian Prime Minister should be accepted by Palestinians, Israelis, Americans and Arabs. The first nominee for this position is Abu-Alaa, said a Palestinian official who demanded his name remain anonymous.
Others nominate Fatah Central Committee member and Minister of Foreign Affairs Nabil Shaath.
By so doing, he avoided a vote of no confidence against him and his government if he remained in his position while there are differences with Arafat.
The third reason is the demonstrations staged by Fatah youths and members of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, the military wing of Fatah who chanted slogans against him and his Security Minister Dahlan including "O Abu Ammar (Arafat), tread on every traitor and spy," "O Abbas, O Dahlan, you sold the nation to the Americans," and "The Central Committee is dishonoured by collaborators and traitors," in an allusion to the resignation of Abu Mazen.
In his speech before the Legislative Council, Abu Mazen said he was facing an Israeli rejection of all of his demands and futile American statements to support him that only embarrassed him.
No sooner had the resignation been announced than Israel started to act in a way that confirmed what Abbas meant when he accused it of obstructing his work. It sent its military planes to assassinate Hamas leader and mounted a political campaign to blame Abu Mazin's resignation on Yasser Arafat and, consequently, demand his expulsion.
More importantly, despite all differences with Arafat, he could not imagine himself to be premier while the Israelis are attacking the Palestinian President's headquarters in a bid to expel or kill him.
If Abu Mazen on whom the Americans and the Israelis betted could not stand the ploy, which other premier can take up the task and successfully do it while ignoring the people and the President together?
Let Javier Solana who is worried about the roadmap calm down, as it was Sharon rather than Arafat who killed the roadmap! If the European official is not able, due to American reasons, to blame the Israeli premier all the words he would utter will be valueless!
What is demanded now of the Palestinians is to do what has never been yet achieved, a unified leadership of all factions, clear-cut decisions to continue the uprising by adopting new techniques and a unified political discourse to restore understanding with the international public opinion!
According to the warning, all of Egypt, not just Sinai, Jordan and all Arab countries are very dangerous destinations for Israeli tourists to visit as they might be subjected to kidnapping and assault from ultras and Islamic elements.
QUREIA'S BIOGRAPHY
Abu Alaa is considered one of the architects of Oslo agreements. While the Palestinian negotiating delegation, which was formed of Palestinian leaderships in the West Bank and Gaza Strip under veteran Palestinian leader Dr. Haidar Abdel-Shafi were attending Madrid conference sponsored by the USA and the Soviet Union, Abu Alaa, was secretly tasked by President Arafat, to discuss the possibility of reaching a political settlement in Norway with representatives from Israeli government headed by Yitzhak Rabin,.
In 1995, through his position together with Israel's minister of finance, he could reach the Paris Economic Agreement which organized economic relations between Israel and the nascent Palestinian entity.
Abu Alaa has met several times with the current Israeli Premier Ariel Sharon on his own farm.
During a seminar named "Iraq between war and peace", the bishop said, " Iraq, formerly one of the richest countries in the world, has turned into one of the world's poorest countries.
Maronite Archbishop of Beirut Polis Yusef Matar noted, "political, religious and cultural values played a crucial role in peace in Iraq", adding that anti-terror campaign has turned into a confrontation between different religions. Peace could be achieved through an Arab-Christian dialogue characterized by openness and mutual respect, he opined.
Iskenderun Port is affiliated to Syria rather than Turkey, Murad said, warning that Iraqi Kurds will help Syria restore it unless Turkey stops its interference in North Iraq affairs and Kirkuk in particular.
The new Jordanian measures, which exclude patients and those who have visa, aim to limit Iraqis' entry to Jordan, not receive any refugees and ban the infiltration of foreign fighters.
Jordan's Muslim Brotherhood said that such an attitude was tantamount to a declaration of war on our Islamic nation in toto and that the matter was simply a new crusade.
FRANCE ADVISES ARAB COUNTRIES TO RECOGNIZE IRAQI GOVERNING COUNCIL
You are aware of the attention we attach to stability in this region in general and this country in particular. We have taken very specific positions on the situation, especially the political one, in Iraq.
U.S. President George W. Bush's speech last night (Sunday) was articulate in this point.
This actuality should be the base. The governing council should be granted power to restore Iraq's sovereignty."
15 ISRAELI MOSSAD ELEMENTS DEPORTED FROM IRAQ
Through facing the Mossad elements with the facts reached by CIA experts, the Israelis denied the charge or knowledge of such explosives.

On his way to Riyadh, the American Ambassador in Saudi Arabia lauded Saudi Arabia's efforts to confront terrorism. He accused Washington's critics of Saudi Arabia of ignorance.
Saudis work round the clock and in complete cooperation with us.
He went on to say that the Saudis had forged ahead with the reform agenda more enthusiastically, especially in the field of economic reform.
It also suggested that every one million Arab citizens be represented by a single member of the proposed Arab parliament, with each country whatever its population having to be represented by at least four members or 40 members at most. Each country can be transitionally represented by ten members to be chosen by their respective parliaments for five years. Once transition comes to a close, the relative representation principle according to population and controls to be set by the unified Arab parliament can be put in place, the Egyptian side suggested.
The survey attributed this to several reasons, mainly the drop in oil earnings in the 1980s, the abysmal economic performance in the Arab region, the application by most Arab petroleum and non-petroleum countries of monetary and financial policies that are useful to address mounting foreign payment burdens as well as successive events since early last decade starting with the Kuwait Liberation War and its negative economic fallout affecting all Arab countries and wasting much money.
ARAB, MUSLIM TRAVELERS NEED FBI PERMIT TO ENTER BAGHDAD
An official with the Cairo-based US embassy stressed a US-Iraqi security committee was already formed, noting that the Cairo-based Iraq Consulate would make contacts with security officers in the American embassy and Iraq's embassies in other Arab countries to coordinate security aspects with them.
MORTGAGE ACT THREATENED WITH FAILURE AS GOVERNMENT BANKS WITHDRAW FROM REAL ESTATE FINANCING COMPANIES
However, this is not the first time for the foundation of real estate financing companies to face impediments as private sector companies had once refrained from paying their contributions to the foundation of the company, excluding one company that paid off part of the companies' quota amounting to about LE10 million. This, in return, led to the delay in operating companies although the company's foundation was announced over one year before.
Electricity companies incurred heavy losses this year owing to pressure for repaying the loans due to international finance bodies in hard currency, while prices of selling electricity have been stable since 1992. This was crystal clear in the reports of these companies' performance rate for the fiscal year that ended late June 2003. The general assemblies of the companies will discuss these reports on 16th November. Meetings will start with production companies, namely, East Delta, West Delta, Cairo, Upper Egypt, and hydroelectric stations.
The companies had borrowed these loans to set up huge power plants or to carry out great repairs to the existent power plants with the aim of improving their performance. It is to be mentioned that before turning Egypt Electricity Authority into a holding company, the companies used to repay their debts to government so that the Central Bank of Egypt might procure the hard currency to the finance bodies. However, the companies are committed to repaying their dues in hard currency or in the equivalent in Egyptian pound directly to the international finance bodies since Egypt Electricity Authority was turned into a holding company.
Prime Minister Atef Ebeid is expected to preside over a meeting this week to thrash out the ownership transfer procedures, said a cabinet source.
Insurances funds are estimated at over 200 billion pounds.
It was initially agreed that each bank would be represented in the company's board of directors according to its contributions' structure as both the NBE and Banque Misr would represent 80% of the board (40% each), while Banque du Caire and Bank of Alexandria would represent 20% equally. Another meeting is expected to be held next week to continue discussion of some outstanding issues including the nature of the company's activity and whether it would restructure capital of some of its affiliates and merge some companies according to their activities in compliance with the new situation as well as considering the possibility of injecting new credit to those companies to enable them to broaden the scope of their activities on the market.
Some bank officials said that the establishment of this company is surrounded with some mystery. The decision did not determine the work mechanism of that company or to what extent that mechanism contravened or transgressed against the authorities and the powers of public banks board of directors that would be mere pro forma ones to just implement decisions. Everybody calls for waiting till the practical experience of those companies and its merits and demerits for the banking sector are clear. Nonetheless, they unanimously agreed that that new company might deprive public banks representatives of participation in the board of directors of that joint venture. It is expected to mull over the proposals of public banks representation in the boards of these ventures, either through retaining or confining those representatives.
The meetings between representatives of the Egyptian government and public banks and the issuance of the decision on establishing investment and holding companies comes within the framework of the activation of bank privatization programme and encouraging the merger of banks to cope with international developments as well as international standards and criteria, including Basel 2, that would be put into effect at the beginning of 2006.

In the first six months of this year, trade exchange recorded 75.7 million U.S. dollars, including 13.3 million U.S. dollars' worth of Egyptian exports to Rumania and 62.3 million dollars' worth of imports from Rumania, which showed a big gap between exports and imports in Rumania's favour.

They added that the Jordanian authorities now find it difficult to identify those persons after they have changed their names. The condition of previous approval, therefore, would give the Jordanian authorities the chance to ascertain their real identities. Apart from that, entry visas are granted for humanitarian reasons especially to women, old people and children.

SAUDI DIVORCE
SAUDI-AMERICAN HASSLE ON IRAQI BORDERS
This shows how keen Saudi Arabia is on safeguarding its borders primarily for security reasons.
What happened a few days ago was that the Israelis tried to provoke the resistance through bombing an anti-aircraft defence because Sharon wanted to have a deal passed with the European Union, by arguing that Hizbullah shells the settlements.

THE GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF PRICES BEFORE THE CABINET RESHUFFLE
September and October are usually the season for much talk about cabinet re-shuffle in Egypt, but this year, there has been incessant demand for such a re-shuffle due to the escalation of the current government criticisms, the deterioration of citizens standard of living and the hikes in the dollar rates of exchange as a result of government measures and decisions. Even national newspapers which are supposedly for the government have published stories urging such a re-shuffle on an almost daily basis.

The deputy asked that any fish or animal farm using such pills be closed down. Their owners should also be referred to the Public Prosecution for a charge of exposing the lives of citizens to danger or even attempted murder.

In statements on the sidelines of the World Bank's (WB) report on international development for 2004, Dr. Othman pointed out that such statistics provided by a joint report by the Central Agency for Mobilization and Statistics and the World Bank were accurate, and what its credibility should not be doubted.
Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper learnt that new Israeli ambassador to Egypt Eli Shaked would arrive Cairo mid-October next. Shaked is the eighth Israeli ambassador to Egypt since Egypt launched diplomatic ties with Israel according to Camp David Peace Accords signed in 1979.
However, Western diplomatic sources did not rule out the possibility of Cairo deliberately putting off credentials ceremony for a while to show its dissatisfaction of the extremist policies adopted by the Israeli cabinet towards the Middle East peace process.
The report pointed out that that sum equaled 4.8% of GNP adding that the aim of that report was to use those significant figures as a tool for setting development priorities at the economic and social levels.

The parliament's Health Committee will open again the file of the rising number of smokers in Egypt.
Egypt is ranked first at the Arab world level in the recent years as far as the tobacco consumption rate is concerned, according to the report.
The parliament's Health Committee said smoking lays on the Egyptian economy burdens, which are three times as much as those mentioned by the international organization. One billion and 600 million dollars are spent on the treatment of heart and lung diseases and cancer. In addition, smoking also leads to untimely deaths, the committee said.

Education officials in the governorate were surprised to find out that a number of parents had forced their daughters to leave school lest they should fall into the mesh of unofficial marriage, a crime that is often punished by killing the girl who marries without her relatives' knowledge. Unofficial marriage is regarded as one of the crimes of honour in Upper Egypt where both the boy and the girl got punished by death.
Some intellectuals in Menya, however, emphasized that the cause of unofficial marriages spread between students is not co-education but rather the educational curricula that are void of any real thought or creativity as well as over-crowded classes and lack of potentialities which result in the students going to school becoming more of a daily promenade. This is also coupled with lack of any real control on the part of the educational process in such a crucial educational stage in the two sexes' lives.
The recent security strike at Muslim Brotherhood through arresting a number of the movement's eminent figures headed by former deputy Dr Gamal Hishmat is certainly not the first or the last in light of a conflict that has been underway between the security and the most famous group in Egypt since 1995 even though a short honeymoon preceded that conflict.
Khayrat Al-Shater, a computer expert and Al-Mohandes Bank board member. A 3-year prison sentence with hard labor was given to forty leading figures and a 3-yrear prison sentence was given to another nine defendants. The court also ordered that Muslim Brotherhood headquarters in Cairo Center be closed and its contents be confiscated.
Muslim Brotherhood General Guide, Counsellor Ma'mon Al-Hudaibi says that there is not a single reason for such security harassments of the members and leaderships of a group who use no violence in resisting the authorities as such practices contravene the constitution and the law. Nor are they needful in light of the state of calm prevailing in the country.
Regarding the tension between the group and the Egyptian authorities, Al-Hudaibi said: "Ask the government which befriends us by day but arrests the group leaderships and members at night. Such practices are peculiar especially as the presence of Muslim Brotherhood is legitimate and popular. Nor does it violate the constitution, the law or the public order. Neither does it use violence or terrorism in any action.
Muslim Brotherhood do not mind that either, in implementation of the same game. For example, when it wanted to give vent to the Egyptian people's anger after the invasion of Iraq, it allowed Muslim Brotherhood to stage demonstrations in various governorates. Once this task was over, however, they were excluded and their cadres were arrested, as was the case with Gamal Hishmat's group.
Rashwan attributed that to the fact that the authorities dealt with Muslim Brotherhood through the constant abortive strikes method. Such strikes have exacerbated sine 1995 and increased recently as the security strategy relies on early abortion. It is erroneous, therefore, to allege that there was an even formal truce because even in Iraq's invasion period there was a war against many Muslim Brotherhood deputies. Gamal Hishmat's (currently detained) parliamentary membership has been dropped.
Nabil Abdel-Fattah emphasizes that security strikes are far from effective because of their resilience in absorbing blows and because they have potentialities to recruit new elements and build cadres besides being a pragmatic group seeking to coordinate with all political forces to achieve their project which they have most tools required for achieving and therefore both their conflict with the government and their survival will probably remain.
The 2-day conference will discuss the required means to have regions free of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) especially in flashpoints such as the Middle East and Korea, Amb.
An exportation bureau (on behalf of other exporters) owned by an Egyptian discovered that the cement shipments are bought and exported to Israel by a Jew called Zev Biliskey who holds German nationality and stays in one of the five-star hotels in Cairo in cooperation with an Egyptian company for transport and trade he provided with trucks to carry cement to Al-Awaga inlet and then continue the journey to the Zionist entity.
CABINET RE-SHUFFLE APPROACHES
CONFRONTATION BETWEEN MINISTER OF CULTURE AND MPs OVER STOLEN MONUMENTS
"I invited Minister of the Interior Habib Al-Adli to attend the meeting to acquaint us with the security measures laid down by the Ministry of the Interior to square up to the modern techniques the monument thieves and smugglers resort to," Culture Committee chairman Faida Kamel said.
The MPs wondered how such gangs would smuggle an archaeological wall weighing one ton from Cairo International Airport's VIP Lounge.
They said asking for high dowries is a strange phenomenon that should be brushed aside in order to help the girl get married to whom she wants.
They affirmed that polygamy, though permitted under Sharia, should not be done through invitation and encouragement because this will lead to overpopulation, which will go against the State's plan to control the rise in population, which threatens development efforts.
The number of divorcees hit more than 206 thousand, which exceeds marriages over a year.
Yesterday, Abou Alaa continued his consultations to urgently form the extensive government after the majority of the PLO Executive Committee as well as the Central Committee of Fateh movement turned down his request to form a micro cabinet for two different reasons.
When it came to the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, member of the political bureau, Qais Abdul Karim told Al-Hayat that it was willing to join an extensive rather than a micro cabinet.
Well-informed sources told Al-Hayat that the Movement was considering the possibility of nominating some intimates as "independents" for joining of the new government. This, however, contravenes Hamas' political platform.
Abou Alaa's efforts to form an extensive government are obstructed by several problems of which Hamas' position is not the least urgent. The new premier's desire to involve Hamas in the government was meant to strike a medium between two urgent demands: Firstly the Palestinian internal demand by reaching a unified political vision and discourse for running the conflict and the crisis existent with Israel in a way that would not lead to an inter-Palestinian confrontation; secondly, meeting the American demand of converting the movement into a political organization in the Palestinian political system.
Two days ago, a Palestinian woman from Gaza Strip gave birth to six twins, five males and a female, an incident the first of its kind.

Speaking at a news conference held with EU's Foreign Policy Commissioner Chris Batin, Al Shara said the Americans have become "our neighbours" and should, therefore, act according to good-neighbourliness relations. "I wish the great superpower would not turn into a Third World country in Iraq and blame Iraq's neighbours for its successive failures," he said.
Director of Theaters Riyadh Al-Bahdaly said the establishment of this festival is a cultural event within the framework of the Ministry of Culture's new plan to set up several activities that reflect the Iraqi innovation in art and culture.
This is the main idea that can be extracted from a news item reported by news agencies on 3rd September instant quoting the Hebrew Radio as reporting that "Israel asked the USA to bring pressure to bear on Saudi Arabia to redeploy a squadron of its F-16 fighters (what is meant here is F-15) from Tabouk airbase where such fighters were deployed for the first time during the preparatory stage of the American invasion of Iraq."
Israel persistently bolsters its capabilities through qualified human force; cumulative combating military traditions, run according to carefully studied and constantly updated military doctrine; coherent integrated systems of weaponry, supported by an advanced and economically feasible industrial base, which makes it the first military force in the region based on an effective political force that excludes it in many cases from being subject to the international law. This military force also has been professionally involved in the war field for more than half a century.
On the other hand, Saudi Arabia has a nascent but distinguished air force in the region. Although it has not been tested single-handedly in an all-out war, it proved on many occasions that it is able to achieve tactical supremacy.
Aircraft overhaul programmes are produced and developed domestically. There are other programmes to develop engines and electronics, which made this fleet always ready to carry out tasks within the armed forces. They are operated by highly qualified air and ground personnel.
In previous decades, Israeli reconnaissance aircraft and fighters penetrated Saudi airspaces. However, Saudi Arabia dealt with this crisis politically. Such penetrations might have ended when Saudi Arabia completed air and air defence systems in this area.
It also has air force capable of carrying out offensive tasks against vital Israeli targets.
The sources added that the US was planning to hold an international conference on dividing water in the region which parties from outside the region would share.
The talks are concentrated on Israel's participation with investments and experts. The project is considered the most important and the biggest developmental project in Turkey whose costs amount to 32 billion dollars.
Giving women equal opportunities in economic life will boost development vistas in the region's countries, a report by the WB uncovered on the eve of the annual meetings of the WB and the IMF.
"There's an explicit anomaly between both sexes in the region," said head of economic experts in the WB Mostafa Naili. He pointed out that the low rates of women participation in the workforce means that the region does not reap the revenues of its huge investments in educating women.
MUBARAK URGES THE NDP TO DEVELOP DEMOCRATIC ACTION

MONGOLS BACK TO BAGHDAD
New York Times quoted commander of the Mongolian battalion Colonel Bi Erkhinbayar who arrived in Baghdad as saying, "Our arrival to Baghdad this time is different from our advance in the 13 C," in an allusion to the conquest of Baghdad at the hands of Genghis Khan's grandson Hulago in 1258 AD when he set the metropolis of the Islamic caliphate ablaze and his soldiers slew 800,000 souls, devastated its cultural features, set its libraries and books on a fire, thus destroying priceless human heritage in an unrepeated battle in medieval history.

The decision of deregulating the rate of exchange resulted in contradictory economic phenomena that many analysts could not predict.

A: The dollar rate of exchange in the unofficial market is 1.15 pound higher than that of the banks. This reflects the failure of the monetary policy adopted by the government during the last period. This policy should be reconsidered and the dollar rate of exchange should also be let to the market's mechanisms without any interference.
A: People started to consider the car as an investment rather than a luxury commodity, which is a serious point in this respect, as they are certain the car price will increase because the dollar rate of exchange is on the rise against the pound while the dollar's rate of interest at banks is slight.

We imagined that the wage differentials between Egyptian and Japanese labour would represent a value added. However, it turned out that the Japanese labour is cheaper despite his high wages due to his technological skills. We also export raw materials and then import them processed. Even over 50% of the feeding industry is imported. We, actually, run in a vicious circle.

Chamber of Commerce reports monitored a sudden rise in the prices of foodstuffs, supply commodities and poultry. Bakery owners took advantage of these conditions and asked the price of whole wheat loaf be raised under the pretext that energy, raw materials and flour invoice have risen. This, however, has been declined by the Supply Ministry which promised to take such conditions into account and consider raising the subsidy on flour sacks by about LE3 and reconsider the penalties statute against offending bakery owners.
Building material prices also rose so high that all attempts to activate real estate market might be aborted. Cement price per ton amounted to about LE225 and might even rise higher this month especially as producing companies would try to make up for last year losses by raising the price per ton especially as demand for cement recovers in the period each year.
On the other hand, traders emphasize that price rises are justifiable in light of the constant retreat in the Egyptian pound value and the rise in the customs dollar rates of exchange as well as other taxation burdens. Economists think the state public budget deficit amounting to LE42 billion and the regional circumstances which do not favour attracting further foreign investments and the pressure the national economy was constantly exposed to since the September 11th incidents till the war on Iraq, all such factors have directly impacted the price chaos witnessed by the Egyptian markets.

Even thieves and people with a blemished criminal record and even drug traffickers can be simply acquitted of any guilt through money!

He said that such abandonment of "property" that was in Israel's possession had weakened Israel's capability of bargaining for giving momentum to the bilateral relations between the two countries.

VETO AND BREAD SHORTAGE!
Officialdom put the blame on bakeries claiming that they do not produce the sufficient amounts of bread or on the people who want the subsidized bread and use it as livestock feed to the end of such stupid excuses and pretexts which nobody might believe and which, nevertheless, would recur whenever prices of wheat or the dollar went up coupled with our failure to meet our needs.

The performance of exports has become abysmal due to their dwindling competitiveness, while several other developing countries managed to raise their exports over the last three decades, it unveiled.

CORRUPTION CASE EVERY 90 SECONDS
Financial violations in 2002 hit 43,832 cases against 39,545 cases in 2001, most of which were in petroleum, bank, culture and localities' sectors, thus resulting in the waste of millions of pounds of public funds. Administrative violations amounted to 23,551 cases represented in negligence, absence, moonlighting and practising commercial work.
The Arab League (AL) is currently undergoing a severe financial crisis threatening its ability to carry out the tasks assigned to it. The crisis was such that the General Secretariat's personnel could not have their salaries for September after AL Secretary General Amr Moussa withdrew from the budget reserve to meet the needs of the personnel's salaries over the last four months from May to August as the manpower expenditure in the Arab League amounted to about $24 million.
Well-informed Egyptian sources said that next Monday the authorities would release about 1000 prisoners and detainees belonging to the Islamic Group on the occasion of the October, 1973 war anniversary. The sources did not rule out the possibility that some of the organization's shura (advisory) council members who had been convicted in the case of president Sadat's assassination would also be released after passing about 22 years in prison.
Although the possibilities of the Islamic Group assuming a political role shortly are ruled out, observers link the recent development and reforms approved by the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) in its recent congress including granting a bigger area or space of free expression to political and partisan opposition. There are indicators, nevertheless, that Muslim Brotherhood will not be granted the same amount of freedom, which seems quite surprising even to the group's leaders themselves. Muslim Brotherhood Guide, Mamoun Al-Hudhaibi, regarded the recent congress of the NDP about change and reform as having introduced nothing new but just a reiteration of the same old ideas that had been announced but had not been put into effect. He added that the congress had reached undefined generalizations adding that no genuine well-planned amendments had been announced so far.
Other fundamentalist websites called on their elements to reduce practising intercourse with their wives and eating "kabsa" (rice mixed with meat). It seems as if they were making preparations for carrying out operations. Another fundamentalist website said that such preparatory programme "concentrates on strength to be able to run, persistence and moving swiftly, which needs running about 10 kilometers." It also calls on trainees to sleep early, get accustomed to hunger, and reduce practising coitus in case the member is married.
Tax Authority figures emphasize that private lessons activity exceeds LE6 billion annually, of which only half a million goes to the Tax Authority due to teachers and private lessons centers owners evading taxes.
Professor of Masculinity, Ein Shams University, Dr. Ismail Khalaf warned against the slogans used by promoters of medicines tempting patients into the false belief that certain drugs have the advantages of long range efficacy and absolute safety. He also warned against using unlicenced drugs which might contain harmful ingredients because they are not subjected to health authorities supervision.
Yesterday, Egyptian authorities released Islamic Group leader, Karam Zuhdi and his mate Mamdouh Ali Youssef as well as other hundreds of the organization's members, in a step which observers connected to President Hosni Mubarak's directives about political reform to his government as the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) wound up its meetings two days ago.
The power of various trends of Islamists can hardly be ignored on the ground and the message which they got through Zuhdi's release, though implicit and unclear, was badly needed.
The group's key figure, Dr. Essam Al-Eryan saw Zuhdi's release as a "positive initiative", but he thought that the political reform needed by the society was something else. Neither did he see such reform steps as complete. He wondered why the emergency law should not be cancelled altogether.
Heweidi, however, noted that the NDP Congress had introduced Gamal Mubarak in a legitimate way as the man who advocates reform thought.
The background of the three-day congress, which was wound up last Sunday, together with what took place behind the scenes and the debates witnessed by its sub-committees over the new ideas about political, economic and educational reforms were locked in explicit differences that exceeded what the officials prefer to call "dissimilarity in approaches" to the crux itself, especially as the core of the idea of "engagement" and dialogue with different society activities are associated with the "reformists" activity after twenty five years during which the old guards were controlling the party with their traditional ideas about the party's hegemony.
Within this context, the Tagamo'h Party welcomed the announced dialogue. Tagamo'h Secretary General Dr. Ref'at Al-Sa'id (the only candidate for leading the party in its congress slated for convention late this year) in the editorial of the party's mouthpiece "Al-Ahali" in its issue on Wednesday (October 1st) said, "We welcome such a dialogue." "Practising dialogue should not be confined to closed rooms but rather extend to calling on government-owned means of mass media to hold symposia through which party leaders could put up their ideas so that voters can be in a position to take the right decision." he added.
The decisions declared by President Mubarak at the end of the ruling party congress primarily reflect an admission to the impossibility of excluding any political, unionist or partisan force once and for all.
Even President Mubarak's call for a national dialogue cannot define whether it was a dialogue between parties or one between the parties and the government but a dialogue, in any case, is urgently needful to define the reform axes even piecemeal and to probe into the crucial problems that jeopardize Egypt's future such as the deterioration of the economic conditions, the exacerbation of poverty and unemployment.
Neither is Egypt the sole country in that regard. When it comes to the "Charter of Honour" which the President urged the parties to adopt to regulate their inter-relations may not be fully viable without another charter that regulates the rules of behaviour between the authorities and the parties including those that had been excluded for long like the Muslim Brotherhood Group which was deprived of legal legitimacy.
The golden rule in the age of the anti-terrorism American war on the region, might be a counter campaign by the Arab governments together with the Arab street and its parties and oppositions.
Rather, it is a matter of option that has gone blind, power that has gone senile, constitution that has lost all constitutional legitimacy, bands that run amok for public looting but yet rule and preach. In other words, it is a matter of a rule that has changed into a rotten swollen corpse that blocks the road to the country's salvation. The solution lies in change wholesale rather then piecemeal or retail. Never expect that those people will quit willingly or through persuasion or that the power would be rotated to people simply through requests or appeals as all that do not go beyond wishful thinking no less no more.
EGYPTIAN COMPANIES EXCLUDED FROM IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION
Maher revealed in his memo that several months ago he sent a message to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to brief him on the harm due to the Egyptian companies that got final approval from the sanctions committee especially foodstuff, pharmaceutical and irrigation equipment companies.

Industries Federation Chairman, Dr. Abdel-Mon'em Se'oudi said the Federation intended to set up a marketing center for Egyptian commodities and industrial products in Saudi Arabia in cooperation with Saudi companies specialized in that field. This will be a mechanism for penetrating the Saudi market, which provides promising opportunities for Egyptian products, he said, pointing out that considerable economic and investment cooperation can be made thanks to capabilities available in Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
Egyptian businessman Mohamed Al-Masri sees that the current circumstances make it inevitable to agree upon a fresh mechanism to organize Egyptian-Saudi trade exchange without violating the agreements and contracts that were signed by the two countries with other countries.
An official source told Asharq Al-Awsat that the Egyptian minister would meet with Saudi Arabia Basic Industries Company (SABIC) to address ways and means of rescinding the dumping lawsuit filed by a number of Egyptian businessman against its products, which led to depriving SABIC of the Egyptian market, which is regarded as an important market for plastic and iron products. This comes in return of the Saudi Trade Ministry's pledge to lift the ban on Egyptian food industries especially potatoes, onions and meat which were banned together with sheep imports after the spread of the rift valley disease mid this year.

NEGOTIATIONS TO SET UP PROJECTS WITH ISRAEL UNDER "QIZ" SYSTEM
Some other members of the same chamber said that the chamber neither knew anything about such talks nor discussed them in any board meeting.
The item that Egypt exports to the USA is subject to 30% customs, while the same item exported by Jordan is not charged with customs according to the QIZ agreement, he added.
"The details of such talks have not been referred to the Chamber," Weaving Industries Chamber member Khaled Abu Al-Makarem said, emphasizing that they are taking place and led by a tycoon of ready-made clothes. "The Chamber's explicit stand of dealing with the Israelis is based on boycotting their products - raw materials and finished products alike," he indicated.
Following the escalation of violence in the occupied lands earlier this year, the Industries Federation held a meeting and called on all producers to boycott Israel and support brotherly Palestinians in the occupied territories, Al-Morshidi said, pointing out that such a stance is, however, unbinding.

The growth rate, which was expected to hit 4.6%, retreated this year to 3.2%, the report said. The statement attributed this to the state of instability in the world economy due to the circumstances before and after the war on Iraq.
Although the report recorded a slight rise in the investments volume against last year hitting 1.9 billion pounds (taking total investments up to 71 billion pounds in 2003), it also reported a decrease of 17.1% of the GDP in domestic investments against 18.3% in 2001/2002.

25 MONEY EXCHANGE COMPANIES OUT OF EGYPTIAN MARKET
Mohamed Hassan Al-Abyad, former head of the Money Exchange Division, said operation on the Egyptian foreign exchange market has become useless, as the companies are being accused of speculating on the exchange rates of the foreign currencies, particularly the dollar. Such accusations, he said, are being levelled despite the fact that the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) is controlling all companies and CBE representatives spend long time at the companies to inspect the files and penalize the violating company harshly.
The sole legal entity that represents foreign exchange companies is suffering from frozenness, as the Supply Minister rejects the Foreign Exchange Division's operation because its members went down from 120 to 59 companies, Al-Abyad noted.

ACCUSED OF MANIPULATION, EGYPTIAN EXPORTERS CONCERNED
Doubts that exporters manipulate this decision are on the increase because many of them have objected to the decree following its issuance. In addition, some of the exporters expressed reservations about the decision. But Ali Essa, Head of the General Division of Exporters, asserted that the majority of exporters had committed themselves to the decision, despite their reservations about it. However, this does not prevent commitment to the decision in respect of the rule of law that provides equality for all exporters, he said.
For his part, Helal Sheta, Deputy Head of the General Division of Exporters, said manipulation was an individual case and the majority of exporters abide by the law. But matters may get worse due to the current conditions, the rise of the dollar's exchange rate and the dire need for it to provide basic goods.
An exporter said a reference price was set last year to export citrus and some other commodities. Such an agreement was sent to the Export and Import Control Authority, Foreign Trade Sector and the Customs House. Only a few number of exporters did not abide by this agreement.

Deputies in Egyptian parliament asked Minister of Foreign Trade Yussef Botrous Ghali and Minister of Supply Dr. Hassan Khidr to destroy 100 thousand tons of American meat which are pending release at Alexandria port and ban putting them up for sale for human consumption due to the appearance of the first mad cow case in the United States. In urgent requests for notification, the deputies asked the government to submit an urgent report to the parliament on its plan to implement the decree of banning importing the American meat, especially the quantities that were contracted or the quantities which are in the way to Egyptian ports, taking into account the approach of Greater Bairam (Eid Al-Adha) and the possibility of infiltrating of big quantities in local market by exporters.
Broad beans is considered the basic meal for many Egyptians regardless of their social categories and classes, as it contains protein and other food components. It also copes with the economic conditions.
Importation crisis "The great increase in population and the dependence basically on broad beans as a popular meal for many Egyptians made the domestic crop insufficient to meet the market's needs. Domestic production meets only 60 percent of consumption," said member of the Federation of Egyptian Chambers of Commerce's Crops and Grain Committee Abdel-Fattah Qamar. The crisis of importing broad beans started 3 years ago when the price per ton was 2700 pounds, and then a sharp shortage took place in the crop due to the cultivation of broad beans simultaneously with wheat together with a wave of very hot weather that impacted on the productivity per feddan, he said.
"Overpopulation together with the increase of life pressure and costs and changing patterns of consumption due to globalization are basic reasons for what happened to all crops, especially broad beans in Egypt because it has very important vegetable protein which compensates for the shortage of the expensive animal protein," head of Crops Department at Al-Azhar University Dr. Osama Saadeddin said. "To this should probably be added the Egyptians' tendency to eat broad beans, which is deeply rooted in the Egyptian cultural heritage. The quantity of broad beans consumption is very high despite changes witnessed by different social classes - some of them have become better off than before," he added.
The Asharq Al-Awsat daily made an interview with President Hosni Mubarak's Political Advisor Osama al-Baz. The following are the salient extracts of the interview: Q: Why does Egypt adopt a hard-line position on the question of involvement in a multinational force in Iraq?
Al-Baz: The decision has no political significance and does not mean a change in the official position against allowing party trends to act on a religious basis.
Al-Baz: We do not move to impose anything on Palestinian factions or the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). But, we move out of our national responsibility and security. If we leave the Palestinian situation deteriorating, and leave the peace camp in Israel weakening to the extent that it cannot exert any influence, then we will find ourselves at a very serious situation where Palestinian and Israeli extremism overwhelms, causing risks to the region.
Q: Did America ask you to block Hamas and Jidad's assets?
Q: How do you look at threats to and pressure on Syria?
Q: Are you concerned about the political and social ramifications of the deteriorating exchange rate of the Egyptian pound?
Al-Baz: No, it won't as the differences in the exchange rate are moving within narrow margins.
The American administration called for special treatment with the US companies operative in Egypt.

JORDANIAN PREMIER: RETURN OF JORDANIAN AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL COORDINATED WITH EGYPT
MUFTI: MARKET STABILITY MORE IMPORTANT THAN REPETITION OF HAJ AND UMRAH
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar exchange rate remained high amid a notable demand for it by dealers especially those who are willing to go to Mecca in Saudi Arabia for Umrah in the Hejira months of Shaaban and Ramadan. Banks have maintained opening documentary credits to their dealers who are working in the import area according to their respective resources which have recently seen a marked nosedive due to U.S. dollar holders' resorting to the parallel market to sell their dollars particularly as the difference in both formal and informal prices shot up to around 90 piasters.
Surprisingly for the Egyptians, the change they had expected to take the form of a cabinet reshuffle in the hope of finding remedies for the deteriorating living conditions, the aggravating price hikes and the dollar exchange rate which has recently jumped above LE7 only came in the religious establishment. Dr. Ali Gomm'a, a professor of the fundamentals of jurisprudence in the Faculty of Islamic Studies, Al-Azhar University, was appointed as Egypt's Mufti instead of Dr. Ahmed Al-Tayyeb who was assigned the position of Al-Azhar University President as successor of Dr Ahmed Omar Hashem who reached the retirement age.
He also has extensive relations that enabled him to work for more than an Islamic society and institution.
Apart from the crisis of the conscription deputies, the coming period will witness the opening of a new file, to wit the ministers of conscription, particularly as oppositionist MP Al-Badri Fargali submitted a request for notification calling for applying the Constitutional Court's explanation regarding the People's Assembly members to all constitutional institutions. Such an explanation is not confined to MPs only, he said.

In its first book the group said that it aims at "giving advice to and guiding Muslims and explaining the modest rule of sharia in order that the Islamic movement might be more adherent to Islam and stick to the right". Keeping the image of Islam pure and its principles explicit is better than improving the image of the Gamaa Islamia at the expense of Islam by remaining silent about the right, it said.
What we see today is the American oppression and tyranny incarnate through violating Muslims' rights, looting their property, occupying their lands and murdering their children.
Addressing the group members, the book said, "The Egyptian society will never do without you as you're part and parcel of it and you cannot do without it as it is the school where you learnt values, principles and morals. It is the environment that made you virtuous men."
