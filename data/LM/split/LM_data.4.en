Broad beans is considered the basic meal for many Egyptians regardless of their social categories and classes, as it contains protein and other food components. It also copes with the economic conditions.
Importation crisis "The great increase in population and the dependence basically on broad beans as a popular meal for many Egyptians made the domestic crop insufficient to meet the market's needs. Domestic production meets only 60 percent of consumption," said member of the Federation of Egyptian Chambers of Commerce's Crops and Grain Committee Abdel-Fattah Qamar. The crisis of importing broad beans started 3 years ago when the price per ton was 2700 pounds, and then a sharp shortage took place in the crop due to the cultivation of broad beans simultaneously with wheat together with a wave of very hot weather that impacted on the productivity per feddan, he said.
"Overpopulation together with the increase of life pressure and costs and changing patterns of consumption due to globalization are basic reasons for what happened to all crops, especially broad beans in Egypt because it has very important vegetable protein which compensates for the shortage of the expensive animal protein," head of Crops Department at Al-Azhar University Dr. Osama Saadeddin said. "To this should probably be added the Egyptians' tendency to eat broad beans, which is deeply rooted in the Egyptian cultural heritage. The quantity of broad beans consumption is very high despite changes witnessed by different social classes - some of them have become better off than before," he added.

If we leave the Palestinian situation deteriorating, and leave the peace camp in Israel weakening to the extent that it cannot exert any influence, then we will find ourselves at a very serious situation where Palestinian and Israeli extremism overwhelms, causing risks to the region.
Q: Did America ask you to block Hamas and Jidad's assets?
Q: How do you look at threats to and pressure on Syria?
Q: Are you concerned about the political and social ramifications of the deteriorating exchange rate of the Egyptian pound?

JORDANIAN PREMIER: RETURN OF JORDANIAN AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL COORDINATED WITH EGYPT
MUFTI: MARKET STABILITY MORE IMPORTANT THAN REPETITION OF HAJ AND UMRAH
Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar exchange rate remained high amid a notable demand for it by dealers especially those who are willing to go to Mecca in Saudi Arabia for Umrah in the Hejira months of Shaaban and Ramadan. Banks have maintained opening documentary credits to their dealers who are working in the import area according to their respective resources which have recently seen a marked nosedive due to U.S. dollar holders' resorting to the parallel market to sell their dollars particularly as the difference in both formal and informal prices shot up to around 90 piasters.
Surprisingly for the Egyptians, the change they had expected to take the form of a cabinet reshuffle in the hope of finding remedies for the deteriorating living conditions, the aggravating price hikes and the dollar exchange rate which has recently jumped above LE7 only came in the religious establishment. Dr. Ali Gomm'a, a professor of the fundamentals of jurisprudence in the Faculty of Islamic Studies, Al-Azhar University, was appointed as Egypt's Mufti instead of Dr. Ahmed Al-Tayyeb who was assigned the position of Al-Azhar University President as successor of Dr Ahmed Omar Hashem who reached the retirement age.

What we see today is the American oppression and tyranny incarnate through violating Muslims' rights, looting their property, occupying their lands and murdering their children.

This decision was approved by the General Division of Exporters out of keenness on providing the necessary currency to energize the State's economic activities. He admitted that exporters have commitments, some of which might be deferred and might be repaid after six months, for instance. So, who will guarantee the provision of these sums of money at the current rates of the banks? This compels them to save part of the revenues till they need them and that they are available, he pointed out.
He asserted that simple differences might happen during supplying the exporters' revenues, as there were no suitable tools of assessment owing to the nature of commodities and the markets. This might be interpreted as a kind of manipulation, though the exporter is not responsible for that, he pointed out.

WAR IN IRAQ AND FUTURE OF SECULARISM IN REGION

There is no doubt that there are other forces in the region - namely Arab liberal forces - that will put other interpretations on the defeat of the Baathist model in Iraq. They will allege that such a defeat was the outcome of adopting a despotic totalitarian policy that did not allow the establishment of a democratic plurality, thus confirming such forces' point of view that the future of the region is to establish a democratic liberal rule.
The second factor is related to degree of trustfulness and credibility of the current American Administration in calling for establishing democratic plural regimes a la liberal model even if this leads to the emergence of opponents to the American interests.

Some Muslim governments do not differentiate between their political organizations and scientific institutions that are entrusted with formulating our present and future," he added.
As a result, we depend on other countries in acquiring such sciences, which the origins of which were inherited from ancient Muslims who had a caliphate, honour and civilization. Impartial (Westerners) give Muslimscredit for enhancing the scientific approach, as those (Westerners) had learnt at the feet our scientists in Cordoba, Granada, Sicily and others. However, when such experimental sciences were in our hand they made a civilization progress to humanity. Neither had they been turned into weapons of mass destruction annihilating millions of innocent people nor they have been so abused if we had continued taking the lead," he added.

Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad thought that the Israeli aggression on Syria two days ago was an attempt by the Israeli government to get out of the big fix it undergoes through trying to intimidate Syria and dragging it and the region into other wars because such a government was a war government and its only raison d'etre is war.
He added that nobody in the world believed in the possibility of peace with the current Israeli government.

This was followed by another 18-million-dollar contract with the US Veritas to conduct a survey study in the Syrian territorial waters in the Mediterranean Sea.
President Bush's support of the Israeli raid on Syria indicates that the White House no longer minded having the bill passed.
The actual impacts of the suggested sanctions already exist since Syria was put on the list of terrorism-sponsoring countries late 1990s.
Former Syrian president Hafez Al-Assad had met five times in the last three decades with American presidents (Richard Nixon in Damascus, 1974; George Bush senior in Geneva, 1991; Bill Clinton in Geneva, 1994, Damascus late 1994 and Geneva in 2002).

Following a steady collapse of the dollar rate of exchange against the euro and the pound sterling in international stock exchanges, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) decided to form a committee of economists to devise a plan to invest the dollar monetary reserve amounting to 14.6 billion dollars, which had negatively been affected by the retreat of the American currency worldwide.
The current retreat of the dollar rate of exchange is not due to American economy-related reasons but rather to the detection of the mad cow disease and the consequent ban on American meat imports, in addition to the state of instability worldwide due to the continuation of the American forces in Iraq and the existence of terrorist threats to many countries. These reasons are also the reasons for a gold ounce skyrocketing rise on world markets, which exceeded 424 dollars for the first time in the history of precious metals, as it used not to exceed 390 dollars mostly, he added.
He called for waiting for the suitable timing for taking such a decision and seeking the help of IMF experts to set such a timing so that it could not negatively impact on the Egyptian economy like what happened in the deregulation of the rate of exchange decision. " We need a temporary decision to stop the current drain of the monetary reserve value. This can be done through investing a meager part in such reserve in European banks or expanding in buying American treasury dollar bonds at interest rates capable of counter-balancing the euro's rise. Such solutions should be temporary till international stock markets stabilize so that a basket of currencies could be established as a permanent remedy for any fluctuations in markets in the future," he made it bare.

He called on Jordanian businessmen to unilaterally break the taboo existent in the Arab world against the economic cooperation with their Israeli counterparts and to open the door for them to contribute to the reconstruction of Iraq.
Thanks to that agreement, the volume of Jordanian exports across those zones rose from $25 million in 1999 to $426 million in 2002 and the volume of Jordanian exports rose from $13 million in 1999 to $420 million in 2002.
Yesterday, Israeli Foreign Ministry complained about Jordan's attempt to underestimate such information and the importance of the ceremonial festival yesterday as well as the prevention of TV cameramen from entering the ceremony hall.
There is a main link connecting criticisms by "extremist groups," preparations for "repulsing any Israeli aggression," adoption of "Syria Accountability act," restoration of "Lebanon's sovereignty" and putting Resolution 1511 to the vote: Damascus is seeking to avoid American attempts to isolate it internationally and that it still has international "options" and regional "cards."
If his solution is to export his crisis abroad and to practise "madness" through "harassing" Syria, this will be responded in kind.
However, the US vetoed a draft resolution "denouncing the aggression" and another Syrian draft resolution to denounce the "separating wall," which Israel is currently building on the occupied territories.
If this Syrian "indicator" is put in juxtaposition to Bush's nomination of Margaret Scooby as American ambassador to Damascus, although Syria Accountability act includes a proposition of reducing diplomatic representation, it can be said that the door would not be closed completely.
Up till now, doors of dialogue are still closed on the grounds that the American policy since the September 11th incidents is based on "dictation" rather than "negotiation." However, they are not closed completely.
CHALABI'S PARTNERSHIP WITH ISRAEL
As for his partner in the firm, namely Mark Zeil, he is an eminent lawyer in Israel and an advocate of the settlement movements in the West Bank.

How did Salem Chalabi manage to reach a partnership with Mark Ziel?
Salem Chalabi's partnership with Mark Ziel opened, for him and his uncle, the doors of the Pentagon, where the relations between the Chalabis and some personalities considered to be affiliated to the Hawks of the Pentagon such as deputy Secretary of Defence Paul Wolfwitz and advisory of the department Douglas Faith.

Although the American Air Force has withdrawn most of its planes and forces from Ahmed Al-Jaber Airbase in Kuwait last May to redeploy them in Iraq and other areas, it officially ended the task of such forces which lasted for 10 years.
It is noteworthy that about 5000 American Air Force personnel were deployed in Kuwait for the last 10 years, in addition to an indefinite number of fighters and transporter aircraft.
The Americans may also evacuate the Doha base within 6 months' time which was the command centre of the US army in Kuwait, military sources said, pointing out that the Orifejan base in the southernmost part of Kuwait would be headquarters due to being a desert isolated area.
Al-Atiya confirmed that the issue of the unified passport subjected to studies that lasted for years and that this passport will be issued "with joint specifications" following the leaders' approval of this recommendation.
However, the pressing question is where is the ideology of political Islam that remained in Sudan for more than two decades.
Surly, these issues are no longer obstacles to peace, as the two parties, full of confidence, speak about the coming peace. Some observers think that the two parties are waiting for the right moment to announce their agreement bearing in mind what was announced in Washington that the US Secretary of State Colin Powell might head for Kenya in order to give a push to peace negotiations.

Yesterday (20th October), insider Pakistani sources told Al-Hayat that Islamabad had bought sophisticated 2000 Colour AWACS model Chinese missiles in reaction to India buying air-borne and sophisticated Israeli radar systems.
During a joint press conference with his Pakistani counterpart, two days ago, Saudi Foreign Minister Saud Al Faysal sharply criticized the Israeli move towards India. He sarcastically said, "I wonder why such a four-million-soul country wants to secure its borders from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indus in India."
He pointed out in a statement to Al-Hayat that the American President had confirmed that he would sign the bill and approve economic and political sanctions. He, however, added that if Damascus failed to cooperate in the coming stage, further suitable measures would be taken to ensure its change of attitude.

MISR EXTERIOR TO MERGE WITH BANQUE MISR
EGYPTIAN BANKERS RULE OUT RISE IN DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE ON UNOFFICIAL MARKET
They warned of the growth of the phenomenon of speculation in the euro and the pound Sterling and rise in their rates to record levels at the unofficial exchange market. The euro exceeded 880 piasters against 12.8 pounds for the pound Sterling.
He pointed out that the CBE has much to face any potential speculations.
He affirmed that there is a remarkable demand by clients for European currencies and exchanging some dollar deposits into euros and pounds Sterling. He stressed the necessity of taking preventive measures to avoid the growth of speculation in those two currencies in the future.

The strangest foreign loan Egypt has got is the credit line granted from the Korean Export and Import Bank to the Commercial International Bank (CIB) - Egypt and Banque Misr.
3 EGYPTIAN BANKS PLAN TO OFFER FRESH SAVING COFFERS IN POUND
Saving coffers' terms will range between 3 and 5 years, depending on dealers' needs, he added.
High interest rates will make the pound more valuable and eliminate black market and random exchange rates, Qura said, pointing out that a more distinguished interest rate will stimulate dollar collectors to have local currency savings, thus boosting banks' resources, helping them cover dealers' hard currency orders pursuant to importing criteria and controls to fend off the recurrence of the consumer importing problem, which cost the country huge foreign currency earnings over the recent years.
Egypt's imports amounted to 2.165 million U.S. dollars against 3.366 million U.S. dollars in the reporting period, a nosedive of 3.69 percent.
The volume tax evasion in Egypt reached LE20 billion ($3.2 billion) last year 2003. About 15 thousand persons were referred to tax evasion prosecution as a prelude to having them put to urgent trial.
BANKS TEND TO STOP GIVING FRESH LOANS TO STEEL SECTOR
For his part, Khalid Shawki who is in charge of the Steel sector at Banque Misr Credit Department, said the bank would seek to stop facilities given to the sector, waiting for what the current situation would lead to.
Pros of the step see it as the sole means to refresh the investment movement, which witnessed a big retreat last year, and save banks from the increase in liquidity and local and foreign deposits. On the other hand, cons are of the view that such a step would lead to the increase of dollarization as well as the inflation, which, in turn, would establish recession on markets.
He confessed that some depositors protested against cutting interest rate on deposits and that they had resorted to banks that offer higher interest rate and transferred their deposits to them. He is of the view that raising the interest rate on the Egyptian pound would curb the dollarization phenomenon and increase the cost of funds at banks.
For his part, general manager of Bank of Alexandria Mohamed Radwan said the decision on cutting interest rate on deposits upset clients but it had not impacted on market. He pointed out that the interest rates at the four public banks, namely National Bank of Egypt, Banque du Caire, Bank of Alexandria and Banque Misr, were relatively fixed.
General manager of Treasury and Exchange Markets Department at the Egyptian Commercial Bank Amr Bahaa expected interest rates on pound deposits to increase over the coming period as a reaction to official statements on controlling foreign exchange (dollar) market. He thinks that raising interest rates would help increase local debt costs and lending costs and curb development and investment, but this would give a relative privilege to the Egyptian pound against the dollar.
Hassan said it was unimaginable to raise interest rates at a time the banking system was witnessing a decline in the lending rates against the increase of deposits. This would result in an increase of investment costs, thus leading the CBE to absorb the increase in deposits by issuing deposit receipts on behalf of banks at high interest rates, which would impact on the CBE net profits which were considered a significant part of the public budget revenues.
Such a measure, the experts added, would increase demand for dollar and deepen the foreign exchange crisis. It would not push dollar holders to deposit it with banks or buy such saving coffers instead of hoarding it. The high cost of these coffers would put the government in a new dilemma and add a further burden that would establish the budget deficit.
He continued to say that the Egyptian market is not in need of such a measure now, particularly as the dollar retreats on the unofficial market and achieved explicit stability in banks over the last four months.
A key source said that a noticeable rapprochement regarding several economic cases took place during the past period, which will help in signing the free trade agreement between the two sides.
There are no problems obstructing holding free trade negotiations.
We work to achieve this goal hoping to achieve progress in this field, the source added.

1ST HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION ADOPTED BY NDP NOTARIZED
A group of Egyptian intellectuals are seeking to form a new political party called "Motherland Egypt," calling for separating Egypt from the Arab world and returning it to pharaonic roots. The group includes Bayoumi Qandeel, Talat Radwan, Dr. Hussein Zohdi, Dr. Wasim al-Sisi, Abdel-Rahman al-Alfi and Mohamed Abdel-Daim. The party cofounder is Mohsen Lotfi, 75, the nephew of Egyptian famous writer and thinker Ahmed Lotfi Al-Sayed.

Dr. Atef Ebeid tried to digress from the subject by dilating on social insurance funds. He tried to persuade them to help the government with its attempts to control the remarkable increase in domestic debt. He, for the first time, confessed to the government seizing insurance funds through the National Investment Bank without a legal pretext or decree.
On the other hand, Dr. Atef Ebeid received pungent criticisms from some unionists who participated in the meeting due to the government failure to control successive price hikes, the bread crisis recently witnessed by the country and the deterioration of the stance-of-workers in most sectors especially contracting, medicine, stevedoring in ports as well as the deteriorating conditions in public enterprise sector companies where the government failed to stop the drain of losses.

In the recent years, charity banquets have been an outstanding trait of the month of Ramadan which businessmen and celebrities vied to hold and which have been the talk of people in Cairo and governorate's capitals.
They were known as " Asmita" (special trays on which food is offered). The Fatimides took extreme interest in them and even held them in special houses called "Al Fitra" houses.
Head of Exporters Department at Cairo Chamber of Commerce, Hilal Sheta has noticed the ebbing away of charity banquets this year.

EGYPT'S POCKETS IN RAMADAN
If total value of yameesh imports is calculated in Egyptian pound's rate before deregulation against the US dollar (464 piasters per dollar), yameesh importation cost will hit 1,299,002,000 pounds.
This means that importing yameesh, apart from lanterns, became a waste of money.
If Egypt's yearly total needs expenditure in Ramadan is calculated, they will hit 1,212,005,000 or 7,432,625,000 Egyptian pounds.
He firmly believed that there is a "will to attack us, and I have to warn that we ought to be vigilant."
After a while, the Israeli military officials' remarks moved from the October War and relevant lessons to focus on two things: the smuggling of arms and anti-shield and tank missiles through tunnels between Egypt's Rafah to the Palestinians, and the Egyptian military's arms deals.
The statement was rebutted by Egyptian semi-official newspapers' editors, who called on Israel to show relevant pictures allegedly leaked to the Israeli press just to know the types and source of such alleged arms.
There is a peace agreement between Israel and Egypt. I do not see any country threatening Egypt."
It added that Egypt established fortifications around Sinai in anticipation of an expected war.
The first indication is that Israel asked the U.S. in the last weeks to stop selling satellite-guided bombs to Egypt.
He also mordantly rapped Sharon's policies against the Palestinian people, and condemned the Israeli military's claims that Egyptian security forces failed to take sufficient measures to stop the smuggling of arms from Egypt. He also blamed the Israeli side for the issue of tunnels, wondering, "Why does not Israel seek to address this issue, instead of laying the blame on Egypt?"
The total Israeli onslaught is due to the following three interpretations.
Third; Israel may carry out escalation against the Palestinians and attack Syria at one stroke, with Egypt to be compelled to sit on the fence through a series of admonitions and indications that Israel stands prepared to fight in Sinai.
And what is the scale of this green light vis-a-vis the Palestinians, Egyptians and Syrians?
U.S. aid should be invested in development projects in Egypt.

The Israeli foreign intelligence department (Mossad) warned Israeli citizens not to travel to the Horn of Africa countries due to allegedly receiving warnings against a scheme by Lebanese Hizbullah and perhaps Al Qaeda organization to kidnap Israelis and assault Israeli aircraft.
TRANSPORT COMMITTEE WARN OF PRIVATE SECTOR CONTROL OF PORTS
Atef Maroni, chairman of the Holding Company for Maritime and Road Transport, said he does not fear for the old ports but the matter requires quick development of the existing ports through adding several pieces of equipment, plots of land, and infrastructure so that these ports would be able to cope with the international trade traffic.
Adel Al-Subaihi, chairman of the General Syndicate for Maritime Transport Workers in Port Said, blamed the deteriorated condition of the container companies on the privatization program that removed those two companies that were contributing to the State budget around 2 billion dollars a year. The privatization program gave everything to the private sector until the shipping agencies number reached 305, he said. He stressed the necessity of the People's Assembly intervention to save the national companies from loss in light of the unfair competition with the private sector.
In an interview with Damietta Port Authority Chairman Vice-Admiral Ibrahim Youssef, he said the port was planned to be a huge entity of five specialist harbours; container harbour, inward goods harbour, outward goods harbour, gas harbour, and river harbour.
They would even be watched through screens at the board chairman office. In addition, a sophisticated wireless telecommunication network would be created.
He answered saying that an open service complex was constructed in the same area of the electronic management on an area of one thousand square meters. It includes 12 offices; a reception office, an office for submitting customs declarations, an office for registering lorries, two customer services offices, and a cafeteria supplied with mobile screens to show the status of quays and ships and other fixed screens to show how the documents are handled inside the port, something that concerns any customer.
He continued to say that the vital things inside any port include the scales as the cars and trucks are weighed empty and loaded. That is why four new electronic scales were installed, run, and operated on the new tracks for the exit of trucks within the new development operations in the port. The scales of the outward goods will be in the outward goods yard to weigh the outward cargo trucks. Two scales in the container yard were moved to the new entry and exit container gate and were developed to go within electronic system so that the containers would have their own exit and entry gates.
He added that the trade port design capacity hits 4.5 million tons, with 31 quays. In 2000, the capacity was increased to 6.5 million tons and 35 quays.
DAMIETTA, PORT SAID MPs WAITING FOR MINISTER OF FINANCE DECISION TO EQUAL EGYPTIAN COMPANIES WITH EAST PORT SAID FOREIGN COMPANY
During the committee's second meeting that was held last Sunday Rifaat Al-Gamil, MP for Damietta, said that Damietta Container Company revenues would be affected by 40% once East Port Said Port starts operation next October. Therefore, government should take decisive measures without differentiating between Port Said Company and Damietta Company.
PETROLEUM MINISTER URGES PRIVATE SECTOR TO INVEST IN OIL EXPLORATION
Eng Fahmi attributed the increase of oil prices on the international market to political interference and the lack of accurate information on the real balance of supply and demand.
Second, the refining industry has shrunk in the whole world, particularly in Europe and the United States, as a result of the pressures for protecting the environment as required by the Kyoto Agreement.
What is the effect of high world oil prices on Egypt?
The differences come from paying attention to exportation of petroproducts, not just crude. Another reason is that the figures for our oil exports are expressed in equivalent petroleum figures that include natural gas, high-octane gasoline, naphtha, mazut, oils, candles, caustic soda, jet fuel, 95-octane gasoline, polyethylene, propane, coal. We depend on exporting many products, not just crude oil.
These are documented figures. And the figure will rise to exactly 27.2 million tons by the end of FY 2004/05. We must remember, however, that these figures include the 5 million tons exported by foreign partners, which are still Egyptian exports and are added to the Egyptian balance of trade.
The President of Shell Corporation said that had there not been a holding company for gas in Egypt, the country would not have taken that big leap, and we would never have been able to do anything beyond supplying gas to houses.
As Libya and Iraq begin to develop their oil wealth in the post-embargo era, and also as other countries enter the oil exportation market with growing oil potentials, what will the effect be on foreign investments that are directed to Egypt?
Another example: although we have competitors in the field of liquefaction of gas, we have investments in this field totaling $3 billion distributed among three units. One unit is located in Damietta, and its production goes to Spain. We were concerned about the success of this experiment in the beginning, but once we were assured of its success, we went into it as partners with 20% of the capital, and when investments in the other two units in Edku began to pour in, we joined as partners with 24% of the capital.
There are fears that customs duties will be reduced as of the beginning of next year - a measure that will threaten national industry.
I once advised an investor to follow that course in 1995, telling him that he would pay a very large bill if he did not build a propylene plant, because the factories that make propylene, the precursor for polypropylene, are few in the whole world, and there is a shortage of propylene.
Petrochemicals have been on your priority list since the late 1990's. What sort of revenues have you achieved in that domain?
Frankly speaking, I am not satisfied with the private sector's role in the petroleum sector.
This was actually the motive behind our establishment of Tharwa Company for oil exploration.
I must also tell you that Tharwa has revealed an important fact: there are no international companies who use their own capital in oil-producing companies; there are only companies that borrow money from banks, then hire specialized services companies and experts and use them to do exploration work in the concession areas granted to them.
This method is so successful that digging 10 wells today means 10 oil discoveries. Egypt made 40 discoveries in a single year. Even if we suppose that several million dollars are spent and nothing was found in the first year, we will make discoveries in the next. We have to bear in mind that the least discovered oil well makes revenues between $1.5 billion and $2 billion.
The the National Bank of Egypt is still making a study that will determine the suitable time for offering the shares of these companies on the Stock exchange. If we look at international companies, we will find that Apache Company, for instance, has 75% of its profits coming from the Stock Exchange. Therefore, we must go to the Stock Exchange, because it represents a source of resources and investments.
Now that you mentioned management, there have been complaints in all sectors of Egypt against stagnation and officials who remain in their positions for decades, with the exception of the petroleum sector, where the complaint is quite the opposite, meaning that change is so rapid and continuous. Why?
And how were you able to put this equation into effect?
The establishment if the committee was the result of several factors, the most significant of which was that it was unreasonable that the sole source of the figures for oil reserves, which directly impact on the whole petroleum sector, be the Minister of Petroleum. Such figures should come from a higher committee that would revise everything and verify figures to make accurate assessments and be accountable for the accuracy of these figures as one of its responsibilities.

Addressing the People's Assembly's Economic Committee headed by Said Al Alfi said that in return for lifting such debts off companies, the surplus assets would be transferred to the Ministry's holding companies to be sold at the market price.
He pointed out that the Ministry's plan this year was to put up 66 companies for sale with only 35 companies expected to be sold at a value in the range of LE2.5 to 3.3 billion. He pointed out that the Ministry would act for developing giant companies like spinning and weaving companies, adding that studies were underway to find ways and means of developing some complicated cases like Iron and Steel Company so that they might turn into profit-makers.
AQSA MOSQUE IMAM: ISRAELI BARRIERS WON'T STOP MUSLIMS PRAYING IN THE MOSQUE
EASTERN WALL SWALLOWS THIRD OF THE WEST BANK
President Yassir Arafat's advisor Nabil Abu Redeina regarded the Israeli government decision to extend the wall to Jordan Valley area as shooting the bullet of mercy on the roadmap and tantamount to the declaration of an all-out war and mocking international resolutions.
If such a wall was completed, the city of Jericho would be more isolated from the rest of Palestinian cities as that city whose area does not exceed 57 kilometers would turn into a city besieged from all sides by what Israel regards as its "territories" and the Palestinians would not be allowed in or out of the city except through gates to be opened and closed according to what Israel itself sees appropriate.
In an interview with Israeli TV Channel 2 on Friday evening, Sharon emphasized that the wall would penetrate several kilometers westwards. It would not extend along the borders with Jordan but would penetrate to the depth of the bank.
Last week, Israeli Television transmitted a report attacking the "The Diaspora" serial regarding it as within the framework of "whetting throats and swords" led by Syria and Iran against Israel, according to the report's allegations.
Al-Hayat learnt from French sources that Paris sent several messages warning Syria that it might be targeted and be exposed to a major American or Israeli action, especially if America failed in Iraq.
The last of such messages was sent early this week, advising Syria to move, get out of isolation, and talk publicly about change, openness and reform.
IRAN READY TO SUPPORT SYRIA IN CASE AMERICA IMPOSED SANCTIONS ON IT
Syrian Vice-president Abdel-Halim Khaddam admitted for the first time to Iraqi funds with Syrian banks, which are currently under consideration to be returned to Iraq. However, he did not determine the volume of such funds. Khaddam's statement came following his meeting with an Iraqi delegation, which are currently on a visit to Damascus.
Addressing marchers in front of Fatwa (religious opinion) Headquarters on the occasion of the holy month of Ramadan on Sunday, he said, "Foreigners returned to occupy Arab lands as what happened after the First World War, but we'll neither accept Israeli occupiers in Palestine nor the American ones in Iraq or Afghanistan till we expel them from our lands. Occupation is now threatening other Arab countries such as Syria and Saudi Arabia by intimidation and temptation."
Yesterday (October 25th), a member in the Iraqi Governing Council (IGC) in Iraq called for the establishment of a strong federal state in Iraq based on dividing the country into five geographic regions.
The IGC member emphasized that Iraq needed a human based rather than religious or factional state, adding that a federation was the option which would ensure Iraq's unity.
Dr. Mohamed Abd El Gabbar, expert in Mosul Institute for Nutrition Researches, warned against having such food which reaches Iraq through neighbouring countries and is, then, distributed in Baghdad, Mosul, Erbil, Dahok, Kirkuk and Sulaimaniyah.
Leader of the "Constitution Movement" Faisal Manif Al-Garba announced merger with the "Royal Democratic Alliance" to form the "Constitution and Royal Alliance Movement".

The military spokesman of the alliance forces said that the incumbent alliance authority had issued commands to the American troops to respect religious rites during fasting, breakfasting and religious visits.
For its part, Iraqi Ministry of the Interior issued a statement containing instructions like forcing all citizens not to openly break fast, and to close down all restaurants whether in cities or on the external roads of the same cities so that they might be open only half an hour before breakfast time, apart from restaurants of first class (five stars) hotels to be specified by the Tourism Authority later on.
The statement asked the police to respect citizens and treat them well when they ask for help. They should be offered as much help as is legally possible.
On the other hand, head of the Supreme Judiciary Council, Sheikh Saleh bin Mohamed Al-Luhaidan asked those who tried to stage demonstrations to stop that matter, calling on Islamic countries to keep away from such "demagoguery."
Iran, on the other hand, has been granted a really rare chance to exercise more influence on the ground, a hope it has been looking forward to for centuries. It has been using its ties with the Shiites to make progress at the expense of Turkey regardless of the well-known differences between Tehran and Iraqi Shiites.
Some Iranians, however, forgot that not all the Arabs were pro-Saddam in the war that he launched on Iran and that quite weighty Arab countries like Saudi Arabia and Syria had forged ahead with rapprochement with Iran regardless of the negative American reactions.
The recent reports, then, came to emphasize that 10% of Israeli military aircraft are now stationed in American bases in the South East of Turkey supporting the Turkish National option siding with Israel against the Arabs in spite of an Islamic-banner government in Ankara.
An association for the people whose ears and tongues were cut or their foreheads were tattooed was declared in a special festival for victims of the former Iraqi regime, held in Baghdad late last week by "Iraqi Human Rights Defence Society (IHRDS)".
The ousted regime punished them severely by cutting ears or tongues of some of them and tattooing foreheads of some others," head of the league of non-governmental human rights associations Adnan Abdel Aziz Al-Samerae said, adding, "The former regime issued an unfair decree under no. 117 on 25/8/1994 to the effect that the families of those tortured youth shall be deported outside cities and deprived of supply quotas. They were also prevented from working in official departments. "We ask, in the name of the league that includes 75 human rights organizations and associations, all ministries concerned to offer those victims psychological and in-kind compensations, rehabilitate them and employ them in jobs that suit their special circumstances."
The delegation which comprised university professors, female lawyers and civil organizations activists were keen on emphasizing the Iraqi's wish to set up a democratic regime after the American forces quit Iraq.
The Democratic Institute had organized similar fora in Arab Maghreb and the Middle East so as to promote the new American democratic ideas after the liberation of Iraq and to enhance the concepts of partisan plurality and develop the role of NGOs.

Officials of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) asked the governors of Beni Suef, Menya, Assiut, Aswan and Alexandria to necessarily work out women's programs ahead of a visit to be paid by U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Middle East affairs Liz Cheney to the Middle East region before the end of this year. In her visit, she is expected to mainly mull with officials in the region over a special blueprint to reform women's economic and political conditions. The plan will focus on offering small loans to businesswomen and other funds to several women's societies to advise and guide them to political life, provide financial support for conferences and symposia on women's conditions, and establish a telecommunication network and a special link system for those women who will benefit from Liz Cheney's project for women. She acquired the approval of a special fund called the "Middle East Finance Corporation" to bankroll women's projects, to which 20 million U.S. dollars have been allocated for 2004, expected to go up to 30 million U.S. dollars in 2005.
The Ramadan fast-breaking (Iftar) banquet given by the Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) group in Egypt two days ago, seemed as if it had been the incidents of a referendum on the officialdom's policy towards the group, especially after the latter was excluded from participation in a dialogue held by the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) with opposition parties.
Special importance was given to the presence of Iranian charge' d'affaires in Cairo Sayyed Hadi Khisro and Egyptian former chief of staff during the October 1973 war General Saadeddin Al-Shazli.
The speech delivered by Medical Association chairman Dr. Hamdi Al-Sayyed, who is an NDP member, was even sharper. He put forward Muslim Brotherhood contribution for years to humanitarian relief activities for years and praised syndicate symbols who belonged to the group. He voiced indignation at the fact that President Mubarak's call for dialogue was "mistranslated". He denounced excluding Muslim Brotherhood from participation in the dialogue attributing that to personal motives.

NEW POLITICAL MAP IN EGYPT DRAWN UP
Such pressure already exists at variable degrees and forms.
In Egypt, for instance, some signs of change started to appear months - or even years in one way or another - before the September 11th.
The reconsideration initiated by the Jamaa Islamia (Islamic Group) in 1997 attained its end and resulted in more moderate thought among Islamic movements in Egypt.
If the vistas of such a dialogue seem limited due to the fragility of the formation of parties and the weakness of their performance, except for the Tagamo'h (Grouping) Party which is cohesive to a certain degree, the development that took place in the NDP is still enough to bring about a tangible change in the political map.
There are about 10 parties ready to enter the partisan arena, which will be more competitive they have ever been since the partisan plurality was launched in 1976.
These two parties are expected to marginalize Al-Wafd Party, which also seems to be the destiny of the Arab Nasserite Party after Al-Karama had been greenlit.
This also coincides with an essential U-turn in the thought and stands of the Jamaa Islamia, which was the most extremist and fundamentalist group and then became the most moderate one.
Therefore, not only has this "group" become more moderate than Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan), it has surpassed Ikhwan as well because it has had an intellectual and political perspective, as it was lacking political and intellectual theorization for decades during which it depended on independent Islamic theorists.
Although there is no sign of the possibility of such a change, the expected amendment of the Law on Parties will likely redraw this map through the establishment of new stronger opposition parties.
Added to that, the meetings were rather bilateral with NDP singling out each of the three parties, which seems to be a condition set in advance under the pretext that on the heels of the meetings there would be a general meeting including the representatives of the three parties with the NDP in a bid to set the final agenda of the proposed dialogue.
The parties which participated in the October 22nd and 27th meetings think that the paper was inadequate for effecting a genuine political change and reform.
These are also the same demands which the secretary of the American vice president Liz Cheney has been trying to implement in the Middle East. Liz Cheney is expected to visit Egypt this month to follow up how far the American Aid funds are directed towards the achievement of these demands.
The preparatory meetings in the last two weeks have also uncovered there were differences in the agenda of the proposed economic reforms. Almost all the parties think that Atef Ebeid's government is leading the country to a disaster and therefore suspect that the dialogue might be just a ploy on the part of the NDP to absorb the state of public anger at the inept performance of the government which caused the people to face such an unprecedented state of price hikes.
This hoped to lend a sort of democratic climate to the state of affairs, which would, by the end of the day, relieve the external pressure exercised on the NDP, according to international reports. The curt statement which was issued at the end of the meeting between the NDP and Al-Wafd Party leader Numan Gomaa might uncover the National Party aim behind the dialogue and rallying the parties support of it. To quote the statement, "The two parties have emphasized unity of ranks regarding external issues and all that relates to Egypt's internal or external National security and the stability of the home front under President Mubarak."
The change process will also include members of the Political Bureau (nine in number), the Central Secretariat (12 in number) and the Central Committee (40 years).
Al-Azhar University was the scene of massive student demonstrations protesting against the university's administration rigging student elections.
EGYPT'S VEILED ANNOUNCERS ASK FOR AL-AZHAR SHEIKH'S HELP
For her part, Nadia Halim, chairwoman of the Egyptian TV Channel Two, told Al-Majalla that veiled announcers cannot appear on the screen pursuant to internal regulations, noting that it did not mean that the Egyptian TV objected to the Islamic uniform. When they signed their contracts, they accepted such regulations, she said. If an announcer puts on Islamic veil, she has to be transferred preparation jobs.
The governmental approval raised the resentment of some members of the People's Assembly who enunciated static against the establishment of the dancing school, especially under the current circumstances in Egypt and the Arab region.
Al-Azhar scholars called on Egyptian officials to stop the project and freeze its activities in order to keep the honour of Muslim girls and avoid spreading depravity and dissoluteness in an official way. The project will barely affect morality, behaviour and virtues by giving profligacy free rein in society.
Dr. Amena Mohamed Nusair, a professor at the Al-Azhar University Faculty of Islamic and Arabic Studies, said unfortunately everything bad is now allowable, noting that dancing is not an art that can upgrade the way of living or entertain people. An art that can meet morality standards is necessary for recreation and entertainment, she said.
It is an un-Islamic act."
He underlined the necessity of laying down laws that incriminate carrying out such experiments in the Arab and Muslim countries.
"The main aim behind my visit is to unite attitudes of and coordinate between Al-Azhar and the Vatican regarding human cloning so as to put this issue forward in the cession that will be organized soon by the UN," the ambassador of the Vatican said, adding," The Apostolic See touches upon the issues that jeopardize human life and family. We tend to make clear visions and attitudes for all religions," he concluded.
On the same day, a banquet which was new both in its idea and site was held in Al-Maharaq Monastery in Assiut governorate, Upper Egypt, 340 kilometers to the south of Cairo. The invitations this time were confined to mass media men and a number of intellectuals. It was organized by Anba Sawiras, bishop of Al-Maharaq Monastry. This banquet is regarded as a development of an idea which was put into effect by the Egyptian Press Syndicate which paid an annual visit to the monastery. The visit was due at the end of October which coincided with the beginning of Ramadan, thus converting the visit into a Ramadan breakfast which is the first to be held in that monastery since its construction in the fourth century A.D.
Dr. Tageddin's call, whether legitimate or not, has added to the feelings of depression that unusually overwhelm the Egyptians in that holy month. Such depression cannot be attributed to the black smog which nobody could either explain or put an end to. Nor could the Minister of Environment Dr. Mamdouh Riyadh do so and, therefore, he just forgot about.
Oriental confectionaries are in no better state. They used to be packed with fasters just before Iftar (fast breaking). However, according to the owner of a shop in Helopolis, Cairo, "Sales rates went down by about 30% compared with last year. I used to employ a guard to organize the customers, as there was no foothold before Iftar.

An Egyptian official said that his country was looking forward to a new stage in its regional relations with Iran adding that Tehran was a main player that could not be ignored in several regional cards. There are also economic and political common interests between Cairo and Tehran, he said.
Head of Iranian Interests Care Department in Cairo Khesro Shahi said that the constant consultations between Cairo and Tehran was a normal thing in light of the successive regional developments and the common keenness on exchanging view points between the two parties on various issues of common interest.
Israel's exports to Arab countries in the reporting period amounted to 88 million dollars, an increase of 13%, the statistics noted, pointing out that Israel's exports to Jordan hit 60 million dollars, up 24%.
EGYPT TURNS DOWN FRENCH JEWISH SOCIETY OFFER TO RENOVATE JEWISH MONUMENTS
NEW POLITICAL MAP IN EGYPT DRAWN UP
Such pressure already exists at variable degrees and forms.
In Egypt, for instance, some signs of change started to appear months - or even years in one way or another - before the September 11th.
The reconsideration initiated by the Jamaa Islamia (Islamic Group) in 1997 attained its end and resulted in more moderate thought among Islamic movements in Egypt.
If the vistas of such a dialogue seem limited due to the fragility of the formation of parties and the weakness of their performance, except for the Tagamo'h (Grouping) Party which is cohesive to a certain degree, the development that took place in the NDP is still enough to bring about a tangible change in the political map.
Some other parties are being formed. There are about 10 parties ready to enter the partisan arena, which will be more competitive they have ever been since the partisan plurality was launched in 1976. These parties include different political trends. If they are licensed, this will be the start of changing the political map because some of them will be stronger than some existing opposition parties or even will express the trends they stand for better than others.
The Tagamo'h may be the only party among existing opposition ones that will be in the heart of the new map despite the fact that more than one leftist party have been established.
The Jamaa Islamia practised violence at unprecedented rates in Egypt and was responsible for most violence incidents before and after its participation in the assassination of late President Anwar Al-Sadat in 1981 till 1997.
The Jamaa Islamia is, consequently, considered the real challenge to Ikhwan because the cofounders of Al-Wasat Party (dissidents of Ikhwan) could not be up to it because the party has not been licensed yet.
If this is followed, in a later stage, by licensing fundamentalist forces, the political map will be ready to assimilate and integrate with them in a gradual democratic process that can change the Egyptian political life in a decade's time.
Despite the curt statements, it has become obvious that there are big and profound differences between the NDP and the three parties. The curtness of such statements were meant to cover up such differences until the awaited dialogue takes place. The differences, nonetheless will certainly erupt at intervals.
The paper talks about sundry general topics with drafts that reek of American pressure.
The three opposition parties, consequently, think that the NDP paper which deals with the rights of citizenship and democracy is inadequate.
However, if the October 22nd and 27th meetings witnessed differences, it seems that the NDP on one side and Al-Wafd and Tagamo'h parties on the other side had agreed to exclude Muslim Brotherhood from the dialogue, which would certainly be in favour of the National Party. This may well explain why it asked that the dialogue be bilateral between it and each party on its own and be confined to the chief parties alone as well as the exclusion of representatives of the professional syndicates and non-governmental organization which the NDP knew, would oppose such exclusion.
TAGAMO'H STARTS CHANGE
Expectations point out that the party leader position, which will be left by Moheyeddin during the general congress, will be assumed by the strongest leader and Secretary General Dr. Refaat Al-Sa'id. It is also expected that Assistant Secretary General Hussein Abdel Razek will be promoted to the Secretary General post succeeding Al-Sa'id. MP Abul-Ezz Al-Hariri may take up as deputy leader, especially after veteran leftist Dr. Ismail Sabri Abdullah had refrained from contesting the elections on the posts of the party leader or his deputy.

Some 22 veiled announcers were barred from appearing on the screen whether on local or satellite channels.
With a 3-year study period, the school started working last August in spite of vehement opposition from the clergy. Some 14 scientific and theoretical subjects, prepared by Egyptian and foreign experts, are taught at the school. Arab and foreign teachers are working there.
Dr. Atta al-Sonbati, a professor at Al-Azhar University Faculty of Shari'a and Law, said dancing and non-commitment to Islamic veil are un-Islamic, calling for canceling the school which will surely lead to spreading immorality and profligacy.
The school will disseminate immorality and dissoluteness in society, she said, voicing support for high-quality arts, including painting, music, good serials and movies, rather than dancing and nudity.
It is a suspicious and alien school whose foundation has been laid by those who lie in wait for Islam and hate Muslims, he said. Al-Azhar scholars vehemently oppose the existence of this bizarre school, calling for closing it to avoid spreading immorality and profligacy.
"Cloning is an encroachment on human nature," Tantawi said upon receiving the Vatican's ambassador to Cairo.
RAMADAN FAST BREAKING (IFTAR) BANQUETS BY COPTS TO SHOW NATIONAL UNITY
This monastery is one of the most venerated among holy places in the Orthodox creed embraced by the Egyptian Coptic Church as it is the place where Christ and his mother Mary stayed for over 6 months during their escape to Egypt in the desert known as Galal Fuscam near Al-Quasya City, Assuit governorate. According to Christian reports, the Church built in that monastery was regarded as the oldest church in the world.

Perhaps for the first time in Ramadan for scores of years, there are almost no traffic jams despite the fact that Cairo 17 million inhabitants have made the capitals' streets as crowded as usual. Although traffic officials give credit to organization, control cameras and discipline, the secret probably lies in the low demand of most customers for purchasing.

Buffalo meat occupied the first place at a rate of 29% to be followed by beef at a rate of 24%; mutton, 21%. The above mentioned three kinds represent 74.5% of total consumption expenditure on red meat in the feast.
The report ascribed the retreat in red meat imports during 2003 to the importance attached by the competent bodies for increasing animal wealth in order to save foreign exchange spent on red meat imports in light of the hike of the cost of imports that resulted from the rise of exchange rate prices. This means that the development in local demand of mutton and beef production is higher than the local supply. It is worth mentioning that per capita consumption of red meat hit 8.9 kilograms in 2002 and then retreated to 8.8 kilograms in 2003.

This can be achieved through the concerted efforts of monitoring the market and keeping their stability as the economic development depends mainly on the two ensured resources of energy, he added.
Al-Naimi pointed out that OPEC second decision conformed to expectations of what will happen to demand, especially as all indices revealed that demand will decline remarkably in the second half from two to four million barrels per day. Moreover, the statistics of expectations of the increase of the strategic stock late in 2002 and 2003 confirmed that there is an increase hovering between 600-800 thousand barrels per day, which also match to the figures of the countries of European Development and Cooperation Organization as far as reserve stock is concerned. These figures showed that there is a daily increase of 500 thousand barrels on the market which hindered a decision of increasing production so that prices might not be affected.

The market now is waiting for a clear remark from Saudi Arabia which is expected to inform its customers of April supplies by the end of the coming week.
The Energy Information Administration at the American Energy Department had warned that if the US petrol stock went down the normal levels, any defaults in a refinery or a pipeline might cause a shortage in supply as well as a price rise.
GEBO REFUSES AL-AZHAR'S RECOMMENDATION TO CONFISCATE BOOK
"Al-Azhar is not entitled to confiscate any book, but it may make a recommendation to that effect and its recommendations are not binding, as the only body that is entitled to confiscate is the Egyptian judiciary which we have confidence in its justice, fairness and defence of freedoms and rights of Egyptian writers," Sarhan added. On Tuesday, the Egyptian branch of the International Writers Club, which is honourably headed by 1988-Nobel-prize winner, novelist Naguib Mahfouz, issued a statement including a stand similar to that of the GEBO, highlighting President Hosni Mubarak's decision that Al-Azhar is not a body entitled to confiscate the creative works of the Egyptians.

WILL ABU MAZEN RETURN TO HEAD PALESTINIAN CABINET?
JEWISH EMIGRANTS RETURN TO RUSSIA
A delegation of the Jews who retuned to Russia met some officials of the entourage of Sharon and told them that they preferred to return after they despaired of being accommodated in Israel.
Some of them said that they had returned to Russia mainly due to the deteriorating economic conditions.
In Israel itself, a new deterioration related to Russian Jews was unveiled in a special report compiled by Premier's office.
It was unveiled in Tel Aviv late last week that Israel entered the Iraqi market so easily and strongly, and its products were now on sale in Baghdad, Basra and other cities and municipalities.
He is well-known by Americans as he holds both American and Israeli nationalities, has two offices in Washington and Jerusalem and writes articles carried by American papers, in which he defends Jewish settlements and does a hatchet job on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
In Israel, over five company owners said they have started to export goods to Iraq through him.
There are also Israeli businessmen setting up companies in foreign countries such as Cyprus and the U.S. to export Israeli products to Iraq.
These firms have been offering know-how and supplies in several areas, including military, media, medical, medicine and energy ones.
IRAQI MONARCHY CONSTITUTIONAL MOVEMENT SPONSOR: TRANSITIONAL GOVERNING COUNCIL NULL AND VOID
A: I think it is more willing to do so now than at any previous time especially as there are now better chances for political action on the Iraqi arena, to the contrary of the ex-regime. Generally speaking, this monarchy can find sympathy and support in Iraq, but the problem lies in the absence of any immediate action to react with the issue. Now what is wanted is the best system that can ensure such rights to the contrary of previous failed republics that turned into autocracies rather than institutional governments.
This model can only work in Iraq but cannot work in other Arab countries because Iraq has got a unique type of factional, political and ethnic multiplicity. In a nutshell, monarchy, in that system, would be the "haven to which each Iraqi may resort to ensure the rights of every Iraqi citizen and avoid the emergence of any despotic systems that abuse power and employ mass media to serve such regimes. The constitution and neutrality will also find a haven in such a monarchy.
The action continued and developed and turned into an organizational movement which we called the "Constitutional Monarchy" in order to deal with other trends including Iraqi forces and parties and Arab and European countries with a view to getting across the message for which we started action.
We have come to Cairo, which is the capital of Arab diplomacy in order to ask for support of our initiative and actions.
A democratic system respects the sovereignty of law and the Kurdish people's rights. It is, therefore, the ideal solution to the problem. I, in addition, doubt that a federation would ensure avoiding the emergence of a new dictator who will exterminate the Kurdish people just as was the case with the previous regime.
The American governor's words seemed to give the impression that there was no Iraq before the Americans arrived. They are trying to suggest that we have come from the desert, thus obliterating all the ancient civilization of Iraq dating back to thousands of years ago.
Q: How do you see the Jews especially as your mother said that it was Iraq's Jews who supported you and then attacked both Muslims and Christians?
A: The American strategy relied on plans formulated in closed rooms with their allies and was based on wrong or inaccurate premises. When they came to Iraq, they were shocked at the reality and we had already warned them about that.
The Saudi TV's Channel One started, for the first time since the Shura Council was formed in 1992, to broadcast a "recorded" tape for the minutes of the two sessions of Sunday and Monday last. This step was meant to enable the Saudi citizen to get acquainted with the nature and mechanism of the sessions, how issues are discussed between the speaker and the members, how comments are conveyed during a session, and how a vote is cast on proposed situations and issues.
Tension started to loom over Algerian-Moroccan relations once again.
It added that the Foreign Ministry ordered the ambassador in Rabat, Bin Alam Basayih to take similar measures with the Moroccan authorities.
This obscure organization announced its adherence to Moroccan sovereignty over Gibraltar Leila Island, Ceuta and Melilla cities in the north of Morocco, which are subject to Spanish control, and rejecting the plan of the international delegate to the Moroccan Western Desert, James Baker.
Any repeated Israeli aggression on Syria entitles the latter to legitimately defend itself with all possible means, said Director General of Information Department, Syrian Foreign Minstry Boshra Kanafani. "It is true that Israel is militarily superior, but we also have our own cards, which we will use all," she added.
SAUDIS SPEND OVER SR 3.5 BN IN RAMADAN
Saudis spend their money on different kinds of dates, soup, beans, starches, different desserts and fruit, they said, citing a worker in Jeddah-based Panda Al-Azizia supermarket as saying that the supermarket was crowded with shoppers, especially women, since Ramadan has started.
This month cannot be compared with other months, he said, in terms of spending, sales and purchases because it is a religious event that all people try to be open handed.
In a press conference held yesterday, on the margin of a meeting by the Supreme Council for Policies, the Egyptian President's son implied that there was a tendency towards expanding participation in the dialogue conducted by his party with opposition forces.
"All reform pivots are based on our own conviction and internal vision. What is called pressure cannot achieve reform or impose a certain order of priorities on us."
Welch asked the Egyptian authorities concerned to teach American history and Hebrew to Egyptian students under the pretext that the US is keen to spread freedom and democracy in the world and preserve human rights, said the deputies. Teaching Hebrew to Egyptian students would help remove hatred towards Israel and convince them of the peace option, the US ambassador claimed.
In the statement, a copy of which was obtained by Asharq Al-Awsat, the Group called for referring the Company's Board to investigations, as unimaginable constitutional and environmental violations and excesses had been proven.
By so doing, Saudi Arabia has closed down the file of the projects of gas prospecting and production in the Rub' Al-Khali area that lasted for about five years. It is noteworthy that the gas initiative was launched in 1998 when Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Abdel-Aziz announced it during his visit to Washington after meeting with presidents of American companies. However, the initiative has not been settled except when it was put up for bidding among international companies. Russia, China, Italy and Spain won it.
Saudi investors do not take part in these projects owing to high international risks, shouldered by these companies in prospecting for gas, said the Minister, asserting that the Saudi government is keen that no Saudi investor should be exposed to big risks. However, he said despite these risks, the gains might be big in relation to the volume of the expected investments. Besides, the support services from contractors as well as the operation and supply departments are mainly dependent on Saudi investors. These gas investments are considered a big chance for the growth and blooming of Saudi economy.
He stressed that this agreement is considered the first of its kind in the field of joint Saudi-Russian cooperation, adding that it would be a strong starting point for establishing strong ties between the two governments. This agreement takes the form of pumping big investments and bringing about cooperation between the two countries in light of the continuous political dialogue and strong relations between the two countries. In the same context, he denied that there are guarantees or insurance for the Russian Company's investments inside Saudi Arabia.
For his part, Vetero Menikato, Senior Executive Administrator of the Italian Company Eni, denied that there were any problems over gas prospecting in the border area between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, especially as the Zone (C) is situated in the area adjacent to the Saudi-Qatari border. He said there are no political differences among the companies over the Qatari borders, pointing out that the headquarters of the joint firm between his Company and ARAMCO will be inside Saudi Arabia.
About 24 countries have shown readiness to attend the 9th international conference on oil, gas and petrochemicals, due to be held in the Iranian Capital Teheran on May 12-17, 2004, says the Iranian News Agency.
Asked about what OPEC will do as the price of the American crude oil is above $37 per barrel, OPEC Head answered, "OPEC has automatic mechanism to control prices. When prices exceed $28 per barrel, OPEC guarantees oil supplies on the markets."
The Spanish-Egyptian Gas Company (SEGAS) would export the first shipment of gas to Spain next November through the company project set up at Damietta Harbour in the Mediterranean Sea.
OIL PRICES LOSE THEIR EARLY PROFITS AFTER THE SENATE HAD CANCELLED ADDING 53 MILLION BARRELS TO STRATEGIC RESERVE

Forward contract prices of Brent crude oil declined in the International Petroleum Exchange following the amendment. Brent prices in April deliveries went down by 36 cents to 32.47 dollars per barrel.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) revised its expectations of demand in 2004 expecting a 220,000-barrel increase a day to 1.65 million barrels a day, due to the rise of consumption in China. The IEA doubled it expectations on the demand for oil in China to 580,000 barrels per day.
IRAQI OIL DELEGATION PROBES IN RIYADH CONSOLIDATION OF JOINT COOPERATION
The delegation will discuss issues of joint concern to back joint investment, he said, adding that the role of Saudi private sector companies in qualifying Iraqi oil establishments will also be probed.

The price of Brent crude went up by Â¢3 per barrel, following a drop of Â¢13 per barrel in the previous session.
US SENATE RECOMMENDATION FOR BRAKING INCREASE OF STRATEGIC OIL RESERVES TRIGGER HOT DEBATE, AMID EXPECTED WHITE HOUSE REFUSAL OF RESOLUTION
Such an action would have a positive effect for lowering fuel prices and easing the burden of American families that are facing extremely high prices, he went on.
The specialized Lundberg Survey bulletin said that the price of gasoline had gone up to $1.77 per gallon (3.8 liters) over the past two weeks.
BP BUILDS ALLIANCE FOR IMPLEMENTING OIL PROJECTS IN KUWAIT'S NORTHERN OILFIELDS
He went on to say that British Petroleum had established an alliance with the American Occidental Company and the Indian Petroleum Company, which had brought into existence a consortium that possessed diversified experiences enabling it to be at the forefront of the competitors for contracts involving the northern oilfields.
The standard Brent prices declined in future dealings at the International Petroleum Exchange yesterday, after a rise of around one dollar in the previous session after a report from the OPEC about the reduction of its production by 13 thousand barrels a day only in February last.
OPEC said yesterday that it lowered its expectation of the demand for the organization's oil in the second quarter by 190 thousand barrels a day to reach 24.76 million barrels a day.
"The current oil price will not be useful to the world and we are concerned over this matter", he told reporters in Jakarta.
The crazy rise in the oil prices in the US raised concerns among a large number of US industrialists starting from airlines to car drivers who spend much to fill their tanks with petrol whose price is increasing day after day.
In a memo to investors, American Airlines, one of the biggest airline groups in the US, said: "The prices of kerosene are higher than expected".
The heavy industry too suffers from this rise.
Minister of Information and secretary-general of the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) Safwat Al-Sherif categorically denied any intention to involve Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) in the dialogue held by the NDP with opposition parties and forces, confirming that the dialogue would only include legitimate forces.
However, he laid it bare that such amendments "will never allow the formation of any Islamic or Coptic party."
"The reforms put forward by the NDP with some party leaders outdid the ambitions of some parties," he said.
He was slightly injured in his right hand and his chauffeur was seriously wounded.

EGYPTIAN SOURCES OFFICIALLY DENY COMMERCIAL COOPERATION WITH ISRAEL
They added that the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Businessmen Association had set a negative list of the members who dealt with Israel in the name of the Federation and the Association as members were free to deal with any market in their names only and, therefore, nobody could have anything to do with that dealing.
The data uncover that Israeli exports to Lebanon through a third country had risen by 151%, thus reaching about $300 thousand.
Tantawi, moreover, claimed that whoever loses his life in these operations should be treated like those who commit "suicide".
The front issued a statement announcing its deep concerns and Al-Azhar and Ifta House's worries about these statements, saying, "We reject these statements and stress that whoever performs such operations is a martyr because these operations are in defence of land and honour against the Jewish enemy."
Sheikh Tantawi's fatwa, which he made exclusively to Al-Mussawar on Tuesday, was in reply to to the Israeli press and television which reported that the Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar prohibited martyrdom operations and deemed them as suicidal and that Mufti Dr. Ali Goma' opposed him and collected the signatures of 28 scholars against Sheikh Tantawi's fatwa, which he completely denied. "I've never made a statement to the Israeli television. If they have a record or tape for such an alleged statement, they can expose it. I even refuse to be interviewed by the Israeli Television.
In the context of sustained U.S. campaigns against Islamic organizations and institutions, there are now reports at diverse American institutions accusing Al-Azhar of financing terrorist groups which carry out aggressive activities against the U.S. and "moderate countries".
Such informal fatwas constitute a reference for religious groups. There is a semi-official relationship between Al-Azhar and religious institutions in some Arab Gulf nations and Lebanon's Hezbollah, taking additional dimensions when directed against Israel, according to Zionist claims.
Despite the directives of Minister of State for Higher Education and Scientific Research, Dr. Mufid Shehab to conduct elections in a democratic and fair way in order to be an example of political participation of youths, representatives of fundamentalist and other opposition trends said that they were excluded so that representatives of the ruling party could win uncontested.
The local administration bodies managed to settle a disagreement between the village citizens that might have led to a sectarian sedition. The prosecution commenced investigations into the reasons of the conflict, which was contrast to the prevailing climate in the holy month of Ramadan.
An official source told Al-Hayat that the Central Security Forces cordoned off the village to prevent the escalation of the situation and arrested 20 people for investigation. Moreover, efforts are being exerted to effect a reconciliation between Muslim and Copt leaders in the village.
"The Middle East Churches Council demanded for a course for Coptic women to raise their awareness of the personal status law, which grants them the khul' right, but the church does not recognize it," ECWR Director, lawyer Nehad Abul-Qumsan said.
DIVORCE AND BUSINESS
The company's directors believe that the problem together with its chronic causes and fears may turn huge profits to the company.
The company intends to invest more than 25 million pounds in this project, which will include other insurance services for small and medium-sized families and women in general.
"There are many social and economic reasons for divorce including complicated circumstances of combining work with household affairs", the official said.
The new project comes within the framework of efforts to extend new insurance services to the Egyptian market amid fierce competition among about five companies that have entered the market since the insurance sector was opened before private companies for the first time in 2000. The main activity of such companies concentrate on life insurance services.
The company's administration fear that some husbands may resort to fictitious divorce to obtain the insurance value.
I'M FOR DEMOCRACY, BUT...
Such admission to guilt is, however, far from being unmotivated or sincere as might be deduced from the Mauritanian case where the regime supported by Washington and Israel is exercising the most ferocious types of repression against the opposition to prevent them from contesting the presidential elections.
This is not a defence of the current state of democracy in any particular Arab country. The image President Bush has been given about Arab positions is far from true and even betrays gross ignorance of the truth about what progress or backwardness democracy is witnessing.
In any case, we are quite beholden to the American President as he, at last, discovered that democracy is not at variance with Islam.
For his part, Al-Azahr grand Sheikh Mohamed Sayed Tantawi said Al-Azhar cooperates with all Islamic institutions to spread the Holy Qur'an and annually allocates 15 million pounds in the form of rewards for such a purpose, Tantawi said.
It is to be mentioned that the Iranian official held talks yesterday with Egyptian Assistant Minister for Asian Affairs, ambassador Mahmoud Karim.

The holy month of Ramadan brings us together in tolerance and cooperation for the propagation of virtue and righteousness."
NEW ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO CAIRO ISOLATED
Sources pointed out that the Israeli ambassador demanded via diplomatic channels more than 13 appointments to meet Egyptian officials in the government, People's Assembly and Shura Council. However, neither of such bodies responded to his demands, which made him worried after he had been optimistic and persistent when he arrived in Cairo to take over officially. He wished to challenge the circumstances and hurdles that faced his predecessors under deteriorating Egyptian-Israeli relations at all levels.
The report pointed out a growth of per capita quota of foodstuffs in general despite tough economic conditions, as the annual per capita quota of grain hit 263 kg in 1991; meat, 12,2 kg; dairy products, 50.4 kg; and fish, 6.7 kg.
Where are Muslim Brotherhood battalions?
In his reply to the youth, Al-Hudhaibi said, "When the nation was united through its faith in Islam that took the forms of words as well as actions, when its faith was deeply rooted in the hearts and fully assimilated in the minds and properly abided by through actions, the nation was then impregnable. It had also its role in all realms and a say on the international level. When there was faith in Islam as a creed warming the hearts, a system of life whose traits are clearly cut in minds and solid actions emphasizing the profundity of creed, the integrity of understanding and the harmony between words and acts, our lands were safe from aggression, our honour was inviolate and our sanctities were unthreatened.
These are the keys to the political attitudes of a people who have deep faith in Islam, a faith that always turns into actions by, a people that seeks to make sacrifices in the cause of faith.
The study said most of those surveyed, 4566 young men and women from 21 governorates, admitted that emotional relationships were spread among youth.
Head of the Sudanese Association for Human Rights, Ghazi Sulaiman, who doubles as head of democratic forces front, said that Egypt has played a main role in maintaining Sudan's unity and affecting the American stance towards it.
NEW VERSION OF MIDEAST PLAN
In a parallel development, Washington plans to impose a kind of economic isolation on Syria and Iran and close the investment market in the face of the two countries as they are thought to adopt an anti-US military presence stance.
Therefore, the US thought that it was better to have direct relations with many countries even if they were geographically small ones, in lieu of confining its political investment to one country to act as its exclusive agent. It transpired that upon the failure, collapse or change of an agent, US regional interests are greatly harmed.
In a nutshell, the new Mideastern plan is a joint Israeli-American political and strategic investment, based on tightening the Israeli-American hegemony on the region and isolating Egypt from Arab Mashreq and the Arab Gulf countries.
Naval sources said the OPEC members did not exert any noteworthy effort to prepare a new naval law for fighting terrorism that will start to take effect on 1st July. They may face a possible confusion in exports if they missed the final date, according to what Reuters mentioned two days.
A source in charge of offering advice to the Middle Eastern and African governments regarding the measures told Reuters: "As far as we know, none of the governments to which we offer advice abides by the security law though some of them trained ships security officers and accepted plans.
The security source said that Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil exporter, trained security officers for its fleet of State-owned carriers, but did not address aspects related to the security of ports.
Another source in charge of offering advices to the southeastern Asian countries regarding the new rules added: "Indonesia did nothing".
Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said in an interview he did not yet know whether strong oil prices would lead the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to delay its pact to cut supplies by one million barrels per day from April.
"I don't know.
Qatari Energy and Industry Minister Abdullah bin Hamad Al-Ateya announced yesterday (22nd March) the establishment of a drilling company under the name of "Gulf International Drilling Company" with a capital of 258 million dollars. The company will work in drilling oil wells in and outside Qatar.
SIGNS OF DIFFERENCE EMERGE IN OPEC DUE TO A PROPOSAL FOR POSTPONING THE PRODUCTION CUT TO JUNE
He continued to says that "There are no official suggestion to that regard."
Qatari Energy and Petroleum Minister Abdullah Al-Attiya said that he does not support any movement from OPEC to put off the production cut.
In this regard, Algerian Energy Minister Chekib Khalil defended OPEC's decision to cut production by one million barrels as of the 1st April, describing it as a preventive measure to avoid a sharp decline in oil prices.
STRATEGIC REPORT: MIDDLE EAST OIL WILL REMAIN CONTROLLING INTERNATIONAL MARKET IN COMING 20 YEARS
The report also dealt with the effects of the US, Europe and Asia dependence on the energy supplies, imported from abroad.
Finally, the report touched on the challenges that face expansion of exports in the Middle East and North Africa from 2004 up to 2030.
In the contrary, during the past 30 years, these attempts raised the quota of the Middle East and North Africa against the international oil stocks increased, and reliance on the oil of this region grew.
The importance of the Middle East oil becomes clearer when the report mentions the expectations of the International Energy Agency that the annual average rise in oil consumption will be within the vicinity of 1.7%, and the expectations of the American Energy Information Administration that the demand for oil will increase from 78 million barrels per day in 2002 to 118 million barrels in 2025. Half of these needs are expected to come from Middle East countries that are OPEC members only.
The Emir of Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province, Prince Mohammad Bin Fahd Bin Abdul Aziz, called on international consultation firms to start giant projects for exploration of minerals other than oil and gas in the Eastern Province. He also urged Saudi businessmen to launch more initiatives for mining investment, pointing out that geological surveys had shown that the Eastern Province as rich in several kinds of minerals that could be extracted in commercial quantities and included raw materials that many conversion industries could use.
The speculators on oil have a great influence on oil prices."
In a speech to the inaugural session of the symposium, Al Naimi said that one of the main objectives of development plans was to develop the mining industry in order to secure the local needs of raw minerals and export the remainder, given that mineral production would be more than local needs.
A sea transportation agent in the region said: "The oil tanker of Sandra Tabyas is being loaded at Khor Al-Amiya, bearing in mind that its capacity is one million barrels."
However, as of its inauguration four months ago, the average exports amounted to 100,000 barrels daily.
The two ports of Basra and Khor Al-Amiya share some units of the infrastructure of oil pumping, which confined total exports from the south to about 1.8 million barrels per day up till now, according to sources.
The Caspian Sea region and the surrounding countries (former Soviet Union states) have become the limelight of US companies due to their strategic importance to international energy markets as well as their reasonable oil and natural gas reserves.
Since the era of former US President Bill Clinton, the United States tried to set up a new pipeline with a view to achieving this end and keeping the recently independent Russian countries away from the Russian influence.
Therefore, the US is seeking to achieve two goals at one go: firstly, securing access to oil in a way that boosts the US economy; secondly, not depending on OPEC and the Gulf region's supplies.
Competing Gulf oil Most oil experts see that the Caspian Sea region's oil will not compete strongly with that of the Gulf for many considerations. The discovered confirmed reserves up till now are not big, as they do not exceed 3 percent of the world's total reserves.
It is noteworthy that demand for oil is expected to grow by more than 78 million barrels daily at present to 119 million barrels a day by 2020. It is also expected that half of such production would come from Middle Eastern OPEC member states.
"Gaddafi is aware that the most important element in the game is Washington, so the Americans will get the lion's share in the Libyan oil," Fred Holliday from London University's Economy Faculty comments.
"Libya is looking forward to the American companies and expertise," an oil consultant said.
Libya considers its deal with Shell as an attempt to repair the oil sector's infrastructure, which stumbled due to shortage of dollar supplies.
The memorandum, which will create 202 jobs for Jordanian workers, was signed by Jordanian Labor Minister Amjad Al Majali and Egyptian Ambassador to Jordan Mohammad Hegazi. The ceremony was attended by Jordanian Minister of Mineral Resources Eng Azmi Khuraisat.
Amb Hegazi said that the pipeline, which was in its second stage, was one of the most significant Arab integration projects and would run from Aqaba to the Syrian border for 380 kilometers with a cost of over $350 million.
"They had two million barrels in the tanks. Now they have 2.7 million barrels that are on the increase every minute," he added.
The Iraqi Oil Ministry is looking forward to producing a total of 2.8 million barrels late this year. This is the quantity, which Iraq used to produce before the beginning of the military operations a year ago.
The study, which was prepared by the Arab League in collaboration with the Arab Monetary Fund and the Arab Industrial Development Organization, stressed OPEC's need for investing some $160 billion to raise its production capacity to 44 million barrels per day by 2010, pointing out that increasing OPEC capacity to 36 million barrels per day during the next few years depended providing other investments totaling more than $155 billion.
The study stressed the importance of encouraging technological participation, which would allow continuity and exploitation of the relative privileges of oil resources in both OPEC and OAPEC, encourage the flow of foreign investments into all the stages of oil industry and change the view of economic security into one that takes into consideration the interests of both producers and consumers alike.
On April 4, 2004, Saudi Arabia held the strict American environmental laws and the weak capacity of American refineries responsible for the record rise in petrol prices in the US.
"No single refinery has been built in the US in the past 20 years.
"Unless the US starts streamlining this field and handling lack in refining capacity, there will be always a problem in petrol," he pointed out.
The project is related to one of the biggest gas projects in Syria, he said. The project provides for building two factories to treat gas. The production capacity of the first factory amounts to six million cubic meters of gas daily, while that of the second hits three million cubic meters.
The American-Canadian-British consortium has been chosen at a time when the US is threatening Syria with imposing economic sanctions on it, including restrictions over exportation and American investments in Syria.
Participants in this exhibition are more than 300 companies from about 30 Arab and foreign companies. This exhibition is aimed at exchanging ideas over the gas and oil sectors, giving a room for being acquainted with the most up-to-date innovations in these two sectors, discussing programs and raised problems, and encouraging specialist activities. This will push the development of oil and gas industry forward in Syria and the region.
Under this heading, Al-Ittihad daily carried a lengthy feature, saying: Why did Israel publish a map of what it called Palestinian organizations' centers and offices in the heart of the Syrian capital of Damascus?
More seriously, the U.S. President George W. Bush's administration is aware of, and has okayed, Sharon's war plan. It also appeared to kick off media and political preparations for this war not only through an expected congressional resolution on Syria but also organized onslaughts against Syria, Hizbollah, Palestinian factions and other parties in a bid to justify the coming war.
-Arab weakness has reached a stage where the Arabs cannot respond to any event whether at the level of war on Syria, Lebanon or even Egypt or Saudi Arabia or that of reoccupying Arab territories of the Arab world.
-The ongoing global situation will have no influence on Israel's plans. Russia, for instance, will not be able to prevent Israel from going ahead with this war. Concerning the European Union (EU), French President Jacques Chirac is almost the only EU leader who cautions against a new Middle East war.
Some link the early December date for war to the end of the holy month of Ramadan and the countdown for Bush's presidential election campaign.
Although Damascus regarded statements by its ambassador in Madrid that Syria would respond militarily to any Israeli aggression as a mere personal position, Syria is believed not to have many options at the level of relying on any international pressure to square up to the Israeli option. Thus, Syria will use all its cards, including a military confrontation whether through a conventional response to air raids or the South Lebanon card which is the optimal one to stand up to Israel as the force which will get engaged in this clash from the South is an irregular force and can fire missiles at north Israel at a depth of 40 km as Hizbollah, and others, have suitable weapons in this regard.
AMERICAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE INTENT ON ESTABLISHING CENTER IN BAGHDAD
Iraqi industrialists are afraid of the new investment act passed by the civil administrator in Iraq Paul Bremer, particularly as it allows foreign and American investors to rent the project land for 60 years enjoying all rights that they have in their mother countries.
The Iraqi Industries Federation gives priority to the investments coming from neighbouring countries, especially Syria, Jordan and Gulf states, he said, pointing out current contacts with these countries in order to achieve that end.
MUBARAK'S ILLNESS EXPEDITES APPOINTMENT OF A DEPUTY PRESIDENT!
Opposition forces demand that such a system be replaced by the free election system from among more than one candidate.
Talk about the son's succession of his father increased after the policies secretariat was set up in the Second Congress of the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) last year with Gamal Mubarak assuming its chairmanship.
Some people, though, think that assigning the position of deputy president to Gamal Mubarak while his father is in power, could earn him the support of all the country's establishments including the army, the police and the Intelligence Service when his turn to become president comes, just as was the case with his father.
Many people believe that Al-Sherif is the closest of those to the President.
Yesterday (21st November), Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher unveiled new expectations that the US would propose later on an Egyptian-Israeli joint pr oject under its auspices to set up a nuclear reactor with the support of a third party, probably South Africa. Thus, Egypt has to lay down an all out strategy including a number of alternatives.
The professors expressed dissatisfaction at that move and addressed a letter to the university president, noting that the university buildings are busy with cultural and scientific activities.

U.S. PROFESSOR IN EGYPT CONVERTS TO ISLAM Nowadays, there is much talk in the American University in Cairo (AUC) about a handsome ethnology professor who has converted to Islam recently.
Interviewed by the London-based Al-Hayat daily, Cole said, "I managed to evade participation in Vietnam War and, instead, stayed in Saudi Arabia in 1968-1970. Thank God, I could live in the old city of Riyadh where Al-Azan (the call for prayer) aired from thousands of mosques strongly pushed me to interact with it."

From the moment he entered the hall, Gamal Mubarak was warmly received by the party's youth who seemed to be staging a demonstration of love, cheers of President Mubarak. He was showered by inquiries after the President's health. This took place after NDP Indoctrination Secretary, Dr. Alieddin Hilal stated that the President was well and that his sudden feeling of being unwell might be attributed to NDP members who showered the President with kisses during their meeting with him in the party's parliamentary body. He pointed out that the President's temperature was high but he insisted on going to the people's Assembly so as not to delay the state's institutions.
In an urgent memo to Premier Atef Ebeid and Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher, they called the government to file an international action before the international Court of Justice to regain the city.
This reward came only a few days after the American President address where he summed up what is practically required for the democratization of the Arab world. It was the address which was followed by a Senate meeting during which an exceptional amendment was introduced allocating $2 million from the annual American aid to Egypt for Ibn Khaldoun Center. Observers point out that such a measure had been implicitly arranged as the amendment was passed without being read after two republican deputies took the floor and asked that the amendment be endorsed to extend support to Saad Eddin Ibrahim's center as that would be part of building democracy in Egypt.
The man (Ebeid) said in his remarks spotlighted by papers that Egypt imports 50 percent of its needs of flour, beans, lentils and meat and all its needs of tea and cacao.
The premier went on to say in his remarks that this situation would remain and that it is not possible to bridge this gap for this requires 21 million feddans while the present area is 8 million feddans and that any efforts will raise this area to only 11 million feddans at most.
This is possible in all countries, excluding Egypt where a cabinet minister is often axed, but cannot resign...why...no one knows.

Israeli Mossad Chief Meir Dagan said Iran constituted the "main threat" to world peace, describing the "Iranian nuclear capabilities" as a major threat to the presence of the Jewish State.
Iran, moreover, was spending tens of billions of dollars on its nuclear project though it is not economically feasible and that definitely proves that the nuclear program is not designed for the peaceful use of nuclear energy as they claim.
MOFAZ: ISRAEL WILL ATTACK IRAN TO ABORT DEVELOPMENT OF ITS NUCLEAR WEAPON
Maariv correspondent added that Mofaz did not talk explicitly about how to put the brakes on the Iranian programme. "Mofaz meant that Israel would not hesitate to abort the Iranian project," he said.
This American stance was apparent during the long talks held by the two ministers separately with American Vice-president Deck Cheney and National Defence Advisor Condoleezza Rice together with Mofaz's meeting with his American counterpart Donald Rumsfeld and Netanyahu's meetings with American economic policy officials.
"What is taking place in Iraq make the Americans understand our position, as they are exposed to terrorist attacks and have to use repressive means to crush Iraqis including innocents.
However, he warned that (the Iranians) talk about postponing rather than canceling the project.
As regards the Syrian-Lebanese issue, they talked about Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad and his vague policies, as Mofaz described him as a strange man while Rumsfeld described him as vague.
He said he believed that the United States would greenlight any Israeli operation against terrorist targets in Syria, which would serve its interests and goals and would be an influential card in the political dialogue with Damascus.

The Chaldeans and Assyrians' call came following a series of demands at the forefront of which was the Kurdish one, which stressed that the coming Iraqi constitution should explicitly stipulate federalism that achieves the whole national rights of the Iraqi Kurds.
In reply to Mazhar, Iraqi Arab academicians said that federalism would be a prelude to separation and that the new Iraqi constitution should not stipulate federalism so long as it enshrines all the national and ethnic rights of all Iraqi people. However, they pointed out the possibility of establishing an administrative federalism.
AMERICAN AGENDA AND IRAQI PROGRAMME
This anticipation, easy as it is, might tempt many Iraqis or perhaps Iraq's neighbours too to misinterpret the American decision.
President Bush's administration which hopes for a renewal of its term in office in next year elections would not be able to defend such an output of a war that expensive.
The ceiling of such a charge as is apparent so far is the international resolution 1511 which contains a UN recognition of the American-Governing Council relation without trials to develop such a resolution in a way that would restore to the UN its role in that crisis.
Suppose we overlooked the meaning behind targeting international, humanitarian and civilian sites in the suicidal attacks, what do the attacks perpetrators promise the Iraqis?
What would be the case, furthermore, if he, instead of coming back alone, returned with his current allies whose experiment in Afghanistan proved their ability to turn a country into a human slaughter house!
However, as Washington is seeking to burden the council with that responsibility whose members are laying the foundation for a unique period in contemporary Iraqi history, they are supposed to move from discussing quotas to the establishment of a "charter" that would make it possible to establish a modern Iraqi state that is immune against the return of despotism and capable of protecting plurality and democracy.
After Syria hosted the Spanish monarch King Juan Carlos and President Bashar Al-Assad visited Qatar last month, Vajpayee reached Damascus on Friday. In spite of his country's distinguished relations with America and Israel, he said that such relations would not be at the expense of India's relations with Arab countries.

Egypt and South Africa are members in the twenty-country bloc, which represents the interests of the developing countries in the WTO, the source said.
Egypt, therefore, seeks to make consultation with South Africa and Nigeria to convince them of the advantages of entering into a bilateral or trilateral free trade agreement.
South Africa enjoys a relatively high protective ceiling, which will give Egyptian products, when they are exempted from customs duties, a relative advantage on the South African market.
Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) took a similar decision.

Some sources with the Academy, however, said that the researches focused on the gravity of Bahais' beliefs and unveiling the relation between the Bahais and Zionism and imperialism. They also refute Bahais allegations that they represent proper faith and are just an Islamic faction regardless of being pronouced as infidels.
The Islamic Research Academy, the highest authority in Al-Ahzar, issued a decision banning the circulation of a book written by Abu Zaid called "The discourse and explanation" in Egypt and demanding the copies distributed on the markets be whisked away.
Egypt is not different from the world countries that work to protect their culture within a framework set by the Constitution, which stipulates that the Islamic creed is one of its main sources, Bayoumi told Al-Hayat.
Due to the judicial ruling that stamped Abu Zaid as an infidel and separated him from his wife, after which he escaped and resorted to Holland, the Egyptian Government moved to change the hesba enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong law.

The new settlement scheme prevents any expansion or connection between Bethlehem and Beit Sahour but, meanwhile, ensures a connection between the settlements in this area, which forestalls any real possibility to restore even parts of Eastern Jerusalem.
The newspaper quoted Israeli officials as saying that the scheme would have started by the beginning of 2004, pointing out that steps are currently being taken to "alter" the ownership of such lands regarded by Israel as owned by "absentees" and, therefore, subject to the authority of Israeli Receiver of the Absentees' Property in spite of the presence of the original land owners and consequently referring them to the Authority of Development in Israel's Land Department as a prelude to starting building works.
Sharon entrusted his double with harassing the Arabs through confiscating their lands and obstructing every way of earning a livelihood for them. This double was Major General (reservist) Avi Etam, Minister of Housing, from the National Religious Party, who could beat his opponent Joseph Paritzki from Shenoui Party and was, thus, granted a government license to supervise the construction of 36 new cities in Negev and Galilee under the pretext of preserving the state's lands.
A journalist with Jerusalem Post newspaper pointed out the number of Negev Bedouins increased from 52,300 in 1985 to 118,200 in 2001.
The policy of forcing the Arabs to be always on the defensive can be traced back to Sharon's policy when he said to the army generals, "We should always be on the offensive to keep the Palestinians on the defensive. Our offensive should not be restricted by Oslo agreements.
According to the project approved by Arnez in 1999, the number of Bedouin youths recruited now for military service amounts to 800 youths. They and the sons of other groups like the Druze and Maronites in Lebanon are sent to border areas to try to prevent the infiltration of commandos from Arab countries such as Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt and would therefore kill Arabs rather than Israelis!
Palestinian Minister of Finance, Sallam Fayadh unveiled a financial and administrative scandal in a governmental body affiliated to the Palestinian Oil Authority.
Al-Masri asked Fayadh about the documents of the Ministry of Finance related to the Oil Authority's revenues on the heels of cancelling its monopoly of importing, selling and distributing oil byproducts and giving room for the Palestinian private sector to take part in this field within a financial reform plan adopted by Fayadh since he was appointed as Minister of Finance about one year and a half ago.
"Following the cancellation of the Oil Authority's monopoly of importing oil derivatives, Fayadh said that the Authority's revenues increased by one third in a month, hitting 6 million dollars," Al-Masri said.
Fayadh replied to other questions ahead of the PLC discussing a number of issues according to its agenda. The PLC will hold a session on Wednesday during which Fayadh will present the draft budget of 2004, which was endorsed by the Palestinian cabinet in its session last Saturday.

The Iraqis unanimously agree that the US security strategy has failed and that security conditions will deteriorate in the coming period.
On the ground, the American crackdowns are currently launched on Sunnite areas for they include Saddam supporters and the fundamentalist trend that become prominent in the last months.
The aim of such parties is to destroy any human base supposedly affiliated to the Saddam Hussein and weaken the social environment of the Sunnites who might be polarized by the Osama bin Laden of Al-Qaeda network.
Furthermore, the US Administration and the Iraqi secular parties fear that the normalization of relations between the Shiite and Sunnite authorities might stabilize the security condition in Tikrit and Ramadi as well as Arab Sunnite areas, thus completely eliminating pro-Saddam groups. Consequently, the attitudes and emotions of the Iraqi street might develop towards supporting the establishment of an Islamic statehood.
America has never extended such amount of external aid, including Marshall's plan for reconstructing Europe after the Second World War, which had allocations to the value of 13.3 billion dollars at the time, i.e. the equivalent of 100 billion dollars according to the current prices.
Officials with the US Administration affirm that the aid allocated for Iraq up till now is not the end of the road, that's to say that the Administration may ask the Congress to extend more assistance over the coming years, especially in case of the Iraqi oil revenues besides the American aid not meeting reconstruction needs.
The White House managed to maneuver the Congress into approving such aid by including the sum among the military allocations for occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan, which made it difficult for the Congress to disapprove the budget.
Those who bet on the failure of the US project should take into account that the American financial, political and military investment volume in Iraq is so big that the concept of failure is out of the question, at least in the foreseeable future.
Loans and advances, moreover, went up by 19% to hit 5.2 billion pounds (820 million dollars).

In an interview with Al-Hayat, Exchange Division chairman Mohamed Hassan Al-Abyad attributed the dollar retreat on market to recession on commodities and staple goods market, consumption rationalization, people refrainment from purchasing some goods due to their high prices.
PRICES RUN WILD
Official sources with the Ministry of Public Enterprise attributed the rise to some importers' monopolistic practices, absence of controls and shortage of required quantities owing to restricting import to a limited number of importers.
The appreciation of the U.S. dollar, required for import credits, and banks' reluctance to open such credits owing to the shortage of foreign currencies are also blamed for mark-up.
The deputies were unanimous that the bill submitted by the government on modifying some investment law provisions is just a step on the right road but it is not enough. They called for not imposing tax sales on capital equipment.

OVER $3 BILLION VALUE OF IDLE FIXED ASSETS
EGYPTIAN ECONOMY LOSES $2 BILLION DUE TO RISE OF EUROPEAN AND ASIAN CURRENCIES AGAINST DOLLAR
Head of Imports Division with the Egyptian Federation of Chambers of Commerce Mostafa Zaki said that the rise of euro exchange rate, in spite of its low interest rate, would negatively affect the Egyptian imports from EU countries.

POWELL'S VISIT TO ARAB MAGHREB MEANT TO CURB FRENCH INFLUENCE IN NORTH AFRICA
Islamic Turkish movements can be classified into three categories:
However, the most outstanding of such organizations is Turkish Hezbollah, which was founded in the eighties under the sponsorship of the Turkish government itself with a view to fighting the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK). After the arrest of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan together with the party's giving up violence, the government have turned on carrying out all-out liquidation operations against it.
2- Fundamentalist Islamic movements:
There are some other "modern" Sufi tariqas that emerged in the republican era as a reaction to Mustafa Kemal Ataturk (1881-1938) and his successors' policies.
In 1983, the Refah (Welfare) Party was established, which came to power in 1996.
This was the start of a self-criticism inside the party that resulted in the emergence of two trends: a reformist trend led by Abdullah Gul (supported by Recep Tayyip Erdogan) and a traditionalist one led by Kutan (and supported by Erbakan).
ARRANGEMENTS FOR MEETING BETWEEN MUBARAK AND SHARON
"The anti-Semitic wave in Egypt has noticeably decreased during the last period," it added.
American officials uncovered that President Bush's Administration had approved of the establishment of an Iraqi intelligence service.
The two men, together with the CIA, think that it is possible to select and recruit a number of the former regime officials in the new intelligence service and get rid of distrusted elements.
Such an initiative comes in preparation to setting up a transitional national legislative body in June and the election of a society which would supposedly undertake the drafting of the 2005 constitution.
The report was prepared by quite a number of former officials in the Mossad, Chabak and Amman supervised by former head of the Research Department, Reservist Brigadier Yaqub Amidor, in addition to a number of current officials in Israeli intelligence bodies as well as Palestinian figures who, according to the paper, asked not to be identified.
The report added that that would be possible in spite of the fact that the Islamic trend constituted only third of the Palestinian community because the majority of the Palestinians see Hamas as a largely clean and effective force and would constitute an alternative to the authority vacuum in some aspects."
"This document is groundless and violates Sharia provisions," Sheikh Sabri added.
Geneva peace document is groundless and violates sharia, and we will never recognize it," he added.
ISRAEL: HIZBULLAH" MAY KIDNAP TROOPS, BUT OUR RESPONSE WILL BE AN OPERATION INSIDE SYRIA
The paper talked about the aggravating state of concern in Israeli army ranks over a possible execution of Hizbullah's new abduction operations against Israeli soldiers on the Northern borders.
The redline However, the most serious accusation leveled by Israel against Egypt is the opening of tunnels for transporting arms to the Palestinian resistance from Egyptian Rafah city.
On the other hand, the Israeli government committed many mistakes to weaken the Egyptian role in Palestine, especially after Egypt had exerted successful efforts with main Palestinian factions to call a truce, which had been aborted by Israel with a repeatedly partial sweeping of Gaza Strip and constructing the separation wall.
Maj. Gen. Selim believes that the coming few weeks will reveal the effectiveness of the Egyptian role, which refuses the fait accompli policy in Palestine, especially after the confidence in an American positive attitude has been shaken, together with repeated American diplomatic mistakes in running Arab crises in Palestine, Iraq and Sudan.
As for the destiny of the Peace Accord, which was signed by Egypt with Israel in this case, Dr. Mohamed says that Israel reneged on many agreements it singed with the Palestinians except for those it signed at the era of former Israeli premier Yitzhak Rabin.
Egypt's security and Syria's security From his strategic point of view, Sha'ban points out that the Egyptian national security is closely related to the Syrian national security. Throughout history, any aggression on Syria was always followed by Egypt's interference in defence of Egypt's strategic interests in the first place, which are always jeopardized when Syria is attacked, he added.
Sharon emphasized that he could not rule out such a possibility in a region that has not accepted the existence of Israel yet, saying, "We'll not be taken aback and we should be cautious."
* Expelling the Palestinians to Sinai to establish their state there.
Regarding the Israeli thinking about reoccupying Sinai, Dr. Mohamed emphasizes that he does not rule it out according to the Israeli mind.
The factions did not differ about the idea of the truce, but rather about its conditions.
Nor would it be in the interest of the Palestinian People's cause to believe that the Palestinians should stop resisting occupation while the enemy went on building the separating wall, expanding and intensifying settlement, confiscating Palestinian lands, scooping agricultural crops, military sweeps of villages, camps and cities, crack down and detention campaigns, assassinations of leaderships and cadres, and the continued suffocating siege and humiliation barriers.
Any Palestinian has the right to suspect Sharon's intentions, as he insists on disarming resistance organizations, liquidating, uprooting and exterminating such organizations and detaining anybody who thinks of confronting occupation as a condition for taking any steps which he (Sharon), himself, announces will run counter to international legitimacy resolutions and the principle on which the Madrid march was based.
The Palestinian factions' delegation of the Palestinian Authority to discuss the guarantees of the truce or to take political action and negotiate with the Israeli party, on the other hand, would be unnecessary as that authority is an elected one and would, therefore, need no delegation or authorization from anybody.
The factions saw the document as offering capitulations to the Israeli party beyond the minimum agreed upon by everybody.
In a conference on the "management of the government's stockpile" held on Saturday, Radwan said the government bought unnecessary fixed assets worth 333 billion pounds that aggravated the cumulative stockpile.
EGYPTIAN POUND EXPECTED TO BE FULLY FLOATED
Addressing a conference in Cairo, he said, "We have three rates of exchange, which is a multi-exchange rate system that would lead to confusion," by which he meant the bank rate of exchange the basic goods rate of exchange, and the black market rate of exchange.
Recently, banks noticeably backtracked on backing industrial activities.
"Bankrolling industrial projects is given due attention by banks in general," Development and Housing Bank's bad debts advisor Emad Abd Al-Qader said. "The banking finance granted to the industry sector till the end of last June hit 36% of total credit facilities granted to the remaining economic sectors which is a reasonable percentage when we take into account the necessity of funding different economic activities," he added.
Regarding the possibility of confining industrial activities to the specialized banks, Abdel-Mon'im says there is only one specialized bank in Egypt, which can not boost industry. Therefore, commercial banks direct their financial surpluses to such kind of activity, that often needs long-range loans, which does not cope with the strategies of such banks, he added.
This is attributed to the high cost of industrial projects in general, as the cost of a medium-sized industrial project is not less than 10 million pounds. Therefore, the volume of finance is not available to a large number of industrialists, while an industrial project used to cost 3-4 million pounds in the eighties, he said.
Banking experts affirmed that the executive regulation of the Central Bank law that was signed by President Hosni Mubarak would result in better coordination among all the concerned parties, including the Government, the Central Bank itself and all the banks operating in Egypt.
He also said that the new regulation combined several of the points of the old law and gave them more clarity, so as to enable the Central Bank to make policies that would be easier to implement and harder to confuse.
The Central Bank source pointed out that the recent period had witnessed a remarkable stability on the Egyptian foreign exchange market and that the fluctuations that had occurred had taken place within certain expectations or as a result of absence of clear policies.
The increase of the Central Bank's capital to LE1 billion ($160 million plus) in the new regulation is aimed at expanding the bank's financial base, particularly in an environment where all banks are increasing their capital. And although the Central Bank is not a profit-making organization, the presence of a strong capital gives the bank more confidence."
Businessman Mu'taz Raslan who is head of Egyptian Canadian Business Council said that two Egyptian banks were preparing for work in South Sudan. He regarded the chance as feasible, adding that the Egyptian investors role would be supported by banks, which would provide them with the funds required for their new investments.
It has been decided that Commerce and Industry Chambers Union and Arab Investors Federation would undertake to arrange for visits by the Arab private sector to the various sites to be invested in South Sudan in cooperation with Sudanese Employers Union and Sudanese chambers.
Al-Sa'edi stressed that creating an Egyptian integrated industrial policy is a must, indicating that this requires setting clear, definite bases and mechanisms including the schedule and necessary costs as well as benefiting from previous studies and measures.
Technological centres the ministry has set up play a significant role in upgrading different industrial sectors through conducting studies and researches for developing factories.
Foremost of these developments is a kind of coordination between the financial and monetary policies towards raising interest rates as the monetary authority represented by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) went on for the third week in a row raising interest rates on bank deposits, while the financial authority represented by the Ministry of Finance raised interest rates on short-term treasury bills which have been put up for subscription to institutions and individuals through the CBE. The interest rate of the last treasury bills put up for sale last Monday hit 7.49%.
Al-Ganaini added that the talk about raising interest rate on deposits and the end of the two seasons of pilgrimage (Haj) and minor pilgrimage (Umra) also led to the devaluation of the dollar on the black market.
Meanwhile, the CBE withdrew the rest of the sum, which hit 5.502 billion pounds, through four deposits put forward to banks.
Following his meeting with the new capital market board of directors yesterday, he added that the features of such a bourse are being defined and its rules are being arranged. He pointed out that a business owner who wishes to have it put up on that bourse should be ready to join an open system and have a simple follow-up system. This bourse participants should know that it has its own risks.
It is noteworthy that the council has announced recently an increase in the duties on tourism sights by 100%.
8 REASONS FOR DOLLAR DEPRECIATION ON BLACK MARKET
Ibrahim al-Mazlawi, a member of the National Specialized Councils, said it is the first time in several years for the U.S. dollar to drop at the black market.
EGYPT'S GREENBACK RESERVES IN JEOPARDY!
Will this effect extend to include the dollar reserve in the CBE?
On the other hand, Dr. Hamdi Abdel Azim thinks that the devaluation of the dollar increases the burdens of debts or installments and interest, thus having a negative effect on American companies profits.
There are four different rates for the dollar on the Egyptian market - the black market rate, the exchange companies' rate, the banks rates and the customs dollar rate.
Banking expert, Mahmoud Ozalib thinks that such a decline of the dollar against the ero and other international currencies is unjustified.
However, there has been a remarkable stability in the Egyptian market in the last 3 months.

Al Okda added that he was currently considering encouraging citizens to shift from using cash to using electronic cards while dealing with banks.
The annual performance results of some Egyptian banks last year (2003) disclosed a contradiction in profit making. As the profits of the Commercial International Bank-Egypt went up by 8% last year. In spite of the currency losses, it achieved net profits valued at 412 million pounds (68 million dollars) against 380 million pounds (63 million dollars) in 2002.
Concerning the financial position of the Industrial Development Bank, the total assets with the bank went up mid last year to 2.613 billion pounds against 2.186 billion pounds in 2002.
As for the financial position of the bank, its total assets increased from 70 billion pounds to 84 billion pounds over the last year.
On the other hand, National Societe Generale achieved a quantum leap in its net profits which soared by 22% to hit 201 million pounds against 165 million pounds in 2002.
This step aims at activating demand for the bank's stocks by American investment funds, which cannot be attracted at present, as they are registered only with London stock exchange, he added.
A state of lull mixed with anticipation and extreme caution dominated the dealings of the foreign exchange market in Egypt over the last days in anticipation of any changes or decisions following the appointment of a new governor for the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) and reforming its board of directors, which have not held a meeting for 4 months.
Saving coffers in the euro are also expected to increase in the coming period due to expectations of a constant rise of the euro against the American dollar, which has recorded its lowest rate against the European currency for 4 years, as the dollar rate of exchange rose to 7.45 pounds for buying and 7.56 pounds for selling.
"The monetary policy alone can't achieve economic reform. The matter needs controlling the inflow of foreign exchange allocated for importation and coordination with the state's monetary policy to control rates of demand for foreign exchange that are aimed at speculation or hoarding," said Advisor to the Premier and CBE board member Dr. Hatem Al-Qarnashawi.
GOVERNMENT ADMITS: $90 BILLION ESCAPED EGYPT
Economists described investment and exports as heading for a disaster. The traits carried by the report emphasize that the data announced by the government since 1980s so far are all false and untrue and that the achievements announced were mere propaganda and "fabricated" figures to serve as a makeup beautifying the ugly image of successive governments.
In spite of all the state's attempts to prop and back up the private sector through offering it the state's resources, the citizens' deposits as well as public sector companies sold to some businessmen dirt cheap, the ratio of private investment to the GDP retreated from 12.4% in 1989/1990 to 9.1% in 2001/2002 regardless of the rise in sums from LE9.7 billion to LE34.6 billion for the same period.
After the government failed, according to the report, it started to head for direct Arab and foreign investment to fill up the gap. Through an arsenal of laws, it made it possible for the Arabs and the foreigners to own any assets in Egypt without any controls under the big slogan of investment encouragement.
In its policy of reliance on the private sector, the government also failed to attract any Arab funds out of a total of $1200 billion invested in Europe and America.
The report says that the growth rate of Egyptian exports for that period did not exceed 2.7% against 11% as average growth rate in developing countries.
The scandal uncovered by the report lies in the government policy of deregulating the rates of exchange and the ensuing devaluation of the Egyptian pound under the allegation that such a step would sharpen the competitive edge of Egyptian products and, consequently, improve Egyptian exports performance.
In his back-page daily column "Egyptian Concerns", Abbass al-Tarabili, Al-Wafd's deputy board chairman and chief editor, writes an article to say: Let's capitalize on Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Ebeid's receptivity, a good quality we should thank God that the head of our government has, to comment on remarks he made during his recent visit to Rumania.
How much will this cost?
Now that wheat is a strategic commodity, how can we guarantee the arrival of Rumanian wheat in Egypt at times of international crises?
However, both countries can create demographic communities who can produce more than they consume at this stupendous demographic vacuum. It is so easy for the Egyptians to move to the south and for the Sudanese to move to the north, and for both to meet at this integration area so as to grow wheat for both Egypt and Sudan.
Addressing the Hebrew Radio, Shalom said, "Egypt is of the view that the Palestinian-Israeli dialogue should be resumed without preconditions and this is acceptable to us". He also said that preparations are underway to hold a meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his Palestinian opposite number Ahmed Qurei.
Egyptian MPs adopted an anti-torture draft act that had been prepared by the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR).
Some 10 million Arab children are dropouts; more than half of the Arab women are illiterate; 40% of the adults are illiterate, and more than half a million people have been affiliated with AIDS since the 1980s, 55% of which are women, said the Developmental Objectives of the Arab World report, which was declared yesterday (10th December) in Cairo. The report was compiled by the UN Development Pogramme in cooperation with the Arab League (AL).
The report recommended that it was necessary to exert more efforts in the Arab countries to reduce mortality rate among mothers and children under 5, control epidemic viruses and protect the environment.
The library also withdrew another five books authored by Egyptian writers tackling the Arabic translation of the book, whose preface was written by late great writer and man of letters Abbas Mahmoud Al-Akkad.
However, Bibliotheca Alexandrina's information official Ayman Al-Amir informed Asharq Al-Awsat that the book would be removed from the library's website, too.
Al-Ahali learnt that the positions of some company owners are being reviewed (mostly foreign company agents and contractors). They joined the NDP before the General Congress held in September in 2000 and played a role after that in directing the bills proposed by the NDP on behalf of the private sector especially the cancellation of subsidies for commodities, transport, waster, sanitary drainage, telephones and other projects under the BOT system. The People's Assembly Speaker, Dr. Fatehi Sorour had warned against the call of some businessmen for the cancellation of subsidy adding that it would lead to the disruption of public security and social stability.
He said, "Some of them could develop closer relationships with certain leaderships in the party recently and did harm to the stage of reform and renovation which the party has embarked upon in the last years.
It is noteworthy that Ahmed Ezz is an advocate the idea of depletion of subsidy and the privatization of the (service) economic bodies, as well as other demands of businessmen in the People's Assembly, the ruling party and some foreign chambers of commerce.
Lyricist Islam Khaleel, who wrote the album, told Al-Hayat that the song lyric reads: "I made the road map for my brethren and children. And I formed a quartet to take care of my business.
Lyricist Islam Khaleel slammed the intimidation policy adopted by George W. Bush towards the Muslim countries, while he feels afraid of North Korea. "Sometimes he says Iran and sometimes he says Syria, but when it comes to North Korea he swallow his pride," the song says.
Al-Azhar severely castigated state-owned institutions conducing to the spread of dissoluteness and debauchery among youth who can not make both ends meet or get married.
Al-Shahawi's book included recommendations directed to women calling on them to give themselves up without reservation or even modesty, the report said. Last month Book Organization head Dr. Samir Sarhan decreed the book from markets be withdrawn and confiscated. Ikhwan MP Mustafa Mohamed had submitted a quest for notification to the Prime Minister citing quotations from the book considering them as profaning religion.
The author, it added, used God's attributes in describing the beloved, which is almost explicit atheism.
OMAR SOLAIMAN'S MISSION
Omar Solaiman knows that the participants' demands are radically different and that their definitions of settlement and peace are as different as chalk and cheese.
He also knows that some others do not believe in such a state and see it, should it exist, as just a stop to continue liberating what is left of Palestine. In a nutshell, some participants dream about a state that co-exists with the state of Israel, while others adopt a programme that aim at the extermination of the latter, an aim which is by no means denied by such a programme advocates.
He well knows that such an administration would be satisfied with nothing less than the dismantlement of terrorism structures. This means that Omar Solaiman is practically urging Hamas and Jihad to pay the price for the Road Map.
PALESTINIANS IN CAIRO: DON'T BE OPTIMISTIC!
Doubts are, therefore, paramount everywhere so of what use are any reassurances, documents or dialogues if the consequences cannot dare to extend geographically behind the halls of meetings and dialogues where documents are signed.
If we don't want the Palestinian dialogue to have such an end, the twelve factions have only to think of a reply to one sole question: how to translate letters of final statement texts into genuine acts on the ground.
Industrial loan's high interest rate is also an obstacle to repayment in light of abrupt price rises of imported materials, they added.
Regarding disinclination of investment banks to finance long-range industrial projects, Abd Al-Qader pointed out two kinds of finance: firstly, funding capital commodities such as buildings, machinery and equipment, which need medium and long-range loans; secondly, funding working capital, which needs short-range credit facilities. Banks should, therefore, finance either of them, he said.
Arab Investment Bank's Loan Management Department head Ahmed Abd Al-Maguid agree with the previous opinion.
Bankrolling industrial activities should not be confined to certain banks, as such a role should be carried out by all banks so long as they have enough cash liquidity to finance any number of industrial projects, he pointed out.
Dr Hatem Al Qaranshawi, adviser to the Prime Minister and director of the Central Bank, said that the new regulation was primarily aimed at reinforcing the independence of the Central Bank in making its own decisions and defining its terms of reference to avoid overlapping jurisdictions with other quarters.
An official source in the Central Bank said that the new executive regulation of the Central Bank law further stressed the independence of the Central Bank and made the bank more effective through monetary tools and policies, including those related to interest rates and monetary issues alike.
The source also said that the market reaction to the formation of the new board of directors for the Central Bank was positive, indicating that the new law had given more clarity to the foreign exchange system and better definition to foreign exchange policies.
BANKS GET READY FOR SUPPORTING EGYPTIAN PROJECTS IN SUDAN
This coincides with an Arab League decision to operate a working group for holding the Second Arab Conference for Development and Investment in South Sudan after the signature of the final peace agreement between the Sudanese government and the Sudan's People Liberation Army (SPLA).
20-YEAR ALL-OUT PLAN FOR DEVELOPING EGYPTIAN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
More heed will be paid to small and medium-sized industries, creating new job opportunities for youth, localizing modern technology, creating potential of development locally, courting and increasing investments, and setting up local industries through depending on Egyptian raw materials with a view to increasing the value added to the mineral wealth, he said.
THREE IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS IN INTEREST RATE FILE
Another key development witnessed by the market is the continual retreat of the exchange rate of the dollar circulated on the unofficial market to hit 660 piasters last Thursday amid strong expectations of a continual slide, especially with the increase of supply and decrease of demand and dollar holders; rush to sell their foreign exchange lest they should sustain future losses.
The CBE, went on raising interest rates on bank deposits with it, as the last two deposits were accepted on 27th and 28th February last at an average interest rate of 8.80% versus 8.594% on the deposit it accepted on 15th February, i.e. up 206 point. The highest interest rate on these deposits early last week hit 9% but it declined late last week by 15 points to hit 8.85%. It is to be noted that last week CBE went on withdrawing banks' surplus cash liquidity.
The Egyptian government announced that it would establish a bourse for small businesses to be independent of the current bourse.
75% INCREASE IN DUTIES ON TOURISM SIGHTS
Such a step, however, infuriated Egyptian tourism companies owners as they had not been notified by the council in advance in order to take precautions and contact tourist agents abroad to modify tourism programmes rates according to the increase imposed by the council.
It fell to LE6.50 against LE7.30 late last year, while it stood at LE6.20 on average at banks.
Furthermore, the CBE has adopted a policy to cut cash liquidity and combat speculations in U.S. dollars, as well as a governmental plan to decrease the dollar at the parallel market, he said.
Economists, therefore, take their economic measures in accordance with it.
In addition to the military expenditure on military bases and the American presence in Iraq and Afghanistan, there are economic assistance whether in the form of grants or loans, which are extended for political purposes.
We, in Egypt, have a chronic problem which lies in the fact that the dollar supply is lower than the demand for it.
She thinks that clients are now in a state of wait.
Some expect the dollar to continue its nosedive till it reaches 1.35 euros, but I don't believe that expectation will come true.
The changes in banks and the formation of a CBE board of directors have led to a resurgence of confidence in the Egyptian market.
For their part, construction companies demanded that their arrears be paid quickly to avoid the negative impacts these companies suffered from owing to delay in payment on one hand and banks reluctance to give these companies further loans on the other hand.
There are more than 20 commercial agreements and protocols between Egypt and the three countries to ban double taxation, facilitate land and air transportation operations, boost industrial and technological cooperation and protect investment, in addition to the comprehensive trade agreement with Europe.
Al Okda emphasized that the rate of exchange was on course according to market supply and demand mechanisms. In a press conference yesterday, he pointed out that stability in exchange rates would urge further investment inflows into the country.
Seyam denied any negative impacts of the anti-money laundering law on the accounts confidentiality as that aspect is legally ensured.
Such a relative decline came after the bank revenues went down from 16.9% to 31.29 million pounds. This coincided with a similar decline in commissions and banking services fees to 21.2 million pounds, while revenues of other operations dwindled to 1.85 million pounds last year.
Concerning the financial position of the NBE, its total assets went up from 105 billion pounds in the middle of 2002 to some 123 billion pounds after the net loans to customers jumped by 6.2%. The Misr Banque net profits went down by 10% during the FY2002/2003, as they hit 120 million pounds against 139 million pounds in the previous year.
Auditors with the bank disclosed some remarks in their report. Such remarks included the fact that the bank did not support the allocations of loans, the deficit in which hits 1.4 billion pounds. This would affect, to a great extent, the evaluation of the loans portfolio in December 2002 as well as the results of the bank performance. The report added that in 2002 the bank excluded some 53 million pounds from the item of financial investments in affiliates.
CIB TARGETS 3 FOREIGN MARKETS
Through regional and international expansion, the CIB seeks to attract foreign investors to the Egyptian market, maximize a share's revenue, and create an Egyptian share to attract investors from world markets, he indicated.
On the other hand, experts warned that the rise of the euro and the pound sterling is due to the American balance of payments' deficit and that the dollar's rate of exchange drop on the international market would have negative repercussions on the Egyptian balance of trade with the EU countries and Britain which import 46 percent of Egypt's external trade. The rise of the euro and the pound sterling also threatens the book value of Egypt's reserve of foreign exchange, which has retreated by 104 million dollars according to the latest report by the CBE.
"Contrary to the fluctuating euro and pound sterling rates of exchange, other main foreign currencies such as the American dollar and Saudi riyal are almost unchanged. This doesn't, nonetheless, mean stability," said former CBE governor Ismail Hassan.
The activation of the dollar inter-bank mechanism will not achieve the required success unless supply is provided through accurate implementation of the decree 506, which provides for depositing 75% of export and tourism revenues with the banks, he said.
The second report uncovered the collapse of exports of any Egyptian products as the state solely relied on exporting petroleum products while exports of other developing countries increased many times over in 2001 compared with what used to happen in 1990.
The retreat in investments in Egypt was attributed to businessmen as the government investments ratio to total domestic investment went down from 17.3% in 1989/1990 to 7.1% in 2000/2001. Dr. Mohamed Hassan, professor of investment in the Faculty of Commerce, Ain Shams University says that the government had sunk into the private sector bog as it offered it as an alternative in possessing means of production, pumping investments, and providing the needs of the domestic market and exports in a bid to maintain trade and the balance of payments.
The state wanted to raise the domestic saving rate from 17.5% of the GDP to 25%, which required a 7% growth rate annually, but this had not been achieved and the retreat went on unimpeded.
Despite all such incentives, Arab and foreign investments have retreated, according to the report, from $5.6 billion, 14.2% to 3.7% of total investments and 6.0% of GDP.
Although exports included petroleum products worth $2.173 billion, they accounted for almost 50% of total exports.
The report points out that the poor position of exports against the increasing imports had led to the corrosion of foreign exchange reserve, thus declining from $21 billion to $14 billion in a few months.
Although the report mentioned the problems facing the policy of turning to an export economy regarding the export infrastructure in efficiency including the financial institutions, maritime routes and administrative expertise, it revealed the successive governments' failure to protect the Egyptian economy, which is heading for a disaster.
He said he discussed with Rumanian officials bilateral agricultural cooperation through growing wheat in Rumania for Egypt or allowing Egyptians to hire farmland to grow wheat there or swap it for fruits and vegetables needed by Rumania.
We need somebody to tell us how much such operations will cost and whether Rumanian wheat will be given to Egypt at a preferential price compared to Australian, French and American wheat.
This integration area - bearing all chances of success - will help create demographic, agricultural and productive communities at the areas where there is a population vacuum.
MUBARAK: RESUMING PALESTINIAN-ISRAELI DIALOGUE WITHOUT PRECONDITIONS NECESSARY
He added that he had put forward during his closed-door meeting with President Mubarak the issue of Israeli spy Azzam Azzam who is now serving time in Egypt. "I felt that President Mubarak understood the critical situation undergone by Azzam's family," Shalom said, crossing his fingers that the case might be solved properly as soon as possible. He, furthermore, considered Egypt's positive response in this regard a "harbinger of good intent" like that which the Israelis want the Palestinians to show so as to improve "living conditions."
EOHR secretary general Hafez Abu Se'da held a press conference yesterday (10th December) that was attended by Hamdi Hassan, Nasserite deputy Hamdeen Sapahi and liberal independent Ayman Nour.

10% percent of the population in Jordan and Tunisia suffer from poverty; 20% in Egypt and Algeria; 40% in Yemen and 46% in Mauritania, the report declared under sponsorship of AL chief Amr Moussa said, warned that foreign debts represent a key obstacle to development in Arab countries.
BIBLIOTHECA ALEXANDRINA WITHDRAWS "PROTOCOLS OF THE ELDERS OF ZION"
The Bibliotheca Alexandrina's Information Department said the book was withdrawn from the book show as an unsuccessful selection that hurts others' feelings.
A state of anger prevails in the ruling milieus because some businessmen abused their positions to get private advantages. This happened after they could infiltrate to decision-making centers through the National Democratic Party (NDP) and its key committees.
Most of them ran financial and consumer investment projects in the field of food industries and clothes for instance and some others abused their (political) positions for making profits through monopolizing some industrial and strategic products and real estate projects.
On the other hand, an interpellation submitted by Tagamo'h deputy, Aboul-Ezz Al-Hariri to the Premier Dr. Atef Ebeid about the role played by businessman Ahmed Ezz in Alexandria National Company for Iron and Steel led to a state of embarrassment in the parliamentary body of the NDP and the party leaderships. Ahmed Ezz is in charge of the membership secretary in the party and head of the Plan and Budget Committee in the People's Assembly. He is also member of the Egyptian-American Presidents' Council.
It seems that popular singer Shaaban Abdel Rahim is sure that the continuity of his popular success is linked to political songs in which he attacks the US and Israel, especially as he is distinguished by using simple words repeated by ordinary people and, at the same time, express the Arab street's hatred of the US and Israel.
In another stanza of the lyric, the writer says, "The US and Israel are two sides of one coin, as they turned the world into a jungle."
Khaleel said the album included 10 songs that criticize the social conditions in Egypt. For example, it includes a song entitled "I will turn off light" that does a hatchet job on the high phone and electricity bills, from which citizens are suffering.
The report of which, Al-Hayat got a copy, was issued within of a campaign launched by intellectuals and men of letters against Al-Azhar's intervention in creative works.
He refused to reply to the Al-Azhar's recommendation and even took part in protests against Al-Azhar's decision.
Moreover, it used metaphors in a flagrant way, the report noted. The report wondered if the book propagated any values or virtues, and whether such publications befitted the nation and protected its youth against perils, or opened the door to fornication and adultery before youth who can hardly establish a family.
We won't be exaggerating if we say that chief of Egyptian Intelligence, Omar Solaiman had been assigned a difficult or even strenuous task.
Some other participants do not basically believe in the negotiation process and see it as bordering on capitulations or rather the outcome of an abortive vision that leads up to bets that are fiascos.
The administration of President George Bush can not inspire the Palestinians that there were hopes for a peaceful solution.
Omar Solaiman knows that the ceiling of what can be obtained from Sharon thanks to Bush's pressure, is much less than what would satisfy Ahmed Yassin, Khaled Meshaal, Ramadan Abdullah Shallah, Ahmed Gabriel and others. He, nonetheless, knows of that the post-September 11th world knows no mercy and that the American President now preoccupied with Iraq is about to be overwhelmed by the presidential campaign so much so that any escalation of the conflict in that period would be fraught with risks not only for the Palestinians but for neighbouring Arab countries as well.
Not a single step, nevertheless, has been taken forward, William Burns says but the American Administration does not act and the Israeli left signs dreamy documents but is not in a position to move a single item of such documents from the bond of textual preambles into the freedom of implementation on the ground, not only because the left is out of power and away from the decision-making circles but because even when it is in power it stops short of acting and even though it might build castles on the opposition air in the Knesset, becomes the first to tread on them with its heavy boots once it steps to power and is visited by security misgivings!
Negotiators in Cairo should not, therefore, be too delighted as if the dialogue per se were a target. Nor should they expatiate an excess of positive phrases to describe the dialogue if it only ended up by them agreeing on the same points about which they had been in concord or differing about other points about which they had always been in discord.
The People's Assembly (PA) announced its support for Saudi Arabia, which is facing a campaign launched by pro-Israel Americans in Washington. In a meeting by the PA Arab Affairs Committee headed by Ahmed Abu-Zeid on Saturday, the MPs said that Saudi Arabia was an important Arab and Islamic symbol and that its power was a power for all Arabs and Muslims.
He also highlighted the necessity of activating public diplomacy to support the peace march and the Syrian stand in such a dangerous turning point undergone by Syria and also support the Iraqi people in order to raise the blockade imposed on them, thus ensuring the restoration of a strong independent Iraq.
It is reported that the Turks fear that Israel would help the Kurds.
According to the sources, the report was presented to the Turkish foreign minister, who asked for sifting through the matter, especially regarding the potential impact on Turkey and the region.
In the meantime, a highly-placed Israeli official was summoned to the Turkish Foreign Ministry where a senior Turkish official expressed to him Turkey's concern about Israeli activities in Northern Iraq.
In an attempt to alleviate tension, Israel explained to Turkey that it has no ties with Kurds and that it doesn't provide them with any assistance.
Demand for jewellery rose on Al-Kadhmiya market in Baghdad due to a relative increase in the purchasing power of many categories in Iraq, as Baghdadi ladies' love of gold dates back to ancient ages.
"Since the economic blockade was imposed, the Iraqis in general, to the exclusion of a limited number of businessmen and traders' families have, stopped buying gold in general except for engagement rings ceremonies in addition to some other small golden objects," Arkan Al-Sa'di, 30, a jeweller said.
Having toured the jewellery market in Al-Kadhmiya, Al-Hayat found that some shops showed about 35 to 40 kilograms of bracelets, rings and necklaces of different forms and sizes to attract clients regardless of the deteriorating security conditions.
22 ARAB COUNTRIES' POPULATION TO RISE TO 654 MILLION IN MID-CENTURY
The report estimated the lifespan in the Arab world at 75 years for men and 79.3 years for women.
The North Africa population, who is now 27 percent of the Arab population according to 2000 figures, is expected to constitute 20 percent by 2050, while the population of the Fertile Crescent, the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf countries will go up to 35 percent of the total population.
BIG POLITICAL REFORM EXPECTED
Analysts and experts pointed out that Mubarak had never shown inclination to pass power, which makes it likely that this tendency is supported by some of the president's entourage.
Former foreign minister assistant Dr. Abdullah Al-Ashaal laid it bare that there is an Israeli campaign to the effect that Egypt's stances regarding Iraq and Palestine causes meet American demands in return for the White House's approval of passing the rule to Gamal Mubarak. For his part, Head of Political Sciences Department at Cairo University Dr.
CRISIS WITH KUWAIT IN THE OFFING DUE TO QUIZ ABOUT AID TO EGYPT
According to the announcement, the quiz included the following questions: When did the Kuwaiti Fund offer its first loan to Egypt?
How many Egyptian workers participated in reconstructing Kuwait and turning it from a barren desert into present day Kuwait?
Shiite Authority in Lebanon Mohamed Hussein Fadlullah accused Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh, Mohamed Sayyed Tantawi, of doing harm to Islam and Muslims when he gave France an Islamic legal pretext to pass the decree of banning hijab. He urged him to apologize to Muslims and to stand up for defending Islam against all internal and external types of pressure.
Fadlullah regarded France as the "country of freedoms in history. Muslims are entitled to practice their freedom in objective discussions and peaceful objections as citizens in France or as advocates of an ideology which others raise questions about."
The government made conflicting figures on such frozen assets, which surged up to 80 billion pounds according to the recent government policy statement from 47 billion pounds as per the January 2003 statement without any economic justifications, they said.

The idea of this society is adopted by Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) leading figure and lawyer Mokhtar Noah who was detained for three years in the so-called "unionists organization" case. The establishment of this society is to run counter to the practices of all political trends in Egypt, which refuse the "other," Noah said.
It will include representatives of different political and intellectual trends in Egypt as well as women and Copts such as Mokhtar Noah, Khalid Badawi and Ibrahim Bakri from the Muslim Brotherhood; Ahmed Awwadh, Tarek Negeida and Essam Al-Islamboli, Nasserites; Montaser Al-Zayat, Mona Embabi and Omaima Al-Shorbagi, independent Islamists; Mohamed Kamel, Atef Al-Banna and Mohamed Elwan, Al-Wafd Party members; and Fawzi Girgis, Talaat Aziz and Magid Hanna, Copts.
The remarks were made by the Sheikh of AlAzhar at his meeting with visiting French Interior Minister Nicholas Sarkozy. Now that the Muslims cannot allow non-Muslims to poke their nose into their affairs, they ought not to interfere in non-Muslims' affairs either, he said.
Gomaa's statements came after Al-Azhar's Grand Sheikh Mohamed Sayyed Tantawi had told international news agencies, following his meeting with French Interior Minister Nicholas Sarkozy, who is currently visiting Cairo, that Muslims living in France had to abide by state laws there. As the Islamic Research Academy, the World's no.1 Islamic authority, will have a difference of opinion over the case, Tantawi said the academy staff was in session to issue an all-out statement on the case.
ARAB AMBASSADORS IN PARIS: TANTAWI NOT FRANCE'S MUSLIMS AUTHORITY
According to well-informed sources in Cairo, there have been relevant consultations between French personalities and Al Azhar Grand Sheikh.
The topic, however, was not broached upon by Arab ministers and French officials.
IRRIGATION MINISTER: NO ATTEMPTS TO BLOCK NILE WATER
Egypt is carrying out now some national programs to maintain water resources and make maximum use of every drop, Abu Zeid stated in a symposium organized by Sadat Academy for Management Sciences.
CEO of Orascom Telecom Naguib Sawiras said that his company " targets the Iranian market" because it is still "fledgling" and abounds in numerous chances.
The report received by People's Assembly Speaker Dr. Fatehi Sorour from counselor Dr. Gowdat Al-Malt, head of the Central Auditing Agency pointed out a rise in that deficit although the Ministry of Finance had repaid the interests and installments of domestic and external loans to redress the balance in the financial structure.
Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) general guide Ma'moun Al-Hudhaibi urged all Christians all over the world, on the occasion of Christmas, to stand side by side with Muslims in the face of Western policies in general and the US policies in particular.
Surprisingly enough, most of these sufferings were caused by allegedly Christian people in Europe and American which established the civilization of violence, racism and debauchery, Hudhaibi concluded.
That campaign will start in cooperation with NGOs in secondary schools in ten governorates in order to acquaint people with the problems of early and orfi (unofficial) marriage, as well as violence against women and girls, female circumcision and teenagers' maternity health.
One day after Israeli Premier Ariel Sharon stipulated that resumption of negotiations with Syria should start from scratch, let alone his insistence that Syria should submit to a number of Israeli dictates, milieus that are close to Sharon said he would not agree on an all-out withdrawal from occupied Syrian Golan Heights within the framework of any political settlement in the future and that Sharon would only approve withdrawal from certain areas adding that Sharon wanted to indicate that negotiations with Damascus could not possibly be resumed from the point it had stopped at under his predecessor Ihud Barak. All questions and demands would be laid on the negotiating table once again, he said.
They recalled to memory Sharon's statement when he stepped to power that he was not interested in activating the Syrian peace track (of negotiations with Israel) and his decision to carefully and deliberately examine Assad's statements were in response to a request from Washington, even though he was quite convinced that such examination would not bring about any breakthrough in the stalemate which the Syrian-Israeli track has witnessed for years.
The sources said the Syrian attitude is characterized by explicit dynamism that may draw a new picture of the Syrian policy towards terrorism files, the postwar stage, relation with the Palestinian organizations, Syrian presence in Lebanon and the file of weapons of mass destruction.
The threat was issued by Brigadier Eibal Ghaladi, former leader of the strategic planning unit, who resigned his post several days ago in protest against failure to be appointed as head of all the circle.

GOVERNMENT RECOGNIZES FOREIGN INVESTMENTS ON WANE
Foreign direct investment at the capital market dipped from 1264.7 million U.S. dollars to 555.6 million U.S. dollars and then to 209.5 million U.S. dollars in 2002-2003, down 83 percent.
Some 224 companies were founded in the first quarter of the 2003-2004 FY at investment costs of 900 million pounds, but the figure fell to 179 businesses in the second quarter at investment costs of 324 million pounds.

He pointed out that trade exchange between Egypt and East Europe and former Soviet Union countries retreated from 68% to 10% of Egypt's external trade.

IRON SHEET PRICE JUMPS LE350 IN ONE MONTH
Ezz Dekheila company produces the majority of iron sheets production which can meet domestic needs but it contracted to export the majority of its production, thus leaving the national factories in a critical situation due to the difficulty of importing. The situation also aggravated as one in the offing.
Cement traders pointed out that companies had cut down their production which caused a cement shortage on markets. The demand for cement on market exceeded supplies which resulted in that price rise.
After a few weeks of temporary price stability, reinforcing iron prices witnessed a fresh rise hitting 3300 pounds (536.5 dollars) per ton, up 350 pounds (57 dollars), in the last six months, which raised many question marks over the government's measures taken a month ago to put an end to the reinforcing iron crisis. This crisis also reveals to what extent iron producers are involved in monopoly practices to control reinforcing iron prices. Producers, in turn, justify such steady price hikes. The crisis is reflected on the real estate market in general and construction companies in particular.
A report compiled by the Central Auditing Agency (CAA) emphasized that raising the profit margin per ton of iron by national iron companies, which exceeded over 300 pounds in some companies against only 65 pounds in 2000, and the tendency of most producers to such a price rise to make full use of such a hike, led to an almost monopoly among big and small producers. This matter has reflected immediately on the markets through successive price leaps that took prices to such a dangerous level.
"Successive price rises tempted many traders to store as much iron as possible and buy iron ahead of being produced because sales witnessed an unexpected leap regardless of the steady price hikes by 50 pounds monthly since last April," iron trader Mohamed Saad Eddin said. "This is attributed to owners of buildings who want to have their buildings finished in order to reduce cost that rises day after day due to iron price rise."
There is also a big rise in demand for iron by China and Japan and other countries to cover the needs of Iraq reconstruction operations, he added.
It is worth mentioning that wheat strategic stock would meet local markets needs for long periods in addition to self sufficiency of other commodities such as sugar, oil and rice.

Advisor to Foreign Trade Minister for African affairs, Dr Sherif Magid said that Ghali affirmed that the ministry's policy for the coming period would depend on four axes topped by agreeing with major marketing companies in South Africa which are British or Dutch in origin. These companies will determine the specifications of Egyptian products to be exported to South Africa and will work for expanding the presence of Egyptian products on the South African market.
The fourth axis is relying on the Egyptian and foreign companies and international trade houses through their databases and relations in order to serve the Egyptian exporter. It is to be noted that there is a partnership between the Egyptian Foreign Trade Ministry and international trade houses like SGS and Cotechna. Such companies are based in South Africa and monopolize import opportunities. SGS company welcomed cooperation with the ministry to provide Egyptian exporters with information and data about quality, quantities and prices of products imported by South Africa as well as lists including names of agents and importers of each commodity so that Egyptian exporters would be able to get access to South African markets.
Furthermore, Sheikh Said Bin Masfer and Dr. Hamza al-Mazini were engaged in a sharp war of words when the latter blamed the Islamists for ongoing violence and terrorism in the country, saying that religious school curricula are to blame partly for violence.
Thus, it has become certain that special sittings are needed to thrash out the domain. Abdel-Aziz al-Qasem made the following recommendations:
-Adopting such rules as justice, mercy and good counsel for dealing with opponents.
-Educating learners about the necessity of getting involved in political and public activities and performance mechanisms.
The Saudi-American relations seem good. Contacts are on between the two countries' leaders and visits are being exchanged. Besides, there are security cooperation and participation in the war on terror, the latest action of which was the two countries' addition of the Bosnia "Wazeer" Company to the UN list of terrorism. This is not the first time in which the Kingdom takes part with the US in a matter like this, and it won't be the last.
Sure enough, our interests and future won't conform one day with Israel's interests and future, even if we are compelled to deal with it. We may coexist, but we won't be in harmony and our future won't be linked to theirs.
However, they are, for sure, concerned with us due to oil and Islam, to which we lay big claims.
He was worried, pessimistic and not assured of the smiles and hand shaking. Once you turn your back, accusations are leveled anew at you, he said. Passive Concern:
Saudi diplomacy has tried to mitigate American pressure through avoiding confrontation and escalation. But it is time to rethink and reassess our gains and losses in the previous phase. We have other rational options for rearranging our important and strategic relations with the US. We should maintain cooperation in the war on terror. It is of great concern to us to chase terrorism and its financiers, as the Americans and us are victims of terrorism.
It was good news that Defense Minister Prince Sultan Bin Abdel-Aziz and the Saudi Ambassador in London Prince Turkey Al-Faysal won a round in their judicial battle against the lawyer of the families of the victims of September 11th who absurdly accused them of financing terrorism. It was good news also that Mohamed Abdel-Latif Jamil and his company won their case against the European edition of the Wall Street Journal, which said that the Saudi-Arabian Monetary Institution was controlling the remittances of Jamil's company because it suspects that such a respectable company has ties with terrorism. Such accusation was totally proved groundless. The paper was, then, compelled to deny it and pay a fine.
KUWAITI NATIONAL ASSEMBLY DISCUSSES CURRICULA AMENDMENT

The Islamic Research Academy (IRA) held an extraordinary meeting on Thursday under the headship of Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh Dr. Mohamed Sayed Tantawai, who is also the IRA chairman, to discuss France's fresh bill imposing restrictions on wearing Hijab by female Muslims there. The IRA resolved that Dr. Tantawi's statements during his meeting with the French minister of the Interior last week complied with the sharia, as the Hijab is considered a mere religious duty rather than a religious insignia.
2- Too much argumentative talk about that issue would hardly meet the current needs of the Islamic nation, as it is facing vital problems and repulsing an unfair campaign on its religion and culture.
B- We urge Muslims residing in non-Muslim countries to abide by the laws of such countries provided that they should preserve their religious and cultural identity. To achieve this end, the countries they live in should deal with them on an equal footing with non-Muslims.

LE250 MILLION FROM CIB TO PRIVATE POTABLE WATER AND SANITARY DRAINAGE COMPANIES
The signing ceremony was attended by CIB (Egypt) President Hesham Ezz El-Arab, USAID Executive Director Kenneth Alice, a number of the Housing Ministry officials, heads of drinking water and sanitary drainage utilities and owners of private sector companies operative in this field.
The guarantee offered by the USAID allows the bank to expand in such a kind of high-risk investments at low interest rates, he said, pointing out that the Egyptian financial and investment sector is still worried about entering water and sanitary drainage projects due to the dearth of finance and high risks involved.
The agreement raised many remarks by officials of the water and sanitary drainage utility sector who participated in a seminar following the signature of the agreement. One of them said he believed that the private sector in Egypt was not qualified for entering such a field as public bodies suffered from budget deficits and that the sector would not, therefore, attract the private sector. Another participant stressed having such guarantees directed to the establishment of factories that manufacture water and sanitary drainage technology, citing the establishment of an alum plant, which is a challenge and a problem facing the water and sanitary drainage sector in Egypt. Another participant urged restructuring pubic utilities in order to enhance their management in a way that would make this field attractive to the private sector.
"There are no restrictions for investors to get loans to set up factories of water technology. The matter depends on the feasibility study according to which the bank will determine the value of the loan needed by an investor," replied Dr. Mamdouh Raslan, who is in charge of infrastructure projects in the USAID.
"This step was taken due to the high demand of foreign investors for the bank's GDRs circulated at London Exchange," CIB President Hesham Ezz El Arab told Al-Alam Al-Youm.
This step will pave the way for the bank's plan to put up GDRs at the American bourse (ADR) over the coming period, he added.

40,000 JEWS OF LIBYAN ORIGIN LIVE IN ISRAEL
Head of the organization Rami Hakloun said that the Libyans began to emigrate to Israel one hundred years ago, in 1904 precisely. The tempo of their emigration to Israel was very low to the exclusion of two periods: when the Italian Fascists, allies of the German Nazism, invaded Libya and started to harass the Jews and in 1953 when the Zionist movement succeeded in launching a big campaign to force Jews to emigrate from Arab countries in general and North Africa in particular.
"He is a very practical and moderate man, who has sound thoughts towards Israel and the world and I believe him when he says that he does want a world free of weapons of mass destruction, as he really wants peace with Israel," Falah added.
ISRAEL KEEN ON ITS FOREIGN MINISTER'S VISIT TO ETHIOPIA

"The proposed curriculum changes do not ensue from a national interest, but rather represent a response to the US pressure on the Arab and Muslim countries to change generations' awareness and obliterating their Arab and Islamic culture, said Islamic Action Front deputy Ali Abu El-Sukkar. Islamic deputies will call for holding a meeting this week to discuss the proposed curriculum amendments with the government, he added.
Islamist MPs draw the attention to the fact that the timing of amending school curricula in Jordan raises doubts about the motives of the government that was not keen on upgrading sciences as well intellectual and cultural developments in schoolbooks as much as it is keen on the difference between terrorism and resistance.
It is worth mentioning that Jordanian opposition parities and trade unions still call for returning the "Palestinian Cause" curriculum which used to be taught in the secondary education stage before 1988.
The mass media source, who stipulated that he would not be identified, pointed out that according to available information, former Iraqi president spends 12 odd hours a day before an American investigation body which would call him at irregular times of the day to screw information out of him regarding mass destruction weapons, etc.

The court will include five judges, the prosecution and counsel for the defence, he said. The Iraqi judge, who is also Basra Governor, told Asharq Al-Awsat daily on the phone from his residence in the Iraqi city of Basra, on Saturday that the law states that the defendant is innocent until he is proven guilty and thereupon Saddam Hussein is still innocent until he appears at court and pleads guilty. The following are salient excerpts of the interview with the Iraqi official:
A: Yes, it is a special criminal court. Arab, Iraqi and international jurists and the United Nations were consulted when the court was set up. Similar international laws and court structures were also considered.
A: Yes, they will and so will the prosecution, the defence and the court. No foreigners will be allowed to join the tribunal, a precondition that has already been met.
A: The venue will be kept secret for security considerations until trial proceedings take place.
A: Maybe.
A: Yes, it will so that the Iraqi people and the world may watch it.
A: He will be able to wear any attire he likes, whether a suit and a tie or an Arabian uniform.
Q: How long will the trial take?
Q: Will the UN take part in the trial of Saddam Hussein and his former regime members?
Q: How do you say so while the Iraqi people suffered so much due to this regime?
A: No, we didn't.
Asharq Al-Awsat learnt that the Libyan leader, Colonel Gaddafi intended to introduce extensive changes to most security and intelligence agencies in a few weeks' time within the framework of what official Libyan sources call a start to an official campaign to purge such agencies of the elements charged with abuse of power or influence in contravention to the principles of the Libyan Revolution launched by Gaddfi in 1969.
An eminent Libyan official told Asharq Al-Awsat that Libya was going to conduct a comprehensive reform on the internal level, but, meanwhile, he emphasized that that did not mean backtracking on the implementation of the Libyan leader's third theory and the adoption of the Jamahiriya system that ensures the Libyan people the direct self-rule opportunity without the need to any deputies.
According to special information to which Asharq Al-Awsat got access, a list was being prepared of all those who had contributed to programmes related to the possession of mass destruction weapons as a prelude to removing them from official circles on the heels of the sudden decision taken by Libya last month to optionally abandon such weaponry and its agreement to open its nuclear and chemical facilities to inspection teams affiliated to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as well as to special teams from British intelligence bodies.
The paper, which, for the last few weeks, has published a series of administrative and financial corruption and reforming state-owned organizations and opening the door to the private sector, said that goals and aims must be clear and responsibilities would have to be accurately defined in all organizations with a view to streamlining follow-up, evaluation and accountability.
EGYPTIAN EXPORTS TO ARAB COUNTRIES DOWN
LE17.1 BILLION TO SET UP 50 TOURISM CENTERS
He pointed out that the philosophy of tourism development relied on the tourism centers as a planning unit with future growth potential. He went on to say that the tourism center was an integrated entity with all urban facilities such as schools, trade and health service, hospitals and factories.
In another related development, reinforcing iron prices had unjustifiably gone up last week to hit LE 3300 per ton.
The Ezz-Dekhila Group, an Egyptian key rebar producer owned by Eng Ahmed Ezz, has reportedly raised rebar prices by around 307 pounds per ton this week. Although the group denied such reports, reinforcing iron bar prices have reached around 3,200 pounds per ton.
Meanwhile, Port Said Steel Company Chairman Khalid al-Baorini said billet prices have gone up to around 425 U.S. dollars per ton this week, leading to high costs up to 3420 pounds, including all expenses, transport, customs, taxes and manufacturing costs on the basis that one U.S. dollar is valued at LE6.50.
The complaint is being carefully considered by the cabinet, which is expected to cancel such charges as a prelude to abolishing other dumping charges on iron imported from other countries. A governmental official predicted that the move might lead to a cut in rebar imported from some of these countries, especially the ones which are updating their plants and have huge quantities of scrap. This will not negatively affect local rebar plants, especially the ones which have huge export potential, the official said.
An official source with the General Petroleum Corporation said the new kind of petrol meets the international developments, particularly as the number of cars that need such petrol are on the increase.
EGYPTIAN COMPANY TO LAUNCH PLANE SPARE PARTS PROJECT
TALKS WITH SOUTH AFRICA ON AUTO INDUSTRY
REGIONAL MEETINGS TO STUDY INTEGRATION OF ELECTRICITY IN AFRICA
Rapporteur of the division Samir Ezz Al-Arab, who doubles as head of the Egyptian Company for Transporting Electricity, said that the World Energy Council, which includes more than 100 countries, showed great interest in studying, analyzing and discussing current and future energy cases with the aim of developing productivity and different uses of electricity to make the best use of it and take the environmental dimension into account as far as sustainable development is concerned.
The study attributed this to the fact that most of the projects in the eighties were concentrated on storage and service projects, which made such zones unable to export.
The study attributed the low contribution of the Arabs and foreigners to unattractiveness of such zones for foreign investments in general and Arab investments in particular due to an increase in the number of free zones worldwide and the ferociousness of competition among them to attract international investments.
ANOTHER EGYPTIAN FARM TO BE INAUGURATED IN ZAMBIA AFTER NIGER
The Fund for Technical Cooperation with Africa has tasked both Dr. Mohamed Abdel Gawad Hafiz, head of the research development at Crop Institute the Ministry of Agriculture's as manager of that farm and Dr. Baha Eddin Hemida, a researcher for the Engineering Researches Institute at the Ministry of Agriculture as deputy manager.
EGYPTIAN FREE ZONE FOR RAW MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION INPUT
The erection of new free zones comes within new measures included in the latest amendments to the Investment Guarantees and Incentives Law, Al-Ghamrawi added. These amendments are meant to improve the local investment climate and provide more legitimate channels for investors so that they could remit their profits into foreign currencies and prepare their financial statements in foreign exchange without troubles, which had been banned over the last period. This amendment has been added in compliance with the exchange rate deregulation policy.
He called for generalizing such zones to industrial cities to effectuate the principle of equal opportunities among investors regarding provision of raw materials and investment incentives. This, consequently, would be a good opportunity for increasing internal and external investments. Expanding in setting up such zones would lead international companies operative in raw materials trade or hiring production equipment to ask for buying vast areas in those zones with the objective of meeting the needs of local factories or re-exporting production to neighbouring countries, thus making an economic center of Egypt in the Middle East.
NO CUSTOMS DUTIES ON EGYPTIAN GARMENTS TO EU
Egypt's adoption of economic and commercial liberation policies, according to the agreement, will help the integration of the Egyptian economy with the international economy and the increase of foreign investments coming to Egypt, he added.

Trade balance between both countries recorded 26 million U.S. dollars. Egyptian exports to Hungary hit around 6.3 million U.S. dollars, while imports amounted to roughly 32.4 million U.S. dollars.
The signature of an agreement on economic integration between Egypt, Saudi Arabia and South Africa is being considered, said Minister of Foreign Trade Youssef Botros Ghali. This agreement would be a nucleus of regional industrial cooperation including the Middle East, Africa and other countries in the fields of yarn and textile, car industries and means of transport.
Egyptian and Saudi governments agreed to start studying concluding a regional industrial cooperation agreement covering the Middle East and Africa and including a group of chosen countries in the fields of spinning and weaving, auto industry and means of transport.
The two sides agreed on forming a joint committee to remove the commercial obstacles and solve the issue of the Saudi embargo imposed on some Egyptian commodities.
On the other hand, Saudi trade minister said on the sidelines of a Saudi forum held two days ago that the embargo and dumping-related issues between the kingdom and Egypt are likely to be solved according to the principles and bases that had been agreed upon with Dr. Ghali during his visit to the kingdom last January.
The Saudi effective participation in the fair this year aims to expose the distinguished and advanced level of their products in different spheres. The companies plan to conclude deals with Egyptian businessmen and companies to represent them on the Egyptian market. Saudi participation this year is characterized with diversity, as the participating companies cover fields of paints, foods, contracting, transport, printing, agricultural supplies, electric appliances, petrochemicals, and import and export of trade.
On the other hand, talks between Yamani and Egyptian Minister of Foreign Trade Youssef Botros Ghali are expected to put an end to the remaining differences related to trade and investment between the two countries and initiate cooperation in the field of joint marketing and integration between projects of the two countries.
The second axis of the plan is represented in intensifying consultations between trade ministers of the two countries and preparing for a meeting to be held soon in Cairo, in which new work mechanisms would be formulated to ensure re-registering Egyptian companies according to the new systems in Iraq. This would allow Egyptian companies to take part in tenders for exporting supply commodities to the Iraqi market.
Mekkawi pointed out that at the end of the Iraqi delegation visit to Cairo the two sides managed to reach specific results represented in forming the Egyptian-Iraqi Businessmen Council and holding its first session during the visit.
300 EGYPTIAN COMPANIES OPERATING IN IRAQ
Dr. Izz attributed the distinguished status of Egyptian business in Iraq to the absence of any hostile feelings between the Egyptian and the Iraqi peoples and to the legitimate and cultural common ties, which urges a high demand by the Iraqis for Egyptian products unlike the case with other neighbouring companies, not to mention the Egyptian expertise in reconstruction. In corroboration of this point, he said that not a single Egyptian national had been harmed in the disorder currently witnessed in Iraq. International companies also drew upon Egyptian labour due to cheap wages and high efficiency.
"The Ministry of Industry and Technological Development will start preparing an all-out strategy for iron and steel industry using state-of-the-art technologies to develop that industry," Minister of Industry Ali Al-Saedi said, adding that the new strategy would include consumption, production and export capacities in addition to fresh expansion and future plans.

No country who relied on foreign aid and grants would achieve tangible development growth or leaps.
In 2001, direct foreign investment reached $510.1 million against $1235 million in 2000, a decline of 58% while it had reached 2919 million in 1999.
She emphasized the importance of the economic aspect in new American initiatives especially the Greater Middle East initiative and ways and means of activating negotiations on setting up a free trade zone and studying the gains that might be obtained by the Egyptian economy through that move and concentrating on an integrated Egyptian agenda for reform so as to cope with American initiatives.
She added that such aid had its assets represented in the provision of in-kind financial resources required for the achievement of economic and social development. Aid, however, according to her, has negative effects too mainly represented in the growing reliance on foreign countries.
She said that the goals of the USAID in Egypt concentrate on putting an end to the budget deficit, avoiding the policy of reform and the competitive integration into international economy and development.
30 MILLION EUROS WORTH OF REVENUES OF FISH EXPORTS TO EUROPEAN UNION
Egyptian trade bureau in the Hague attributed Dutch Customs Authorities failure to cancel customs duties on Egyptian exports of flowers and ornamental plants, although the implementation of the trade part of the Egyptian-European partnership has started, to failure to submit proper documents of consignments coming from Egypt.
They advised Al Shayal that the Egyptian consignment be accompanied with documents including the country of origin certificates, cargo bills as well as EUR forms in order to facilitate Egyptian exports access into Holland.
Kuwait occupied the second place with investments of 8.4 million dollars. It was followed by Bahrain, 4.9 million dollars; the United Arab Emirates, 1.5 million dollars; and Jordan, 300,000 dollars. Egypt didn't receive any investment influx from Tunisia and Libya during the same period.

He pointed out that car prices in show rooms did not expose to any price changes.
A key official at the Egyptian Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) attributed this decline to using part of such a reserve to open credits for importing important goods with a view to facing the sharp increase in dollar rate of exchange on the unofficial market during this period as it exceeded 7 pounds. This comes within the efforts exerted by the government in cooperation with the CBE to put an end to speculations in the dollar on the black market.
The government decided to increase the value of taxes which will be levied next year by about LE7 billion.
The public expenditure in the budget is due to reach about LE165 billion, an increase of LE6 billion only over last year. It includes a rise in allocations for civil servants to LE42 billion. The draft budget also includes a slight rise in financial allocations to education and health.
IRON PRICE CRISIS RENEWED IN EGYPT WITH TON PRICE UP TO $566
It is noteworthy that the interpellations and queries had focused on a monopoly by Ahmed Ezz, an eminent key figure in the ruling National Party on the iron market.

Adel Al Danaf uncovered that the cost of a ton of iron imported from Ukraine, the cheapest in the world, had risen to LE2450 ($448), without adding customs duties, sales tax, transport cost or profit margin for wholesalers or retailers, thus raising the price to over LE3000 according to the level of quality.
Businessmen bitingly blasted investment incentive draft law, which is now at the People's Assembly for deliberation.
Chairman of the Investment Committee under the Egyptian Businessmen's Association Mahmoud Fahmy said the investment incentive bill is constitutionality doubtful due to five reasons. Firstly; the bill failed to mention whether it was presented to the State Council Legislation Department, which may open the door for filing appeals against it.
Fourthly; article 64 contradicted the constitutional article 40 by failing to set a deadline to violating investors.

Mohamed Ghoneim, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce with Exporters' Division in Damietta, said importers included France, Spain, Italy, Britain, Belgium, America, Canada, Russia and Arab Gulf countries.
Al-Hayat learnt that the government stipulates certain conditions for opening the file. It is believed for instance that it should be gradually opened to run parallel with the political circumstances as the foreign loans in the current circumstances represent an unwelcome burden especially if they were linked with certain countries having nothing to do with international funding institutions.
This, according to observers, is the main aspect of putting up such a file to obtain such guarantees with a view to promoting investment opportunities available in Egypt the confidence in which would be enhanced through American treasury guarantees.
Egypt's name has been struck off the money laundering blacklist.
Pensioners had to go to banks to fill in such forms, making bank personnel sympathetic with them.
CBE HESITATES AND EXPERTS DIFFER OVER RAISING INTEREST RATE
Former Egyptian economy minister, Dr. Mostafa Al Said said that interest rates were a thorny issue which should be treated with extreme care, so no decision about it should be taken until a detailed and full study has been done.
Raising interest rates in such untimely circumstances would freeze domestic credit and increase the banking system's liquidity to such a degree that would render it incapable of investing savers' funds, which is an even sharper problem than "dollarization".
He went on to say that the maintenance of the currently high interest rates would make entrepreneurs refrain from industrial or trade investments and deposit their funds with banks in return for an interest rate reaching an average of 11.75% on long or short-term deposits. Investment and private banks even offer higher interest rates.
The Egyptian economy suffers a sort of lull in the investment movement especially productive industrial direct investment. Most investments enter the bourse and then leave it without affecting national economy.
He added that the rise in domestic products costs would raise their prices and make it difficult for them to compete with international products thus aggravating recession and increasing stockpiles. This would negatively impact that social aspect due to investment and trade entrepreneurs incurring losses.
Minister of Industry and Technology Development, Dr. Ali Al-Seidi pointed out that the Ministry was implementing programmes related to education, technical and vocational training, the construction of Technological Centers, the resettlement of some industrial compounds in a new environment, and the provision of an integrated industrial information network. He called for the enhancement of the benefits gained from the Egyptian-European partnership.

It is worth mentioning that Cairo Barclays Bank's paid-up capital hits 270 million pounds.
EGYPT'S IMPORTS FROM LIBYA DIP
President of the Commercial Representation Service pointed out that there are many agreements organizing the economic and commercial relations between Egypt and Libya.

The Premier pointed out that the wave of food price rises was international and would require cooperation of Arab countries to properly cope with that food gap especially in oils and fats. Scientific and research bodies, he added, should try to find means of increasing vegetable oil production.
He added that the Public Enterprise Sector companies (6 companies) contracts represent 49% of the total contracts, while the private sector companies (14 companies) contracts represent 51%. The Modern Nile Company signed the largest number of contracts hitting 24% of the total contracts and 46% of the contracts signed by private sector companies.
Trade balance deficit went down during the first ten months last year to 20.72 billion pounds versus 29.25 billion pounds during the same period in 2002. This was announced by the monthly report issued by the Cabinet's Information and Decision Support Center, pointing out that the total value of exports including petroleum exports, the re-exported ones and the trade of the free zones surged to 29.75 billion pounds against 17.83 billion pounds during the first ten months of 2002.
Petroleum production (including condensates) hit 3007 thousand tons in December last against 2996 thousand tons during November last and 3060 thousand tons in December 2002.
The report slammed the insistence of some Egyptian companies that had a long history on the Soviet Union markets to use mechanisms that do not cope with the current Russian market which now work according to open market mechanisms. It also criticized companies for refrainment from taking part in specialized Russian markets that are held in Moscow and main Russian cities, especially as those occasions are considered appropriate opportunities to present Egyptian developed products.
Upon his arrival from Iraq, Secretary-General of Egyptian Businessmen Association Mohamed Youssef told reporters that an agreement was reached on training a number of Iraqi doctors from North Iraq and to contribute to designing the first computerized archive of Kurdish heritage.

OCI PARTICIPATES IN IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION
Al-Alam Al-Youm learnt that OCI's quota in the new contract hit 50% of the contract value.
A committee headed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) including some specialists in the banking sector and the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) will be formed to prepare a study to find a solution to the finance problem, which is considered an obstacle to investors, Abu Zeid told Al-Alam Al-Youm. The study is expected to be completed by next March.
Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) Group received an avalanche of condolence cables on its Guide Ma'moun Al-Hudhaibi's death. Some cables were sent by figures close to the state. Meanwhile, the State Security Prosecution decided to put 12 Ikhwanite leading figures for 15 days in custody. The detainees were arrested before the decease of the guide on charge of reviving the activities of a banned group.
The candidate for the general guide post should not be less than 40 years old and should be a regular number of the group for not less than 15 lunar years. He, moreover, should have erudition (especially Sharia jurisprudence), and practical and moral properties that qualify him to be the leader of the group.
The Shura (advisory) Council approved an agreement that contributes to developing Sinai at a time when the government pledged before the People's Assembly to forge ahead with Sinai development plan and settle over 3.5 million people there by the end of 2017 within a plan meant to end Sinai's isolation following its liberation from Israeli occupation.
The settlement project costs 35.620 million dollars for constructing wells, water reservoirs and dams, as well as 3500 small farming units and 4650 houses, not to mention improving individual skills of men and women.
It is to be noted that mental retardation only represents 3% of the population.
Hotel evening charges ranged between LE200 and 850 per guest, while paddle boats charges started from LE250 and expensive restaurants varied from LE200 to 250.
The second, which spells danger, shows a downward trend in marriage cases which amounted to 452 thousands in 2002, down by 6,000 against 2001, and 140,000 contracts in 2000.
While the first presidential intervention was meant to rebut recent reports on patrimonial power in Egypt, the second intervention was intended to make sure whether recent parliamentary bye-elections were held in a legal way. The vote was carried out after a number of ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) deputies had resigned from the parliament. The resignation came after the Supreme Constitutional Court had declared their memberships illegitimate for failing to meet the obligatory military service performance stipulation.
Rather, they, in fact, came as a result of certain exercises meant to reveal, maybe designedly, that the process of grooming Gamal Mubarak for presidency is in full swing, and is backed and blessed by the president.
Such tremendous changes trigged off a gap between public and formal explanations of their significance.
It is the NDP which replaces the people with their parties and diverse political forces and monopolizes policy-making on grounds of its majority. It is the NDP Policy Committee which replaces the NDP itself under the pretext that it is tasked with overhauling its policies and injecting fresh blood. It is the NDP Policy Committee secretary who replaces the committee on the grounds that he is the prospective reform man. This series of replacements will eventually end in the emergence of the reigning champion, notably Gamal Mubarak, who will be the only candidate for holding sway in a party that has a sweeping majority in the People's Assembly that can nominate a single candidate for the presidency.
President Mubarak's interview excitingly confirmed, rather than dismissed, this potentiality.
I hope that youth can appear and move actively.
In this context, the "parliament's draft dodgers issue" only shows that the NDP's exercises and conduct have seen no change, and that a desired genuine political reform whether inside or outside the NDP cannot be realized as long as those people stay in their posts.
At first, the Minister of Justice asked the Constitutional Court for clarification which it provided with all the required perspicacity. It emphasized that performing or being legally exempted from military service is one of the conditions not only of the validity of membership but of eligibility for candidature as well. Consequently, anybody who does not meet that condition becomes ineligible for candidature. Any consequences of his invalid candidature would, therefore, be null and void too.
Those who tendered their resignation had already lost their capacity as deputies once their candidature was declared null and void!
Without attempting to understand the importance of the legal and moral aspects of this issue, we believe that its political dimension might, yet, be more serious and more significant and capable of uncovering the reality of the cul de sac facing the ruling political regime in Egypt.
What would such consequences be?
According to antecedents, we can predict that the Constitutional Court would say.
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD NEW GUIDE: WE DON'T WANT CONFLICT WITH GOVERNMENT
As regards the Copts, Akef said that he himself maintained good relations with them. The group doesn't want to clash with the regime, he confirmed.
Akef enjoys a highly placed rank among the Ikhwan as he is one of five members of the group who served a twenty-year sentence during the Nasserite era, after a death sentence had been commuted to a life sentence. Akef had an eminent role in the "special organization" (the Ikhwan military wing) formed by the group founder Hassan Al-Banna at the early 1940s.
He knew Ikhwan in 1940 and became a disciple of Hssan Al-Bana.
Afterwards he left for Riyadh to work as a consultant to the International Symposium of the Muslim Youth, and in charge of its international camps and conferences.
Akef got 9 votes out of 15 members of the Guidance Bureau.
He contested the parliamentary elections in 1987 for an individual seat.
BURNS: EGYPT IS FREE TO MAKE RELATIONS WITH IRAN
However, he declined to comment on Syria's rejection of Israeli president's invitation to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to visit Israel.
However, Egyptian sources uncovered that Cairo and Tehran had not agreed yet on a schedule to resume relations.
JAMAA ISLAMIA LEADERS: BIN LADEN MADE ISLAM SUSPICIOUS, QUESTIONABLE
Faults and Dangers". The book was written by the Egyptian Jamaa Islamia historic leaders Karam Zohdi, Essam Derbala, Isam Abdel Maguid, Fouad Al-Dawalibi, Ali-Sherif and Nageh Ibrahim. The authors had been charged in the assassination of former Egyptian president Anwar Sadat and some of them are still detained.
"The Egyptian women are still victims rather than perpetrators of crimes, especially in familial violence crimes, where hitting is the most common crime.
The study highlighted the increased number of domestic crimes reported in 2003 in comparison to last year.
"There is no peace without justice. The developed world also violates human rights. The matter, thus, is not confined to the developing world," he pursued.
Those who adopted, trained and taught terrorists are now being harmed with terror and reaping its fruits. I hope we would learn the lesson from the past," Saleh argued.
The Royal Democratic Alliance (RDA), one of the Iraqi parties that supports return to monarchy and keeps good relations with neighbourly Jordan, welcomed the coming visit of Prince Hassan, former crown prince of Jordan, to Iraq next month.
There are four decisions of great importance that will be announced next week, he said, threatening to take bold steps and hold other coordinating meetings to follow up developments.
"We won't to stimulate Jordanians, the king or his entourage.
In an exclusive statement to Asharq Al-Awsat on his first day as head of the ICM, Al-Nashi said, "The ICM's stance rejecting terrorism to express its attitudes or policies has been crystal clear since the beginning." He confirmed his commitment to this line and categorical rejection to the policy of terror and violence as well as taking a hard line on dealing with Islamic issues.
"ICM's programme for the coming stage will be determined after approving the 21-member general secretariat board," he noted.
"Change is a natural issue that had taken place in a satisfactory way," he added, confirming that discussions that spread among the ICM ranks in the recent period uncovered the dire need of putting forward fresh concepts in the stage to come.
WILL US-KURDISH HONEYMOON COME TO AN END?
Nor is the future of Iraq's Kurds themselves spared such ambiguity so long as Iraq's new constitution has not been completed yet. There are two main approaches to that constitution, firstly to conduct general elections where all Iraqis should participate to express their opinions in a new constitution. Secondly, partial elections through meetings by key elements in each governorate and then conveying proposals and recommendations to the Governing Council.
In their approach to the new Iraq, the Kurds, consequently, seem to be rather peculiar in the Iraqi spectrum (Arabs, Turkmen, etc).
The Kurds have opted for confederacy, as it would enable them to preserve both their nationalistic privacy and Iraq's integrity at one and the same time and as it is part of their right of self-determination.
The Iraqi-Kurdish scene, therefore, seems surrealistic seeking of civil wars and auguring an end to the Kurdish-American honeymoon!
In relation to political reforms, the US administration has established the civil administration authority, the military command, the provisional Iraqi Governing Council and the caretaker government in Iraq, working independently of each other. This is part of a political reform drive to consecrate the principle of separation between state authorities and secure their independence as there have never been multi-decision makers in Iraq. Regarding democracy, it requires internal stability in Iraq.
As for natural gas, the U.S. consumes 25% of global natural gas production. It is predicted to become the key world natural gas importer in ten years' time, preceding Japan, the present key importer.
The region's resentment, if, at the Gulf-based American neighbour is not new since relations between countries in the region are plagued by disputes, conflicts, wars, rows, rapprochement, rupture and instability. American-Gulf ties appear to be more stable than inter-Gulf ones. While Gulf Arab citizens averted visiting the U.S. due to strict complicated security measures taken by some of its agencies, including visa services, America moved to the Gulf to establish its state there in line with a new strategy of "preemptive relations". Thus, visiting it in this case should not require all such security complications or much money.
Although the Gulf-based America has come into being through a military invasion and domestic betrayal, it has become a de facto state that should be recognized diplomatically to deal directly with it and do without the major mediator; the U.S. This will save time and favourably affect the future of relations with America, the Gulf neighbour.
The last days of 2003 in Saudi Arabia witnessed crucial events including the amendment of two paragraphs of the Shura (Advisory) Council's constitution with a view to consolidating its legislative competence and devising a fresh ministerial post for the Shura Council affairs. Moreover, the 2nd round of national dialogue wound up in Mecca last Wednesday (December 31st).
Despite such a reformist tendency, the absence of a reform programme means that the Saudi reform thought has not got out of the quandary it was involved in from the beginning.
It neither rejects such demands as a whole nor accepts them.
On Saturday, the Crown Prince received a delegation of the second meeting of national dialogue with the recommendations of such a meeting.
The government, represented by the Crown Prince, called for such a dialogue, provided the official framework and cover for it, chose its participants, and determined the topics and limits of dialogue.
The government can achieve success, as it managed to make itself an arbitrator among such trends and sects, which should encourage it to push ahead with adopting an explicit and ambitious reform programme because it will mean that such reform demands do not contradict the legitimacy of the state, but rather consolidate it.
What are the limits, according to its concept, that should not be stepped over by such participation?
Its sponsorship of the national dialogue and establishment of a center for it under an official umbrella point out that the acceptable dialogue for the government, at least up till now, is the one it sponsors within an official framework. Such dialogue should adhere to the requirements of official limits, whether political or religious, and that it should be subjected to their resultant bureaucracy.
This official approach for the reform issue in such a way imposes the following question: Is this a temporary option imposed by the necessity of adopting gradual reform?
Here, we should point out that the achievement of participation as a reform goal requires three indispensable matters: constitutional amendment making the constitution the only reference for all the state's authorities, ensuring freedom of expression and organization and allowing the establishment of a civil society independent of the government.
In this respect, there is another question: Does the government's ambiguous approach to the dialogue and participation issue reflect a difference at the leadership level over the issue of reform?
STRATEGIC CONCERNS CONTROL SYRIAN-TURKISH RAPPROCHEMENT
In light of this, both Damascus and Ankara are about to turn a new leaf of strategic rapprochement and cooperation after it had become certain that Syrian President Bashar Assad will pay an unprecedented visit to Turkey soon following gradual improvement of bilateral relations over the last four years during which more than 40 Turkish and Syrian ministers as well as the two countries' former premiers exchanged visits. Moreover, Syrian-Turkish trade exchange amounted to one billion dollars.
Syrian President Bashar Assad refused this proposal at that time. However, Syrian Vice-president Abdel-Halim Khaddam's visit to Ankara in November 2001 and his meeting with Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezar and former premier Bulent Acevit led to a compromise regarding Iskenderun. They agreed upon the necessity of respecting each other's political borders.
As regards Turkey, there is concern about the loss of its strategic importance, which started following the breakup of the former Soviet Union, then increased after the extension of the NATO to East European countries, and after that consecrated after the American occupation of Iraq. It uncovered the American decreasing need to Turkey, while Washington is boosting its relations with its new allies, i.e. the Kurds. Ankara, therefore, opted for the EU and accepted all its difficult conditions after the end of its "functional" role, which it practised for a long time for the sake of the United States.
Undoubtedly, both Syria and Turkey have their traits and capabilities that can benefit each other, which are by no means less than what Israel promises or promotes. Therefore, shelving joint dossiers (particularly that of borders) between the two countries will prevent America and Israel from making speculations and interventions in this stage.
Despite the gravity of these rates, they ignore significant differences between countries and inside the same country. The rates also did not disclose more disastrous rates in less-developed Arab countries, especially in rural areas.
Well-informed sources told Asharq Al-Awsat that the return of Hussein Khomeini, who arrived in Qum two days ago, came after he received a message from his darling grandma Batoul, Khomeini's wife, and after the US-led coalition authority warned him that he was targeted by Iranian elements.
Hussein's return to Iran surprised the regime oppositionists who earlier welcomed Hussein's rebellion against the incumbent regime.
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD GUIDE INVITES GOVERNMENT TO DIALOGUE: TENSION IS DUE TO SECURITY PRACTICES!
He said, "The organization has institutions that apply its principles, statutes and strategy." He categorically denied any generations conflict inside the group.
Regarding Muslim Brotherhood relation with the government, Akif said, "We're dealing with the government according to a constant policy that never changes. We're offering what we have and ask them to have a dialogue with us and listen to our arguments.
We, nonetheless, would not force anybody to cooperate with or talk to us.
Anybody who agrees with us is welcomed, but argue with everybody who disagrees with us according to the well-known (Ikhwanite) principle. "We cooperate in doing what we are agreed upon, but condone each other's differences."
He said, "Muslim Brotherhood attitude towards the Copts has been known since Al Imam Al Banna (the founder of the group). Our relations with them are very good. We have known of no sectarian sedition until recently and they were politically taken advantage of by some bodies.
Akif called on the nation to stand against American hegemony, he said, "I certainly believe that such attacks will come to an end and will only harm those who launched them. All we should do is to strongly stand up for right and without any remissness rise to face that aggression."
He added "I'm fully confident that Islam will invade Europe and America simply because Islam has got a logic and a message.
Libyan Leader Mu'ammar Gaddafi intends to change the official name of Libya and reduce its current six-word name (Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya), while it was reported that an American diplomatic mission headquarters would be opened in Tripoli shortly, Asharq Al-Awsat learnt.
Despite being dissatisfied with the Arab official reaction regarding its recent step to scrap weapons of mass destruction (WMD), Libya does not intend to give up its regional and Arab position, the source said, pointing out that Libya still waits for the results of the Arab summit that will be held in Tunisia next March to decide whether it will maintain its permanent membership in the Arab League or not.
American sources told Asharq Al-Awsat that a group of 5-7 persons from the American Department of State would head for Tripoli in the coming few weeks to hold the required arrangements for inaugurating the expected American diplomatic mission headquarters.
He added that once qualified such companies would be able to form a consortium among themselves or with major construction companies in other Arab countries to enhance the chances of winning further deals to execute giant projects.
He added that penetration of foreign markets is one of the most important ways out of domestic market losses, pointing out that the volume of works in the projects of Iraq's reconstruction or South Sudan development exceeding tens of billions of dollars would redress the balance of the construction sector in Egypt should a reasonable quota of such projects be allocated to Egyptian companies whether directly or through international companies.
He criticized the tax burdens, especially the sales tax on capital goods as they raise production cost and reduce competition opportunities. Engineer Samir Allam urged countries to reconsider their concession contracts implemented in the constrution sector as they put companies in an embarrassing situation exposing them to heavy losses after the deregulation of rates of exchange and the devaluation of the pound as well as the current steady rise in building materials prices.
He said he is for monopoly if it is aimed to cut prices and alleviate burdens on customers.
Abu-Ismail unveiled disagreements inside the government over determining the minister concerned in the competition support and antitrust law. He expressed the Federation's hope that such a minister will be the supply minister.
They also warned that that action might also bring instability to the market and deprive it of the profits it made including narrowing the gap between the dollar in banks and that on the unofficial market. The differential reached 20 piasters after it exceeded 80 piasters a few weeks ago.
Former head of the Banks Union Abdel-Salam Omar said putting up a dollar saving book at an interest rate that is 1.5% over that of the dollar would cause harmful competition between banks and the new saving coffers for dollar.
Board chairman of Misr-Iran Development Bank Ismail Hassan explained that effectuating such a step would be improper for the market is in no need of such measures to attract dollar savings.

It is to be mentioned that the government issued a decision reducing customs duties on yarn, textile and ready-made clothes imports in compliance with its pledges to the World Trade Organization (WTO) to liberalize markets. Textile and garment industrialists confirmed that such a decision runs counter to Egypt's commitment to the GATT, as Egypt pledged to implement the agreement. The finance minister's decision included a timetable for removing customs obstacles and other protectionist charges by cutting down the tariff on yarn imports from 22% to 20% in 2003 provided that such tariff would not exceed 18% as of 2004 and then decrease to 15% at the beginning of 2005. However, the latest government decision provided for reducing the customs duties to 12%, i.e. 3% less than the Egyptian commitment.
Nevertheless, the last decision took them down to 40% ahead of schedule.
Deputy chairman of the Investors Division at the Federation of Chambers of Commerce Adel Al-Ezabi said the government ignored consideration of the effects of that decision on local industry as well as the giant government companies in which some 1.5 million workers work.
In the FY2002/2003 the Al-Mehalla Al-Kobra Company made losses to the tune of 130 million pounds; Kafr Al-Dawar Company, 326 million pounds; Helwan Company, 157 million pounds; Asco Company, 112 million pounds; Dakahliya Company, 55 million pounds; Delta Company, 32 million pounds; Middle Egypt Company, 74 million pounds; Upper Egypt Company, 58 million pounds and the National Company, 185 million pounds. The debts due on those companies to banks totaled 14 billion and 23 million pounds.
This means that the government decided to cut customs that have been estimated at 5% but left charges and taxes estimated at 15% on importation of such equipment necessary for developing local production.
It is not true that the officials didn't study the position of industry before they take relevant decisions.
Now we can say that survival is for the fittest and those who are able to develop their products and raise quality levels. We provide all facilities to achieve that end.
The value of commodity imports also rose from LE47 billion to LE50.4 billion, a 7.5 billion pound rise.
CAPMS emphasized a rise in maize imports to LE2 billion and 583 million an increase o f14.6%, timber imports to 2 billion and 444 million, an increase of 20.6%; and oil products to LE2.1 billion, 57%.

Due to the burdens on the textile sector whether in the form of taxes or customs duties, Khamis urged factory owners to study the question of setting up special free zones where exporting factory owners are granted tax and customs exemptions for about 70% of their products.
The council members showed willingness to offer required guarantees to public sector companies including pre-payments and letters of guarantee, etc. to which Abou El Qumsan objected, emphasizing the difficulty of forcing public sector companies to supply exporters. He pointed out that contractual relations between private sector companies operative in the textile industry sector and the yarn producing public sector companies should be governed by economic principles.

They also voiced their support of the works of the negotiations committee that started its meetings in Addis Ababa last month.
The Nile Water have invariably constituted the most serious aspects of the Egyptian national security. This might have been the reason why Mohamed Ali (founder of the ex-royal family in Egypt) once, tried to secure the Nile sources.
It is rather a matter of life and death.
We know that Egypt is still targetted in everything and that international parties do not want this people to live in security and hence the galaxy of unexpected problems or crises, the goal of which is quite obvious namely to destabilize Egypt.

This decline, he said, occurred at a time when companies suffer from a shortage of yarn, causing a shortage of local cotton in local spinneries. Therefore, the national industry depends on importing cotton of quality lower than that of the Egyptian cotton.

He said that the Egyptian product is capable of competing with the foreign product both in quality and price despite the subsidy to the latter by its own country. Such Egyptian competitive edge is due to several reasons including Egyptian producers' efficient performance and their care for producing distinguished products of good specifications and in compliance with export conditions. He is also keen on increasing care for export specifications to ensure continuation and future dealings with those markets especially as they cannot do without the Egyptian poultry product which could gain excellent reputation on those markets especially after several European and African countries were exposed to epidemics and therefore stopped exporting.

Board Chairman of Housing and Development Bank Fatehi Al-Seba'ei determined another reason for the expected refresh on real estate market in the coming months, pointing out that there is a big number of people who want to purchase real estate units but they were unable to do that due to the limited purchasing power, especially after the rise of the prices of building materials. However, he added, the effectuation of real estate finance law and the start of the activity of Al-Tamir Company for Real Estate Finance as well as the construction of anther three companies will allow those people to get access to real estate market as investors.

Hassan Abdel-Hamid, a member of Bank of Alexandria board of directors, regarded that raising interest rates at present would not be in the interest of banks, including the four state-owned banks notably the National Bank of Egypt, Misr Bank, Banque du Caire and Bank of Alexandria, which have abundant cash fluidity. This might impede the movement of borrowing, if interest rates were raised.
The CIB has recently resorted to increasing interest rates in pursuit of a better investment of available cash fluidity and match between investing in treasury bonds offered at higher price and granting distinguished interest rates to depositors.
Some banks are reluctant to take such a step out of their desire to keep their profits, which negatively affects investment and pushes businesses to prefer foreign borrowing to domestic bank borrowing just to raise finance charges, she said.

AUTO INDUSTRY: BETWEEN THE DOLLAR'S ROCK AND HARD PLACE OF OPENING TO EUROPE
As for the volume of the number of cars in Egypt, it has grown in the last 7 years to reach 2.716 million cars in December 2002 including 1.9 million passenger cars, 664 thousand trucks, 61.647 thousand buses. Regarding car feeding industries in Egypt represented in fittings, seats, exhaust pipes, spare types, filters, glasses, conditioners, bus glass, radiator components, etc, they achieved 45% local component manufacturing while buses achieved 60% and buses from 50 to 70%.
Away from the language of figures and statistics, auto industry in Egypt relies on more than 20 factories with international agencies which manufacture different types of cars, mainly passenger cars, by importing their components from countries like France, Germany, South Korea, Italy, the USA and Japan.
Assistant Secretary of EMAM Eng. Salah al Hadari thinks that the volume of demand for cars in Egypt exceeds the volume of sales and is not proportionate, in the meantime, with the number of the population. The level of individuals' income, however, affects the sales movement and the real problem of production is linked to the economic volume in Egypt. Such a problem is aggravated by the fact that free Arab trade zone applies negative lists, which means that the car movement between Arab borders is not subjected to customs exemptions, customs duties, therefore, increase the car price. To ward off this problem, those negative lists should be cancelled in the joint Arab unity project to bring about a boom in car market movement.
If the national domestic component increased in the auto industry, this will mean an increase in Egyptian market activity. In my opinion, the solution to the industry and exportation crisis lies in canceling negative lists and activating the domestic market by the implementation of flexible systems to replace old cars by new models that preserve the environment and suit the Egyptian citizens' income. Egypt is the Arab country qualified for taking the lead in auto industry in the Arab region because of its expertise, cadres and broad base. This will be enhanced by the implementation of the European-Egyptian partnership agreement under which Egypt could export cars to Europe without taxes," Al-Hadari added.
The National Car "Although some factories fared well in increasing the rate of domestic components and sometimes exceeded 70%, they still rely in the first place, on imports from abroad. Such a system is considered a success and I wish we could have a 100% national car in Egypt, which would be possible if companies efforts combined to produce a national car instead of each company following its own interests and personal investments," he pointed out. In that case, the domestic cost of the car would be reduced instead of its increase year after year due to its link to the American dollar rate of exchange.
Minister of Finance Dr. Medhat Hassanein said that luxury expenditure did not exceed 4% only of public expenditure adding that he was trying to reduce it.

Egypt's desire to set up such a free trade zone comes within the framework of its commercial policy in the African continent, which aims at promoting cooperation with the main economic development pivots in the black continent, said Trade Minister Plenipotentiary and Advisor to the Minister of Foreign Trade Alaa Shalabi.

Since Mubarak is one of the October war heroes and since he is a clean-handed and clean-tongued president, people, in spite of their cares and chronic despair, hold him in high esteem.
The conditions in Egypt, apart from Atef Ebeid and his supporters, have become good for only those who harbour enmity to Egypt. I think that the people would be delighted if President Mubarak went to the television or radio quite alone without the company of those faces that have besieged us for over twenty years so that the President may directly talk to the people in Egypt.
What budget is required for a family that consists of a husband, his wife and two children?
People expect his Excellency to talk to them about the philosophy of cabinet re-shuffle in Egypt especially after Al Ganzouri left under the pretext that he had once given wrong data while Atef and his ministers have given wrong data for years and years and yet retain their positions!
People want to know from the President how we could talk about exports while not a single Egyptian mark could give credit to Egypt even though some ministers boast of Egypt's exports which could be exported by just one factory in China. Suffice it to say that Egypt's exports did not exceed $10 billion whereas South Korea's exports hit $60 billion annually, India's exports, $68 billion and China, $350 billion. Neither of these countries cited the pretext of over population, a pretext reiterated by Atef Ebeid round the clock.
SISTANI'S WORLD: AUSTERITY THAT BORDERS ON PRIMITIVENESS, DECISIONS TAKEN AFTER CONSULTING EXPERTS
When Saddam Hussein's regime collapsed, there was complete change both in quantity and quality.
The house door is one and a half meter wide.
Besides, there is also another square-shaped hall in another glass-roofed house containing old wooden benches.
After the collapse of Saddam Hussein's regime, he refused the introduction of any essential change to the administrative part of the office.
Sistani's elder son Mohamed Ridha is the dynamo of the office mechanism. In spite of the latter's intelligence and knowledge, too much work together with the multiplicity of axes and contacts present him with countless difficulties that weigh on him and lend some sharpness and nervousness to his behaviour.
He, however, has his appointments arranged in a special diary.
He, sometimes, tends to seek the opinion of advisors in cases that require technical or administrative experience. Those advisors can be incumbent or retired employees. He has an extensive network of deputies and representatives who provide him with the new developments of various situations.
The Religious Authority greatly contributes to a lot of the basic needs of Najaf as well as other Iraqi cities that suffer from severe shortages in medical services. The latest specialized hospital is being built in Najaf and many services are being improved in the city.
Under this headline, assistant chief editor of Al-Hayat Ghassan Sherbel writes an article to the following effect: Whoever was a witness to the Lebanese civil war cannot conceal his concern over Iraq.
To be also included in the "Lebanization signs" was whispers, that spread when the former regime fell and then turned into explicit talks about the population percentage distribution.
The Lebanization signs also include the retreat of non-sectarian parties and the resort of every sect to its clergymen to assign the defence of the sect and its quota.
To this may probably be added a phone call I received from an Iraqi politician protesting against what is sometimes published by the paper about the Iraqi population distribution. He emphasized that there was no accurate census of the population.
MUBARAK ABOLISHES IMPRISONMENT PENALTY IN PUBLICATION CASES
Minister of Information Safwat el-Sherif delivered Mubarak's speech on his behalf in the inaugural session of the conference.
He also voiced opposition to the imposition of a single pattern of reforms on all Arab countries, noting that reforms should be based on the principle of mutual consultations.
The press should assume its role in disseminating the culture of involvement, dialogue, democracy and citizenship, he said.
Director of Bibliotheca Alexandrina Dr. Ismail Serag Eddin said it is scheduled that some 120 Egyptian and Arab thinkers and intellectuals of different trends and specialties would participate in the conference. The number of Egyptian participants would not exceed one third of the total number of participants so that the conference would be Arab in every sense of the word. The conference is expected to issue a document stating reform requirements to be referred to the Arab League ahead of the convention of Tunisia summit.
We are obviously in a historic pivotal stage; a stage in which the ruling regimes are exposed to both internal and external pressure to carry out reforms without manoevering or prevarications. As much as we hate external pressure which is motivated by ambitions and greed we bet on the success of internal pressure with its deeply rooted national demands in the establishment of what has come to be internationally known as enlightened good government based on political, legal and constitutional principles that would create a state of law and institutions not a state of individuals, centers of power and bodies of narrow monopolistic interests.
Although we admit once again to the currently available press freedom margin, we believe that contenting ourselves with that margin represents a genuine inability to forge ahead as much as a shackle that impedes progress towards further freedom. We should, therefore, continue our struggle to convert that limited margin to a towering edifice in the state of law and institutions and to erect the model of the enlightened good government in accordance with acknowledged international and national standards. We could do so, we would achieve two important goals, firstly forging into the march of reform and genuine democratic development to meet a national need and to give momentum to the reconstruction of the modern state; secondly, the ability of this modern national democratic state to withstand foreign blackmail and pressure with its policies of reinstalling networks of imperialistic domination as is obviously seen.
Although the bank does not pay the annual interest to the Insurance Authority, but only registers it and adds it to the original debt, it turned out that about LE17 billion had been seized by the bank, but not added. The sum represented the differential between the interest rate on insurance funds and those on investment certificates, which, together with postal savings bank books and insurance funds surpluses constitutes the main resources of bank.
In the period from July 1991 to June, 1992, insurance funds interest rates were raised to 11% while investment interest rate remained at 17.5% with a differential of LE2182 millions.
SOMALI PIRATES RELEASE 23 EGYPTIAN FISHERMEN DETAINED TO RANSOM
"The ship's value hits some two million pounds and is registered in Egypt," he said, adding that the load of the ship that hoists the Egyptian flag, amounts to 30 tonnes. When the ship arrived in Somalia, the agent of the Cypriot company Ali Nour Mohamed surprised the fishermen by seizing the ship with the assistance of a number of pirates who heavily shot the bow of the ship, which belongs to a 4-ship Egyptian fishing fleet.
The President may hardly need anyone to draw his attention to such escalating threats. However, there is no project adopted by the President to fend off such threats. All solutions are partial, case by case solutions, opting for a piecemeal approach and lacking in a strategic perspective that links them together to inspire hope for transcending them! I believe that procrastination in the democratic change in the name of gradualness or the security problem gives impetus to foreign interventions and deprives our political community of any immunity! It is the present position's continuation that threatens national security and opens all possibilities to anarchy scenarios.
We are calling on the president to opt for his major contribution in his political career through a broad democratic openness that would undermine the rules of the current political game that dwarfed our country.

The question comes following recent comments by Israeli minister of housing and construction Efraim Eitam, carried by Egyptian newspapers on their front pages, proposing Sinai, Egypt, as a homeland for the Palestinians beginning from Gaza as far as Sinai.
The complication of the situation lies at its beginning as Israel from the very beginning took control of the land, and the first issue for it has become a security one just to protect such land and prevent its original owners from restoring it.
- The premonition of resources: water, oil and any other resources that can be targeted by the Israeli aggression.
However, the population has another aspect, notably the balance between the Jews and the Arabs. Israel resorted to Judaizing newcomers from other religions, but it has failed to reach the population growth rate of the Palestinians, which fulfills expectations that the population structure will change swiftly in favour of the Palestinian people, thus making a Palestinian majority but posing a threat to Israel.
Three wars were waged on Sinai in 1956, 1967 and 1973. Six years following the latter, Israel left Sinai for good. Over whole six years, it exploited oil and other resources in Sinai, set up the Yamit Jewish Settlement and tried to retain it later on, but it had to demolish it as per the Egyptian-Israeli peace accord. It also failed to keep Taba in Sinai under an international arbitration resolution. However, it could set security arrangements for Sinai in a way that can thwart new wars there under the peace deal between both countries.
The land expansion issue is risky and constitutes no leverage as Israel seeks more people, not more land.
In the Egyptian-Israeli case, the decisive factor is the military balance and deterrence owned by Egypt, preventing the Israeli side from taking any risks.
Second; the expulsion of the Palestinian people which means the outbreak of a new war to be decided by the military power balance, international position and the domestic situation in Israel and Palestine.
The radio bankrolled by the European Union aims at encouraging coexistence between the Palestinians and the Israelis.
The new radio launch declaration aroused the concern of Israeli settlers and their leaders. The hardliner rightist Knesset member Auri Ariel, the leading figure in the National Union Party, asked that the project be cancelled.

FROM SYKES-PICOT TO THE GREATER MIDDLE EAST
The problem lies in the fact that, according to the "new conservatives", the Middle East destiny should be determined at in camera meetings by republican rightists in Washington named think-tank and in the European corridors which are exceptionally hospitable to Zionist lobby agents. Therefore, the most remarkable diplomatic message of the Syria Accountability Act and Lebanon's Restoration of Sovereignty passed by the Congress seems not only a consecration of the right of unilateral preponderance in taking unilateral decisions in the Middle East but also notifying the region that the British-French Sykes-Picot formula created by the First World War has just been replaced by a unilateral American formula created by Iraq's war named the Greater Middle East project.
The second stage would take place if George W. Bush was re-elected for a second term in office. In spite of all possible dangers, we cannot be certain that Washington, then, would think that any escalation of diplomatic pressure on Syria to the extent of military pressure would be more feasible than talking with it about certain constants in the Greater Middle East. In Washington's point of view, Syria is still one of the few Arab countries that have a secular regime and the country which Bush Administration refrained from including in the list of the Axis of Evil states in spite of all the charges leveled at it with developing mass destruction weapons. It is also the only state among those classified as "rogue countries" with which Washington has normalized diplomatic relations so much so that they still have diplomatic representation at the level of ambassadors even after the Syria Accountability Act.
The strategic vacuum in the Middle East region has been the main concern of quite a number of official decision-making and research circles.
A set of political moves have recently emerged in the region, which profoundly imply further chances of bilateral and collective cooperation and coordination to settle or find solutions to some regional problems or to face issues and files which are wide open and prone to negative ramifications.
President Mubarak's visit to Ankara, therefore threw some light on dissatisfaction with that increasing role which would lead to further Egyptian retreat on the foreign policy arena especially as it is connected with the Arab-Israeli conflict issue where Cairo used to play an important role and is still keen on activating this role now through the Palestinian and Syrian channel.
Several Signs! Obviously, the tendency to form a collective leadership is still lacking in factors that turn that leadership into a concrete reality.
However, a motley will possibly render such a collective model chances even stronger due to the dominant tendency to introduce genuine political reforms which would lead to major changes in many strategic concepts including regional leadership, its mechanisms and dynamism in dealing with developments and what non-conventional requirements are needed for political and economic interaction.
Consequently, there is a growing need for a reconciliatory formula filling in the gap between the regional vacuum state and the preservation of the USA strategic interests as well as the inauguration of what structural reforms it aspires after.
New Types of Interactions As the USA wants to restructure the region in accordance with its own ambitions it will invariably seek to change the type of interactions to suit its immediate or direct presence in the region. This is especially so because reliance on one country if available for the implementation of American concepts would create genuine sensitivities between some influential countries in the region thus enhancing the odds of failing coming American projects.
Letting each country behave on its own would also lead to clashes in practices that would eventually make it even more difficult to reach successful political solutions.
It would eventually provide that umbrella of alliances which the USA wants to change many of the region's features, according to its declared perspective, especially as the region's countries conviction of such ideas would be required so that they would not object to any concepts that may be proposed.
The interview held by Al Majalla with political and economic specialists had one pivotal question: what does the unification of Cyprus politically and economically mean to us as Arabs, Gulfides, Middle Easterners?
Dr. Hashim thinks that the principle of negotiations based on alienating past gains in return for a pledge of a better future is the American strategy that might recur in more than one hot Middle Eastern and Arab areas including the UAE-Iran dispute over the Arabian Gulf islands, the Arab-Israeli conflict, the desert dispute between Morocco and Mauritania. It will be like the latest example of a peaceful settlement in our Arab world, the peace programme between North and South Sudan.
We should, furthermore, expect an American political action in three integrated cycles- the first and the smallest in the East Mediterranean including Turkey, Cyprus, Lebanon, Syria and Israel, the second which is the biggest includes all previous states in addition to Egypt and Arab Maghreb countries and the third cycle including the rest of Arab countries. This is the American strategic political perspective of the Middle East.
Regarding the effects of such unification, as reflecting unified European will, on the Arab Israeli conflict, Dr. Fadel says that such effects will generally be negative and will represent a disillusionment to those who see the Arab right in Palestine measured by square metres rather than opportunities of life, jobs and institutional construction.
Employees with US press offices and TV stations in Cairo said they received information from their main centers to the effect that US official bodies claimed the imminence of capturing Al-Zawahri, the second man in Al-Qaeda organization after Osama bin Laden.
However, Al-Zayat said he had no idea about that, expecting that the US administration aimed, by such a step, to distract mass media attention from the goings on in Iraq for its heavy losses there.

Egyptian businessmen set aside some one billion dollars for investment in infrastructure projects in Iraq over the coming period through a joint Egyptian-Arab consortium.
However, the private sector refuted those accusations after it had penetrated the Iraqi market through cellular phone and construction companies. Other companies entered the Iraqi market as subcontractors and via international partners.
They participated just to talk about a problem suffered from by the Arabs apart from Egypt. However, the Shiites in Egypt have a big presence. One of their leaders in Egypt, Dr. Ahmed Rasim Al-Nafis, professor in the Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, sent an official letter to the Minister of the Interior demanding that the Shiite sect be recognized in Egypt and that its few members be allowed to practice their religious rites without incrimination or security harassment like what recently happened to them in Al-Sharkeya, Upper Egypt and Ras Gharib. He based his demands on fatwas (religious opinions) by former Al-Azhar grand sheikhs allowing worship through Shiite Al Gafari sect, like Sheikh Salim Al Bishri and Sheikh Mahmoud Shaltout in 1959. Such fatwas are still valid today.
In spite of the fact that the nation is now undergoing numerous crises that urge us to uproot rather than sow the seeds of discord, there has been feverish and abnormal activity as well as contradictory moves led by Mohamed Al Dereini, Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Alul Beit, who insists that his council is not Shiite while the Internet Shiite sites as well as the Shiite News Agency deal with it as the representative of Shiites in Egypt. This contradiction mixes matters up and renders them unclear especially as Al Derein's council had announced feelings of hostility towards the officially dissolved Muslim Brotherhood Group, Al Azhar and Al Ashraf Syndicate. This has attracted much attention to him and justified fears of the Shiite presence in Egypt in light of the Iraqi picture and inquiries about their approach to occupation resistance especially as the Shiites are known for their inclinations to revolts and coups. The Supreme Council of Al El Beit Care is still following a course of action that would recall to memory historic disputes that date back to over one thousand years ago.
AL-AZHAR WANTS TO WATCH "THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST" AHEAD OF PERMISSION
Meanwhile, Rafaat Othman, an academy member, was quoted as saying that the academy would decide whether to permit the film in Egypt once it watched. "Al-Azhar is not asked to compile reports on religious movies directed and produced abroad so they are shown here without seeking its opinion. However, we won't remain silent about "The Passion of the Christ" film, and we will call for banning it if it is proven that it contains any violations of the Islamic Shari'a." "In this context, we should take action just as the Jews did as they did their utmost to absolve themselves of crimes they committed against Christ, some of which were scheduled to be monitored by the film."
Under the pressure of the crisis, there may be responses to some public opinion demands like the cancellation of journalists or non-journalists imprisonment for publishing cases. Such responses, important as they are, do not constitute a system or clear agenda for political reform that may convince us that Egypt is heading for a new stage and a new age.
He said, "We can't just press a button to have public freedoms!"
Nor do we have the least doubt that Arab public opinion in toto especially in Egypt rejects reform the American way. The USA reputation is at its worst in the Arab street. And the wave of hatred of its policies has become so intense that no newspapers, satellite channels or democratic initiatives or allegations might be feasible. The ugly face is not amenable to any cosmetic attempts.
We are not in a race with others regarding launching initiatives as our mortification has reached such a degree that our own destinies are determined by others who fail even to send envoys to Cairo to acquaint us with what is expected of us.
Algerian diplomatic sources said Mubarak denied during the call that he intended to insult Algeria, people and government, in his recent statements.

The sources highlighted the necessity of the intensive presence of Egypt among the Nile basin countries through providing technical support and aid.
These terrifying figures were announced by Egyptian Health Minister Mohamed Awadh Tageddin who held drivers responsible for 90% of those accidents.
Mulling over the reasons for such a drain is just like solving a catch-22: The Ministry of Health and research bodies blame drivers for most accidents and drivers blame other factors, mainly including the bad condition of roads and flyovers as well as crowdedness.
Some of them are under the legally prescribed age for driving, which means that they have no driving licenses, even though such a document has turned recently into mere ink on paper.
In his meetings with Israeli and Palestinian officials in Ramallah and occupied Jerusalem, Egyptian Intelligence Chief Major General Omar Soliman was keen on achieving two aims, the first is that Israel should withdraw completely and thoroughly from Gaza Strip to be followed by further withdrawals from the West Bank.

Saif highlighted that Bahrain adopted transparent and opening up financial policies, which make it a main financial center in the Middle East and a gate to the regional market. He revealed that democratic reforms helped citizens, to practise their political and social life freely.

"The issue is related to running our available resources," he said. The sub-South Saharan countries ask for a fairer share of the Nile water.

During the larab leaders in their summit expected to be held on March 29th and 30th. The postponement of such discussion is not an attempt to avoid dealing with the ideas of the Bush Administration, which aim at bringing about political and economic reforms in the Arab world, sources close to Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa said. However, Western sources considered the postponement as an indicator of differences among Arab countries regarding that initiative.
GAMAL MUBARAK: NDP DOES NOT SEEK POWER MONOPOLY
Modesty may also be recommended so that economic and structural elements might combine in Arab societies, in a bid to create new dynamics based on some sort of modernization inside each Arab society but would reflect in the form of modernization on the collective Arab action level.
The American project itself reflects all such misgivings (at least in text).
Such goals include the following:
3- The project ensures support from the eight industrial countries under the cover of financing reform, but, in the meantime, implies a change that would turn into a profit-making investment in the long run where rich countries would participate in the exploitation of a region that abounds in resources and consumer potential.

This was said by head of the Commercial Representation Al-Sharqawi Hefni who added that the rate by which exports covered imports during the corresponding period rose from 49% to 76% due to the steady increase in petroleum exports from 67 million euros to 106 million euros.

However, it seems that the problem of the internal debt has reached a crucial stage that cannot be disregarded and that radical solutions should be sought in order to get rid of the burdens of this debt.
It has been noticed that the dependence on redressing the deficit through treasury bonds and bills is on the increase year after year, as this percentage has been risen to 71.5% or 37.5 billion pounds in the FY 2004/2005 draft budget.
This will not be through reducing expenditure but rather rationalizing it and stopping luxury expenditure represented, particularly, in buying fabulous cars, refurbishing ministries' headquarters, government ads especially those that can be dubbed as social hypocrisy, running the government's stock piles wisely, and reducing celebrations and spending on travels and conferences, etc. The solution also includes activating the collection of government revenues, especially mature debts on high-income categories and the wealthy and redressing deficit in the public economic authorities, which should fund their activities out of their own resources and seek to achieve surpluses. Such economic authorities do not achieve surpluses although they practise activities which the private sector practices and made high profits. How can, for example, the Egyptian Radio and Television Union make losses while there are hundreds of private radio stations and television channels making profits?
Political observers as well as economic milieus in Cairo expected that President Mubarak's official visit to Russia on 27-29 May at the invitation of Russian President Vladimir Putin would push Egyptian-Russian relations into a new stage of joint action and boost the distinguished friendship and cooperation relations that link the two friendly governments and peoples.
The proposals underline the importance of Egypt's commodity councils jointly participating in specialized exhibitions mounted yearly in main Russian cities and holding meetings between the Egyptian Banks Union and its Russian counterpart to consider the possibility of founding a joint commercial bank to help fund the two-way commodity and service trade, in addition to joint investment ventures. This will reduce financial costs of joint trade and investments and, thus, boosting them.
In light of the recent Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) resolution providing for accepting Russia as an observer member, the proposals pointed out that the tremendous financial programmes provided by the Islamic Development Bank could be tabbed. The Islamic Development Bank provides progrmmes to finance two-way trade and joint projects that aim at bolstering economic and trade cooperation between the organization member states provided that the two parties should present certain projects with feasibility studies.

In their assessment of an anticipated visit by the German Economy Minister to Cairo which will start on Monday, German officials said that such a visit would be very timely in light of signs of improvement in the Egyptian economy, the approach of putting the Egyptian-European partnership agreement into effect next June, and the expansion of the European Union which 10 countries joined.
However, the German ambassador rejected the idea of establishing a European investment office in Egypt to be a link between European investors and governmental investment bodies, adding that Bureaucratic obstacles should necessarily be removed.
The timing of the German Economy Minister's visit is very important because the tough circumstances that have been afflicting the Egyptian economy will come to an end soon, said CEO of the German-Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry Peter Gopvric.

The third is that the law decided that the premier should give additional incentives through tax exemptions in contravention to article 40 of the constitution.
He added that the law devised only five new rules as all the other rules were derived from previous laws. Although the law put into effect some time ago, no executive statute has been passed for it so far.

FIRST UNION OF EGYPTIAN-EUROPEAN BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS FOUNDED
The step comes in realization of the bad need of a non-governmental organization on the Egyptian and European levels especially due to the presence of a number of strong bilateral trade business associations and chambers lacking a mechanism of coordination between them as well the need to create cooperation bridges with European Union institutions and agencies due to the lack of any specialized business organizations to energize relations between Egypt and a big number of the 25 countries, members of the European Union which have bilateral chambers.
The EU did not deny such products' access to its markets, he said, emphasizing that it only demanded the aforementioned items should meet some conditions and specifications.

She added that there had been negotiations between the two parties so that the national programme could include Egyptian development priorities in the forefront of which are encouraging Egyptian exports to European markets and promoting the competitive edge of several Egyptian vital sectors. The programme finances several important programmes such as supporting the implementation of the partnership agreement between Egypt and the European Union, developing water and sanitary drainage sector and irrigation, education, cooperation with the European Union in the field of scientific and technological research health sector and the financial sector.

"Alexandria document" put up visualizations and views meant to treat shortcomings in the political, economic, social and cultural fields. It also presented details on dilemmas in Arab communities.
Al-Sharif explained that some participants stressed the necessity of pressurizing Arab regimes to achieve reforms. They thought that recommendations like releasing prisoners of conscience, putting an end to the emergency law and providing freedom for the citizenry are all results ensuing from the legitimacy of the regimes per se.
He said to Al-Hayat, "In all societies new proposals come from small categories and then spread rapidly and become requests by the whole society. If we manage to create public Arab awareness through the document, governments, undoubtedly, will pay attention to us."

SHARON PLANS TO ACCOMMODATE ONE MILLION IMMIGRANTS IN ISRAEL
Sharon held an extended meeting with senior officials from the Jewish Agency, representatives of Jewish organizations abroad, Minister of Finance Benjamin Netanyahu, Minister of Immigrant Absorption Tzipi Livni and a number of experts in immigrant absorption.
This year, only 2650 immigrants reached Israel, a drop of 30% against the corresponding period last year.

AFTER THE PROVISIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL
In fact, nobody in the Governing Council has voiced his final opinion or put forward his decisive concept for the future of Iraq as a homeland and a state for all.
More than one phenomenon could be recorded in the context of the "constitutional achievement".
This, nonetheless, did not reflect as much wisdom, neutrality or even discretion on the part of the Americans, as it meant that they did not abandon their previous ideas and attitudes towards the Shiites, but only had a realistic approach towards the situation that emerged after occupation.
Nobody, however, can be certain that granting the Kurds an almost independent entity would provide a decisive solution to the historical problem.
Neither could they give others their due attention. It was to the interest of the Shiites to reassure and contain others, but they left this task to the Americans.
The signature of the constitution, in spite of Al-Sistani's objection constituted an American message that occupation authority has the final say in the matter.
Initiating a national campaign in this regard, Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Sabah called on citizens and residents to rationalize water consumption. Kuwaiti MPs criticized the government for discovering the problem late, attributing the problem to a "management crisis".

Moroccan officials were preoccupied during the last week with the wave of bombings that targeted trains in Spain and the legislative elections there. Out of the blue, they found their country strongly present at this "landmark" turning point in the history of Spain.
Morocco bets on building stronger economic relations with the new long-awaited Socialists' government after severe differences with the previous center-right Aznar's government. Differences with the previous government were about to lead to an armed confrontation between Morocco and Spain over a disputed rocky island in the Mediterranean in summer 2002.
Spain's heaviest loss resulted from canceling fishing concession rights near the Moroccan coasts since 1999, by which 350 families were living on in Andalucia province.
However, the Spanish endeavor failed after French President Jacque Chirac, whose country benefited most from the deteriorating Spanish-Moroccan relations, opposed that step.
It is worth mentioning that Madrid approved late last year referral of the project to the European Commission (EC), which pledged funding of feasibility studies.
The Arab leaders decided in 2001 to conduct a plan for a comprehensive development of the Arab system to cope with modern developments. So, the Arabs have to take their place and go forward towards development, and this gives importance to Tunisia summit, otherwise we will leave the way for others to fill in the gap which we will leave.
So, there is a dire need for reform, we believe in that. However, all these reforms should be implemented gradually to avoid any setbacks. The conditions of each Arab country should be taken into account to be able to achieve success.
Alexandria's meeting included more radical visualizations about the conditions the Arab world is living in and explained the reality we are witnessing described by many as "lousy" and in need of radical solutions.
A paper on political reform said, "it is (political reform) no longer optional".
As for cultural reform, the paper anatomized the present Arab reality, stressing the need to restructure cultural institutions and lift foreign countries' tutelage on the Arab world. The Arab regimes were always concerned about the emergence of new trends that could reveal their "deteriorating conditions".
The religious discourse should be purified from fanaticism and intolerance to adopt an enlightened secular project.
"The US is remapping the Greater Middle East and planing to control the region culturally, politically and socially as if those who live in it were incapable, ignorant and in need of someone to rule them," said Hizbullah Vice-Secretary Na'im Qassem.
REFORM OF COUNTRIES AND REFORM OF ARAB LEAGUE!
The reason is obviously that the big powers would take decision regarding that issue in the G8 summit next June, then in the NATO countries summit to be held in Turkey, the closest NATO country to the Middle East, which is now candidate for becoming "Greater".
This is simply an excuse that claims wisdom and deliberation. The development plan might have been studied and discussed enough to have it endorsed or might have needed further consideration.
It has recently been said that the available time before the summit is not enough to prepare a document for reforming the Arab League and covering all its new elements. This means that no Arab agreement could be reached on all aspects of reform (an Arab Parliament, Arab Court of Justice, an Arab Common Market, an Arab Security Council, besides shifting from unanimity to Majority as a basis for the voting system.
The European projects, on the other hand, neither brandishes a stick nor stems from hot hostility to the Arabs.
So long as that is the current situation, how can the summit probe such an issue?
It is not known whether the Tunisian summit would have the ability to produce an Arab project that would win a unanimity (as the majority has not been put into effect so far).
Such a document, undoubtedly, replies to a question which should have been put forward regarding a still existent Arab tie justifying the presence of the AL.
In an exclusive to Al-Alam Al-Youm, he said that the current prices would continue as they are till the enforcement of the Presidential decrees issued two weeks ago to set up the Organizational Authority for drinking and sanitary water and the protection of the consumer. Such a statement was made by Dakruri as he was assigned the responsibility of determining those rates and setting up a holding company whose assets are 100% owned by the state and which will include all drinking and drainage water stations as well as networks and their pumping and power stations. The company's capital is expected to exceed LE5 billion.
Dakruri's main duties include the construction of administrative and technical structures in charge of determining the tariff used in accordance with the actual costs. Accurate statistics to be collected from governorates will be used to those effect. The statistics will cover current consumption as well as the financial categories used in a bid to standardize the tariff on the level of all governorates. He pointed out that 50% of water consumption had not been paid because government authorities do not regularly pay the value of their consumption.
The experts noted that the Egyptian private sector turns out 60% of the volume of medicines in Egypt. This percentage is valued at over 2.330 billion and 800 thousand pounds annually ($388 million) out of Egypt's total medicine production that amounts to 3.597 billion and 400 thousand pounds ($599,8 million).
He ascribed that to some challenges, topped by the fact that international companies control many trademarks of medicines. These companies allow exportation of medicines only through them. They don't allow any other companies or agents to export medicines directly. The international medicine trade volume hit 373 billion dollars in 2000 versus 256 billion dollars in 1994, 94 billion dollars in 1985 and 43.5 billion dollars in 1976.

In the memo, both sides stated their commitment to providing all facilities required to create partnership between private sector parties in the fields of manufacture and service provision.
"I'll not allow using the data and statistics included in the consolidated statistics sample, which would be used as of July next, for any purpose other than the statistics purpose of the General Authority for Export Control," said Minister of Foreign Trade Dr. Yousuf Botros Ghali. Exports and Imports law is being amended to ensure that no access to such data for any purpose is given to the state bodies or other individuals, he added. Ghali made it clear that such a step was meant to secure an all-out security system for the incoming and outgoing data. All data will be codified and no access will be allowed to them even to the authority without permission from the minister.
Ghali stressed that as of January next, no Egyptian products would be given access to the European or American market unless they are exported by companies that have abar code which is internationally registered with a view to following up the products of this company and how far they comply with the international specifications and standards.
Yehia attributed this increase to some producers' monopoly of markets and some high-ranking officials' intervention to delay the issuance of the Anti-trust and Competition Support Act, which impacted negatively on the real estate prices and formed a problem to contractors due to the difference between the current price and the contracted upon price when signing contracts."

He also pointed out that the system proposed by the Central Bank would procure the foreign exchange required by banks for opening documentary credits by getting that money from banks that had excess foreign currencies or from the Central Bank itself, which would be qualified for buying and selling foreign exchange under the new system, according to the situation on the market. "The only thing that is needed is an initiative by the Central Bank in the beginning, after the market shows signs of need for interference, then the Central Bank would buy the dollars once they become plentiful on the market. This system is in effect in a number of foreign countries, and it does not represent any departure from reality for them."

$1 BILLION UNDER ERROR-AND-OMISSIONS-EXCEPTED ITEM
Commenting on the visit paid to Egypt by the German Minister of Economy in the last few days, Dr. Sayed Al-Baz of Al-Ahram writes an article on page 10, some excerpts of which run to the following effect:
We, then, concentrated on his statements on investment opportunities in Egypt and that the Egyptian economy provides attractive opportunities for foreign investors, thus leaving the real motive behind the visit without discussion or preparation, which led to our failure to turn the visit into a breakthrough with positive consequences. Here are some of the visit's reasons:
Unfortunately, the European offer hardly included any items that would give Egyptian agricultural control access to Europe, for instance.
Can this way of running conflicts work out?
1-Strawberries quota 500 tons per year Feddan yield average 20 tons=25 feddans.
6-Lettice quota 500 tons per year feddan yield average 20 tons=25 feddans.
Only two commodities, namely potatoes and rose remain.
I'm not against the agreement but I think we could have obtained much better advantages than those we got. Seriously enough, after the implementation of the agreement in June, they will discover the truth and will lose credibility in us, so why is that deception?
The European Union has recently endorsed the programme of grants to be offered to Egypt in the two years 2005-2006 to the value of 243 million euros.

A diplomatic source said that deputy trade minister's coming visit will concentrate on the economic developments in the region and Northwest Gulf of Suez project.

Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Kamal Al-Shazli denied any government intention to increase petrol prices during the coming period.
If we go back to a fundamental issue understanding that kind of violence, i.e the motives and objective circumstances that encourage and support that violence, we believe that political stalemate and oppression together with corruption and targeting of religious manifestations have created the so-called 'internal violence'. External oppression represented in targeting Islam and Muslims by foreign powers, however, caused 'overseas violence'.
In this atmosphere, unprecedented "levels" of wrath against the Hebrew State and the United States were formed in support of this violence.
So, it is not plausible any more to leave 100,000 US soldiers occupy Iraq and other Arab countries and search for other distant targets, particularly as the situation in Iraq has become similar to that in Afghanistan after the US occupation.
Opposition to these attacks was apparent.
Unfortunately, they were legitimate targets for that overseas violence though they are non-combatants. Their governments were surely hostile to us, but this is no justification to shed their blood.
We should differentiate in that regard between the Palestinian, Iraqi and Afghani cases as direct confrontation cases with Israeli and American occupation forces and the previously mentioned ones. Attacks on our direct enemies, namely US and Israeli occupation forces, are more effective to the nation than attacks on overseas enemies.
a- A covenant between Arab leaders.
The developments in Iraq come fifth, while the sixth through the ninth items include outstanding issues like Iran's occupation of the three Arab islands of Big Tunb, Small Tunb and Abu-Moussa in the Arabian Gulf which belong to the United Arab Emirates, the strict measures to which Libya is exposed due to the dispute over Lockerbie case, supporting peace, development and unity in Sudan and solidarity with and support of Somalia.

Tagamo'h Party held the American Administration responsible for the Israeli brutalities and daily massacres committed by Sharon against the Palestinian people due to the American Administration's support of the bloody suppression policy practised by the Israeli Premier as well as its premeditated obstruction of a just and comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
He also called on Palestinians to affirm their unity and not to give up their arms as it is the only way to stand against the enemy.
By persistently supporting Zionists politically and militarily, America is to blame for chaos in the region, it said, calling on those Arab countries which have relations with Israel to sever such ties and expel its ambassadors and diplomats from their land.
The party also decided to form a delegation comprising the party key leaderships to visit the Palestinian embassy in Cairo in support of the struggle of the Palestinian people and to denounce Sharon's crime and offer condolences for the assassination of Sheikh Yassin.
Israel tried to assassinate him last June.
Ismail Haneya; Manager of Sheikh Yassin Office.
PRESS SYNDICATE: ISRAELI NATURE IS BRUTAL
YASSIN'S MESSAGE TO TUNISIA SUMMIT
He, furthermore, asked them to clarify their attitude towards Jihad in the occupied territories. Yassin said, "Jihad in Palestine is a legitimate right of the Palestinian people and an individual obligation of every Muslim. Describing Jihad as terrorism is a big injustice rejected by our Palestinian people and Arab and Muslim peoples.
Moreover, he asked them to extend all forms of support to the sisterly Iraq so as to be liberated from the US occupation as backing the Iraqi is a kind of support to the Palestinian people and causes..
He laid it bare that he had talked with officials in Washington and that he thought that they were surprised by the operation. "Israel seeks the opportunity of America's preoccupation with elections to commit such acts regardless of their consequences which we fear."
At the popular level, thousands of undergraduates took part in demonstrations condemning the operation in most of the Egyptian universities.
Q: Have there been any contacts at Hamas leadership to probe the question of its founder, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin's successorship?
Sheikh Yassin's departure, in that regard is quite a loss, but Hamas has always been up to it as it has never failed to offer vanguards of its leaders as strugglers and martyrdom seekers.
Q: It has been said that resistance entered a new stage after Sheikh Yassin's assassination?
Q: Hamas was committed to not extending the battle abroad and there has been a recent keenness on not targeting civilians and sometimes restricting operations to 1967 lands. Will there be any changes in these three principles?
To my mind, the crime of assassinating Sheikh Ahmed Yassin would urge strugglers on the Palestinian lands to rush in every direction in search of new mechanisms to develop resistance with all its open options provided that they are kept inside Palestine whether on 1967 or 1998 lands.
If the enemy has targeted our leadership and symbols and even a big symbol of the weight of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the resistance has a right to returns in kind.
Q: It is believed that Sheikh Ahmed Yassin represented a moderate trend and a point of convergence where divergent views met. How would Sheikh Yassin's absence reflect on the movement?
It is by no means easy to make up for the loss of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin on Hamas level or even the Palestinian or Arab level, but on the movement's leadership level, there is no place for worries as we are an institutional movement governed by a system, platform, regulations, controls and democratic advisory institutions. We are, after all, governed by a spirit of faith and brotherliness, unselfishness, coordination and cooperation.
Secondly, he wanted to restore balance to his political position in his government which has recently undergone some weakness due to objections from the right and the Likud hawks to his programme whether regarding disengagement or unilateral withdrawal from Gaza.
A: It is not timely yet to talk about them, but our people, through its awareness knows them and their practices. Our people well knows the plans that are being fomented and realizes the weight of the responsibility it has to assume.
We have been monitoring the details of the scheme prepared by Sharon backed by the American Administration.
Under this headline, Khalid Al Haroub, a Palestinian writer and researcher in Cambridge writes an article, some excerpts of which run to the following effect: At human, ethical, political, strategic and security levels, the crime of the assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin is insanity par excellence.
He is, on the contrary, an easy target that is quite accessible. His daily routine and schedule including his prayers times are quite known.
Due to his insight and realistic approach, he realized that Hamas military actions were not an end in themselves without a ceiling but rather a military and political practice that have an end to achieve.
A single decision or word to that effect simply meant that Hamas would abide by what he said.
By killing him, therefore, it actually courted an uncontrollable wave of such operations.
The preservation of Hamas as a unified movement was more than just a necessity or something that could be boasted of as it was immediately to the interest of the national project in toto. A unified Hamas under the late pundit was the safety valve which strictly and firmly controlled any wild trends towards an internecine Palestinian civil war which was often on the brink of breaking out.
The new leadership is primarily expected to control the movement's military wing, which may go wild or get angry at any jerks in the political atmosphere.
The importance of that line increases due to Sharon's unclear scheme to withdraw from Gaza.
Then, the Palestinian situation would be dominated by a state of "slaughtering" as there would be wild military groups that would plan and implement military operations irrespective of any political agenda or goals.
In any case when the military wing runs amok or breaks away from the control of the political authority, it means the absence of centralized control.
"MODERATION" ASSASSINATION FORCES PNA, EGYPT AND JORDAN INTO CORNER
In this context, Hamas also complied with pressure and political moves aimed to stop bloodshed and push forward political talks.
He also immediately cancelled a visit by an Egyptian parliamentary delegation to Israel to take part in the Kneseet's celebrations of the 25th anniversary of the Camp David peace treaty with Egypt.
He also killed two birds with one stone: impeding efforts by the EU, mainly Britain, to restructure Palestinian security organs (the Israeli request originally) and what Israel called "attempts to internationalize the conflict" to maintain "disputed land" in lieu of "occupied land" and stop international pressure. This was openly voiced by Sharon in his comments on motives for "disengagement" and its other face of pullout of Gaza Strip.
Most Arab countries considered the assassination of Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin a brutal, terrorist and cowardly act and which would foil all peace efforts.
"It is a heinous crime," he said. About four thousand Palestinians staged a march in Al-Yarmouk refugee camp (south Damascus) calling for revenge.
"Israel's announcement that its Prime Minister Ariel Sharon supervised the operation is a proof of the nature of the Israeli government, its prime minister, its terrorism and assassination practices," Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Al-Hariri said.
Gulf Cooperation Council The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) considered the assassination of Sheikh Yassin "a crime". Kuwaiti Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah condemned the assassination of Sheikh Yassin and called on the Quartet Committee member states to step in and put an end to that situation.
Sultanate of Oman denounced the assassination of Sheikh Yassin.
Shiite leader Muqtada Al-Sadr said the liquidation of Yassin was a "criminal" act and "aggression". Head of the Sunni Scholars Organization Sheikh Hareth Al-Dhari also denounced the operation saying, "It will ignite wrath of the Palestinian people and push them to keep steadfast."
"It is an Israeli escalation that is considered another Israeli crime against the Palestinian people that violates all traditions and covenants," Jordanian Prime Minister Faisal Al-Fayez said in a statement.

HAMAS, A CLANDESTINE POLITICAL MOVEMENT GOVERNED BY A SHURA COUNCIL
Hamas is a secret jihad movement in every sense of the word. It is part of the Islamic renaissance movement. It believes that renaissance is the main way for liberating Palestine from the river to the sea.
The politburo of the movement, which is elected from among the Shura council members, is designed to run the movement affairs in compliance with a program set by the Shura council. Owing to occupation and difficulty in contacting, there are territorial Shura councils in Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
Mash'al's term in office was to end this year, but it was renewed two days ago owing to the difficult conditions that forestalled the Shura council convention.
"We are praying that God may help and bless Dr. Al-Rantissi as well as all our brethren. We also pledge to our people and nation to remain loyal to the martyred Sheikh (Yassin) and all our martyrs and to stick to our national unity in the face of the Zionist enemy," Mash'al noted.

He added that that approach represented the cornerstone of Egyptian foreign policy and that Egypt was the first to call for cooperation and dialogue between Europe and Mediterranean countries known as Barcelona operation with a view to promoting cooperation.
He went on to say that such concepts were simply ignored when it came to the Palestinian issue.
THOUGH DEAD, SHEIKH YASSIN DOMINATES THE ARAB SUMMIT
The Palestinian resistance factions have nothing to do with terrorism organizations such as Al-Qaeda or others that kill and terrify innocents even from Islamic and Arab countries from which most of such organizations emerged.
The Arab masses' wrath will, of course, impose itself on the summit and will have priority over any other issues on the expanded, bilateral, trilateral or even quadruple meetings of the Arab kings and presidents.
Dr. Al-Baz warned that Arab countries would be an easy prey for all unless they stand united in the face of all hazards in the region.

In the study prepared by the Commercial Representation on the household linen market in the US the Ministry added that some Egyptian yarns are qualified for producing fine types of linen to achieve value added higher than that achieved by selling Egyptian yarn. The study added that it was necessary that such an increase in household linen exports should coincide with the growth of ready made clothes exports for a number of reasons in the forefront of which is the fact that most Egyptian ready made clothes exports to the USA, made from cotton and yarn mostly imported from abroad, while Egyptian exports of household linen came and could be increased from Egyptian cotton and yarn.
The Cabinet's Privatization Committee decided during its meeting under Prime Minister Atef Ebeid on Monday that 64 state-owned strategic staple companies should not be sold off.

EGYPT LOSES LE400 MILLION POUNDS DUE TO COMESA
Producers and businessmen called for adoption of barter deals between Egypt and the COMESA.

The steps demanded by the US included that tariffs on clothes should meet with requirements of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and that leaderships should voice their rejection of the calls for boycotting American products and they should say that these calls will do harm to the Egyptian interests. The US demands also included taking certain steps towards the intellectual property rights, the development of customs system, and persevering good relations with Israel.

ESTABLISHMENT OF EGYPTIAN-IRANIAN PROJECTS CONSIDERED
The Egyptian side has already started to compile a list of projects and fields that will be given priority in cooperation with the Iranian side, including communications, petrochemicals, cars, yarn and textile spheres, he added.
The Iranian side asked its Egyptian counterpart to supply it with lists and information related to exports and imports in the fields of carpets, ceramics, petrochemicals, car spare parts and foodstuffs. It also paid attention to cementing tourist relations, Eshrah said, pointing out that the Iranians were less enthusiastic about most of the companies and projects put up for sale by the Egyptian government in the Investment and Privatization Conference.

NCHR PREPARES MEMO ASKING FOR ABROGATING EMERGENCY LAW
MAHER SLAMS ISRAEL FOR DETERMINATION TO IMPAIR PEACE
Maher criticized the behaviour of the Israeli government which not only resorts to assassination, but also declares its intent to forge ahead with such assassinations, to the extent that it had a previously prepared list of assassination targets. "I cannot find a description of such an act." Maher said.
Egypt had cancelled its participation in the ceremonies of the Knesset owing to the assassination of Sheikh Yassin, which might also abrogate the possibility of returning of the Egyptian ambassador to Israel, who was recalled three and a half gears ago in protest against the violence against the Palestinians.
EGYPTIAN DEMAND TO EXPEL ISRAELI AMBASSADOR
The Islamic bloc deputies named many demands to be referred to the PA, mainly including reconsidering the Egyptian-Israeli peace accord and expelling the Israeli ambassador in 72 hours' time.
Such a facelift is backed by Mair Daghan, a former officer in the Israeli army who had been selected for this difficult task by Israeli Premier, Ariel Sharon.
He received his education in Israel and was promoted in army ranks till he became general.
Daghan spent a long time studying the Mossad record and found out that it had reached a stage of flabbiness and bureaucracy especially in the last two decades of the last century although it had been known for its great endeavours in protecting the Jews in the former Soviet Union countries and carrying out secret operations to deport the Jews from Arab countries or the Soviet Union countries to Israel as well as pursuing and liquidating Palestinian officials in Europe, as happened in Cyprus, France, and Belgium and also harassing, pursuing and liquidating the Arab atomic experts or the foreigners who cooperate with them.
We'll turn Hizbullah life into such a hell they will repent ever carrying Klashinkovs.
Egypt showed willingness to do that stipulating four conditions - a continued American backing of the project, an Israeli pledge with American guarantees to stop assassination operations against Palestinians from all parties and factions, refrainment from any military actions in retaliation to any supposed military operations against it and the Palestinians unification of their security bodies and agreement to an actual and permanent ceasefire and Israel's raising of the blockade imposed on the Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.
Within the framework of the initial implementation of the British-Palestinian security plan, British sources said that London succeeded in establishing an "room of operations" in Ramallah with a view to putting into effect one out of four Israeli demands to regain confidence in the Palestinians as a prelude to resuming negotiations.
On another level, Egyptian efforts are active in cooperation with Britain in order to unify Palestinian security bodies, as an Egyptian delegation will arrive at Gaza Strip to rehabilitate and unify the security bodies. Cairo also is preparing for hosting a dialogue including Palestinian factions to be held soon.
Six agents of the Israeli Mossad intelligence agency were killed in a long-range machinegun attack on the secret office of the Mossad in the Iraqi city of Kirkuk on Saturday. The Mossad's secret office works in Iraq under the guise of a company called the Al-Rafedein Export Company.
During that lethargy and loss, the Arabs order resigned to a hellish game that would eventually exterminate it.
The only asset they may be credited with is in the fact that they might be the "aliens" to whom bloody bombings are attributed, a mere pretext, peg, or ploy to evade recognition of local "terrorist" reality.
Anyhow, this is nothing new as significant stages in that process have already been achieved at the military level so much so that only the political level needs now to be moulded.
Throughout the last couple of years, before and after the war, the world was shocked at the degenerate condition of the Arab world or rather the vindictive American campaign was targeted on it on the first place. However, it remained inactive.
The war broke out and a big Arab country - Iraq - was occupied and yet no urgent summit or even a consultation meeting was deemed necessary.
It has become known that essential differences came to the surface.

They will also probe the possibility of establishing a business company, through which they might cooperate to find export outlets to some Egyptian exports on South Korean and international markets.
There is a good opportunity before some Egyptian commodities to have access to the Korean market. The South Korean market could accommodate such commodities which include ceramics, marble, carpet, cotton, rice, phosphates, fertilizers, chemicals, yarn and textiles and some foodstuffs.
The S.Korean-Egyptian cooperation in this field would boost Egypt's exports to S. Korea, encourage demand on national products and take personnel performance levels to new hights, he said, noting that an advanced information center was set up and a number of Egyptian personnel were trained in S.KKorea in a way that could streamline work and benefit both producers and consumers.
Sales remarkably retreated because people have a shortage of cash liquidity although gold prices plummeted to a great extent recently due to a drop of the dollar rate of exchange on the black market. The state of recession led to the closure of more than 30 percent of gold factories in Egypt. About 50 percent of gold workshops also closed down due to inability to continue on the market where there are much expenses and retreat of sales and profits. Estimates point out that the Egyptian gold market usually witnesses a boom by 30 percent in the summer due to gifts given to successful students and marriage occasions and the rise in the number of Arab tourists.
"70 percent of gold workshops closed down due to market stagnation. There are almost no sales nowadays, perhaps due to exams," Secretary of the Division of Precious Metals and Stones Salah Abdel-Hadi said. "Current economic conditions have, definitely, affected the market to a great extent. Contrary to what used to take place in the past, many brides content themselves with token jewellry," Abdel-Hadi added.
Egypt is totally committed to the obligations of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Chairman of the Egyptian Customs Department Mahfouz Aragawi said.

FORECASTS: AUTO SALES DOWN BY 10% AFTER 3-8.5% DUTIES
Meanwhile, Secretary-General of AMA Salah Al-Hadari said," The AMA backs regulation of State's public resources, but we should first study alternatives carefully so that these alternatives would not have adverse effects. Auto sales could go down, consequently, taking down State's public resources even after the new increase." The present customs duties are already high. The rates are set, depending on the car's engine capacity, as follows:
Auto sales hit in 2003 about 52,000 cars, 32500 of which were locally produced and 19,000 were imported. 88% of the cars bought or sold on the market were with engine capacities of 1,300-1,600 cc.
Deputy head of Auto Traders Department, Mohsin Talai emphasized that the new increase in duties on car sales amounting to 8.5% in some cases had struck markets with paralysis.
Talai expected that the car imports customs revenues would not rise due to a decline in car imports in the coming period. He warned that such an increase in car prices as a June 1st would lead to delay of the production capacity of domestic factories and threaten importers and investors in the field of car trade with bankruptcy.
This came during the minister's meeting with members of the Egyptian-Canadian Business Council under Mo'taz Raslan.
GERMAN ECONOMY MINISTER: LIBERALIZATION OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE & OIL PRICE RISE DECREASED EXPORTS TO EGYPT
A: I've come to Cairo to cement relations between the two countries in trade and investment fields. The delegation includes 70 businessmen seeking investment opportunities in Egypt. Vistas of boosting trade exchange between Egypt and Germany are possibly huge and have not reached their peak so far, especially in light of the unity of political and economic vision between the two countries and good Egyptian-German relations. Germany is Egypt's second biggest economic partner after the United States.
Some German businessmen set up small-sized projects in Egypt and exploited the opportunities offered by the Egyptian government and I think that this would serve the two parties.
Q: In your opinion, how can Egypt-Germany balance of trade deficit be redressed?
We have excellent relations with many Arab countries including Egypt. As for Egypt's exports to the EU, the joining of such countries to the EU will give more export opportunities in many fields. I say you should seize this opportunity, as the European market includes 450 million consumers. Germany can be Egypt's dependable partner in this regard.
A: Germany is launching fresh trade agreements and technical, educational and industrial assistance. There are many axes supported by Germany whether in its relation with Egypt or with the rest of the region countries. Cooperation is not confined to economic fields, and trade and investment exchange, but also includes aid programmes including financial and technical cooperation and spreading vocational education such as Mubarak-Kohl initiative.
The price of such lands will be paid in installments over five years provided that cooperative housing societies should start building and such societies' members should obtain housing units in the coming two years. The state will shoulder 50% of the cost of the detailed design (of the units) as well as the design of utilities, he said.
On the other hand, real estate experts made conservation on the standard of utilities in the lands that are put up for sale by the government as well as their prices and conditions of ownership. They explained that such lands had become a target for speculations and that they had not been invested as a tool of energizing the real estate market. "Most of the state-owned lands that are put up for sale within the current projects and expansions are divided into large spaces that can only be bought by certain category," said Director of Al-Ahli Real Estate Investment Company Sayed Qamar.
In addition to the region's issues, the peace process, the issues of Iraq, Sudan and anti-terrorism, the meeting is expected to deal with bilateral relations such as economic cooperation, trade exchange, American grants and aid.
Al-Sherif pointed out a series of steps like the foundation of the National Council for Human Rights, the cancellation of state security courts and the citizenship rights and democracy paper in the party's first annual congress last year.
Since the Greater Middle East project was announced, Egyptian press and mass media have not stopped launching sharp criticisms at the American Administration. The American President has often been targeted by national newspapers' caricaturists on an almost daily basis.
POSSIBILITY OF NATIONAL DIALOGUE CONFERENCE IS UNLIKELY
Tagamo'h said that its ideas were not preconditions.
The amendment of the constitution is considered the main bone of contention, as the NDP agreed through the bilateral meetings with the leaders of such parties that this issue would not be discussed because the timing is improper.
Thus, we have to sit again and lay down a new agreement on Nile water distribution," Museveni added.
But this selfish stance on using the Nile water should come to an end," he added. Other Nile basin countries including Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda and Congo ask for modifying the agreement on the Nile water distribution.
Lugar underlined the necessity of letting the NATO take part in the security measures in the region. He, moreover, proposed that such ideas be mulled over in the NATO summit due in Turkey late next June.
AMERICAN "GUARANTEES" TO ISRAEL FOR NOT COMPELLING IT TO WITHDRAW TO 67 BORDERS

Egyptian parliament on Monday unanimously passed a motion to extend President Hosni Mubarak's mandate to make decisions that have the force of laws in the military production area.
For his part, Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Kamal al-Shazli said armament deals should be hammered out so speedily and confidentially so the mandate needs to be extended. Regional and global circumstances and daily changes require the country to be ready for any abrupt events. "Life among nations has become like a jungle, the means of which are claws and money." MP Dr. Hussein al-Sirfi said threats posed by Israel and its Premier Sharon on the Egyptian border in Rafah necessitates the extension of the mandate, which grants political leaders power to sign relevant deals.
However, they expressed hope that there would not be circumstances that require extending the mandate once more.
In a step described as the most important reform measure in Egypt recently, President Hosni Mubarak revoked a life sentence issued by a court-martial against a key Egyptian fundamentalist extradited by Sweden. Mubarak decided to have the defendant tried before another court.
Al-Zayat lauded the cancellation of the military ruling issued against Egeiza, saying it is the first time in the history of the Islamists' trial that a ruling is cancelled and an appeal is accepted.
According to the Egyptian law, court-martial rulings are unchallengeable and unappealable nor can they be re-examined before any other court.
He pointed out that some developed countries granted their governments monopolistic privileges in some activities.
For his part, head of the General Federation of Chambers of Commerce Khaled Abu-Ismail said the law aims at organizing the market, controlling the relations between all parties, raising efficiency of the market and protecting consumers and producers from groundless allegations, particularly in light of many loopholes in the market, mainly including manipulation of exchange rate.

Historian Dr. Yonan Labib Rizq said, "I can say that any country that turns into a gang loses, from the historical point of view, one of its most important constituents and, consequently, its survival and continuity.
"In my opinion, should the Palestinian factions stand united in the aftermath of assassinating that struggle symbol and deal a painful blow to Israel, then they would put the feet of the weakened Israel on the right path," he said.
By so doing, Israel violates all conceded legal and international conventions. What happened was a big political mistake that will lead to fatal consequences for the Israeli people themselves.
The study pointed out that the reason for such a phenomenon lies in drug taking on the part of the husband, his refusal to divorce his wife or keeping on picking quarrels with his in-laws. Some wives, furthermore, cannot put up with their husbands amorous relations with other women and therefore resort to violence. On the other hand, the Centre's consultant, Dr. Ahmed Al-Magdoub emphasized that family violence had turned into a phenomenon among all classes due to the disappearance of the language of dialogue in favour of the use of violence.

The space of a mosque should be more than 175 meters and should not be a subject to any disputes. Moreover, it was stipulated that anyone who donates a plot of land to build a mosque on must bear the cost of engineering designs and layout to be prepared by the ministry. He must also deposit 50,000 pounds with a bank for the establishment of the mosque to prove that he is serious.
"They are unjust conditions, particularly with respect to compelling donors to deposit 50,000 pounds and build a two-storey mosque," they added.
The sources uncovered that the council's next meeting due on April, 6th this year might witness some tension between the council members because some of them objected to announcing things which were still under consideration without having them referred to a council meeting for discussion.

BANKERS CALL FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF "HOLDING COMPANY FOR BANK INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT"
The bankers stressed the importance of setting up such a company in order to follow up the implementation of financial and technical reforms of banks and help implement privatization and merger programmes between banks. They underlined the necessity of setting out its function and legal status, especially in case of a relevant decision by the Prime Minister.

North American markets came third in terms of increase rates of 38% due to the increase in exports to the USA by 40%, thus retaining the second place next to Italy in terms of the relative importance of exports on country levels then came Arab and East European countries markets to occupy fourth place at an increase rate of 23% an finally came the Asian market with 3% only hitting $939 million against about $915 million.
The officials and experts, who participated in the forum of "Exportation to and Penetration of External Markets" organized on 25 May by the National Planning Institute, warned of the consequences of concentrating Egyptian exports on conventional markets like the EU countries and the US. They pointed out an annual decline of 5-7% in Egyptian imports from these countries. They stressed the importance of boosting Egyptian exports to the Arab and African markets.
The number of its offices in Africa (51 countries) is 9 only. This needs reconsideration in order to rehabilitate this body technically so that it would be an addition to the export sector, he noted. Ezabi suggested expanding the range of "buyer-agent" companies system and giving it privileges and exemptions that would encourage setting up more companies in this field inside the Egyptian economic sector. He explained that that system managed to double ready-made clothes and textile exports to 2.9 billion pounds in 2000 versus 575.2 million pounds in 1990.
While such companies agreed to raise prices, Al-Mussawar learnt that Minister of Public Enterprise Sector Dr. Mokhtar Khattab received a report from head of the Holding Chemical Industries Company Adel Al-Mozi emphasizing that Suez, Tora and National Cement companies have not raised prices so far and that their prices were still ranging between 215 and 221 pounds per ton including taxes.
A thorough report inventorying the government's debts due to the government has been compiled.
The report also uncovered the presence of debtor and creditor bodies at the same time, foremost of which is the LE8.4-billion dues of Electricity and Energy Ministry on the state's administrative body (2.9 billion pounds), private sector companies (one billion pounds), public enterprise sector (2 billion pounds), public sector companies (160 million pounds), and economic bodies (2.2 billion pounds).
The committee has laid down the principles and proposals of radically solving the issue and rectifying banks' conditions and restructuring them. It also determined the annual return that will be earned by the owner who will handle the issue so as to be able to compare the returns to the costs. Means of repayment of the funds to be provided to solve such a problem, the value of the losses that will result from suspending interest on faltering debts as of the date of concluding the agreement would be assessed. The value of proposed return on bank reserves with the CBE will also be discussed. The agreements concluded with banks on the repayment of enterprise sector companies' debts should be highlighted.
Furthermore, agreement was reached between the public enterprise sector and electricity and energy on industrial consumption categories and their charges with a view to the interests of the two parties.
The debts also include 3.3 billion dollars to Japan, 11 billion dollars to EU countries, 1.4 billion dollars to Arab countries: 365 million dollars to Kuwait, 356 million dollars to Bahrain, 311 million dollars to Saudi Arabia, 143.9 million dollars to the United Arab Emirates, 4.8 billion dollars to international and regional institutions, 735 million dollars to state rightful bonds, and two billion dollars to other countries and institutions.
IN A FESTIVAL STARTING TOMORROW: 5 EGYPTIAN-EUROPEAN AGREEMENTS WORTH 221 MILLION EUROS TO BE SIGNED
It consists of 5 components: customs evaluation, risk management system, auditing and control after customs release and setting internal and external communication channels. The project has been designed in coordination with the projects of other donor bodies especially the project executed by the USAID known as assisting customs and facilitating trade. The Ministry of Finance especially the Customs Department is considered the top beneficiary of that project.
It contains an item related to supporting the abilities of non-governmental organizations.

He added that there were about 5 programmes for reforming income tax as well as the sales tax and real estate and customs taxes.
In customs, a new bill has been prepared with a view to streamlining customs procedures, reform management and facilitating dealing with customs.

The new leader of Hamas Dr. Abdel-Aziz Al-Rantissi threatened Israel with due "reprisal" for assassinating the movement founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin last Monday in Gaza.
He described Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon as "the world's biggest terrorist". He also described American President George W. Bush as "enemy of God and Muslims".
Al-Rantissi, who was elected Hamas chief by the Student Union Council members on behalf of the University students, said, "Constants never change. I swear we will not surrender and will not accept Zionist existence on our dear land of Palestine." They (Jews) will not enjoy security on our land and we will cede neither Jerusalem nor the right of refugees to return, he said, adding, "We will not forget those who are now in prison," in reference to the Palestinian captives and detainees.
He said the delay of the Arab summit came to the Palestinian people's disappointment.
BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN SHEIKH YASSIN AND ISRAEL
A lot is heard about America's power and some either willfully or in good will advise us to submit to it of our own accord instead of being forced to yield through bombs and shells.
It is faith which was to invest Sheikh Ahmed Yassin with such power that was in contrast with his wheelchair.
QUARTER OF PALESTINIAN CHILDREN WANT TO BECOME "MARTYRS"
The survey was carried out after the number of Palestinian girls who carried out martyrdom operations had increased.
According to Abdel-Shafi, the worst thing is that Palestinian children come under direct violence, witnessing scenes of killing, injuring and funeral processions. They also see fears and concern in the eyes of their parents and teachers.
The following are reasons for this situation:
- 62 percent of children watched family members wounded or killed.
It seems that Israel does not miss a chance to exploit the repercussions of the war on Iraq with a view to gaining as much benefits as possible in different fields.
The Israeli Intelligence Investigations into the double martyrdom attack on Ashdod Port concluded that "Hizbullah" was the financer of the operation after it had participated in choosing the target, said a military commentator with the Hebrew Haaretz daily, adding that Hizbullah elements were in contact with Hamas activists in Gaza Strip which, along with Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, the military wing of Fatah, claimed responsibility for the attack.
Israel on Sunday considered that the postponement of the Arab League (AL) summit supposed to be held in Tunis on March 29-30 was a positive indication that the Arab world is changing, while a Palestinian official opined that it would be conducive to escalated Israeli aggressions. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) called on the Arab leaders to "rise to the level of challenges and provide cohesion with their peoples."
"There is no need for the Arab League.
Rantessi told reporters at the Islamic University in Gaza that the delay decision was regrettable, hoping that the nation would get elevated to the level of challenges.
He went on to say: "President Arafat accepted and inked the document, while Syria voiced reservations about it. However, it (Syria) was optimistic that such disagreement can be resolved."
Every Palestinian official I met has given his reason for the visit to London but I usually have no credulity for any official talk and even hold the opposite argument as nearer to the truth!
However, Sharon is as much a war criminal as a killer and Sheikh Yassin's assassination has several reasons including Sharon's attempt to undermine the new attempt or rather nip it in the bud.
The British will act as a liaison channel with the USA and have promised, therefore, to help Palestinian security forces through training and providing them with some equipment to rehabilitate those forces after the damage done to them by Sharon.
While Sharon did not lose hope in a Palestinian civil war outbreak in Gaza Strip, I personally think that such a war is very unlikely to take place.
SUMMIT FOR THE US SAKE
The reality of Arab fragmentation has become stronger than the will of unity and solidarity. Each country now arranges its relations with the Arab body in light of its own relations with the US.
This delayed reform and development, however, was untimely, as the US declared its plan for "reform" which includes an agenda that aims at dismantling this bloc.
Definitely, the Arab commitments would remain subject to accountability as long as it is a response to Washington. As regards the Arab League reform, no one would be brought to book or blamed for failure to meet his commitment to it.
An official source with Hamas told Asharq Al-Awsat on the telephone that the movement did not intend to replace the official Palestinian delegation.
NATO Supreme Commander in Europe, General Jim Jones said that Morocco had suggested that its military bases be used by Washington for training. He pointed out that the American forces training usually takes place in Tunisia.
Before Gaddafi stepped to power, Libya was a base for strategic command bombers of the American air force.
The American Command in Europe, which supervises operations in Africa, considers performing constant operations for the American military forces in camps and maintenance airports.
We can detect signals about their movement in that direction.
NATO officials met with African military commanders in Brussels last week within the framework of the efforts to promote coordination with African countries in terrorism combating.
The magazine also quoted a White House official source as saying that General John Abi Zeid had started implementing Operation Spring under his command and supervision to pursue Al-Qaeda leader, Osama Bin Laden and his aide Ayman Al-Zawahri on the borders between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Head of the Iraqi Industries Federation Qais Al-Khafaji said, "Our brethren, especially Gulfites, should move to buy such companies in lieu of foreigners and in cooperation with their Iraqi brethren. Privatization will be carried out once the Iraqis take over power."
The Iraqi Federation put 35 industrial projects or companies for hire and Arab and foreign companies purchased 260 businesses, he said.
During preparations for invading Iraq last year, the American army constructed about 120 operation bases on the Iraqi-Kuwaiti borders. Then came hundreds of military bases which were set up for military operations and the provisional bases which were supposed to continue for 6 or 12 months for tactical and logistic operations like catering for American soldiers' needs.
There are also plans for constructing and upgrading airports in Baghdad and Mosul and reconstructing about 120 kilometers of roads in the main highway of the American occupation forces northwards.
A military plan designer in the Pentagon said that it was a big aim.
Iraqi scientists received Israeli offers to work in Tel Aviv, she said, adding that foreign mediators worked hard to drain Iraq of the know-how.
Moreover, she added, some released professors acknowledged that investigations mainly focused on the alleged weapons of mass destruction (WMD) file.
She also hinted at certain quarters making some "reservations about organizing lectures and activities on the Zionist terrorism".
Iraq plans to launch railway lines linking it to Europe via Karkuk-Arbiel railway line, giving access to Mediterranean seaports through developing Kaim-Dir Zor railway line in Syria, opening horizons in the east and linking Iraq to the Iranian railway network.
Another agreement was also reached on exporting 25,000 tons of Syrian wheat to Iraq out of a total of 50,000 tons via the aforementioned line.
As for linking Iraq to Europe, he uncovered a new railway line running from Baghdad to north Karkuk, Arbiel and then Mosul towards Dahuk as far as the Turkish-European network. The line will be 500 km long and cost 1.4 billion U.S. dollars.
ROBOT CAMEL RIDER IN QATAR
Al-Dousri added that the new robot will be used in future races in order to convince camel owners of its importance. The experiment has succeeded by more than 50%. The audience welcomed it, though they were shocked when they saw it for the first time.
This is the first time Credite Agricole Bank issues a payment card in Egypt. There have been preparations for this step over the last two years, during which the bank got assured that the new card would be able to resist forgery and save and exchange information digitally. It also got assured that the special data in the card is coded and carries a password, which is considered one of the distinguished qualities of that card.
As for the foreign debt, the report pointed out that the medium and long-term debts represent 94.1% of the total foreign debts, while the short-term debts represent 5.9% of the total foreign debt and 11.9% of the net foreign countries reserves. The report confirmed that the government foreign debt represents 64.9% of the total public foreign debts and 26% of GDP.
In a report on housing and urbanization in Egypt the Housing Committee emphasized the necessity of encouraging banks to participate in the construction of real estate financing companies and encouraging insurance companies to undertake that job and not be content with its role in insurance coverage alone, thus increasing the number of existent financing companies to meet the citizens' needs.
The Housing Committee emphasized the necessity of reducing the ceiling of financing offered to each investor in the first stage to broaden the base of beneficiaries and reduce the burden of financing and minimize risks.
During discussions on the relation between the Authority and investors in the field of allocation of lands to set up investment projects or buildings, the deputies pointed out that the Authority had caused the waste of public funds through pumping LE3.3 billion into the new cities while occupancy rate there did not exceed 1% due to the Authority's policy.
He demanded that the Authority's statutes be altered so that it would be committed to paying homage to private ownership rights emphasizing that the withdrawal of plots of land from investors after allocation was violation of construction provisions. Deputy Mohamed Al Beyali announced that the withdrawal of plots of land from owners after they paid off their prices was an obvious violation of the Constitution provisions and private ownership sanctity.
The government says that it should impose fresh taxes in order to meet the needs of the growing population, while it winks, on the other hand, at the government's increasing expenditure and excludes licences of yachts, private planes, chalets and palaces in the Northern Coast, Hurghada and Sharm El-Sheikh from any additional taxes.
Although the low-income categories will pay for the government failure, the per capita share of service allocations in the new budget does not exceed 645 pounds annually, i.e. 53.07 pounds monthly or 179 piasters per day!!
Is such a tax the other side of a deal between the government and the two mobile phone companies as per which the government backpedaled on entering the market with a third mobile company in return for a handful of money?
The problem lies in the fact that the recipients of such allowance are not, necessarily, the taxpayers, as the allowance is confined to civil servants, according to Prof. of Sociopolitics Hoda Zakaria. Thus, the state gives a very limited category amounting, perhaps, to 2-3 million civil servants the right to collect taxes from 20 million citizens. It is a game of corruption when taxes are imposed on the majority rather than the wealthy.
Egypt's economy has witnessed recently a remarkable development after the success of the economic reform programme, which is a model to be followed by other regional countries, which have already implemented reform programmes, whose elements are mostly taken from the Egyptian programme, he said, pointing out that Egypt managed in the last phases of the reform programme to absorb many social crises, which usually coincide with such programmes, thus making Egyptian programme different and distinguished.
The agreement provided for cooperation between the NBE and Qatari CB to sell the NBG's quotas in petroleum projects to the Egyptians and investors in Qatar and promote selling the Egyptians and Arabs in Qatar the assets that devolved to the NBE. The agreement extends to cover cooperation in the implementation of the internet banking system and cooperation in the field of collecting the savings of Egyptian expatriates in Qatar and selling banking products and services offered by the NBE to Egyptians in Qatar.
The volume of Egyptian exports to Qatar last year amounted to the equivalent of $19 million where as the volume of Qatari exports to Egypt in the same year hit $252 million!
EGYPT'S CEMENT EXPORTS UP 293.7%
HC said that the most important causes for such a rise in Egyptian cement exports is the attractive price evaluated in dollars in comparison with most international exporters.
The report mentioned that 10 agreements have organized economic and commercial relations between the two countries since the convention of the first joint supreme committee in 1989. These agreements include economic, technical, maritime and tourist agreements. They also include encouragement and protection of investment, double taxation and specifications. Moreover, there is the agreement of establishing the Egyptian-Algerian Business Council.
Egyptian frogs, pet birds, wild duckS, mammals, reptiles and insects became export commodities, said Minister of Agriculture Youssef Wali, adding that their exports hit 16 million dollars.
Total imports from the Russian Federation in 2003 hit some 2,231,966,000 pounds, while Egypt's exports hit some 183,323,000 pounds, said head of the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMS) Ahab Olwi.
Head of Egypt Air Trade Sector Mohamed Munir said that the company was considering raising air travel fares for international routes by a percentage ranging between 10 and 15% to follow the suit of other airlines.
This increase would be applied on travel tickets booked in Egypt rather than those booked abroad, he said.
The Egyptian auto market opened up to several types of cars after 1973 war following the "economic open-door policy". Before 1973, Egyptians were used to driving Italian Fiat and its Egyptian replica Nasr.
In Egypt, sales of Japanese Toyota produre of four-wheelers reached 250 cars annually, 12 to 14% of the four-wheeler market in Egypt. In Saudi Arabia, Toyota sales alone constitutes about 40% of the total market.
Asked whether the company has plans to produce four-wheelers locally, he said, "6 years ago, we presented a local production plan to Toyota but the project stopped for economic reasons. We are now studying the possibility of re-presenting the project and we expect a positive response this time". Eng.
There are many brands of those cars in Egypt, but only 3 makes are locally produced, as market figures show.
Four-wheelers of an engine capacity of 1800 cc is sold now, after the new rates, at LE339,000 while those of an engine capacity of 2,000 cc are sold at LE420,000 after the new rates.
We will also set up aservice center on Cairo-Alex highway before the end of this year."
The competitiveness of exports did not increase with the pound devaluation because 70% of production input is imported.
It sets standard specifications and conduct tests for products like water and drainage pipes.
Yasser Hussein, manager of a company specialized in this field, said the field of his work is related to importing raw materials, printing and packaging machines and supplying them to plastics plants in Egypt.
In order to preserve the quality of those industries, the government should encourage them and customs duties on imported raw materials should be cut down, he added. Atef Rizqallah, a factory manager, depends on export to Arab countries such as Jordan, Sudan and Libya. He points out the great development in the industry of pipes, pipe joints and accessories and water and drainage pipelines.
He points out that his company, which produces machines used in producing plastics, depends on exporting its production.
PM: POUND FLOTATION IRREVOCABLE
"There are factors that ensure stability, mainly including supply and demand.
"The competitive edge of Egyptian trade on international markets, particularly in South Europe, have benefited by pound floatation, which also positively affected imports that unrestrictedly flow into Egypt," Ebeid said, highlighting a 20% decline in imports.
As regards the Suez Canal and alternative Israeli projects, Ebeid added that those projects are mere dreams. "Let them dream on!
Chairman of Industries Federation Dr. Abdel-Muneim Seoudi said the federation would pay due attention over the coming period to the constituent structure of chambers of industry, reviewing the Industries Federation law, activating the sources of the chambers, increasing demand for Egyptian products inside and outside the country, meeting the needs of different industry sectors and activating the role of the federation through negotiations on industrial affairs.
As of next January, the present customs duties would be decreased from 80% to nil according to the Arab free trade zone agreement. This would threaten the Egyptian industries because of the big differential between the burdens borne by Egyptian industries, which range between 20% and 22% of taxes, charges and others, and their Arab counterparts which bear no tax burdens.
Head of the Chamber of Engineering Industries Nabil Farid Hassanein says many Egyptian industries are threatened with closure in case such agreements are put in place. Engineering industries would bear the brunt of harm because they are linked to small feeding industries. The latter would be unable to compete with their Arab counterparts, which receive privileges and support from their governments, whereas Egyptian industries are burdened with taxes and charges not to mention the tariff deformations.
The study, published by Okaz newspaper, said, "Late marriages have become a phenomenon between young women of high scientific certificates". The more women get higher degrees, the more spinsters there are.
The study, made by education associate professor Samir Qutb, Faculty of Education, revealed that polygamous fathers of educated girls tend to delay their daughters' marriage because they need their salaries. 35% of the girls polled refused to marry at an early age while studying, but they are now searching for spouses even if they were as old as their fathers, the study revealed.
Deputy chancellor of Assuit University Dr. Mohamed Abdel Salam Ashour, who doubles as head of the conference, said the US, which wages war against what it calls terrorism, practices a more ferocious terrorism by not abiding by environmental treaties and charters. Carbon dioxide emissions from the US industrial activities and means of transport constitute 25% of the world's emissions of that gas, which is the main cause of high temperatures and what is called "global warming" or the "greenhouse gas effect". The continuous high temperature levels would lead to grave catastrophes, the bulk of which is borne by poor countries, said Ashour. This would lead to melting snow in the two poles of the earth and raising the surface level of seas and oceans, thus flooding low areas in the world including deltas like Nile Delta and historical cities like Venice and Alexandria.
FIRST ARAB WATER COUNCIL ESTABLISHED
Under this heading, Al-Ahram deputy chief editor Salama Ahmed Salama writes a column on page 10, which runs to the following effect: In the aftermath of Israel's assassination of Palestinian struggler Sheikh Ahmed Yassin the Arab countries faced an insoluble problem - admitting to the fact that any confidence in the US ability or desire to achieve peace in the Middle East is sheer self-deception and distortion of the truth.
No longer is it questionable that America's anti-terrorism policy was per se a reverse policy to employ terrorism to serve its own purposes.
Those who criticize the Palestinian resistance and urge it to stop martyrdom operations are inciting it to commit suicide for the sake of the Israeli people's happiness rather than for the sake of the Palestinians.
The world is now facing a "sacred" alliance of the new terrorists - Bush and Sharon.
The third shortcoming is the fact that American illusions on Iraq's invasion have led to an inferno for the Iraqi people and the whole region so much so that the USA has turned into a paragon of all evils in the eye of Arab citizens who expect nothing good of it.
Instead of squaring up to the problem and bracing up courage and genuine patriotism to save the nation and its peoples who suffer from repression, defeat and loss, such attempts of escape took the form of counter-initiatives to turn the issue into an assumed national issue to rally the support of the peoples incapacitated by the authorities malaise so much so that they are no longer able to rise after their governments managed to bring them to knee and boast to the West that Arab peoples are just flocks of sheep in whose names all sins and vices are committed just as such vices are perpetrated in the name of freedom, justice and law. The matter was given the assumed form of confronting foreign intervention. In such a farce, paradigms used by Moses' Pharaoh were reiterated when, for instance, he tried to incite his people against that foreigner (Moses) who wanted to distract them from their "traditional thinking". When, however, the magicians realized the crux of the matter, faith versus disbelief, they were charged with great treason of the country which was then, just as it still is, the ruler himself.
The latest form of such attempts was the reduction of the reform issue to the Arab League reforms. They certainly know that reforming Arab countries would create an environment that is favourable to any regional organization while the proposed reform is tantamount to skipping well-known realities. It would be of no avail to create new bodies or to propose new sanctions while the Arab environment itself is poor.
However, no Arab ministers or rulers' proposals would be of any avail unless they admitted to the fact that it was the failure of political regimes after independence that tempted our enemies to lie in wait for us and that Israel's monstrosity was mainly brought about not by any inherent distinction on its part, but by the ineptness of Arab governments and their utter blindness to the reasons for such ineptness.
Efficient and capable elements, therefore, should be given the opportunity within a scheduled programme to remove corruption which reached the marrow, a fact denied by current governments and to submit solutions to crucial problems in the field of education, culture and economy and to restructure the state on modern sound bases so that public posts would be allocated only to those eligible for them.
The distinctive mark of such "Arab Unity" was using the Palestinian cause as a pretext not for solving the Palestinian cause or regaining the Palestinian people's rights, but to give Arab regimes a freehand to do whatever they want with their peoples to the extent of "scrapping" their very existence.
Such circumstances could help patch some holes in the "Arab Unity Umbrella" till the September 11th terrorist attacks caused too big a hole, for that statements, threats and even security intelligence exchange with the West, particularly the US, to patch.
Following what happened in Iraq, no regime would be changed by force, but matters may follow the same course of events as what happened in former Easter Europe and the Soviet Union.
This refers us to a reality, according to which Arab leaders work but refuse to publicly recognize: each and every country concentrates on its own interests and ignores joint interests.
Taking the Arab street turmoil as a pretext, some Arab officials dared to reject any reforms in the form of proposals from the US. However, the turmoil in the Arab street is attributed to various and different reasons, including the governments' failure to provide a decent life, dignity and future.
AMERICAN REPORT: SAUDI ARABIA, EGYPT, TURKEY WILL OBTAIN NUCLEAR ARMS IF MANUFACTURED BY IRAN
American observers say that Teheran thinks that it has a range of time that can be used for developing its nuclear program and decrease the level of the American reaction to this issue to a minimum.
According to these reports, the CIA expects the beginning of a large-scale campaign of detention in Iran. This campaign will target the leaderships of the Iranian reformist trend following the retreat of its weight after the elections.
The CIA expected Saudi Arabia to store its nuclear weaponry in Pakistan after it makes sure of its CSS-2 missiles ability to carry the produced nuclear heads. This might be attributed to the kingdom signing on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
PARLIAMENTARY CIRCLES EXPECT CANCELLATION OF EMERGENCY LAW
The sources pointed out that the tendency to cancel the emergency law, which has been in force for 23 years, might not necessitate the abrogation of some other strict measures such as the detention of some dangerous elements.
A workforce sample survey in 2003 pointed out that the joblessness rate among secondary education certificate holders was the highest hitting 69.2%, followed by university graduates, 21.05%; junior college graduates, 6%.
Meanwhile, Abu Zeid said that whenever the basin countries agree on something, hidden parties move to spark trouble and rumors.
SHURA COUNCIL CALLS FOR STOPPING PEGGING POUND TO DOLLAR
EGYPTIAN-UGANDAN TALKS OVER NILE WATER
Last Thursday, the Ugandan President stressed the necessity of redistributing the Nile water equally. However, he did not repeat calls voiced by Ugandan MPs to the effect that Egypt should pay Uganda for the extra quotas of the Nile stakes.
Egypt, the main beneficiary of the Nile resources, always avoids involvement in round-table negotiations with those three African countries, he added, accusing Egypt of adopting instead a "division strategy" preferring to deal and negotiate with each country separately.
The Shura (Advisory) Council warned on Saturday against having insurance and pension funds plundered.
The People's Assembly discussed last Tuesday five interpellations on the government's appropriation of insurance funds, thus threatening 25 million of beneficiaries of the pension system.

The report also urged the development of the efforts made to extract and process iron ore from Egyptian territories economically and smelt it in the companies which can cope with the smelting stage for the production of steel squares and to set up a company for collecting scrapped iron from all sectors in Egypt in order to reduce their prices domestically.
The deputies led by Aboul-Ezz Al-Hariri (Progressive Grouping Party) said that the committee on industry, following disputes, contented itself with the distribution of an incomplete 10-leaf report, whereas the original report consisted of 80 leaves.

GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT BANK ENTRY INTO REAL ESTATE ACTIVITY LEADS TO MARKET RECOVERY
Experts emphasize that the summer season will be a touchstone to measure how extensive such a recovery will be. In addition, what makes hopes even stronger is the fact that Egyptian expatriates' holidays are approaching. They are the main customer of summer, medium and posh housing units. Due to the state of living and economic instability, there is a tendency to search for valuable saving coffers like real estate, gold and various assets.
Such a return would also help to reduce interest rates and attract low-income brackets to the market. 3 days ago, the Egyptian government represented in the Minister of Finance, Dr. Midhat Hasanein announced the foundation of a fund for supporting real estate financing companies in cooperation with the National Investment Bank, the International Financing Institution and American Mani Mani Institution.
The People Assembly's Committee on Housing pointed out that 60% of the housing units built during the last 30 years were built illegally. Those housing units are called uncharted areas, which were not built to a plan.
The state as well does not make use of such units in levying taxes.
The committee had a set of proposals, but those of the finance minister and the premier were given predominance.
Firstly: assets yielding revenues which rise in value year after year.
The premier suggested 5 institutions and holding companies to be transferred to the Ministry of Insurance. These are institutions with value-increasing assets and reasonable profitability.
TRAVEL AGENCIES TO BEAR CHARGES OF RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT INSTEAD OF TOURISTS TILL LATE OCTOBER
The Egyptian tourist sector, including companies, hotels and facilities, should bear those charges so that the incoming tourism would not be negatively affected and in order to avoid the penalty clauses enshrined in the concluded contracts.
It was agreed that travel agencies would bear the charges till late October. This is the first initiative to be launched by an economic sector in Egypt in this regard.
Investors Society ascribed that to several obstacles facing those factories mainly including the customs tariffs and the instability of laws, regulations, rates of exchange, funding and bank problems especially interest rates and allocations.
Amin Mubarak decided to hold another meeting in a week's time to complete discussions and to call on head of Exports Development Bank, the governor of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) and heads of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones and Industries Federation to resolve the problem and lay down guarantees to ensure that no investment project would reach the danger stage or come to a standstill.
The establishment of the Arab Federation for Small-Sized projects is considered an important step towards economic integration among Arab countries and a new start of making use of Arab funds and squaring up to economic problems, Minister of Manpower and Immigration and head of the Arab Labour Organization Ahmed Al-Ammawi said.

AFRICA TO RECEIVE EGYPTIAN CONTRACTORS WITH OPEN ARMS
"Egypt, with all the experience at its disposal in several domains, can do much more.
"This includes the Democratic Republic of Congo, Africa's second largest and richest country, which has great natural wealth but has no roads to connect its east to its west. To go from the eastern part of Congo to the western, one has to travel for three and a half hours by plane. The country also needs many bridges, housing compounds and dams. Use could also be made of its wealth, in addition to that of Cameroon, particularly wood, which can be used in making furniture or to fill Egypt's needs instead of importing lumber from Europe that originally comes from the woods of Congo or Cameroon."
Egyptian and American sources denied the news reported yesterday that Egypt and America have signed an agreement on qualified industrial zones (QIZ).
The agreement would allow Egyptian exports access to American market under the American law, they said.
Studies conducted by the private sector say that those zones will provide about 350 thousand job opportunities and increase Egyptian exports to American market to 3 billion dollars in two years. Egypt has not taken any political decision yet regarding this issue owing to the bad conditions in Palestinian territories and Israeli aggressions on Gaza and Rafah, the sources said.
The government has recommended six industrial cities to be QIZ including the 10th Ramadan City, 6th October City, Obour City, 15th May City, Port Said City and Sadat City.
The first agreement includes providing 6 million euros over three years to fund the third stage of the trade enhancement program with a view to supporting customs reform, cutting the cost of setting up commercial and economic activities on local market, activating market performance and increasing competitiveness of Egyptian exports.
According to the third program, the European Commissioner would provide 18 million euros for supporting social development and civil society foundations. As for the fourth program, some two million euros would be provided to raise awareness among citizens and business community regarding the importance of the partnership agreement.
The new unit would consult and coordinate with other units at the ministries and governmental bodies concerned, said the minister. Implementation of the partnership agreement is carried out on two levels; the partnership council, which is a political council, and the partnership committee, which follows up implementation and coordination with different bodies in this regard.
Some MPs tried in vain to make the PA postpone accepting the resignation in view of Hassanein's frustration and his long history of patriotism since he was a university student. However, the resignation was accepted on the ground that Hassanein tendered it willingly.
He stressed that the Shura Council should have more competence so that it could play a better role. Its appointed members should also be reduced so that there will be better opportunity for the masses to express themselves, he added.
He accused the private sector of falling short of bearing responsibility regarding the problem of unemployment.
The minister put forward that proposal during the resumption of discussions of the population problem in Egypt by the PA Religious Affairs Committee. The committee hearings were attended by Islamic religion scholars.
She added that the elite culture in the field of family planning is not sufficient.
Speaking to Arab Affairs Committee with the People's Assembly on Wednesday, Egyptian Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Mahmoud Abu Zeid disclosed for the first time that a Libyan request to get a share of River Nile water was behind the recent water crisis in the Nile Basin countries. There are surely some foreign pressure on the Nile basin countries whether from Israel or other countries, Abu Zeid said.
We understood the apprehensions and concerns of the Nile basin countries and that is part of the solution, he concluded.
This task was entrusted one day after the Local Council members had agreed to name a main street of Sheikh Zayed neighbourhood in response to a proposal by a number of the council members and the government personalities.
The Israeli Maariv daily reported that the provisional Iraqi Governing Council (IGC) vowed to restore alleged fortunes left behind by Jews in Iraq to their Jewish owners, and to allow Iraqi Jews to return to Iraq, invest their money and set up projects there as of next June.
But, if the Iraqis restore it to them, it will be a good thing, he said. Knesset (parliament) member and former minister Ron Cohen, who had left Baghdad when he was only ten years old, ruled out that the IGC could return such huge fortunes. He proposed that all Iraqi Jews concede their fortune in Iraq in exchange for being allowed to get back to Iraq.
There are hundreds of terrorist Jews who have been planning to destroy the Holy Shrine of Aqsa Mosque with the aim of obstructing withdrawal, Chabak said, pointing out that it finds difficulty in reaching those terrorists.
Israeli Police Commissioner Shlomo Aharonishky called on Israelis on Monday to carry their licensed weapons during the Easter holidays that started from Monday and ends on next Monday in anticipation of any possible Palestinian bombing attacks against Israel.
During that period, vacations of personnel working in all security bodies will be cancelled except in some personal cases.
By the same token, the IAF will carry out military operations against certain areas, particularly in Gaza, Rafah, Nablus, Jenin and Bethlehem.
In an interview with Al-Hayat, head of the Planning Department at the General Authority for Operating Tigris Basin Projects, Khalid Shalash said that the danger of those plants lies in their obstruction of the river water and impeding the work of water pumps installed on the river branches in villages, as well as their consumption of huge amounts of water that reach one cubic meter of water daily per plant, thus wasting water wealth.
He expected that the amount of water coming to the Tigris Basin would stabilize the next summer because 67% of that river sources lay inside Iraq, which lands flexibility to control of the rate of the river course water in contrast to the Euphrates where the water rate would go down from 32 billion cubic meters to 8.25 billion cubic meters when the Turkish reed project is completed in 2006.
CONTINUATION OF SADR'S UPRISING PORTENDS SHIITE DIVISION
"Sadr trend in Baghdad accuses the IGC of intently marginalizing the trend, which is weighty among the Iraqi Shiite masses," spokesman for Sadr's office in Baghdad Abbas Al-Rabie told Al-Hayat.
For his part, member of the Muslim Scholars Organization's Shura (advisory) Council Sheikh Abdel-Jabbar Abdel-Sattar told Al-Hayat that the conflict of Shiite authorities in Najaf is possible, pointing out dialogue and good relation with Sadr.
The assassination of Hamas' leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin Gaza has opened fire on the American forces in Iraq.
Therefore, we won't be surprised if the coming days witness coordination between three fronts: the Iraqi resistance, Hizbullah and Hamas so that a confrontation of Israeli-American terrorism may be mounted on Arab lands.
Some flames might also reach some Arab regimes.
I say so on the occasion of the dreadful shock that terrified and disgusted many people who have watched the scenes of having some US soldiers and contractors mutilated and dragged to the ground in Falluja a few days ago by the agitated Iraqi masses, who did not content themselves with ambushing and killing the Americans.
The ordinary Americans might not know why their sons are treated in that way, even though they hear President George Bush Jr. and his hawks saying that their sons are doing an honourable and lofty mission to save the Iraqi people from the hands of chaos and dictatorship and that the US forces in Iraq spare no effort for forming a democratic model that would be copied in the Middle East.
The more sympathy and condemnation it arouses, the more evidence it presents to how deep the widening gap is between the Alliance Forces and the Iraqi people.
Strategic affairs analyst Riyadh Khawagy writes an article to the following effect: Studies, preparations and talks behind the scenes show that a new U.S.-formed Iraqi army will be a freak in view of equipment and force compared to the former army or other neighbouring countries' armies, including the Kuwaiti one.
The Kuwaiti army is composed of 40,000 troops (including reservists), the Jordanian army, 100,000 troops, the Iranian military, 400,000 (in addition to reservists), the Saudi army, 160,000, the Syrian army, 420,000 (in addition to reservists) and the Turkish army, 511,000.
According to American military commanders in Baghdad, such Sunnite armed groups are mostly composed of former Iraqi army troops, Baath Party supporters and extremist Islamic movements' activists.
Retired American general Gerald Thomson was quoted as saying that the U.S. command was aware of the difficult situation, so, the new Iraqi military would remain under control of the joint command of the alliance even once a ministry of defence was formed.
Professor Anthony Kordsman, a military historian and chief researcher at Washington Strategic and International Studies Center, said contracts for equipping and arming the Iraqi army were locked in difficulties after canceling one of them as a result of impairments surrounding the winning company regarding failure to meet required conditions, along with a suspected relationship between the company and a member of provisional Iraqi Governing Council (IGC).
THE BEST OPTION FOR IRAQ! FEDERAL STATES ON GEOGRAPHIC BASIS
Feelings of national disunity are also growing in an unprecedentedly negative way.
2-The Kurds would not accept a return to the former political situation: Iraqi Kurds who suffered from persecution and woes and were exposed to massacres, ruin and destruction at the hand of successive central governments in Iraq for decades, cannot agree to return to the previous situation and, therefore, insist on a federal system that legally and constitutionally preserves their rights, meets their demands and preserves the traits of their national character as Kurds and Iraqi citizens who contribute to the construction of their country.
6-The inability of non factional political forces to influence the stream of events or direct social culture.
Since the distribution of the federal states is geographically based, Kirkuk's inclusion in the Kurdistan state has no significance or importance 2-The Central State: It includes the following governorates: Mosul, Anbar, Saladin, Diala 3-Baghdad State: it includes Baghdad governorate with its geographical and administrative borders 4-The Central Euphrates State: it includes the following governorates:
Article B: Public resources, national wealth and financial revenues should be distributed to the five federal states into one of these two ways: The first:
It is also necessary to seek to sign a number of active agreements in collective defence with friendly and regional countries to ensure Iraq's independence, protect its democratic system and its borders.
NATIONAL AND MINISTERIAL MECHANISMS TO IMPLEMENT EGYPT-EUROPE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT
There are two levels in implementing the partnership agreement with Europe; the first is political and the second is technical. The former is represented by the partnership council, which is a political council comprising the foreign ministers of the EU countries and the Egyptian foreign minister, while the second is represented in the partnership committee, which undertakes the technical follow-up of actual implementation of the agreement, the minister added. She noted that such a pattern used in the implementation of the agreement is not a new thing as the 1977 Egypt-Europe cooperation agreement was enforced in the same way.
She considered the partnership agreement as a basic future test for Egypt's competitive potential, expressing conviction that Egypt has a competitive edge.
The EU also agreed to exempt a number of Egypt's agricultural exports from customs tariff without determining certain quotas all the year long such as citrus fruits, medical and aromatic plants, and guava, Nassar pointed out.
EGYPT AND RUSSIA SIGN PHARMACEUTICAL, GAS AND OIL AGREEMENTS
On the other hand, an Egyptian private company specialized in gas and oil field clinched an agreement with a major Russian company in this field to work jointly in Egypt as well as in Arab and African countries in cooperation with the Arab Contractors Company and Petrojet, which will help extend gas pipelines and develop oil and gas fields.

Potential investments in Egypt are estimated at 400 million US dollars. Lukoil's production is also forecast to record 10 percent of Egypt's total output, he added. The Russian company is developing its activities at its concession area in West Ish Al-Mallaha in Egypt. Its daily production hits almost 12,000 barrels of oil. The company prospects for oil and gas at the two areas of Northeast Geisum and West Geisum through international bids announced by Egypt, involving several international companies, the minister of petroleum said.
Egyptian-Korean relations gained major momentum following President Mubarak's first visit to South Korea in April 1999 since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries at the ambassadorial level in 1995.
In this context, the Korean Minister of Communications and Information paid a recent visit to Egypt to discuss with Egyptian officials a group of cooperation projects in the communications and information technology fields as the Korean side expressed increasing interest in the new mobile phone network and the establishment of a software production center and another center for research and development in the communications and information technology area. The latter will be the only center of its kind in the Middle East and Africa.
This price decrease came after the government has exercised pressures on iron manipulators who cornered markets, foremost among them is businessman Ahmed Izz, owner of Izz Dekhila Iron and Steel Company, economic sources said.

EGYPT IMPORTS COTTON FROM MALI TO MEET DOMESTIC NEEDS
Al-Shewi ascribed the export decline to the impacts of the USA extended subsidy to American cotton exporters on Egyptian cotton as such subsidy did extreme harm to all cotton-producing countries this year, the majority of which are Third World countries.

The new entity is meant to set a framework for cooperation between the two countries through a joint plan of action for activating bilateral cooperation. Periodical meetings would be held every three months to encourage the inflow of more Chinese investments with a view to making use of Chinese expertise in communications, information technology, fabric industry, energy, medicine industry and distance learning. Moreover, the Chinese side would promote the special economic zone in northwest of Gulf of Suez.
The Chinese side suggested that Egypt, thanks to its location, would be a center for Chinese industries and re-exporting Chinese products to neighbouring countries.
Egypt had tried to import cotton from Mali to answer the needs of local spinneries.
A number of food exporters warned against sudden Jordanian measures, accusing the Jordanian government of recalcitrance and failure to abide by bilateral deals between the two countries, especially the free trade exchange agreement, which was signed in December 1998 and became effective in 1999. It was aimed to establish a free trade zone between the two sides by January 2005 at most. They also accused it of violating an agreement on facilitating and developing trade exchange among Arab countries.
EGYPTIAN INVESTMENTS IN ALGERIA HIT $1.2 BN
As for the joint investments in Egypt till late last October, they are represented in five projects including three projects under the internal investment system and two projects in the Free Zone in Port Said. Total investments of the five projects hit 25.9 million pounds and their issued capital is 12.4 million pounds. Algerian contributions to those projects account for 4.2 million pounds.
The two grants come within the framework of the Egyptian and Japanese parties' interest and agreement on giving priority to water and irrigation fields and completion of Japanese projects that contributed to developing such fields, she said, pointing out that there is a big project for distributing drinking water to the north of Giza at a total value of 35 million dollars.
Industry and Energy Committee at the People's Assembly said investments of the industry modernization program in the FY2004/2005 are estimated at about 432 million pounds.
The new industrial register, which includes many facilities, should be declared quickly, said the report. Measures should also be taken quickly to overcome problems of businessmen, it added.
She added that there were agreements that require People's Assembly approval and cause financial burdens and therefore are subject to second paragraph or article 151 of the constitution and have to be referred to the People's Assembly.
She concluded that what happened proved seriousness about removing the obstacles which used to unjustifiably delay ratification of agreements which would, in turn, delay benefiting by them. This proves the high level of coordination between the Finance Ministry, International Cooperation Sector and Civil Aviation Ministry.
Basic input in iron and steel industry from scrap and sponge iron and steel would be exempted from tariffs, it said.
"Taxpayers can also send in their tax declarations on the Internet," he added. In press statements on 9 June, Ali affirmed that the second step in developing the services of the center was still under study, explaining that the step in question concerned authorization for a tax inspector to receive documents, assess duty and receive payment, all in one process, which meant that only one person would do the whole job.
In the field of inspection, the center is currently developing inspection systems with a view to conversion from traditional inspection to inspection of the accounting systems and financial policies applied in companies.

UNOFFICIAL EXCHANGE MARKET COLLAPSE IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO LAUNCH DOLLAR INTERBANK MECHANISM
On the other hand, other bankers emphasized that the current circumstances were absolutely suitable for launching dollar interbank mechanism as it is the most important tool for undermining the unofficial market in parallel to the rate of exchange deregulation mechanism since January, 2003.
MINISTER : MERRIL LYNCH'S FIGURES INACCURATE!
The minister pointed out that the retiring funds loans to the value of LE176.8 billion included LE126.7 billion originally included in the government domestic debt amounting to LE266.3 billion to the equivalent of 58.2% of the gross domestic products (GDP).
Regarding the public budget deficit which Merrill Lynch emphasized that it would rise to represent 9.1% of the GDP in 2003/2004, which 3 times as much as it used to have been in 98/99, the Minister of Finance described the report content in that regard as expectations. He said that the report figures were not facts and hard figures on the budget deficit, but mere expectations that the the deficit would hit 9.1% of GDP in the fiscal year 2003/2004.

They mostly suffer from anaemia and chest and skin diseases. Lawbreakers use graveyards to carry out their crimes.
He wondered "Where do low-cost housing units go?"
114 LOW PROFITABILITY COMPANIES TO BE PRIVATIZED
EGYPT TO IMPORT FRENCH, BRITISH WHEAT
An Australian mission had arrived in Egypt to consider agreements over exporting 1 million tons of Australian wheat to Egypt, he said.
This came in a meeting between Al-Ghamrawi and member of the Swiss Organization for the Facilitation of Investments (SOFI) and some Egyptian businessmen.
The reports uncovered that Egypt's joining the Comesa in mid February 1999 had done great harm to national economy as it led to the aggravation of Egypt's trade balance deficit with the Comesa countries as well as stupendous losses in the proceeds of customs duties entering the state's treasury annually and the importers manipulation of the country of origin certificates thus impeding a rise in the volume of exchanges.
The sources went to say that the multiplicity of negative commodity lists do not abide by the rules of the agreement especially customs exemptions has greatly minimized the access of Egyptian exports to African markets. There are also other obstacles to which the government has found no solutions in order to boost its exports to the Comesa countries markets especially the absence of any direct and regular navigational routes linking Egypt with the Comesa countries, which raises the costs of cargo and transport for goods exported to the Comesa states, thus making exporters refrain from dealing with those markets due to high costs.
Egypt and Sudan have agreed to set up an Egyptian-Sudanese company for the development of the Nile navigational course in both countries whether through dredging or setting guide marks as well as the improvement of ships and navigational maintenance equipment. The expertise of both countries will be drawn upon to carry this out.
He reiterated that all Sinai Cement exports which hit 600,000 tons on annual basis are exported to Spain, Italy, Libya, Kenya, Jamaica and Brazil. "In spite of all the Israeli temptations through offering high prices through mediators, we have refused to export cement to Israel," he disclosed.
In response to President Mubarak's directives, a committee comprising representatives of all ministries, including the Ministry of Foreign Trade, the Ministry of International Cooperation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and businessmen associations, is being formed at present to promote relations and set up more development projects with the Nile basin countries, especially Sudan, Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Mahmoud Abu Zeid told Al-Alam Al-Youm.
The Ministry of Irrigation is ready to extend consultation or any other facilities to the private sector to maximize its role in the Nile basin area, Abu Zeid said.
Private sector investments in the new year plan are expected to rise to 40 billion pounds, up 8 billion pounds against last year, Minister of Planning Dr. Othman Mohamed Othman expected.
The plan stresses social goals and aims at achieving balanced development all over Egypt governorates, as 22% of total investments has been allocated for the Upper Egypt against 18% in the current year plan, which reflects a quantum leap in directing the plan's investments, he added.
He is the second son of President Qaddafi and his first son from his second wife Safiya Furkash. She was a nurse and Gaddafi met her in the hospital at the beginning of the revolution where he had had appendectomy out. She was the nurse that oversaw his room. At the early years of her marital life, Furkash rarely appeared in political or diplomatic milieus, but in the recent period she started to participate on several art, political, and revolutionary occasions.
From the very beginning, Saif Al-Islam opted for work through unofficial channels to be able to work at various levels in a semi-official way without being restricted by official, diplomatic and administrative consideration. Formally, he does not occupy any political or official position in the state, but his role in contacting, negotiating, and in giving statements is higher than that of the foreign minister.
Saif Al-Islam became famous in the international media when he bartered the German hostages kidnapped by Abu-Saiaf Group for 25 million dollars.
Former American deputy secretary of state Robert Billitro acknowledged on Monday that his country pressed for delaying the Arab League (AL) summit supposed to be held in the Tunisian capital of Tunis on March 29-30.
MOUSSA: ARAB SUMMIT MOST PROBABLY IN TUNIS MID-MAY
As for reports talking about differences between Arab Mashreq and Arab Maghreb countries on who would host the summit, Moussa acknowledged he had no information about Rabat's good offices to host the summit as a political compromise.
However, the mere meeting of the Arab League council or holding of an Arab summit indicated the presence of a general Arab tendency as well as optimum circumstances to transcend disputes and take joint positions even without any intentions to have them put into effect.
To meet in the Arab League headquarters, was, therefore, one thing and to implement policies on the country and practical level was quite another thing.
The question now is: what do those people exactly want?
Those who felt that they were in a favourable position, started to see that minimum accord a detriment and had, therefore, had more frenzy against Arab summits or solidarity.
Those who falsely assume that position would even go crazy if such implementation took place.
The bill was submitted by deputies Thomas Tacrindo and Donald Byan who had both sent a message to President George W. Bush in that regard.
The bill calls on the American Administration to ask the Sudanese government for a full restructuring of security bodies and excluding those involved in international terrorist acts as part of the peace accord currently negotiated between Khartoum and Sudan People's Liberation Army SPLA and stopping being involved in or supporting any terrorism acts and putting to trial any Sudanese official involved in backing international terrorism. The bill asks Secretary of State Colin Powell to investigate the involvement of senior officials in the current Sudanese government in world terrorist crimes and to present the Congress with a report of the investigation results.
Those names, according to the bill are the President's first deputy Ali Othman Mohamed Taha, former Federal government and external security minister Dr. Nafi Ali Nafi, Presidential Advisor and leading figure of the National Islamic Front Dr. Ghazi Salah Eddin, Minister of Energy and Mining, Dr. Awadh Ahmed Al Gaz, Foreign Ministry Director and former Security official during the attempt on Mubarak's life Dr. Mutraf Seddiq Nemiri and former director of external intelligence Dr. Qutbi Al Mahdi, and Internal Security Director Major General Salah Abdullah, Minister of The Cabinet Affairs, Major General Al Hadi Al Nakasha director of External Security Branch Dr. Abd El Karim Abdullah, Major General Usama Abdullah from the National Congress Party and Major General Gamal Zamghan and Major General Imad Eddin Hussein.
Meanwhile, homegrown initiatives shrugged off the Islamists' role, strong position and popularity in most Arab countries. The American plan shares this inattention with them.
Thus, they are not aimed at reform, genuine change or democracy. Rather, they are meant to buy time until the Arab democratization storm coming from abroad eases out and, then, stretching-out comes to normal for relaxation.
The involvement of Islamists in the democratic process is a difficult question which the Americans and ruling regimes in the region seek to evade.
To avoid generalization, when I (the writer) say Islamists I mean those Islamists who believe in democratic exercise and recognize the opponents' right to political participation and emulation and accession to power through fair elections.
The gap between extremist and terrorist Islamists and moderate and democratic Islamists has persistently embarrassed and upset many of those who prefer to put all Islamists under one umbrella; extremist terrorists who should be fought and violently uprooted.
Exactly, American and Arab official positions on the gap were exposed in countries where moderate Islamists were denied access to politics.
Thus, they evade the question of genuine opening-up represented by a step-by-step program that may eventually lead up to the handover of power to people and placement of socio-politics on the democratic devolution road not only as for ruling but all other societal affairs as well.
Some see it as a regrettable matter that may send the region into the unknown, a thing which the Islamists themselves should take into consideration as others' confidence in them and their own planks is poor.
Their responses and positions on any democratic opening-up become an unpredictable question.
To deal with crises that need a drastic reform in the Arab countries, reform should begin with the political system and then take different directions. For example, the issue of human rights should not be imposed on school subjects and schoolchildren as they are not accused of violating them. Rather, it should be imposed on the ruling regimes themselves, who are accused of violating human rights.
TUNISIAN EVENT...GGATEWAY TO GREATER MIDDLE EAST!
Since the dramatic event in Tunis, a question has been strongly begged: Are the overt and covert moves to destroy the Arab League and its summits far from calls for a new regional order designated as "Greater Middle East"?
The eccentric thing in the regional Arab situation at present is that influentially weak but modestly powerful countries are now in the position of decision-making at the expense of major countries notably, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria, which constituted the pillars of the regional Arab order.
Under such circumstances, the AL and the regional Arab order were created to show the Arab public's yearning for independence and integration and to demonstrate the balances of regional power and interests of dominant superpowers.
LIBYAN JEWS WELCOME SEIF AL-ISLAM GADDAFI'S INVITATION
He added that the resolution of the Libyan Jews' cause should come within the framework of the courage steps recently taken by the Libyan government such as resolving Lockerbie case and giving up its mass destruction weapons.
He pointed out a law issued by the Libyan regime on 27th July 1970. This law provides for compensating Libyans (whether Jews or not) whose private properties were confiscated, through treasury bonds which would be repaid within 15 years.
SYRIA STIPULATES COMPELLING ISRAEL TO ABIDE BY WMDs ITEM
He, furthermore, added that Damascus appreciates France's progress in this file, but it also understands that there are other countries which oppose that. Syria will not sign the partnership agreement with the EU unless Israel abides by the same item concerned with WMD, he underlined.
SYRIAN COMMUNIST PARTY CALLS FOR COMPREHENSIVE JUDICIARY REFORM
Presidential candidates in Iraq should be acceptable to all Iraqis and should neither be subject to any foreign country nor have any political, sectarian or ethnic affiliations," Al Sharif Ali bin Al Hussein, Chairman of the Constitutional Monarchy Movement said.
The IGC should be renamed after June 30, he said, noting that it should be a house of representatives or a legislative council for all Iraqis.
LIBYA: IKHWAN PRISONERS STAGE SIT-IN IN TRIPOLI
Sources said that security forces were getting ready to break into the court and forcibly return the prisoners to their cells in Abu Salim Prison, southwest Tripoli.

Addressing Parliament Speaker Ahmed Fatehi Sorour, Hassanein said that he got frustrated at unattainable political reform and that he joined many parties to no avail, emphasizing that his decision was final and irrevocable.
It also provided control cadres from the CBE to follow up the market movement and reveal any violation, they said, adding that during the coming few days another 25 controllers will be joining such cadres, thus totaling 65.
The CBE failure to take a decision regarding the interest rate may push some Egyptian expatriates to keep their money in the form of foreign currency deposits, which is not in favour of the Egyptian pound by any means and may even push it to further retreats, they said.
If such banks merged under the supervision of the CBE, this would make them more capable of providing services of higher quality and more attractive interest rates that would make their clients increase their dealings, thus making the balance tilt in favour of domestic banks in the face of foreign ones, they said.
"The party's candidates will not be less than 25 in some constituencies," Al-Wafd Secretary General Sayed Al-Badawi told Asharq Al-Awsat. However, he added that the real number of candidates would be announced in a few days' time. "Al-Wafd rarely contests the Shura council elections because it concentrates its efforts on the parliamentary elections.
Since 1990, particularly following the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, American warships have been using the Suez Canal on theirmargin of his participation in an anti-money laundering conference in Cairo, Al-Emari termed as untrue the reports that the group was no longer interested in investment and expansion in Egypt. He pointed that the existence of a large market, low-cost labour, attractive exemptions and encouraging free zones were encouraging factors. "Like any other investor, we look forward to more facilities, legislative amendments, understanding by banks, and stability of the rate of exchange because the liberalization of the pound rate of exchange last year has affected our activity to a great extent."

191 MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF COTTON EXPORTS
EGYPTIAN EXPORT DEVELOPMENT CENTER TO BE ESTABLISHED IN COOPERATION WITH JETRO
It might be mentioned that Egyptian and Libyan officials met in April 2002 to finally agree on the volume of Libya's share in MIDOR's refinery and the measures and conditions that should be laid down according to the results of the joint higher committee meetings held on May 19th 2002.
It is worth mentioning that MIDOR is a giant oil-refining project, the first of its kind in the Middle East and Africa. It exports about five million tons annually of high quality oil products. Its investments amount to two billion dollars.
The Japanese government is interested in supporting JETRO-Egypt, said Ghali, pointing out that the two countries had long relations over more than 140 years. The Foreign Trade Ministry made use of the Japanese successful trade policy. This made Egypt resort to the Japanese experience in boosting exports. Ghali praised the experience of Japanese people in creation, development and making optimal use of human resources.
In a statement, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia expressed hope that the USA would reconsider its position expressed by Presidepromising export-oriented products in Egypt. It would also provide technical support for improving quality of these products. It would mount annual exhibitions in Japan with a view to enabling Egyptian exporters to visit Japan and offer their products directly to Japanese importers, he said.
There have been reports of Arab and international moves to cope with the situation following Bush's promise. The Europen Union (EU) announced that it would hold a high-level meeting in Berlin on 28th April.
STATE OF EMERGENCY TO BE ABOLISHED AHEAD OF 2005 ELECTIONS The value of contracts of Egyptian cotton exports surged up to 91 million dollars since the beginning of the season till mid this month with a quantity hitting 1.391 million kantars of cotton fibre.
The Barakat (Sudan) cotton prices also declined to 80.25 cents per pound. Moreover, the prices of the American Pima cotton declined to 107 cents per pound. Middle Asia cotton prices went down to 86 cents per pound.
It will then refer them to the People's Assembly and the Shura Council for further deliberations ahead of the final abrogation decision.
A certain schedule cannot be fixed for setting the final characteristics or conception of the emergency abolition bill, which requires more time and effort especially as the council is still preparing its internal, financial, administrative and personnel regulations, he said.
The ministry's departments, the Ministry of Total Egyptian exports rose to LE4.3 billion in January 2004 from LE2.9 billion in the same month of last year while imports spiraled to LE6.5 billion in January this year compared to LE5.4 year-on-year, the latest report issued by the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMS) said. CAPMS chairman Maj. Gen. Ihab Olwi stated that free zones exports went up from LE535 million in January 2003 to LE1.2 billion in the same month this year while their imports rose from LE728 million in January 2003 to LE1Justice and the council are jointly considering all available alternatives to guarantee security stability in the context of legislation and laws in place, Ghali said.
The positive response of Interior Minister Habeeb al-Adli and other ministry agencies is an encouraging favourable position, and the emergency abolition now is a correct security measure that matches the circumstances and development of the Egyptian society, shows an understanding of its needs and voices the vision of democratic establishments, NCHR Vice-Chairman Dr. Ahmed Kamal Ab003.
Non-petroleum exports slightly went up by 1% to hit 305 million dollars due to an increase in fully manufactured exports by 8%; raw materials, 94%; raw cotton, 10%; and petroleum exports, 36% hitting 257 million dollars.
As for dealings of free trade zones last January, the report recorded a rise of 31% - from 185 million dollars in January 2003 to 243 million dollars, 64 million dollars of which are exports to the domestic market.
Commodity imports under such systems hit 143 million dollars, 33 million dollars of which came under the temporary clearance system and the remaining part came under the drawback system.
Around one third of the state budget goes to the repayment of debt installments and interest, which are higher than annual pay allocations.
Opposition forces, however, deemed those measures insufficient adding that a real reform needed a political will to give momentum to further public freedoms.
Two weeks ago, Mubarak cancelled a ruling passed by a court martial in absentia against Egyptian fundamentalist Ahmed Hussein Ogeiza. Such measures were regarded by observers as a prelude to other measures on the way. Mubarak has always voiced belief in the necessity to maintain state stability and avoid the strategy of sudden shocks, but a reform trend in the ruling National Democratic areholders union also applied to purchase another 10% of the company's capital so that the union's share would rise up to 20% of the company's capital.
A report compiled by the Arab Labour Organization on unemployment in Arab countries said the number of the unemployed who hold junior collage qualifications is on the Party led by his son Gamal Mubarak has managed since the party convention two years ago to promote the idea of reform especially after the 2000 parliamentary elections brought Muslim Brotherhood to the limelight as its candidates won 17 seats while a number of the ruling party symbols lost the elections in a phenomenon attributed by political circles to the electorates voting for any candidate who did not belong to the ruling party regardless of his personality or platform. Circles close to the authority also talk about another trend in the ruling party that resists the change process. In 2000, elections were held under judicial supervision, inside ballot stations in implementation of a judicial ruling that excluded executive bodies from attending the stations.
The opposition forces demand that the plebiscite system to choose the president should be stopped and replaced by another which allows more than one candidate to stand for presidential elections.
According to statements by Dr. Atef Ebeid's government ministers, the issuance of the Egyptian sovereignty dollar bonds had two motives, firstly to have Egypt on the map of international money markets, to quote Minister of Foreign Trade Dr. Youssef Botros Ghali; secondly to secure dollar funds at a low interest rates to be used in highly profitable projects without having to abide by the conditions of international financing institutions, to quote Minister of Finance Dr. Medhat Hassanein to whose ministry the boes, and denounced the massacres perpetrated by the occupation troops in Falluja, Ramadi, Baaquba, Najaf, Nasseriya, Kut and Basra.
Although on putting the bonds up in mid 2001 the government banned Egyptian financial institutions from subscribing for such bonds, the ban was cancelled last year and those institutions were allowed to buy the bonds. Direct orders were even issued to public banks and major insurance companies to purchase such bonds in a bid to provide them with a prop after foreign investors refrained from such purchases in favour of other countries' bonds due to the decline of Egyptian economy credit worthiness. More than two thirds of the bonds have thus come to belong to Egyptian institutions, thus, almost converting into treasury bonds and losing sight of their original objective, - presence on the international market.
In a statement, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine condemned the American occupation troops crimes, saying that the American occupation forces seek to invent new reasons to justify their presence.
He pointed out that such a study was conducted in cooperation with the IMF so as to avoid awkwardness on the market. He added that the policies Enterprise organizations in Egypt are considering holding a joint meeting shortly, which would be the first of its kind, to evaluate economic relations with world countries and the possibility of upgrading relations with Arab and implement in monetary policy are sophisticated and state-of-the-art in order to achieve price stability. Foreign know-how from the IMF and other international banks was also drawn upon in the formulation of such policies. He pointed out that the target was reaching monetary stability in 18 months' time and achieving free flow of foreign exchange into the banking market.
Meanwhile, enterprise organizations called for stopping bilateral economic cooperation with Israel linking that to Tel Aviv's shift from its current policy in the region.
NEW TRANSPORT PROJECTS CANCELLED
A GOVERNMENT PLAN TO RENOUNCE MILLIONS OF PENSIONERS! New transport projects in the FY 2004/2005, to start July 1st next, have been frozen, official economic sources uncovered.
This means that unprecedentedly no fresh major Dr. Atef Ebeid's government intends to reduce the number of beneficiaries of social insurance pensions and to increase the subscription period stipulated for getting retirement, disability or death pensions.
The forthcoming amendments stipulate that the worker should have paid subscription premiums for at least 25 years so that he might be eligible for getting pension on leaving service under the early retirement system instead of the current legal provisions that stipulate the payment of insurance premiums for 20 years only for getting pensions.

LOCAL MONETARY FLUIDITY GOES UP BY 438 MILLION US DOLLARS
Quasi-money amounted to 344.520 billion pounds against 340.955 billion pounds in the reporting period, it added.
The plan relies on foreign finance sources in only 9 percent of its investments, hitting 8 billion pounds, including 2.1 billion pounds' worth of aid and the rest is soft loans and foreign facilities, he said.
The market has been struck with a state of embarrassment as a result of the rumours spread by some in London about President Mubarak's health and the consequent postponement of the expected cabinet reshuffle.
The Stock Exchange has witnessed a decline in all its indices on last Sunday and Monday circulation sessions due to the big waves of selling on the part of stockholders. On the first day of circulation, the number of securities whose closing rates declined amounted to 73 accounting for 82.31% of the circulation volume. Hermes standard index which represents active stocks went down by about 1.4% while capital market authority index declined by about 0.8%.

President Hosni Mubarak is expected to accept the resignation of Dr. Atef Ebeid's government and to task him to form a new government.
The new government will not include deputy premier and Minister of Agriculture Dr. Yusuf Wali, Foreign Minister; Ahmed Mahir; Minister of Education Dr. Hussein Kamil Bahauddin; Minister of Enterprise Sector Dr. Mahmoud Khattab and Minister of Supply Hassan Khidr.
The sources added that the ministerial reshuffle would be more extensive than expected, pointing out that the "reformists" to whom some ministerial portfolios would be assigned would work as one team. They pointed out that the change would be radical regarding the economic group ministers including economy, supply, planning and enterprise sector ministers.
It is to be mentioned that Misr-Iran Company has bid the highest price.
A recent report on the privatization of state-owned companies indicated that a total of 202 businesses and factories have been privatized since the privatization program was launched until late December 2003. Only 178 businesses have remained unsold, including 59 losers sustaining 3117 million pounds, 53 profit-makers making marginal profits of 78 million pounds and 66 profit-makers achieving 2390 million pounds.
The plan is mainly aimed to stop annual losses of at least 3.1 billion pounds likely to increase due to several factors, including fierce competition, low technology, dilapidated equipment and labour and financial burdens. It is also intended to maintain a certain number of more profitable and powerful makers and improve their efficiency by giving them to those who are able to invest in them, develop them and maintain their capabilities to turn them into productive forces through the conditions of carrying on with the activity that maintains the largest number of workers in those companies. The conditions come as follows:
-A buyer and tenant can propose a development plan to be put in place in 24 months' time since the date of delivering assets or factories, with the existing productive capacity to be maintained and further developed.
Staple Commodity prices saw a sharp rise.
Rebar prices rose by 81.5 percent, cement by 65.7 percent, wood by 27.2 percent, glass by 62 percent, wall paints by 23.9 percent and bathroom fixtures by 26.3 percent.
In an attempt to put an end to the current wrangle over the volume of public debt in Egypt and whether it exceeded the safe limits, Minister of Finance Medhat Hassanein emphasized that the internal debt rose from 252.2 billion pounds on June 30th 2003 to 266.3 billion pounds late last December, i.e. 58.5% of the GDP. This means that the government's local debt is still within the safe limits as it stands at yet 60% of the GDP, which the European Union considers the limit of danger.
In an exclusive statement, Hassanein confirmed that wrangle over the volume of local debt was methodological and scientific in the first place. "We should differentiate between the government's obligations or the so-called state treasury obligations and 'state-owned bodies' obligations' including the economic authorities and the NIB. The local debt is confined to government's debts only," he said.
EGYPTIAN COURT UPHELD TRAVEL BAN ON BUSINESS TYCOON
Earlier, Baghgat filed a lawsuit against the Prosecutor General in his capacity for banning him from traveling to the United States for treatment.
The United States is currently holding talks with four Arab countries, namely Egypt, Jordan, Tunisia and Morocco, to launch a regional project for investment in medium and small-sized projects.

JEWISH LOBBY IN AMERICA ACCUSES AL-AZHAR OF SUPPORTING TERRORISM
The Jewish writer alleged that Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh Mohamed Sayed Tantawi encouraged volunteers from the Arab countries to go to Iraq out of the belief that resisting oppression is an Islamic duty and that Jihad is permissible till doomsday.
The IAEA implements the international legitimacy, he said.

The investors call on the conferees to start an internal investigation to find whether the sale of giant bulldozers violates the company's internal statute, which stipulates that the company should accept responsibility for the safety of citizens worldwide and take special and necessary priorities into account.
Despite the abundance of Shiites weapons and their fabulous ability to play an important role in fighting US occupation forces, abduction remains to be the most effective Shiite weapon that is capable of forcing occupation to leave. Amid escalation of resistance operations in Iraq led by Shiite young cleric Muqtada Al Sadr, the Shiites resorted to their old weapon for repelling occupation; abduction.
In February 1986, Hizbullah abducted two Israeli soldiers. In 1991, Israel announced they were dead. In July 1st, Hizbullah exchanged the remains of these two soldiers for the remains of 123 Lebanese. On the same day, the Lebanese group set free 25 soldiers from Lahd's army, a staunch ally of Israel, in return for Tel Aviv setting free 25 prisoners from Al Khaiam concentration camp, South Lebanon.
The Sunnites and the Shiites, though embrace different beliefs, agreed on the importance of this weapon and its tough effect on their enemies as they agreed, not long time ago, on martyrdom operations against Americans and Jews, thus striking fear into the hearts of their enemies.
During an open meeting in the National Assembly (parliament) which most deputies did not attend, deputy Dr. Walid Al Tabtabae said that some people allege that the Kuwaiti people support what occupation forces do in Iraq, which is not true. All Kuwaitis are against the practices of those forces which are no less bloody than those practices of the former Iraqi regime.
While an activist in Islamic cases, lawyer Usama Manawir hailed strugglers in Falluja who raised our heads so high, Al Sheikh Ahmed Al Qattan called on strugglers not to enter residential areas and to spare women and children any possible trouble and not to take refuge to mosques. If they wanted martyrdom let them to the martyrdom sites.
Asharq Al-Awsat learnt that the Kuwaiti government had received those families and offered them food assistance.
The government, however, did not use such a plan which might be put into effect in case of fresh developments.
In Khartoum, Foreign Minister Mostafa Othman categorically denied such reports and described them as tendentious and false.
Saudi sources belittled the effect of arresting a number of reformists on the Saudi reform process.
Those reformists had better take into account the nature of the conservative Saudi society, which tended towards reform a few years ago, the resources said.
All players involved in that game would not be able to get away unless an unlikely surprise took place through the Iraqis' unity and the American Administration's willingness to admit to and rectify errors.
The next few weeks are crucial for Iraq and the whole Middle East region.
They asked for additional forces, but Bush did not commit himself to sending such forces and Ramsfeld dawdled over the process while the whole administration was averse to the idea.
There is also the date of June 30th which was defined by the American Administration for handing power over to the Iraqis, in a bid to impress the American electorate that they had managed to convert an Arab country into a democratic state.
Such a buffer zone is now no more and the borders are open to alliances between organizations.
When Ariel Sharon goes to Washington next week, he will carry a project which George Bush may not be able to reject. He will submit demands which if granted, would aggravate the reprisal campaign against the USA.
He wants implicit backing of the separating wall and an American approval of Israel's right to invade Gaza if necessary even after withdrawing from it.
In fact, he wants to get the USA more soaked in the bog in Iraq and the Arab region.
America's bog in Iraq also means that Iraq is the bog, which is regrettable for a country that have spent decades under the yoke of repression, misery and exploitation.
Saad Mahyu, a journalist with Al-Hayat newspaper weekly supplement "Al-Wassat" wrote a lengthy article which ran to the following effect only in part: Has the Iraqi boiler reached the boiling and then the exploding point?
Not only did they claim the lives of scores, injure hundreds and spread ruin from Basra in the south to Baghdad in the center, but they also embarrassed the Shiite majority led by Ayatallah Ali Sistani who, have so far, at least, cooperated with occupation authorities.
Falluja incident where four American corpses were heinously mutilated after being burnt urged occupation forces to set a different more violent plan.
Mahdi army does not exceed 3000 nontrained and often unarmed elements.
It may affect, shake and embarrass it but it won't, at this stage, radically change it.
However, why did matters develop so dangerously in the triangle?
There are three possibilities:
The first option means semi independent confederal cantons and the second means that tribes, clans and war barons will be independent of the central government, which would then be hypothetical and marginal rather than a real or genuine state.
Should such a date be delayed, President Bush would stand exposed before his opponent for the Presidency John Kerry as the former had meant the power hand over plan to persuade the American electorate that everything was alright in Iraq and that all democratic shots against him would not hit the target.
- Old Europe (France and Germany) which would be more than glad if Bush bled his nose in Iraq and then bled to death on the big ballot day in the Presidency elections.
- China, too, in spite of being fully absorbed in its ambitious economic project which would turn it in a few years' time into a superpower, can only rub its hands with pleasure as it sees the American giant drowned in the Middle East bogs.
More than one factor makes Muqtada Sadr and his Mahdi army a subject for controversial talk and may spark a further military escalation and a political quibbles within a framework of a deal that may be concluded to end the current escalation in Iraq, although the American occupation troops announced that they would arrest Sadr upon an arrest warrant issued by an Iraqi judge, accusing the young Shiite leader of being involved in assassinating young Shiite leader Abdel-Majid Kho'ie, who entered Iraq following the Anglo-American invasion in March 2003 and was killed in Najaf early April 2003. Sadr's follower Mostafa Al-Ya'qoubi is said to be involved in assassinating Kho'ie. Ya'qoubi, together with another thirteen of his followers, was arrested upon an arrest warrant, which the American forces claimed to be issued by Iraqi courts of law. Many observes in Baghdad see that the fresh American escalation was politically and psychologically prepared with a view to nipping the Sadr's trend in the bud before it develops into an uncontrollable political and military phenomenon in the future when they pull out to certain bases for the advantage of the anticipated Iraqi government, which is supposed to hand power over on June 30th next at most.
While some considered that the number of Iraqi casualties in the military escalation may cause officials tensions, the contrary took place, as many demonstrators and sitters-in withdrew from the sites they occupied and Basra province headquarters, leaving them to Iraqi police and civil defence squads.
Secondly, the Americans linked the recent bloody incidents with a decision considering Sadr wanted by the U.S. for reasons that have nothing to do with such incidents but rather with the assassination of Kho'ie a year ago. The two issues may force the occupation forces into a tight corner.
It seems that there are other causes that escalated the situation. I wish to be mistaken when I say that the occupation troops deliberately pushed the incidents the Iraqi situation in that direction so that they might copy Israeli behaviour towards the Palestinian leaderships, unaware of the dangers of indulging in such a policy. There are yawing differences and disproportional capabilities, thus portending uncalculated dangers.
He pointed out that EGOIEF offered all facilities to S. Korean Exhibitions Authority as well as S. Korean Industries Federation to participate in Egypt exhibitions whether public or specialized in order to promote relations between the two countries' businessmen and publicize their products. Egypt will also take care to participate in all exhibitions to be held in S. Korea with a view to maintain contacts between the two countries businessmen.
He confirmed the success of the S. Korean investments in Egypt due to the seriousness of investors on both sides.
Egyptian-Korean Business Council held a meeting on the sidelines of the Egyptian trade week activities attended by head of the Egyptian delegation Sherif Al-Gabali and head of the Korean side King Hun. Ambassador Amr Hilmi called on the Korean party to lift the ban on Egyptian citrus fruits exports, especially as the Egyptian party had submitted scientific reports confirming the Egyptian products safety.
He said that operating a direct air route between Cairo and Seoul as of next month would boost tourism and trade between the two countries.
These remarks were made by Minister of Agriculture and Deputy Prime Minister Yousef Wali and Minister of Foreign Trade Yousef Botros Ghali. The two ministers were visiting the farms of an Egyptian company in Nobaryea that are run by South African experts. They called on the stations of preparing and packing fruits (especially grape in its new season) ready to be exported to the Gulf and European markets.
The law is suspected to be unconstitutional, because it has been enforced retroactively on the existing exchange firms, said the report.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESOURCES UP 22%
REBAR SALES DOWN
Traders monitored a state of worry in producers dealings due to indicators pointing out the possibility of having a further reduction in rebar prices. The said opening importation and cutting down the customs duties to 5% compelled national iron factories to reconsider their prices so that they could compete.
Eng. Khaled Al-Yorini, head of a Port Said-based producing company, expected a slight cut in rebar prices before conditions are settled over the coming month. He had reservations about practices by some plants that give traders bigger profit margins to dispose of stocks. This is meant to do harm to the rest of producers and cause them heavy losses, particularly as the production cost differs from one plant to another according to the used raw materials and the extent of its price reduction.

Dr. Atef Ebeid's government is currently facing a new crisis after work rates in Toshka project retreated unprecedentedly as some contracted companies stopped their work in basic infrastructure after they sustained heavy losses due to the deregulation of exchange rates. The government did not disburse price differentials set in the terms of the contract.
For his part, Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation, Mahmoud Abu Zeid informed the committee of the performance rate, admitting that work rates have been affected since the deregulation of exchange rates. The ministry does not have the allocations necessary to disburse the 10% price differentials to continue work at its normal rate, he said, especially as the giant projects investments hit LE5 billion.
First Undersecretary of the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation and Irrigation Department Chairman al-Amir Othman told Al-Alam Al-Youm daily that the ministry paid the dues of companies working at Toshka and there was a surplus which would be used in developing the project.
It has become the hottest file that is likely to interact with the Middle East developments.
The recent relative detente in Turkey's dealing with the Kurds pointed out that the military solution has become less effective.
Despite the peculiarity of the Kurds' problems in every country, they agree on their political ambitions and share the same injustice and sufferings by leaderships in central governments.
Results of the American occupation Actually, the number of Kurds in Iraq amounts to four millions, i.e. 16% of total population.
Decisions should be taken unanimously.
The agreement also added that any administrative unit, whether a governorate or a district, that includes a Kurdish majority should be annexed to Kurdistan.
Although there are main differences between the Iranian tools of dealing with the Kurds in comparison to those of Syria, Al-Qamshali's incidents emphasize that the Kurdish issue has become more volatile and that the Kurds of Iraq will not keep silent or detach themselves away from the neighbours.
Many people consider the period from 1970 up till Al-Qamshali incidents as a relatively quiet period.
It can be said that the Kurds' positive role will grow contrary to the past decades when they were part of a regional equation in its negative form.
The Kurds are considered the most convinced party of the preparations, measures and motives in Iraq, thus consecrating the historic suspicions between the Arabs and Kurds.
THREE CONDITIONS FOR URGENT IRANIAN MEDIATION
1- The American forces pledge to stop its operations and not attacking Najaf.
These issues will be the core of talks between the Iranian delegation on one hand and the Iraqi Governing Council, the Shitte religious authority Ali Al-Sistani and Sadr on the other hand.
At the same time, the Supreme Guide of the Islamic Republic of Iran Ayatollah Ali Khame'ei likened the acts of the American President George Bush of attacking people in Iraq to those of the Israeli Premier Ariel Sharon in Palestine.
Washington did not seek help from the Arab League or any neighbouring Arab country not because it does not want any country to intervene but because it knows that none of those countries has the influence or credibility to intervene actively.
It is true that most Iraqis have reservations about any Arab role in this stage for well known reasons.
Instead of moving to give legitimacy and eligibility to the interim Governing council by supporting its stance, some Arab countries worked in an organized way to undermine its eligibility and legitimacy on the basis that it is not an elected council.
A memo by the Gulf Chambers of Commerce general secretariat pointed out that there was no clear plan regarding the period from 2005 to 2010, revealing that advancing the date of issuing the unified currency emanates from the rise of the level of challenges faced by the region's countries.
In a related development a technical committee has been formed to work out the criteria for the economic rapprochement that will be considered by the GCC states as criteria for getting qualified for the unified currency. These criteria are expected to be completed by 2005. Moreover, the leaders of the Gulf countries have agreed to reach the stage of the unified currency by 2010, the memo added.
What provoked Islamists, particularly Salafis (traditionalists) is that the government's declaration of its intention regarding the Faculty of Sharia coincided with Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed's pledge to Shiite MPs to issue a licence to establish huseineyas (Shiite schools) and hauzas (seminars in Shiite law colleges) to teach Jafari jurisprudence in Kuwait, along with his support to the Star Academy in Kuwait, a real TV programme that aroused a wide-scale uproar and was severely criticized by Islamists.
Faculty of Sharia and Religion Principles was established in 1982 according to a decree by Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah. More than one thousand students, a third of whom are females, are currently studying in the Faculty of Sharia. The staff consists of 80 members, most of whom are Kuwaitis who belong to the Islamic Trend, particularly the salafi one.
The accusation against the faculty and any sharia institution is ready made - it is a hotbed for terrorism, he said, adding "If the faculty where extremists had studied was accused of such extremism, it would be more reasonable to accuse faculties of engineering and medicine as Osama bin Laden is an engineer and Ayman Al-Zawahri is a physician."
Some political observers link between the Faculty of Sharia file and the government's attempts to control political force balances in the country, particularly as there is another file that concerns the government more than any thing else; the redistricting proposal, which, if put in place, would decrease the government deputies chance to get access to the National Assembly.

The party co-founders' agent Mohsen Lotfi welcomed this and considered it a step forward for having the party licensed. "We're waiting for the committee's notification of approval. There's still a period of one month and a half. If the committee didn't notify us of its decision during this period, it would be considered rejection. In this case, we'll resort to the judiciary, especially as the party's platform met a basic condition set by the committee - having distinctive features," Lotfi told Asharq Al-Awsat.

The reform initiative was unveiled by Tagamo'h Party leader Refaat al-Said at a news briefing on Saturday.

ISRAELI ASSASSINATIONS THREATEN THE REGION'S ECONOMIES
Textile Industries Chamber board member, Khalid Aboul Makarim said that the recent Israeli assassinations of Palestinian leaderships divided the business community into two-parts, one linking politics with business and the other separating them.

Within this framework, head of Construction Committee with the Egyptian Businessmen Association Salah Hijab said, "Such exhibitions are considered a big opportunity for marketing different kinds of housing units. However, this is conditional upon good organization and support of governmental institutions and banks that help raise consumer's awareness that it is important to deal with the real estate finance system."
Head of the Real Estate Investors Union suggested that all this would be provided with the government's support through allocating a part of the public budget for such a purpose, thus creating a positive and indirect effect on the state revenues. This support will give momentum to the purchase and selling market and give momentum to the business of companies and relevant investments and industries, on which taxes are imposed. Besides, this would create more jobs and decrease the current rate of joblessness. "The involvement of many companies and banks in the real estate finance activity will definitely increase competition that will, in turn, reduce the cost," he added.
For his part, consultant Alaa Al-Balkini expected that the government's tendency to reduce real estate notarization charges, following the two-stage reduction last year, would result in urging owners to quickly notarize their real estate as notarization of a real estate is a must for dealing with the real estate finance system.

Minister of Planning Dr. Othman Mohamed Othman admitted that the foreign investment growth rate in Egypt is low, as it did not exceed 500 million dollars in the current fiscal year, in spite of the convenient investment climate created by the government's recent facilities.
However, they do not offer investments incentives or guarantees such as those offered by Egypt.
Both the private and public sectors should understand that Egypt is in dire need of more investments to raise its economic growth rate to 7% per annum, the limit that would be sufficient for weathering the current crises such as unemployment, the low standard of living and the high prices of commodities and services. The Egyptian society's ability to achieve this single-handedly is very low, he added. "Some people might allege that the period between 1974 to 1978 achieved 8% economic growth rates and this indicates that the government then was excellent. However, this is not true from the practical point of view, as the reason behind that rise was not a growth in local production or the optimal usage of production assets.
This is an accomplishment that should be recognized. This new management of assets alleviated the burden of successive shocks that faced the Egyptian economy following the Luxor terrorist incident in 1997, September 11th incidents and the last war on Iraq. Hence reflected the strength and high flexibility of the Egyptian economy, at a time when Egypt could not be isolated from the international economy. In this age, oriented economy has no place; as open door policy has the upper hand.
Regarding the new taxes imposed by the government on tourism, mobile phones, cars and aviation, which undergo a state of recession though, Othman said, "Such taxes should be endorsed to curb the big rise in the state's public deficit resulting from the upsurge in subsidy allocations that accounted for 16 billion pounds this year, now that they did not exceed 8 billion pounds only.
About 180,000 kantars, which are paid-in-advance contracts, are currently being shipped, thus, taking the quantity of shipped cotton up to 1.15 million kantars at a rate of 72.91% of total volume of contracts, said the report.

LAWSUIT AGAINST PRIVATIZATION OF WATER
The government decree, which was issued earlier this year and uncovered by Minister of Housing Mohamed Ibrahim Solayman, provides for implementing fresh water pricing system where consumers will be divided into categories.

As regards Egyptians' arrears due on the Iraqis that were not paid long time ago, Al-Shabibi said, "I have no details regarding this issue which has not been discussed yet." However, he reiterated that such matters are among the sensitive matters that would be discussed by the Iraqi government.
Formal figures of the state-owned business privatization program showed a serious drop in the program's proceeds from 1994 to 2002.

Salaries increased at higher rates than during the former regime's era, he added.
"Regarding the transitional government, UN envoy Lakhadar Librahimi came to help us in this respect. As for elections, there is a committee that will cooperate with a working team dispatched by the UN Secretary General, which will consider the formation of an independent election body to supervise the whole election process. This body will include qualified and independent personalities, who will lay down an election law on modern bases, in addition to a law on political parties, which will point out how parties will participate in the election process, he said.

Aboul-Motasem who introduced himself to Al-Majalla through a telephone conversation said that he was talking from Iraqi Falluja city on which the American forces had tightened a fortnight siege, adding that he was the leader of Arab volunteers in Iraq, but he refused to uncover his nationality or the national Islamic group he belonged to. He said that the Iraqi resistance men would demand that the former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein be released, together with thousands of Iraqis now detained by alliance forces in Iraq in return for releasing foreign prisoners of war and hostages detained by Iraqi resistance groups.
He went on to say that the fact that the American occupation had simply disregarded all other points of view whether those of religious authorities or some Iraqi politicians would enhance the current coordination between Sunnite and Shiite groups till a unified command is set up.
He pointed out that they fought in order to drive American occupation out of Iraq rather than to pay homage to this or that party or President!
AL-SADR: SHOCK AND TERROR!
American Secretary of State Colin Powell has uncovered such implicit intention in the American discourse when he said, "We have faced a terrible week in Iraq. It seems that there is some sort of contact and coordination between the Sunnites and the Shiites". It is as if the two factions did not belong to the same country; Iraq! The same thing was said by President Bush while praying in his church to mark Easter Sunday.
However, why did the Americans opt for confronting before the date defined for handing power over to the Iraqis on June 30th?
This view, nonetheless, represents a justification of the Iraqi Communist Party's participation in the Governing Council formed by occupation forces rather than any political vision because Sadr's trend had penetrated the Iraqi fabric for almost ten years since Mohamed Sadik Sadr started to take up an opposition line to the former regime and the silent "Hawza" represented in foreign Shiite authorities represented in Al Sistani which preferred not to get itself directly involved in Iraqi politics.
After the death of Sadr was announced, hundreds of Iraqi demonstrators took to the street and many of them were killed by the Iraqi army, while others were arrested. Four men appeared on Iraqi television screens and were accused of killing Ayatollah Mohamed Sadik Sadr and his two sons.
At that moment, he was simply wearing his own shrouds expecting bullets to come to him from any direction.
Did Washington take this fact into account or has it just been deceived after a whole year of occupation or did Muqtada Sadr just risked getting involved in a battle which is not for Shiites?
A: If one compares the current scene with what it used to be one year ago, one is apt to say that Baghdad and even the whole of Iraq were in a state of humiliation. Everybody was struck with dismay, especially as they saw occupation troops roaming everywhere without any resistance. There was a sort of confused outlook at the relation between defending the country and defending Saddam Hussein's regime. Such ambiguity is no more as the resistance tempo is escalating not only in the Sunnite triangle but also in North and South Iraq.
A: I think that although the Shiites have been promised political gains, they have apparently preferred to place national gains above factional ones and have, therefore, left the sectarian cocoon opting for the national umbrella, which we witnessed in the extensive support which took practical and military forms in Falluja, Najaf, Kofa, Bakouba, Basra, Tikrit and other cities. This means that the Shiites have realized that promises of political gains were meant to show them as accepting occupation, which is an attempt to mar them. One year after occupation, nonetheless, things cleared up and people came round thus bringing about a merger between Shiites and Sunites.
Q: Does this mean that Muqtada Sadr has come to feature largely in the Iraqi equation in general not only in the Shiite equation so to speak?
Q: As far as Falluja battle is concerned, how would it affect the Iraqi scene in both the short and the long terms?
Under this headline, Bilal Al Hasan of Asharq Al-Awsat writes an article which runs to the following effect: What happened in the White House on April 14th, 2004, was not just a meeting between the American President George W. Bush and the Israeli Premier Ariel Sharon. What happened on that day constituted an official and public end to the peaceful march between the Arabs and Israel, which began in Madrid Conference in 1991 and constituted an official and public end to Oslo agreement which provided for negotiations over a permanent solution to the problems of borders, settlements and the refugees.
The American president has relieved Israel from any possible retreat in the final settlement negotiations and consecrated all its violations of international laws as a status quo as if they were a right of hers. He, furthermore, has formulated, together with Israel while the Arab or Palestinian negotiator was absent, all the conclusions of a permanent and final settlement in accordance with Israeli demands and wishes so much so that those formulas have come to be an American-Israeli position to be imposed on the region's countries.
This is the first time the American administration has declared its support of the Israeli settlement though it used to talk about it as a violation of international law and an obstacle to peace.
President Bush is returning the whole Arab region to the climates that prevailed after Palestine was occupied in 1948.
Washington thinks that the margin for any Arab action to build military power is extremely limited due to the absence of the Soviet Union and because of the presence of the occupation American army in Iraq.
There is the Palestinian resistance to occupation, which held ground before all Sharon's attempts to repress it.
In both cases, the Arab region will be an area of conflict with the American policy and its Israeli subordinates.
LIBYAN THRONE HEIR REJECTS GADDAFI'S REFORMS AND CALLS FOR CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE
In a message directed to the Libyan people Al-Sinoussi said that the day of reckoning is very near. "We all should work and close up ranks" to save our country. This is our option and we have every right to adhere to it supported by sharia, religion, and international treaties and laws.
JORDAN WORRIED OF US PRESSURE
The official said, "Bush's pledges to Israel in the year of the US election increased Jordan's fears for its role in the final settlement negotiations and posed questions about the destiny of some 1.7 million Palestinian refugees, most of whom live in camps that lack strict security measures in Jordan." Moreover, the chance of establishing a Palestinian state on the borders of 1967 has become unprecedentedly meager, thus reassuring Jordan that the timing of Abdullah-Bush summit is inappropriate and putting us in a critical situation before the Jordanian street, which increasingly hates the American and Israeli policies in Iraq and Palestine.
The US pressure on Jordan coincided with internal security deterioration, as Jordan found itself, for the first time, face to face with hard-line groups which came from Syria and Iraq with trapped cars and poisonous gases. Amman was a scene of bloody confrontations between the police and fundamentalist networks which include Iraqis, Syrians and Palestinians.

Under this heading, deputy chief editor of Al-Hayat Abdel Wahab Badrakhan writes to say: If the Arab summit is held on 22 May next, can Arab leaders blame US President for committing through the "Balfour-Bush Declaration", a political annihilation of the Palestinian cause, and because his ally, the Israeli criminal of war, took advantage of the green light to translate this annihilation militarily?
Such discourse should appeal to "America's Arabs", if they were still interested in the cause of an Arab people under occupation forces that deal with it with terrorism and savagery and form a focus of sabotage and enmity in the region.
Rather, the Iraqi side would have demands other than those of the US and the US agenda.
According to the latest reports about the Greater Middle East plan, the Europeans describe the new American version of the plan as worse than the first one.

American calculations in Iraq are inaccurate.
One feels that the establishment of democracy after the fashion of the West is a farfetched matter.
In light of the Iraqi sufferings, the Arabs expected that Bush's administration would take a step to ease the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in order to encourage the Arabs to take a cooperative stand siding with it in Iraq.
Simply, Bush seems to be asking the Palestinians to put up with some changes that took place on the ground and the lessons that should be extracted from any realistic reading of the imbalance of power.
His following explanations about the necessity of putting an end to the final status issues through negotiations don't, however, eliminate concerns, as the American president considers Sharon's disengagement plan a magnificent and historic opportunity for the world's cooperation to establish a Palestinian state based on institutional rather than individual rules.

The experts proved their argument by saying that the customs cuts were issued three months ago, as they went down from 20 to 5 percent. However, this step led to no increase in iron imports, as the Committee on Monthly Follow-up of Iron Prices proved that importers refrained from importing rebar after they had discovered that its prices abroad are higher than its prices in Egypt, let alone the rise of transportation and freight charges, in addition the high quality of Egyptian rebar.
"The retreat of rebar prices by 700 pounds per ton against its prices last March has nothing to do with the reduction of customs duties imposed on iron imports. Rather, it is attributed to a nosedive in China's consumption of rebar, which hit 30 percent of world market by the end of the last year," head of Al-Ahali Real Estate Development Company Hussein Sabbour said. "Real estate development allocations of China's last year budget may be over."

He attributed this to poor production atmosphere, high cost of production, high customs, the ineptness from which technical and human cadres suffer, in addition to problems related to airports, harbours and export outlets.

The reports and the figures of the Central Bank of Egypt disclose part of this farce in privatization program, as these reports say that 76% of public enterprise sector companies, 241 companies out of 314 companies, have been sold but their proceeds did not exceed 16,741 billion pounds. Meanwhile, Premier Atef Ebeid said that the companies' proceeds hit 12.6 billion pounds, and then 12 billion pounds only after six months.
We discussed these figures with law experts.
UN Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi insisted on his recent comments calling Israel "poison" in the Middle East region. UN Secretary-General Kofi Anan said Brahimi's comments on the Zionist entity only expressed his envoy's personal viewpoint.
America's persistent support of Israel is a main obstacle to his mission, he said.
Attributing Brahimi's anti-Israel comments to the UN, the Israeli government is not satisfied with the argument that such remarks only expressed his personal views as they were made by a senior UN official, the Israeli envoy said.
Ma'ariv quoted sources in the office as saying that Sharon informed Bush of his initiative that he was absolved of Arafat-related pledge. This is a precautionary step in preparation for any fault in the operation of transferring Arafat to Gaza, lest he would be harmed in the operation.
It is the fourth exhibition to be opened for selling Iraqi antiquities in Israel since the fall of Iraq in April last year.
Dr. Mahmoud Khalil, a professor of Economics in Haifa University told Al-Ittihad that Iraqi antiquities trade flourishes in all parts of Israel, which positively affected its economy particularly with the large number of Israeli companies operating now in Baghdad, around 100 companies. This urged senior officials to open a number of museums for trading in Iraqi antiquities since the fall of Iraq.
He added that Israel is expected to become - if the major economic organizations and institutions defending property rights and heritage in the world failed to confront it - a hub for trade in these antiquities across the world just as it has become - due to its suspicious relations - a big international hub for trade in African diamond across the world.
The only exception among such reasons was mainly this: radically securing Israel against the Iraqi threat, a reason which has never been revealed by the American policy and which it spared no effort to conceal.
Israel, in fact, was over the moon about such a strategic change which relieved her of the burden of worrying about a potential revival of the Eastern front especially as she was reassured about the silence of the other surrounding Arab fronts.
However the post Iraqi case developments makes it incumbent to wonder whether Israel could achieve all its goals of the war which is still called its war on Iraq. Any simplified reply to the question may be erroneous.
There are other factors away from either love or hatred of the Palestinians which have complicated penetrating the Iraqi repelling wall. Some Iraqi forces, in an attempt to reverse the former regime's behaviour claimed that Israel need not be antagonized and tried to drag popular sectors to such a course, such a discourse, however, was lent deaf ears and had, therefore, to withdraw their (uncovered) cards perhaps in wait for another chance. They, in any case, have almost disappeared or withdrawn from the scene.
We haven't broached the topic of Haifa pipeline and will never broach it. Nor was it technically or administratively examined. This statement confirmed the ridiculousness of Israeli claims in that regard which almost convinced everybody that only a few buttons need to be pressed in order that deserted pipeline which was heavily damaged might come to life again.
In such a climate of the Iraqi approach to Israel, there can be no solid ground for any talk about Israeli penetration through Jewish capital. Capital, let alone Jewish capital, usually refrains from any multifarious extension into a region infested with tension, insecurity and prospective haziness, which makes such talk a bit exaggerated.
The matter is much deeper and is more related with a set of constants than with variables. The Iraqi Governing Council condemned the assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin without caring about a contrary American stance.
Chairman of Libyan Sport Olympic Games Committee Mohamed Gaddafi, son of Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi, met with some of the Chess Federation officials and informed them that the participation in the championship would be available for all.
Investigations with "Ansaar Al-Islam" (Islam Supporters) elements arrested ten days ago in Sulaimaneya and Irbil, North Iraq, resulted in new information about the organizational structure adopted by cells similar to Al-Qaeda network in the region, a security source in the Iraqi Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) said to Al-Hayat.
The elements lately arrested in North Iraq cities are all Iraqis, according to the Kurdish source, who said that they could not have been arrested but for the help of Sulaimaneya inhabitants.
The Kurdish source denied that the PUK had handed over any of the detainees to the US forces, pointing out that the regional government in North Iraq had its own courts of law that would try them.
Ha'iri, who has been living in the Iranian city of Qom for over 25 years, yearned to go back home one year ago, directly following the downfall of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. But, the coalition authority denied him access to Iraqi soil, accusing him of stirring up violence and sedition not only against coalition forces but also between Shi'ites and Sunnites, Shi'ites and Kurds and among Shi'ites themselves.
According to a source close to the Iranian presidency, Ha'iri started to reconsider his thoughts following the engagement of Moqtada Sadr, who is now holed up in Najaf, into military clashes with coalition forces, provoking Shi'ite Authority Chief Ayatollah Ali Sistani and his allies Ayatollah Ishak Fayadh and Ayatollah Mohamed Said al-Hakim.
AL PREPARED TO HOST IRAQI FORCES RECONCILIATION CONFERENCE
WASHINGTON REFUSES TO SIGN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH GCC
Al-Sirisi also held talks with Lebanon, Syria and Morocco as some agreements would be concluded with these countries soon.
In a statement to Al Hayat, he pointed out that the enhancement of Iraqi democracy scares regional countries.
He denied any relation between the decision taken by the American governor Paul Bremer to return hundreds or thousands of Baathists to their posts and the ramifications of the security situation and Falluja and Kufa crises.
"LARGEST MERCENARY ARMY IN WORLD": OUR GOAL IS TO PROVIDE PROSPERITY AND DEMOCRACY TO IRAQIS
Blackwater head office is based in a small city in northern North Carolina near the border with Virginia.
In a new support of the American occupation of Iraq and in an effort to help U.S. forces in Iraq, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members will be ready to dispatch troops equipped with sophisticated arms to Iraq once the UN Security Council adopts a resolution before the end of this month authorizing military involvement in the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq, the Kuwaiti Assyasa paper reported on Saturday.
Among these secret maps, the map of partitioning Iraq was demonstrated. According to the map that was drawn under the auspices of Britain and its allies following the collapse of the Ottoman Caliphate, Iraq was dismantled into three states; Shiite in south Iraq, Sunnite in central Iraq and Kurdish in the north and northeast.
Moreover, the area now called by the US and European mass media as the "Sunnite triangle or central Iraq" is not peopled by the Sunnites only as falsely alleged, but rather the number of the Kurds, Shiites and Turkmen who settle in Central Iraq is equal to the Sunnite population.
Additionally, the US and its allies' formation of the so-called "Interim Governing Council" (IGC) in Iraq according to the religious, doctrinal and ethnical shares is a reflection of the geopolitical division initiated by the US project based upon Dr. Lewis' project. The IGC will not realize the US objectives, according to which this project was laid down, especially as it has become clear that it is an interim "governed" rather than "governing" council.
STUDY: EGYPT'S PRODUCTION OF WHEAT MAY SATISFY DEMAND
Egypt's imports of wheat went down from 7.2 million tons in 1990 to 5.7 million tons in 1992. However, wheat imports during the period 1994-2003 revolved around 5 and 6.5 million tons despite the growing increase of population, it said.
The study also demanded that prices of domestic wheat be increased in order to encourage producers.
Moreover, when Noweiba Mountain is exploited, 2 million tons of raw materials will be extracted in the second stage, so that tantalum production would reach 840,000 pounds per annum. Production will start in June 2005.
It was decided to establish an Egyptian-Romanian Company with a capital of LE40 million to provide new industrial cities with natural gas. The new company will work under the share system. The Romanian party's share in the new company will hit 25% in addition to providing modern technology and experience in administration. The remaining share will be contributed by Ministry of Petroleum, 5%, Ministry of Housing and Urban Communities, 25% and project owners at Badr City, 50%.
PUBLIC BANKS LOOK FOR A MINISTRY
They highlighted the necessity of defining a ministry to which banks should be affiliated to guarantee coordination between and support of their works.
Board member and general director of Banque de Caire Gamil Salim said that the public banks and their general assemblies were affiliated to the former premier, but now in the new government the body or the ministry to which public banks are affiliated is unknown, unlike the bourse, the capital market, and insurance networks which are under Investment Development Ministry. This will affect the work mechanism in banks that should be affiliated to a ministry to support and buttress their tendencies, Salim said, calling for the issuance of a decision regarding banks' affiliation to a certain ministry to avoid contradiction and ensure coordination between banks.
While economic milieus in Egypt expressed cautious optimism about choosing Dr Ahmed Nazif to form the new government, businessmen and economic experts voiced their fear of re-applying the same economic policies that were adopted by the previous government, which took the public debt to unprecedented limits increased the deficit of the state's public budget and caused economic recession.
For his part, chief of 10th of Ramadan City Investors Association Dr Mahmoud Sulyman asked the new government to follow in the footsteps of the countries which had the same conditions like Egypt and managed to achieve high growth rates like India.
He raised his eyebrows regarding the justifications of choosing Nazif to form the new government which are: to take Egypt to the age of information and technology. More than 50% of the Egyptians are under poverty line and a great deal of them cannot earn their living. Unemployment rates are on the increase.
He ascribed his optimism to the government reshuffle, which was a demand by all dealers of the bourse, after the government failed to save the country from the chronic economic recession.
50% said that the ex-government performance was "weak", 30% said "acceptable" and 20% said "good".
The first level includes increasing the number of branches inside and outside Egypt. At the internal level, the bank has got the approval of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) of setting up two new branches, one in Sharm El-Sheikh district and another in Nasr City district.
The bank already has 5 branches in different areas in Rumania in a step that aims to support its presence in the European Union (EU) region as Rumania will join the EU by 2007 .
An agreement with another company whose name was not identified is going on.
The bank also studies offering the Call Center service in the bank as well as introducing mobile bank service. The bank has also finished the development of its website.
On the other hand, the bank put up a new system for evaluating the performance of personnel based on the periodical assessment based on certain objective factors and principles. The administration would take some measures following the annual evaluation. It would determine to what extent its personnel are in need of training, new employees or increasing awards and promotions in a way that would led to the improvement of the performance of all personnel.
Japan International Cooperation Bank, he added, would manage the loan allocated for purchasing the equipment necessary for production. This equipment would be given to the Japanese Mitsewi that acts as a contractor of the turnkey project.
PSAMLRC is an Egyptian joint stock company which 24 agricultural societies and 283 members of 6th October Warriors Agricultural Cooperative Society contribute. A specialized Chinese delegation had visited the project site 17 kilometers off south Port Said. All the project needs were identified including equipment, building and machinery.
The report expected that the Stock Exchnage would benefit by the privatization process and that foreign investors would return to the Egyptian market. The privatization operations will focus on the strategic investor who has the right of administration.
In its report on the state final account for the FY 2002/2003, received by the People's Assembly Plan and Budget Committee, the CAA said there was a marked contrast in trade activity revenues, hitting 7.6 million pounds, as actual receipts recorded 26.9 million pounds, but the target was 34.5 million. Service funds paid by exhibitors amounted to 1.954 million pounds, 1.546 million lower than that the 3.5-million-pound target.
The exhibition total expenses hit 247,000 pounds, and contributions hit 102,000 pounds only.
The CAA called for carrying out necessary feasibility studies before organizing foreign exhibitions.
Members of the Egyptian side in the council will head for Washington next week to participate in the meetings that will be held next Wednesday. The meetings will include a number of commercial officials from the two countries.
US CONDITIONS FOR QIZ PROJECTS
The American market only receives 46% of total Egyptian textile and ready-made clothes exports. The quota of Egyptian products to the American market started to retreat in the last few years in favour of the Jordanian textiles that enjoy customs privileges, as Jordan signed a QIZ agreement 5 years ago.
Deputy executive director and senior economist of the Egyptian Economic Studies Centre Dr. Samiha Fawzi said, "The establishment of QIZ in order to maintain the Egyptian exports quota of textiles on the US market is extremely sensitive for many reasons, forefront of which is the fact that the Egyptian textile exports, accounting for 498 million dollars out of a 1.40 billion dollars, have a big quota that affects the structure of Egypt's exports in general and the US market in particular. The bad situation in the region and Israeli practices against the Palestinians do not encourage that step, at least for the time being."
Yesterday (11th July) a new round of negotiations between the European Commission and the government kicked off in Cairo regarding the implementation of the second stage "TEP B" of the program of enhancing trade, which is funded by the European Union with a total of 66 million euros.
It is to be mentioned that the two stages of TEP A and TEP B were signed in late May last in Cairo.
The council's meeting, to start with, was obviously given official attention as part of the meetings attended by Egyptian petroleum minister, Eng. Sameh Fahmi and British minister of trade and investment who emphasized his government's support of the council's activities. He said that he considered the council an important incentive to the development of bilateral trade.
IRAQI MILITARY EXPERTS CRITICIZE AMERICAN TACTICS IN FALLUJA BATTLE
He warned that in order to avoid failure in war, there should be a balance between military and political goals so that the former may promote the latter.
The Israeli expert wondered whether America could achieve her direct and indirect strategic goal behind fighting Falluja. He confirmed that America, together with alliance countries, had utterly failed, which reflected on the attitude of many countries which supported America in the war on Iraq. Such countries did not hesitate to express concern over the recent turn in Iraqi events on the eruption of the worst fight since the war broke out last year.
However, once they found themselves engaged in residential areas fights, every thing they had learnt evaporated.
Firstly, because they failed to achieve the goals announced before the fight - handing over the killers of the American civilians. They also failed to force Falluja fighters to hand over heavy arms.
He went on to say that resistance in the city had achieved a big success which was represented in the following:
The lessons learnt Major General Al-Shallal enumerates the lessons learnt from Falluja battle summing them up in the following points: The importance of intelligence and information activity in dealing with resistance operations. The failure to bet on sectarianism as Falluja battlefield showed unity while dealing with the enemy. The fifth column, however, emerged in a new form feigning support of the resistance but actually trying to rid it of every chance to invest victory or complete fortifications or intelligence information, or constructive cooperation between fighters and civilians and finally the emergence of a need to possess means of exploiting the Euphrates.
Under this headline, Al-Majalla, held an interview with former Egyptian assistant Foreign Minister Dr. Abdullah Al-Ashaal some excerpts from which run to the following effect:
A: There will be a sort of partial hand over of power to people in complete subordination to the American Administration and the American administrator. There will not be any transfer of power to the Iraqis in accordance with the option of the Iraqi people who may have elements that run counter to the American vision and the occupational presence of foreign forces thus creating the possibility of an armed conflict. That's why the USA won't allow any free elections that might lead to the Shiites' assumption of power.
Occupation forces, consequently, are trying to cut it to size or liquidate it until the stage of partial handover of power comes. They do not want Sadr to develop such a strength that could cause concern or give a pretext to the American Administration to take any measures to postpone the transfer of power to the Iraqis. The USA wants to drag the UN to the Iraqi bog so that the UN rather than the USA might bear the brunt of any fiasco of foreign presence in Iraq. They also want to bring NATO or multi national forces to take part in the massacres that take places in Iraq.
A: He who asks for a chance to occupation forces to construct Iraq is in the wrong as the USA did not go to Iraq to build it but rather to get its oil and build military bases on its territories and to remap the region's countries to serve American as well as Israeli interests. This will do harm to all Arab interests without exception, as that represents the USA concept of the issue.
Nor is the future of any country. All possibilities are on the cards on Iraqi lands as it has lost all sanctity, present, past, and perhaps future unless something new took place!
In a press conference held in Manama, Capital of Bahrain on Monday on the occasion of the end of the 5th meeting of the board of directors, Kamel uncovered a feasibility study on founding an international Islamic bank whose capital is expected to hit two billion dollars.

$1.7 BN LOSSES OF Q8
The sources said while the company continued the series of losses over the past 20 years, there was no serious position on its strategic plan.

Darwish, for his part, pointed out that he would convey those demands to the Syrian leadership.
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al Faysal admitted that Saudi Arabia together with the USA were to blame for "Al-Qaeda" phenomenon and Osama Bin Laden. He said that if Saudi Arabia was to blame for what has become of Bin Laden, the USA should certainly bear part of that blame.
He said that those conservatives do not preach the ideology of global expansion like that adopted by Al Qaeda but rather fanatic self-isolation from the ideology of modernity.
He went on saying that in order to achieve their goals, they had to drive a wedge between Saudi Arabia and the USA and, therefore, committed the September 11th terrorist attacks.
The Saudi foreign minister highlighted the kingdom's ability to overcome difficulties.
BIN LADEN THANKS BUSH!
Bush asks the Palestinian people and Arab countries to thank Sharon for his initiative to unilaterally withdraw from Gaza Strip and for the continuation of assassinating Palestinian leaderships and canceling the UN resolutions. Then, in order to ensure such achievements, he pledges an unlimited American support of Israeli racist separation wall to crush the Palestinian people and humiliate Arab peoples and regimes.
Noticeably, matters no sooner calm down a bit than American Israeli policies, which have been subjected to the subtlest coordination and control, lost no time in taking provocative measures, decisions or military operations that would add fuel to the fire of hatred and rejection against America.
It is needless to say that there is an unholy alliance that was formed and was unexpectedly reinforced between Bush and Sharon on the one hand and Bin Laden and international terrorism on the other hand.
The group is headed by former finance minister Dr Abdel-Wahab Othman, Communications Authority Secretary General (Minister of State) Al-Tayeb Mostafa maternal uncle of Sudanese President Omar Al-Bashir, former health minister Babakr Abdel-Salam.

In another development, Al-Hayat learnt in Asmara that the factions of the Sudanese opposition are tending to form a wide front comprising parties of the opposing "National Congress" and Ummah Party led by Al-Sadeq Al-Mahdi.
Everybody knows that the Americans do not recognize the city's inhabitants or resistance groups having any capacity for direct or even indirect negotiations.
Some Governing Council members tried to polarize them, but failed, especially with respect to collecting arms and pacifying clans in a bid to make conditions normal.
Then, came the atrocity of mutilating the Americans' corpses which made the occupation forces end any kind of truce in Falluja.
The American milieus say that the decision is in the hands of President Bush. This means that the matter is serious and would result in a lot of casualties (among the Americans of course), thus requiring a decision by the President himself.
The Iraqi "politicians" realized from this crisis that they have no effect on the American approach.
Some Iraqis are helping them, whether by paving the way for them, dying instead of them or even participating with them in taking revenge.
But this time, he might order that a campaign be launched to arrest Arab satellite channels ahead of the massacre.
These lists include a hike of 20% per potable water cubic meter for the houses whose consumption does not exceed 20 cubic meters, and a hike of 25% per cubic meter for those whose consumption reaches 30 cubic meters, which is the average consumption of more than 70% of citizens.

He confirmed that there is a big opportunity for joint manufacturing with Iraq as well as exporting foodstuff and electric appliances. The Egyptian Commercial Representation Bureau in Baghdad indicated that the Iraqi markets are full of Egyptian commodities but those commodities have been exported from countries other than Egypt.

They added that ex factory of cement does not exceed 214 pounds a ton including profit and sales taxes and transport charges. However, agents coordinate with companies to decrease production so that prices go up.

The question now is: To what extent can that retreat in dollar exchange rates in the parallel market cause a reduction in the prices of new cars?
We were not affected by sources development tax either, as it was imposed on tourist buses whose customs duties were 5%. When the duties of that tax increased, the tourist buses were not affected because it was slight. In addition, these buses were produced domestically and were neither affected by the dollar exchange rate nor the sources development tax.
Car price rose from 56,000 pounds and a pick up hits 18,000 to 94,000 pounds. These increases came after a long period of price stability, a matter that led to a recession in automobile market and a retreat in selling rates.

A STUDY: PRICING IRRIGATION WATER HARMFUL TO EGYPTIAN AGRICULTURE
In his study, Al-Gamasi criticized the World Bank's condition of irrigation water pricing as one of the items of an agreement to reduce Egypt's debts by 15%. He pointed out that a number of international economic institutions were persistently urging the Egyptian government to carry out the pricing.
Tampering with the metres were also probable, he added. Al-Gamasi pointed out a study prepared by a researcher financed by the USAID, in cooperation with Egyptian experts entitled "Determining Irrigation Costs and Its Impacts on Crop Structure and Net Return. The study concluded the threats posed to Egyptian agriculture might then out do such returns.

SERIOUS STATEMENTS BY ECONOMIC COMMITTEE CHAIRMEN ON QUALIFIED ZONES WITH ISRAEL
CONFLICT BETWEEN AL-WASAT AND AL-KARAMAH PARTIES TO POLARIZE A COPT
Abdel-Malak had joined the leftist Tagamo'h (Grouping) Party and the socialist Labour Party before he was convinced of the Islamic civilizational project due to his strong ties with late secretary general of the Labour Party Adel Hussein. He also published several books including one about his experiment with the Muslim Brotherhood when he entered the parliament on the Labour Party's list, which was in alliance with the Muslim Brotherhood.
Submission of candidature papers was over on Tuesday (May 4th) in 67 constituencies in which elections would be held to choose 88 MPs in addition to the 44 MPs who would be appointed as per a presidential decree.
NASSERITE PARTY UNVEILS FRESH REFORM INITIATIVE
Dawoud denied that his party's fresh initiative was a reaction to the Tagamo'h initiative. "There is no difference between the Tagamo'h and us. Our initiative would have been announced before the Tagamo'h, but it was delayed for some reasons," he said, emphasizing that his party's initiative agrees in many points with that of the Tagamo'h but it has many details in some other points, especially the issue of distributing responsibility among authorities unequivocally.
Shukr told Asharq Al-Awsat that the Ikhwan's initiative was not submitted to the politburo of the party; thus, no stance or opinion was adopted by the party. Any partisan or political powers have the right to express their views towards reform, but this does not mean that everyone will accept it, Shukr added.
Yesterday (30th April), Egypt and Iran signed an agreement for setting up a council for businessmen in both countries in a bid to boost bilateral economic and commercial relations.
The plan highlighted the necessity of rationalizing potable water consumption and sanitary drainage usage along with encouraging private sector access to the fields of drinking water and sanitary drainage in the fields of execution, operation, maintenance and pricing of these services.
The plan referred to the establishment of post-graduate faculties in the field of engineering, medicine and education. Study in these faculties will be in English and at the cost of students. It also aims at converting some schools, which have been financed by the state's investment plan, into cooperative school in order to refund the investment cost of these schools and build new ones. The plan will get all the society sectors involved in financing education to achieve quality and distinguished education level requirements.
Minister of Housing and New Urban Communities has already taken concrete actions to implement the presidential edict.
However, it seems that the problem of the internal debt has reached a crucial stage that cannot be disregarded and that radical solutions should be sought in order to get rid of the burdens of this debt.
It has been noticed that the dependence on redressing the deficit through treasury bonds and bills is on the increase year after year, as this percentage has been risen to 71.5% or 37.5 billion pounds in the FY 2004/2005 draft budget.
This will not be through reducing expenditure but rather rationalizing it and stopping luxury expenditure represented, particularly, in buying fabulous cars, refurbishing ministries' headquarters, government ads especially those that can be dubbed as social hypocrisy, running the government's stock piles wisely, and reducing celebrations and spending on travels and conferences, etc. The solution also includes activating the collection of government revenues, especially mature debts on high-income categories and the wealthy and redressing deficit in the public economic authorities, which should fund their activities out of their own resources and seek to achieve surpluses. Such economic authorities do not achieve surpluses although they practise activities which the private sector practices and made high profits. How can, for example, the Egyptian Radio and Television Union make losses while there are hundreds of private radio stations and television channels making profits?
He also urged the formulation of an integrated Islamic model for edification. "The Muslims themselves, rather than anyone else, should be held responsible, as they turned their acts of worship into mere routine work and neglected all elements of advancement and power," Gom'a said.
Even though we do not show enmity towards the Western peoples, we antagonize the injustice of their leaders."
Tolerance does not mean waiving the people's right to resist usurpers or occupiers or accepting a foreign occupation of an Arab and Muslim country, said Lebanese Mufti Sheikh Mohamed Rashid Qablani, pointing out that other cultures include examples of intolerance and hatred against the Muslims.
Dawood added, "The general attitude inside the party is increasingly adverse to the resumption of dialogue."

Deputy editor-in-chief of Al-Hayat, Abdel Wahab Badrakhan wrote: The United States used the International Quartet meeting to alleviate the Arabs' displeasure and anger at the "Bush promise" and to give a false impression that everything was as usual and nothing has changed in the American policy.
It might have been better if Rice herself had attended the Quartet meeting, so long as she expresses the core of American policy better than Powell does.
So long as the Quartet is unable to impose the international will on Sharon and his gang, how do they expect the Roadmap to be implemented, and why does Washington press for merging the Arab peace initiative into the Roadmap, which has practically turned into a tattered piece of paper that Sharon is now manipulating at will?
The Quartet was unable to make the Roadmap address the situation on the ground. Instead, it has fallen hostage to an American-Israeli methodology that deals with this situation for the standpoint of the "war on terrorism," which is a grave and essential mistake.
What is the use of telling the Arabs that these are your positions and that you insist on them, at the time when the Arabs are quite aware of your positions and have their reservations on your standpoints, motives and purposes?
It is the war criminal Ariel Sharon, not the Quartet or international legitimacy or the United Nations, that makes the decisions in the Middle East.
MESH'AL CALLS ARAB SUMMIT TO CONVEY FOUR MESSAGES TO PARTIES CONCERNED IN MIDDLE EAST
"When Sharon speaks about the unilateral disengagement plan, he aims at improving the image of Israel before the world to appear as if he was keen on providing concessions, but he does not find the Palestinian partner. He wants to get rid of the (demographic) burden of Gaza in return for legitimizing settlement in the West Bank. Sharon wants to sell us Gaza in return for the West Bank."
As for the internal Palestinian level, Mesh'al made fun of those who held Hamas responsible for the failure of the inter-Palestinian dialogue. "Hamas is not responsible for that failure. It is unreasonable to try to reproduce the futile settlement plans by which neither Israel nor America abide." He added, "The roadmap plan launched by American President George Bush was shredded by Bush himself before Sharon.

Yesterday, in a press release, Dr. Mahmoud Mohi Eddin emphasized that the new government sees some advantages in raising interest rates. He pointed out that such a step would lead to the containment of inflation and opening the door to making the pound a fully convertible currency.
Taha added that he actually believed that raising interest rates was of vital importance, adding that the Egyptian American Bank has tended for some time to raise them as the exchange problem was the stumbling block before the investor who could bear the borrowing cost differential in the short run provided that it shows up transparently in the budget.
Hassan said that a third factor that cannot be ignored when talking about interest rate trends which is the urgent need to activate economy and accelerate its rates, which would necessitate investment encouragement as was quite apparent in the recent cabinet reshuffle. There would, consequently, be no need to raise interest rates for the time being. There may be a need even to reduce them in addition to the removal of all obstacles to investment and the improvement of its climate. Since the early 1990s, he added, bank interest rates have been left to each bank to be determined in light of market, supply and demand factors.
Senior economic researcher in EFG Hermes Hani Geneina said that raising interest rates now would not help reduce inflation due to supply rather than demand factors but it might, in the long run, help reduce inflation as higher interest rates would make companies refrain from investment even though money employment rates are already nearly nil.

The military cannot be more human or ethical than their civilian dignitaries nor can they be more perceptive of political and social complications.
Such practices were systematic and regular but not an exception to the rule.

Will those leaders content themselves with the naive deduction that Bush just had to give guarantees to Sharon only for election reasons so much so that his implicit backtracking has become evident in Condoleezza Rice's statements where she emphasized that the final status was yet left to bilateral negotiations? His Secretary of State, Colin Powell also joins Quartet parties' talk about the termination of the Israeli occupation that started in 1967.
While Powell is partner in the former, but, is initially not one in the latter unless his agents were able to impose his own dictates.

Egypt received official confirmations from the Nile basin countries to the effect that there is no cooperation between any of these countries and Israel. Nor do they seek Israel's expertise in constructing unilateral projects that might prejudice the rights of any Nile basin country.

Former CBE governor, Ismail Hassan who is now president of Misr Iran Bank for Development said that it was not necessary to raise interest rates at the present time as the same pretexts cited for raising interest rates could be pretexts for refraining from taking such a step and seeking, instead, to coordinate between banks to reduce the current differentials between their interest rates.

A year ago, a fresh idea struck Fatehi Gomaa (42 years old) that he thought that none of Rafah or Gaza Strip inhabitants paid attention to. He decided to invest half a million dollars in setting up the first zoo in Gaza Strip.
Eight days ago, there was high rush to the zoo. The project's revenues were relatively high, too, until it was stormed by the Israeli occupation troops, who destroyed it and stole a number of rare parrots and birds while the remaining animals and birds were either killed or left to roam in the city's streets, thus jeopardizing people's lives.
Due to such crimes, the city's inhabitants advise each other not to invest their money in any economic project for fear of the occupation army.
Nasser's two brothers were planning to return to Rafah and live with him in the same house, which turned into rubbles after the occupation troops had dynamited it.

These countries are, namely Qatar, Yemen, Kuwait, Oman, Mauritania, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), they said, noting that some of those countries have already submitted requests to withdraw from the AL organs after the real presence of the AL has become so limited.
Egypt is expected to take part in the Pan-Arab Trade and Economic Integration Conference in the Jordanian capital of Amman on September 20-22 to discuss vistas for developing pan-Arab trade and economic integration.
A recent survey showed that pan-Arab trade did not exceed 8 percent of Arab foreign trade as a result of continued obstacles and disputes impeding the proposed major free trade zone, including non-customs and non-technical obstacles and taxes and duties, bureaucracy at customs offices, lack of Arab experts in preferential origin rules, exchanged dumping charges, hegemony of foreign currencies, especially the US dollar, over Arab deals, the weak Arab banking system and the marginal existing industry base. Investments in the Arab region is now estimated at 125 billion US dollars, around 20 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), while the Arab world needs 210 billion US dollars annually to raise growth rate and end joblessness.
He pointed out that the development of current investments and their new expansions or external promotions their would not happen without the help of experts and specialists in various fields.

EGYPTIAN INVESTMENTS FLEE TO GULF COUNTRIES
Investors confirmed UAE and Turkey are enjoying unique competitiveness that makes production cost less than other countries, which gives their products high competitiveness. They revealed that Egypt is considered the highest country in the region in terms of production cost, which weakens the competitiveness of national products on foreign markets, let alone the obstacles, exaggerated charges and routine procedures imposed on investors.
It is to be mentioned that government reports have admitted to the retreat of the volume of foreign Arab or local investments besides a 35% retreat in the number of the new companies that have been set up.

There are clear regulations for privatization and reconstruction in yarn and textile sector, foremost of which are preserving public funds and ensuring labor rights whether currently time or in the future, said the minister, pointing out that pumping new investments in this sector is conditional upon two things: either reducing losses rates or achieving profit.
Minister of Investment Dr. Mahmoud Mohi Eddin pointed out that direct foreign investments went down from 2 billion pounds to 250-450 million pounds last year, a decline of 80%. During the General Assembly for Yarn and Textile Workers Conference yesterday (25th August), the minister said there had been a remarkable decline in the volume of local, foreign, Arab and governmental investments in Egypt during the last five years, a matter that aggravated the unemployment problem.
"I was appointed to boost Egyptian investments," he noted, adding that intensive talks are currently underway to review the methods of selling Public Enterprise Sector companies to ensure preserving public funds and labour rights.
The company could not raise its exports due to its commitment to the fulfillment of domestic plants' needs, especially ore billet and galvanized sheet. A major part of the company's export earnings goes to Al-Nasr Coke Company as the former consumes one billion pounds' worth of coke production supplies on an annual basis, he said.
In reply to inquiries raised by MPs, the minister said in his message, "Egyptian pharmaceutical industry is able to bridge the gap and square up to the mafia of such companies and their attempt to control the drug market, which is characterized with a special sensitivity."
They emphasized that Egypt would not submit to any pressure and that medicine was a strategic commodity that should be treated in a special way that would not load low-income citizens with any extra burdens.
It is to be mentioned that an Arab investor suggested Electricity and Energy Minister Dr. Hassan Yunis to allow private companies to sell electricity.
A report by the Cairo Chamber of Commerce showed that Egyptians' vegetable and fruit consumption has been on the wane in recent years.
Per capita consumption of fruit recorded its highest levels in 1999 and 2000, ranging between 68 kg and 67 kg.
Dr. Yunis stressed the electricity sector keenness on supporting Egyptian companies to obtain projects and works outside Egyptian borders and exporting locally produced electricity equipment and machines to different international markets.
This was declared by Minister of Supply and Home Trade Dr. Hassan Khidr yesterday.
Egyptian Minister of Supply and Home Trade Hassan Khidr is expected to hold a meeting with French Grain Export Association Chairman Jane Jack Fremoze on September 4 on reinforcing Egyptian-French relations in the area of exporting grains, especially wheat.
Yesterday, Minister of Foreign Trade and Industry Eng. Rashid Mohamed Rashid and the Executive Manager of JETRO (Japanese External Trade Organization), which is considered one of the biggest and most important economic organizations concerned with Japanese trade development, discussed ways and means of setting up an authority for the development of Egyptian exports to international markets, on the Japanese organization's model through drawing on the economic, marketing and technical expertise in the field of exporting Egyptian products and the enhancement of the Egyptian exporters dealings with international markets especially the Japanese one with particular emphasis on raising Egyptian products specifications to the international standards of quality and competitiveness.
The minister added that the volume of Egyptian exports to Japan had risen in the first quarter of this year compared with last year. He went on saying that the Egyptian exports were mainly cottons and their textiles, vegetables, fruit, medical and aromatic herbs as well as a number of food commodities and leatherware.
The JICA's negotiations are intended to persuade those African countries to allow the Japanese agency to grow new highly yielding and pest resistant categories of rice in a bid to guarantee food security in Africa.
The government has received a Japanese offer to set up a free trade zone between the two countries to be a nucleus of a free trade zone between Japan and Arab countries, said General Director of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Industry's Bilateral Commercial Agreements Department Said Abdullah.
The Commercial Agreements Sector has prepared a study over the feasibility of concluding a free trade zone agreement between Egypt and Japan in which the measures of importation, exportation and aspects of Japanese market's consumption were reviewed.
Therefore, there should be a margin of tolerance especially with regard to Japan's imports, it stated. Japan imposes more than 20 non-customs restrictions on its imports, which should be met whether a free trade agreement was signed or not, the study said.
Saudi imports of frozen vegetables have increased by 54% on average during 1998-2003 to reach 256,000 tons in 2003, with a market share of 0.11% of total world imports of frozen vegetables.
Customs duties on imported cement which hit 10% on in bulk and 20% on packaged cement, said Minister of Foreign Trade and Industry Rashid Mohamed Rashid, pointing out that such a decision would be applied as part of the new amendments to customs tariffs. The Ministry of Finance would finish the preparation of the final formula that includes those new amendments. This step came after the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Industry and some other ministries had reduced customs duties on the main commodities and redressed deformities in the current tariffs, hence the reduction in the commodities production costs. This contributes to increasing their competitive edge in local and foreign markets.
He pointed out that the cement sector in Egypt enjoys competitive advantages such as the availability of labour, cheap energy and local raw materials. It is also considered one of the sectors that attract both local and foreign investments, noting that attracting investments to this or any other sector is one of the main interests of the government. "Cement is an investment promising sector. We provide incentives to local and foreign investments as new investments mean providing new job opportunities, increasing competition and pushing production capacity up.
It surged up in the first half of 2004 to hit 220 million pounds, a rise of 170% in comparison to the same period last year. He added that the leap which cement exportation had witnessed, made Egyptian cement reach a distinguished position on overseas markets due to its high quality and cheap price in comparison with international prices.
He accused those foreign businesses of pursuing the undercutting policy to control the cement market after holding 42 percent of Egyptian plants' productive capacity.
These companies have initially agreed on raising cement prices up to 185 pounds per ton, 220 pounds per ton and then 300 pounds, 150 percent over 15 months, the deputy said.
Although dumping duties on construction rebar imports have been scrapped for almost one month, no contracts have been clinched so far. Some importers even traveled to Ukraine, Russia and Turkey, but failed to hammer out any import contracts due to high construction iron prices as a single ton in those countries are priced at around 3,530 pounds while its local price is still 2,250 pounds in spite of exaggeration.
Kinds of sheet iron to be imported from Ukraine and Russia, even if it is cheap, will not be good for Egyptian plants, he said. Chairman of the Chamber of Engineering Industries Nabil Farid said Egyptian plants clinched contracts to import sheet iron, which is expected to appear at the market within three months' time. It will be sold at lower prices due to the dumping customs cancellation.
The sources pointed out that producing companies opted for reducing prices in a bid to re-attract construction companies which suspended the execution of several works and projects due to the recent exorbitant price rise which created a state of severe recession.
Minister of Agriculture and Land Reclamation Ahmed Al-Leithi decided to renew the ban on importing cows and their products and fodder additives including the powder of cows' meats and bones from the European countries for another three months.

WASHINGTON INVITES 5 ARAB LEADERS TO G-8 SUMMIT
American officials said that in the summit that would be held on an island in Georgia on 8th-12th June next, the administration would declare a new revised formula of the Greater Middle East (GME) plan which has been formulated in coordination with the NATO countries and Arab and Muslim countries to launch economic and political reforms.
The initiative, which offers partnership in the military and security fields, would be launched in the NATO summit in Istanbul late next month.
He expected that one billion dollars per annum would be allocated for financing the ambitious project, with contributions from European and some regional countries.
The communique pointed out that Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Morocco had not been included on the invitation list.
It was announced that AGFUND chief Prince Talal bin Abdelaziz would sign in Jordan an agreement on establishing the National Bank for Financing Small-Sized Projects within his initiative to control poverty in the Arab world in cooperation with governments and the private sector.
The epithet of "emergency" or "extraordinary" was attached to (14 Arab summits out of 28 ones held in 49 years. Most of the emergency events that led to the convention of those summits were the Israeli wars on Arab countries. Lebanon, one of the Arab League (AL) cofounders, got the lion's share of those summits, as the consecutive Israeli wars and Lebanon's internal schisms required the convention of more than one summit the interval between some of them was six days like what happened in 1976. Lebanon also played host to the Arab summits in 1996 and 2002.
EU SEEKS TO CONCLUDE AGREEMENTS WITH SYRIA REGARDLESS OF AMERICAN SANCTIONS
Those talks came within the framework of the Barcelona Process launched in 1995 to promote political, security, cultural and economic relations between the European Union and 12 of its neighbouring countries in the Mediterranean Sea basin.
The American President George W. Bush banned all American exports to Syria apart from foods and medicines accusing Damascus of backing terrorism, seeking to develop weapons of mass destruction and failure to prevent anti-USA hardliners from crossing borders to Iraq.
Calling on Muslims to boycott it, Al-Fawzan said, "A Muslim should not undermine his home for untrue allegations, especially as Al-Jazeera spreads much evil and incitement because it interviews people who issue confusing fatwas that violate sharia.
A seminar on "Repercussions of what is happening in Iraq on Kuwait's security," organized by the Gulf Center for Strategic Studies and run by the Center's advisor Major General Gamal Mazloum to discuss the potential repercussions of various developments witnessed by Iraq under occupation on Kuwait's security uncovered Kuwait misgivings in that regard through pinpointing the emergence of the Shiites as a power seeking to establish a role in political life in the new Iraq on the grounds of their numerical majority, which may represent a threat to some Gulf states. A sign of such a threat showed up when the Shiite leader Moqtada Al-Sadr called on Kuwait on April 7th to drive the American forces out of Kuwait as the latter no longer needed such forces after deposing Saddam Hussein, according to Sadr who added that Kuwait should help the Iraqis get rid of the primary factor of terrorism in Iraq (he meant the USA).
The third scenario predicts chaos running amok spreading instability and civil wars that may impose the partitioning of Iraq and the prevalence of political factionalism on the one hand and the continuation of Anglo-American occupation without being capable of decisive action on behalf of the American project in Iraq.
In a telephone conversation with Asharq Al-Awsat, Al-Yawer said that Iraq would still need multinational forces due to its dismal security situation. He wished that Arab forces would have an effective rather than a token presence adding that he had informed the American President George Bush that the Iraqis would welcome his country's forces if they behaved as guests, but would reject such presence as occupation forces.
This is our vision according to which we will act in international and Arab spheres. We will also demand support from all governments to pass a new Security Council resolution cancelling resolution 1483 and granting us full sovereignty.
Q: Will coalition forces actually quit Iraq?
We don't want to stay at the mercy of any particular group.
Q: There is contradictory information about the formation of a transitional government, how far did negotiations and efforts go in that concern?
Q: Will it follow the factional and national quota system?
Q: There seems to be some change in the Kurdish position regarding the presidency issue as they demand one of the two positions, the President or the Premier.
The Arabs in Iraq constitute over 75% of the population. The quotas that have showed up recently in Iraq are rather strange. First, they classified us as Sunnites and Shiites then as Arabs and Kurds. In fact, we want to be Iraqis and nothing but Iraqis as the essence of belonging is Iraq although each party may hold fast to its background in high esteem.
Q: Will its members be selected through elections?
The republican palace was not a palace of Saddam or even built by Saddam. It was built during the Monarchy era and throughout previous eras it was regarded as a symbol of Iraq. I wonder it there is any reason why the Americans should seize it.
Jordan renewed demands to extradite member of the Iraqi Governing Council and Iraqi National Congress leader Ahmed Chalabi for trial in a case of Jordanian Petra Bank funds embezzlement.
The request to extradite Al Chalabi comes at a time the USA is launching an unprecedented political campaign on Ahmed Chalabi amid leaks of information about the American forces intentions to have him arrested shortly.
The same sources, however, emphasized that Governing Council member Ghazi Al-Yawer was the only name proposed now for presidency. An agreement, which is, however, not final, has been reached by Iraqi forces under Lakhdar Brahimi supervision, assigned the President's position to a Sunnite, the Premier's to a Shiite and the two vice-president's positions to a Kurd and a Shiite.
The exclusion of Al-Pachachi from presidency seems to have strengthened the chances of Mahdi Al-Hafiz for that position because both men belong to the same political grouping. The premier's position was subject to more controversy than that of the President's.
However, that man was met with so many objections especially from Shiite forces. He was finally excluded due to information about his work during his absence from Iraq for an Iranian nuclear reactor, which the Americans could not possibly neglect.
Observers of the Iraqi political situation emphasize that the state of emergency will necessarily be put into force after power is handed over to the Iraqis on June 30th next because the situation there can not be controlled except through such security procedure.
Such forces, especially policemen, even sustained much losses, as about 800 policemen have been killed up till now. Another unqualified number of them has also been laid off, especially as some of them exploited their posts and committed violations.
It just monitors, watches, criticizes and warns but without causing the fire to extend to it.
However, as there are no other winners, Iran seems to be the major winner so far.
It watched the regime that bled it for years fall under the blows of the "Big Satan's" machine.
Iran, once again started to win.
All elections in Iraq would necessarily reflect demographic facts, the Shiite role will be larger than before.
Even Zarqawi who could find a shelter in Iraq can find no suitable circumstances for expanding into Iran.
The Arabs would not find it easy to stand such a balance disruption with Iran accused of having nuclear aspirations.
The foes have engaged in such loggerheads with each other that Iran started reaping profits without having to pay any costs.
This election is considered a positive message to the reformist trend and President Mohamed Khatemi's government in his last year of the second term in office, as he has confidence in Adel, who promised the new parliament (controlled by the conservatives) to be cooperative with Khatemi's government.
On the other hand, Mohamed Reza Bahonar was elected first deputy speaker. He is a prominent theorist of the conservative trend's strategy. Bahonar is not a clergy either.
Rohani has been recently assigned the responsibility of the nuclear file.
However, Amnesty International described Washington's policies in fighting terrorism worldwide as void of prospective vision, as it gives up human rights in order to blindly achieve security.
Avivi even alluded that he may practise pressure on Turkey through the pro-Israel lobby in the United States by saying that he was facing many problems due to inquiries, which he alleged that he received from such a lobby, about the reasons for Ardogan and Gul's refrainment from visiting Tel Aviv. Turkey disregarded an Israeli offer to set up an energy pipeline under the Mediterranean Sea to link the two parties, Avivi uncovered.
GUL ANNOUNCES EGYPT HAS CONFIRMED OWNERSHIP OF CONFISCATED WEAPONS SHIPMENT
Meanwhile, Turkish Sabah newspaper said hat the NATO had monitored the shipment, through satellites, since its departure from Ukrainian military store but independent sources did not confirm that information.
A senior official of the White House said on Friday (June 4th) that the US administration understood President Hosni Mubarak's apology for not attending the G-8 summit, which will discuss the Greater Middle East initiative.
The US proposed in a paper it will submit to the G-8 summit forming new corporations to reinforce economy in the region and push forward social and political reforms.
Advocates of the first trend oppose the idea of reform and change and seek to promote an idea that reform is considered a response to external demands, especially American ones.
Observers see that the enormous articles on reform and change written by chief editors and published recently in major national papers were test balloons for causing controversy in the Egyptian street to poll opinions of political and cultural elite and sort out attitudes and take them into account when reaching a final view on reform steps and the nature of change.
It was learnt that former ambassadors, judges and thinkers who do not belong to political parties or the opposition are preparing a memo to be presented to the Presidency. The memo includes proposals and mechanisms which, according to them, should be adopted in order to tackle the problems Egypt faces.
Ahead of the Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom's visit to Egypt on 7 June, an Egyptian well-informed source denied reports that the recent Egyptian contacts seek to impose Egyptian security control over Gaza with the aim of securing Israel against the Palestinians.
Concerning Shalom's talks in Egypt, the source said the talks would touch upon the measures to be taken to guarantee the PA control over the territories in Gaza and the West Bank from which the Israelis would withdraw. Egypt insists that Israeli withdrawal should be complete and a step for withdrawal from the West Bank and a step within the framework of the road map peace plan.
We tried to convince him of that. But it is not an easy matter for him."
STATE SECURITY PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE INVESTIGATES CHARGES WITH TORTURING IKHWAN DETAINEES AND DEATH OF ONE OF THEM
The prosecution will also investigate reports regarding about ten detained defendants having been subjected to torture in police stations to which they were transported from Tora prison where they were supposed to be remanded in custody.
Hassan added that Tora prison administration refused to permit members of defence committee to visit the defendants, then it allowed 9 to be visited who were reduced to just four in the presence of all prison officers who refused to bring the rest of the defendants.
Asharq Al-Awsat learnt that a committee of professors of law and ruling National Democratic Party deputies have almost completed a bill on practising political life as a prelude to referring it to the People's Assembly (PA) and the Shura Council (Advisory) in the next parliamentary session.
If, moreover, he insists on that, he would excluded from the slate in favour of another candidate nominated by his party.
The sources uncovered that law professors and experts in law and the Constitution participate in reviewing the bill prior to putting it up for public and extensive discussions. They pointed out that the bill would be amenable to deletion and addition to cope with the Constitution provisions and remove all provisions that are suspected of contravening the Constitution.
In the meanwhile, the slate election system according to the sources and the prospects of the new bill, will put an end to the attempt of capital to control the elections and the ebbing of thuggery acts and riot which mainly eliminated individual elections in the 1990,1995 and 2000 elections and which claimed the lives of several citizens who fell in the battles of competition. It also contributes to the elimination of family tribalism and urge deputies to exercise their control and legislative roles.
It is to be mentioned that Tehran has severed diplomatic relations with Egypt in 1979 in protest against the conclusion of the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Accord.
Iranian diplomatic sources pointed out joint agreement on concentrating on the positive points in bilateral relations and avoiding the negative points till contacts succeed in restoring matters to their previous conditions before 1979.
Ruling party organ, Mayo, quoted Al-Sherif as saying, "It is President Mubarak who has a final say in that matter, under his constitutional competence (as President).

IRRIGATION MINISTER: 8 THOUSAND ISRAELI EXPERTS IN NILE BASIN COUNTRIES
PA INQUIRY ABOUT ASSASSINATION OF EGYPTIAN SCIENTIST IN IRAQ
The family confirmed that some family members visited him three weeks ago in the detention camp and he was well.
Hassan said that he had warned the Foreign Ministry and the government, since the beginning of the Anglo-American occupation of Iraq, that scientists were targeted, as is the case with some Iraqi scientists.
Egyptian opposition parties failed to reach agreement on a unified political reform paper to be referred to the government amid increasing demands to achieve a comprehensive reform through an internal will without any foreign interference.
The sources emphasized that the opposition parties were seeking to prepare a unified reform paper in an effort to close up opposition ranks and reach joint demands regarding political reform.
The same faces the Egyptians have seen for decades rule and oppose. Only ministers and legitimate party leaders who are not known by the people are changed.
People's Assembly Speaker Dr. Fatehi Sorour was born in 1932, the same year when head of the opposition Tagamo'h (Grouping) Party Dr. Ref'at Al-Saeed was born.
Al-Ummah Party leader Ahmed Al-Sabahi is the oldest of all ministers and oppositionists as he was born in 1915.
No one in Egypt opposes the existence of some old ministers or opposition leaders, but the strange thing here is the fact that those "old people" represent the majority or perhaps dominate the political arena.
Higher Education and Scientific Research Minister Dr. Mufid Shehab and Industry Minister Dr. Ali Al-Sa'edi were born in 1936. Interior Minister Habib Al-Adli and Minister of Culture Farouk Hosni were born in 1938.
Minister of Insurance and Social Affairs Dr. Amina Al-Gendi was born in 1942.
Three MPs with the People's Assembly (parliament) worked out a new draft law, the first of its kind, providing for imposing progressive taxes on the property of the affluent and the well-to-do of the Egyptian people in order to increase resources.
The draft law proposes imposing charges to increase resources, on chalets, villas and posh houses sprouting in the new cities, especially in tourist villages.
They also emphasized that the articles of the project would not impose any new burdens or taxes on the investors' projects.
They emphasized that they would present the new party's documents to the parliamentary Committee on Parties' Affairs shortly.
The new party's platform has been completed, Ashennawi said.
SIGNS OF CRISIS BETWEEN MINISTER OF EDUCATION AND EGYPTIAN PARLIAMENT DUE TO GERMAN LANGUAGE SET BOOK
Ibrahim said that the book described traffic in the Egyptian street as chaotic and pointed out that any Egyptian could drive his car or any public or other transport vehicles without paying any attention to any rules.
On page 183, in a letter from Egyptian girl "Nelli" to German girl "Dina", the former says, "Your parents grant you a lot of freedom.
The deputy asked the Minister of Education to tell the parliament what measures and decisions he had taken against those he considered as "offenders of Egypt, who allowed themselves, to quote his own words, to be like traitors to this country".
Al-Morsi referred to a report compiled by the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and statistics, which pointed out 12 million citizens live in graveyards, slums, garages and mosques, warning against a disaster represented in a rise in the number of outlaws, as the birth rate in such graveyards hits 15% of the newborns in Egypt.
A church delegation led by Anba Kirlus, bishop of Nagaa Hammadi Diocese for Orthodox Copts, visited the family of Victor Tawfik Girgis, the Egyptian hostage in Iraq.
TEXTILE EXPORTERS CONCERN OVER CANCELLING QUOTA SYSTEM
However, the WTO said that China and India would control global textile trade following the cancellation of the quota system. China will only control half of that market worldwide because its products are 25% lower than that of Egypt, thus obstructing Egyptian exports way to such markets in light of such a fierce competition.
Meanwhile, lending market between banks (Interbank) almost witnessed a collapse as its prices retreated to about 0.25%, its lowest price ever.
Director and supervisor over the bank's international transactions department, Shahinaz Fouda said that the certificate would be put up as of tomorrow (1st September) for natural and artificial persons who hoard foreign exchange so that they would transfer their foreign exchange to the bank in return for buying the certificate.
Rustom added that another reason of such a decline in interest rates was the fact that no deposits were put up by the CBE recently as it contented itself with putting up treasury bills only, a move which most banks refrained from joining, thus raising their liquidity.
State-owned and private banks' share of treasury bonds recorded 58.6 billion pounds, down 1.3 billion pounds over one month.
During a seminar held at Saleh Kamel Center for Islamic Economy, Al-Azhar University, it was revealed that Egypt and Islamic countries need to exert tireless efforts to attract foreign direct investments (FDI) and raise its share of total international capital flows.
Meantime, Chairman of Consultations Dep. with Saleh Kamel Center Dr. Mostafa Al-Desouki said that foreign remittances abroad reached LE6 billion while incoming remittances hit LE3 billion. Foreign investments in Egypt mostly come from the United States, EU member countries and Japan.
Delta International Bank decided to raise its interest rates on three-year term certificates to 12.25% annually, thus exceeding all prices granted by other banks including National Bank of Egypt, Misr Banque, the Suez Canal Bank, Egyptian Arab Land Bank, Mohandes Bank and Cairo PNB Paribas.
This has been confirmed by the signature of several agreements, the latest of which was the conclusion of a financing agreement to the value of $950 million in favour of exporting Egyptian liquefied natural gas to France. B-Gas Company and its partners, Malaysian Petronas and Gas De France, have finally approved of financing the first unit project to liquefy natural gas of the Egyptian Company for Liquefied Natural Gas in order to be exported to France. The first notification to withdraw the first payment has been issued as a prelude to lending banks delivering the first payment of the funds estimated at about $600 million of the project and the shareholders. This clearly shows the international financial community's confidence in the company project as international enterprise, which will contribute to the placement of Egypt on the list of the seven major gas exporting countries in the world by the end of 2006.
For his part, British Gas Company director pointed out that 29% of the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project is divided between E-Gas (12%) and the Egyptian General Organization for Petroleum with the same percentage (12 %). Gas de France Company, on the other hand, contributes 5% the finance and the remaining percentage constituting 71% is divided on between British Gas and the Malaysian company of Petronas.
Hala Fayiq pointed out that the two projects bear witness to the international capability of Egypt in gas reserves, which hit about 65 trillion cubic meters.
Deputy Director of National Societe Generale Bank Tarik Fayed points out that the role played by the National Societe Generale Bank in the gas deal won by Malaysian Petronas in cooperation with British Gas and Gas de France is the role of financial advisor, which procures the required funds.
For his part, Director General of Gas de France pointed out that Gas de France's contribution to the deal which had recently been concluded with Malaysian Petronas and British Gas amounts to 5% of the contract value, which hit $950 million, which is concluded on behalf of a project to export Egyptian liquefied gas to France in coordination with the Egyptian Liquefied Gas Company (B-Gas).
The political tendency and the conditions currently undergone by Libya, together with lifting the American ban on Libya supports the Egyptian banks tendency to head for Libya which is regarded as a promising market for investments especially infrastructure, airports and communications.
Hussein added that the bank was currently holding consultations with its key clients who want to invest in Libya, especially as the United Bank of Egypt had been chosen as an investment advisor to the Egyptian party. Agreement is underway with the Libyan government on the nature of projects, especially as the Libyan companies contribute about 20% to the bank capital. The bank is currently considering some projects to probe the possibility of financing them. He declined to uncover the volume of the funds allocated by the bank to investment in Libya.
Cairo-American G.BB Morgan Chase's regional director Mostafa Al Sahn added that the Libyans were supposedly receiving their funds kept in American banks, which amounted to millions of dollars especially as the date of lifting the American embargo on Libya is approaching. Al Sahn is visiting the Libyan capital in a few days' time to inform the Libyans of the situation of their funds with the bank and to open new fields of investment.
He expected the Egyptian-Libyan banking cooperation to take the form of documentary credits and cadre training. He pointed out that the banks had no political orientations but rather financial and economic ones.
BANKS VIE FOR ISSUING HIGH-INTEREST INVESTMENT CERTIFICATES
LAUNCHING SAVING COFFERS AT DISTINGUISHED INTEREST RATES RAISES MISGIVINGS
For his part, National Bank of Egypt's board chairman Hussein Abdel Aziz ruled out the possibility that the new saving coffers would affect loans while monitoring a remarkable shift in favour of the Egyptian pound in the three days following the launch of that saving coffer. He declined, however, to define the rate of the shift. Abdel Aziz understated misgivings about accumulation of liquidity due to the remarkable demand for the new coffer of the distinguish 12% interest rate. He pointed out that such a step came within the framework of developing monetary policy to secure economic policies and development plans in the forefront of which came curbing inflation rates, raising saving rates from 17.5% to 25%, restoring confidence in the national currency and putting a final end to dollarization.
International Delta Bank President Ali Negm pointed out that the fact that one or more banks resorted to raising depositors' interest rates was subject to the degree of its need to a further financial liquidity and the available potential to employ such funds. He added that there was an orientation to increase credit rates in the coming stage and get out of the doubt circle that caused the faltering problem. This would require more liquidity. He added that the new saving coffer grants the Egyptian family better interest rates periodically, and curbs spending on goods and services and consequently helps to reduce inflation rates, giving banks credit flexibility especially as they are exempted from the rate to be deducted in favour of the CBE monetary reserve.
The main objective of this bloc is to boost inter-Arab trade exchange, he said.
The banks' issuance of new saving certificates at high interest rates has pushed most US dollar depositors to convert their deposits into Egyptian pound ones.
Egypt's exports to Syria edged up by 160 percent to 26 million US dollars in January and February this year compared to the same period last year. Its imports from Syria recorded 11 million US dollars.
A report on such zones' dealings received by Minister of Planning uncovered that they had negative results with a 94.3 million dollars deficit due to the rise in imports over exports in the corresponding period.
The government delegate with Cotton Exporters Union Mohamed Al-Shewi ascribed the retreat of cotton exports to numerous problems including the American subsidy of the American cotton, which competes against the Egyptian cotton on international markets.
Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) figures pointed out a 25% growth in the value of exports in the last 9 months of the fiscal year 2003/2004 against 14% increase in imports value.
There has also been a rise in the value of manufactured exports such as iron and steel, fertilizers, carpets, medicine, citrus fruit, raw cotton, dried onions, crude oil, petroleum products, aluminum products, peanuts and ready-made clothes.
Although Egyptian textile exports had increased over the last three years from 899 million dollars in 2001, 945 million dollars in 2002 and 1.037 billion dollars in 2003, producers and exporters of this sector are concerned due to the cancellation of the quota system by the WTO as of next year.
Exporters of such products to the USA voiced their hope to conclude preferential agreements such as QIZ (qualified industrial zone), which they seek, as a private sector, to achieve. Minister of Foreign Trade and Industry Rashid Mohamed Rashid emphasized that the conclusion of such agreements fell within the private sector rather than the Ministry of Foreign Trade's competence.
Yesterday, the market witnessed a new rise in interest rates on saving certificates led by Egyptian Arab Land Bank and Cairo Paribas Bank. The Egyptian Arab Land Bank raised its interest rates on its saving certificate "Development of capital" to about 12.8%. It is a five-year term certificate with a cash cumulative interest cashed every month at LE8 per each LE1000 certificate and LE163.5 at the end of the certificate term.
Fouda added that, the bank in return, could pay its clients the interest on the certificate in foreign exchange.
Rustom pointed out that the CBE intervention by putting up even one deposit could raise the Interbank rates, but its refrainment from issuing deposits will keep prices at their low rates.
A recent report by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) said the private and foreign banks' share rose up to 18 billion pounds, up 443 million pounds in April.

Inter-Arab trade represents only 8.9% of total Arab trade volume, Dr. Saed Abdel Khaliq, director of Economic Research Department under Foreign Trade and Industry Ministry, said. He also noted that Arab investments abroad hit $1.2 trillion, while inter-Arab investment hit $16.9 billion, or 1.5%.
Delta International Bank Chairman and Managing Director Ali Negm said the bank decided to raise its interest rates in response to market conditions, pointing out that subscription to such a certificate had no restrictions, as it would be offered to individuals and institutions alike.
Head of the French economic mission in Cairo emphasized that the agreement was one of the most important agreements on the level of Egyptian-French relations because it pertains to the natural gas sector, a strategic sector whose importance is not only economic but also political.
British Gas Company director pointed out that the future plan of the company aimed at the continuation of constructing production lines relying on the availability of gas on one hand and the availability of buyers.
She highlighted the big demand for such projects by foreign banks in addition to the International Finance corporation (IFC) and Egyptian banks contributing to that deal like Misr International Bank, Commercial International Bank (CIB), and National Societe Generale Bank. She added that the volume of contributions offered by this category was in the range of $200 million out of a total finance hitting about $1.3 billion representing the first stage of financing Train-1, which had been completed.
Regarding the feasibility of the banks contribution to gas projects, Al-Fayed says that after the discovery of gas and as the world's reserves reached economic rates, banks became certain of the economic feasibility of prospecting for and marketing gas as well as exploiting such reserves due to remunerative economic results. This explains why banks are so interested in financing gas projects in general as well as the projects related to gas like those of fertilizers relying on gas.
EGYPTIAN BANKS HEAD WESTWARD FOR LIBYAN MARKET
Libya has a big reserve of oil, which makes it a fertile field for foreign investment.
He pointed out the Libyan market prosperity and the disappearance of the problems concerning donations which used to be caused by international agencies.
He highlighted the Egyptian banks desire to invest in the Libyan market due to the availability of investment opportunities especially in the field of petroleum, communications, airports and infrastructure that require further finance. He, however, declined to uncover the volume of investments to be pumped in to the Libyan market. He added that during his expected visit he would discuss with Libyan companies the possibility and mechanisms of finance as well as the quality of the projects to be implemented. He expected the Libyan government to extend facilities to Egyptian banks and offer them exemptions to help in one way or another with the finance operation.
He pointed out that Libya was promising and rich in oil and had an infrastructure, which is eligible for investment due to security and political stability.
More private and investment banks have started to issue distinguished investment certificates at higher interest rates (12 percent) than the current market rates.
Despite an outstanding liquidity surplus estimated by the latest Central Bank of Egypt CBE report at about LE46.9 billion or the equivalent of $7.55 billion at the beginning of last June and although such funds were employed in new projects the credit facilities of which amounted to about LE296 billion or the equivalent of $47.67 billion, some public and joint Egyptian banks launched a new service of saving coffers in the domestic currency at a distinguished interest rate of 12% and a 3-year term. Bankers described such a move as ambiguous, especially as banks did need to attract any further savings and as raising interest rates would aggravate economic sluggishness and the burden of debt service, thus negatively impacting on public budget deficit. Bankers also doubted that such a step might be able to curb inflation as, according to them, such inflation in Egypt is not so much caused by over consumption expenditure or an increase in demand for goods and services that could be dealt with through withdrawal of liquidity from the market as it is due to a rise in the cost of production which led to a rise in prices.
The Nile Bank board chairman, Kamal Al Sabbagh emphasized that the orientation of bolstering the bank liquidity is a positive matter and does not run counter to the CBE or government policy in the coming period. He added that putting up saving coffers at distinguished interest rates was one of the well-known tools that could contain inflation in the short run and restore confidence in the national currency. He pointed out that raising interest rates would positively affect an increase of foreign investments but they increase domestic debt in the short run if such a rise took place within an integrated system of measures in the forefront of which is reduction of taxes on markets.
For his part, former Minister of Planning, Dr. Ahmed Al Darsh warned against rushing into raising interest rates, as the cost would be too heavy for the state public budget. He pointed out that a 1% rise in interest rates could cost the budget an additional burden of LE2.1 billion.
Within this framework, Abdel-Dhaher held a meeting with a delegation from the Kuwaiti Agricultural Cooperatives Union. The two parties voiced their desire to boost cooperation among Arab cooperatives to serve national economy and take further steps towards more economic cooperation.
Sources said all foreign and Arab currencies are available at the banking market.
In 2003, Egyptian exports to Syria shot up to 74 million US dollars in 2003 against 60 million US dollars in 2002. Imports from Syria rose to 74 million US dollars in 2003, creating a balance with exports, against 38 million US dollars in 2002.
61% RETREAT IN COTTON EXPORTS
This subsidy forced foreign companies to cancel their contracts of importing Egyptian cotton due to its high price, Al-Shewi said, adding that foreign companies preferred paying a fine of 10% of the value of the contract to implementing the importation deal.
However, due to the relatively big weight of imports compared to exports, the imports value hit $1.566 billion while the export increase value stood at $1.499 billion.
On the other hand, there has been a decline in the value of the exports of medical herbs, carbon, coal, raw linen, aromatic oils, aluminum, rice and cotton yarn.
Meanwhile, high ranking diplomatic sources unveiled to Asharq Al-Awsat that there were differences of opinion between Egypt and Turkey regarding Turkish attempts to urge Arab and Islamic countries to recognize the government it backed in the Turkish party of Cyprus and to end its diplomatic isolation.

The amendments introduced by the administration to President George W. Bush's original initiative on democracy and reform in the Middle East crowned discussions between both leaders during Mubarak's recent visit to the US, as well as Arab reactions and opposition to the initiative, the American official said.
THREE TRENDS IN RULING MILIEU SPLIT OVER REFORM
Advocates of the second trend see that reform became a must and the continuation of the current positions would embroil the country in a lot of crises whether with external or internal forces.
He said the conditions in Egypt reached a state of weakness. He stressed the necessity of achieving a real development so that Egypt would take its appropriate status regionally and internationally. It became a strong demand to launch a real reform process in all fields and choose people characterized with seriousness and credibility away from the spirit of prehensile resourcefulness which afflicted some people known for honesty and transparency.
Diplomats, former ministers, lawyers, professors and thinkers are considering how to lay down regulations for the declaration. These regulations would ensure acting from within the ruling regime and not opposing it so as to move stagnant water without blaming certain people or bodies. Rather, steps should be taken so that Egypt could restore its regional and international position. Internal conditions should be analyzed and advice should be offered to all.
Egypt supports the Palestinians not only in the security field but also in all fields, said the source. Security, agricultural, economic and administrative experts would be sent to Palestine.
The source denied Egyptian mediation for moving Arafat from the West Bank to Gaza, saying, "This is not true. We had talks with the Israelis over the necessity to give Arafat full freedom of movement in the West Bank and Gaza." Arafat should not move to Gaza without Israeli guarantees so that Gaza would not be the last station and non-return to the West Bank, added the source.
The security issue has to do with the issue of reforms which the PA should take into account.
Al-Zuheiri was supposed to be investigated today to examine the issue of extending his custody together with 32 others who spent a month in remand custody.
The Ikhwan bloc deputies in the parliament asked the council to conduct an urgent investigation within the framework of its terms of reference in the incidents and circumstances concomitant with the arrest of the defendants in the case and their exposition to torture and negligence, thus leading to the death of Eng.
Furthermore, Ikhwanite sources said that Central Security as well as special forces besieged Mit Al-Kholi village in Al-Zarqa town, Damietta governorate to prevent the arrival of any of Al-Zuheiri's relatives or friends to offer condolences to his family.
The proposed amendment retains the 50% rate for workers and farmers of party slate candidates. Elections would be held according to original and reserve slates so that reserve members would occupy the seats that fall vacant during the parliamentary session.
The sources said that the distribution of parliamentary seats among all governorates would be subjected to careful calculations.
All statistics pointed out that individual elections have not for long constituted an element of attraction to the Egyptian voter to practise his right in selecting this representatives in the parliament.
Egypt stipulates establishing full normalized diplomatic relations before receiving Iranian pilgrims coming to visit Alul-Bait (prophet's family) shrines spread in many Egyptian cities.
The source added that the two sides are currently focusing on pushing up economic and commercial relations rather than normalizing diplomatic relations.
Ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) Secretary General and Minister of Information Safwat Al-Sherif has put an end to speculations about both the timing and the size of the cabinet reshuffle in Egypt. He denied the party or any official leaking particular names for key positions nominations in the next reshuffle.
National newspapers and magazines chief editors close to decision-making circles have recently expatiated on a forthcoming large scale reshuffle and criticized the situation in light of the presence of ministers and officials they branded as "resourceful and smart".
He said that such meetings would continue in the next few days to discuss the details of several issues including political reform.
In a symposium on the future of water in light of global variables, held in Saad Zaghloul Cultural Centre on Thursday, Abu Zeid pointed out that the presence of such a number of Israeli experts was not threat to Egypt. "Egypt is stronger than Israel in terms of water expertise. Pakistan asked Egypt to provide it with Egyptian expertise in irrigation projects.
This came in response to an urgent query submitted to the parliament by Muslim Brotherhood deputy Hamdi Hassan in which he quoted the family of Egyptian scientist Mohamed Abdel Moneim Al-Azmirli as saying that the latter was assassinated inside a prison near Baghdad.
He was also listed among the wanted within the occupation forces search for weapons of mass destruction and Iraqi scientists.
The deputy asked Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher to disclose before the PA the actions taken by the Egyptian Foreign Ministry to defend the Egyptians in Iraq, particularly scientists. He is also required to reveal the ways and means of bringing to account the US forces accused of torturing the Egyptian scientist to death.
Taking any step towards the preparation of certain reform demands and referring them to the government will be useless in case of a cabinet reshuffle. It is better to wait and see whether the talk about the reshuffle is real or mere talk to reassure citizens in such a perplexed situation, the sources added.
POLITICIANS ABOVE THE AGE OF 70 RULE... AND OPPOSE TOO
Opposition and government men compete with each other for setting records in staying in their positions for long years and assigning old people to leading positions.
The first was presented by Nasserite MP Hamdin Sabbahi (49) who desires to found Al-Karama Al-Arabiya (Arab Dignity) Party after he left the Nasserite Party led by Dia'eddin Dawoud who was born in 1926.
Therefore, Prime Minister Atef Ebeid seems to be relatively young, as he was born in 1932.
Information Minister Safwat Al-Sherif and Minister of Wakfs (Endowments) Mahmoud Hamdi Zaqzouq were born in 1933.
Minister of Local Development Mustafa Abdel-Qader was born in 1940.
Minister of Youth and Sports Dr. Ali Eddin Helal was born in 1944. Health Minister Dr. Mohamed Awad Tag Eddin was born in 1945
The MPs, namely Abdel-Mon'em Al-Oleimi, Al-Badri Farghali, and Dr Hamdi Hassan, said that the draft law would offset with the burdens imposed on the low income people, especially civil servants and public sector employees. The draft law will also put an end to the rich enjoying of the same indirect subsidy directed to the poor, which causes disorder in the social structure.
The MPs revealed that they did not handle in detail the categories of the proposed charges and taxes, pointing out that that would be determined after deliberations inside the parliament, discussions with businessmen MPs, 42 in number, and consultations with the Finance Minister.
In continuation of the state of instability currently undergone by the opposition Al-Wafd Party, two leading figures, namely head of the party's Water Resources and Irrigation Committee Dr. Ahmed Abdel-Khaliq Ashennawi and rapporteur of the Economic Committee with the party's higher authority Mostafa Annasharti, split after they had tendered their explained resignations to the party leader Dr. No'man Gomaa.
They pointed out a state of "liquidating opponents" inside the party.
A number of the current leaderships will announce their resignations from the current party and will join the new party, Ashennawi added.
The deputy said that the book contained phrases that obviously offend Egypt and its peoples.
Everybody in the street acts at will!
Girls in your country also enjoy the same rights as boys.
Spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) parliamentary bloc broadsided the government and accused it of turning life into a hell and meeting the needs of the well-to-do rather than the poor.
"The continuation of such a situation contributes to spreading hatred and crime among social classes and affects negatively the Egyptians' feelings of belongingness."
Egypt's mosques and churches pray that Victor would be set free and return home safely, he said.
Their concerns are particularly attributed to the fact that the USA's imports of Egyptian products of this sector (yarn, textile, ready-made clothes and household linen) reached, according to the quota system, about 535 million dollars in 2003 out of 1.37 billion dollars worth of Egypt's total exports, i.e. more than half the value of exports.
NEW BANKS RAISE INTEREST RATES!
The bank also raised interest rates on three, four and five year-term saving certificates with cumulative interest to 12% cashed at the end of each certificate term. A few days ago, the bank obtained the approval of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) of the issuance of that certificate. It was then approved by CBE board of directors in its last meeting and notified its branches of putting it into effect as of tomorrow (September 1st).
She pointed out that the bank currently owns another 5-year term certificate with a monthly interest rate of 10.25%. On the other hand, Al-Alam Al-Youm, learnt that there are other several other banks which are about to raise their interest rates on some of their savings coffers especially saving certificates after getting the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) approval.
For her part, Shahinaz pointed out that there should be no link between the low Interbank rates and the rise in internet rates on saving certificates emphasizing that the market was "not merely saving certificates", but an integrated system controlled by the cost of funds with each bank.
EGYPT'S SHARE OF INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL FLOWS DOWN 48%
Some Islamic countries have cash surplus estimated at $1 trillion invested in Western countries while inter-Arab investments reached only 10%, Omar noted. Egypt has a chance to increase its quota of international capital flows through offering guarantees to investors via a third international party, carrying out items of contracts concluded with domestic companies, reforming the monetary system regarding exchange rates, putting an end to corruption to reduce illegal expenses and bringing to an end all harmful practices of competition such as monopoly.
DELTA INTERNATIONAL BANK RAISES INTEREST RATE TO 12.25%
Detla International Bank certificates term hit three years at annual revenue cashed every three months. Under the guarantee of the certificates a loan amounting to 90% of their value is allowable.
He pointed out that the contribution of Gas De France to the gas sector was not confined to the 5% represented by that deal. He emphasized the company's intention to develop its contribution to the Egyptian gas sector so that it would cover not only getting Egyptian gas and exporting it abroad but also achieving other goals like the transfer of technology employed in that sector as well as training labour and other investment aspects which can be activated in that sector.
Regarding the countries which show the highest demand for buying Egyptian gas, besides France, he places America, Italy and Spain in the forefront of the countries expected to conclude future deals in the field of Egyptian gas exports.
She pointed out that preparations were underway for the second stage Train-2 and regarding the possibility of Egyptian banks contributing to the gas projects, Delta International Bank Board Chairman Ali Negm says that gas projects are giant ones that need syndicated loans contributed to by more than one bank.
Fayed pointed out that banks' demand for contributing to financing gas projects was also attributed to the fact that the rate of credit risks were reasonable in financing that industry.
In cooperation with a group of Egyptian investors, Egyptian and foreign banks are considering heading for the Libyan market to invest in it in a few days' time.
United Bank of Egypt board chairman, Hassan Hussein who doubles as Managing Director uncovered that a delegation of Egyptian businessmen and investors would visit the Libyan capital Tripoli next October. The delegation comprises a group of investors in cement, real estate development, contracting and petroleum. He pointed out that the Libyan party took interest in Egyptian contribution to development and investment.
He emphasized that the Egyptian banks opting for the Libyan market had its effects on investors' milieus concerned with investment in Arab countries. Some companies had expressed willingness to contribute to projects, which are economically feasible.
He highlighted the importance of the Egyptian banks in the Libyan market for the evaluation, study and marketing of projects.
He announced intentions to expand in the Libyan market through opening a new branch for the bank where the Libyan government would contribute about 24% of the capital.
Among these banks are Suez Canal Bank, a private bank, other investment banks, in addition to two state-owned banks, the National Bank of Egypt (NBE) and Banque Misr.
While the banks that launched new saving coffers monitored a remarkable demand for them, confirming intentions to expand investment in the sectors of natural gas, fertilizers, energy, information technology and communications, most other banks showed reservations concerning such a step ruling out the possibility of following suit, but admitting, in the meantime, to its state of bewilderment and wait in light of the ambiguity regarding interest rate orientations. This meaning has been emphasized by board chairman of Misr-Iran Bank and former CBE governor Ismail Hassan when he said that due to ambiguity of the interest rate situation, a sound credit and investment decision is rather difficult to take. While the CBE is giving indices of price stability, the Ministry of Finance is raising the interest rate on treasury bonds and sometimes the reverse takes place. He pointed out that the state of fluctuation and contradiction extended to all the banking sector's units as some banks have recently tended to reduce interest rates in an attempt to reduce the cost of its funds and avoid bearing the burdens ensuing from the high liquidity rate.
For her part, CIB managing director Sahar Al Sallab expected such a step. She expected that interest rates whether in public or private banks would witness more or less general rises in accordance with the prices of treasury bonds put forward by the Ministry of Finance. She pointed out that the CIB resorted to moving its interest rates by .05% in a bid to better employment of its available liquidity and to create a balance between investment in treasury bonds and granting distinguished interest rates to clients. She supposed that such a step would help borrowers cope with a similar increase in lending rates.
FIRST ARAB ECONOMIC BLOC INCLUDING EGYPT, SYRIA, MOROCCO, KUWAIT
US DOLLAR SALE FEVER SWEEPS BANKING MARKET
The US dollar rate of exchange hit LE6.20 for selling, the euro between LE7.38 for buying and LE7.56 for selling, and the Saudi riyal between LE1.63 for buying and LE1.675 for selling.
$488.9 MILLION FREE ZONES EXPORTS
A government official revealed a sharp retreat in the Egyptian cotton exports during the season that ended on August 29.
Cotton exports were high in the last season due to the availability of huge quantities of cotton with companies over the previous years as well as the low cotton supply on international markets, especially after the weakness of the Indian cotton crop.
This indicates a rise in the steady trade balance deficit to reach LE5.403 billion as a differential between imports worth $12.807 billion and exports to the value of $7.404 billion.
Despite the rise in the exports of some commodities, the value of many of them after the rise remained limited. The value of peanuts exports reached $1.2 million in the 9 months; dried onion, $1.4 million; preserved and dried vegetables, $1.7 million; potatoes, $3.8 million; medical herbs, $4 million; aromatic oils $5.1 million and
This sector's exports during the period January-May last amounted to 508 million dollars against 414 million dollars during the corresponding period in 2003, up 23%.
Yesterday, some banks raised interest rates on their saving certificates in response to the recent orientation led by the National Bank of Egypt and Misr Banque.
Meanwhile Cairo Paribas Bank announced putting up a new saving certificates at an interest rate of 12% with a 3-year term and a steady interest cashed every month.
Lending prices between banks (Interbank) went down yesterday to their lowest rate recording ever 0.25%. This decline was ascribed by the Egyptian Watani Bank international transactions director Mohamed Rustom to the end of the reserve rates and controlling bank liquidity, when Interbank rates usually reach their lowest. Such a decline, however, was due to the remarkable increase in domestic currency liquidity on the banking market at higher rates than the normal recent rates.
BANKS' SHARE OF TREASURY BONDS HITS 58.6 BILLION POUNDS
Egypt's share of international capital flows retreated by $171 million, or 48%, while net flows reached $353 million last year to retreat to $182 million this year.
Saving rates in Egypt do not exceed 15%, professor of Islamic Economy at Al-Azhar University Abdel Hamid Ghazali said, noting the difficulty in doing without international funds during the current period, asking for reliance on inter-Arab investments in the future to do without international funding gradually.
Yesterday, Delta International Bank joined the list of banks, which decided to raise their interest rates on saving certificates.
BANKS VIE FOR INVESTING IN GAS SECTOR A growing interest has been recently taken in the gas sector by banks in particular and by investors in general.
He also pointed out that 20% of the world's imports of Egyptian gas are carried out through Gas De France company, which justifies, the French banks interest in financing petroleum and gas investment projects. In the forefront of such banks comes the National Societe Generale Bank. He added that the biggest banks in the world compete for winning opportunities of participation in investment in Egyptian gas sector.
Misr International Bank director Hala Fayiq says that Egypt had recently witnessed the biggest two projects for the liquefaction of Egyptian gas, the first one by British Gas, the biggest contributor to it, besides the project of Malaysian Petronas company and the second is C-Gas project in cooperation with Union Fenosa company.
One bank takes the lead in financing those projects in coordination with other banks. Negm pointed out Delta International Bank contribution to similar projects like that of fertilizers at Abu Qir the contract of which had been recently signed with Misr International Bank (MIBank). Negm emphasized Delta International Bank readiness to contribute to financing gas projects in the future if it was invited to do so and after a feasibility study is done for the project and after making sure that there was a financial surplus allowing contribution to such enormous projects.
Deputy Director of the National Societe Generale Bank, Abdel-Mohsen Al-Simari says that investment in the gas sector is one of the most rewarding of investment fields whether that investment was direct or through the bank entering into syndicated loans. He emphasized the feasibility of investments in the gas sector as a promising sector that represents no risk at all, which explains his call for Egyptian banks to take interest in investment in gas sector.
The group included United Bank of Egypt, Commercial International Bank (CIB)-Egypt, Arab Banking Corporation (ABC) and American G.BB Morgan Chase.
Egyptian banks hold meetings with their Libyan counterparts to discuss aspects of cooperation, available opportunities, financing potential, nature of projects as well as means of presence there.
In reply to a question on the political dimension behind the Egyptian banks' orientation, especially as the ban was lifted on the Libyan market, Hussein said it was a banking option which had nothing to do with politics especially regarding laying down Egyptian investments there and cooperation with Libyan investment companies.
Executive head of Arab Banking Corporation (ABC-Egypt) Tarik Helmi uncovered the bank's desire to enhance its presence or representation by spreading new branches on the Libyan market especially as the Libyan government contributes to the corporation's capital.
Deputy board chairman of CIB (Egypt) Sahar Al Sallab, who doubles as managing director said that some Egyptian banks were studying the Libyan market and its investment opportunities as well as the suitable means of getting access especially regarding petroleum and construction pointing out the CIB study of the Libyan market.
The competing banks have to sell such certificates to individuals and natural persons, rather than funds or corporations.
Some other banks, however, raised interest rates in a bid to attract further funds. He added that he preferred deliberation in taking the decision of raising interest rates to ascertain whether the CBE would carry on with its policy of expansion in drawing liquidity or that was a temporary state. He expected the state of wait to continue for sometime to avoid enormous burdens that might negatively affect the bank annual revenues and consequently net profits.
She thinks that the launch of new saving coffers would encourage many hesitant banks especially private ones to increase interest rates to avoid withdrawal operations in favour of the new coffers, and in a bid to expand their quota of liquidity available on the market.
The first Arab economic bloc, including Egypt, Syria, Morocco and Kuwait, will be announced soon and will include Arab economic cooperative organizations later on.

A senior official of the White House said on Friday (June 4th) that the US administration understood President Hosni Mubarak's apology for not attending the G-8 summit, which will discuss the Greater Middle East initiative.
The US proposed in a paper it will submit to the G-8 summit forming new corporations to reinforce economy in the region and push forward social and political reforms.
Advocates of the first trend oppose the idea of reform and change and seek to promote an idea that reform is considered a response to external demands, especially American ones.
Observers see that the enormous articles on reform and change written by chief editors and published recently in major national papers were test balloons for causing controversy in the Egyptian street to poll opinions of political and cultural elite and sort out attitudes and take them into account when reaching a final view on reform steps and the nature of change.
It was learnt that former ambassadors, judges and thinkers who do not belong to political parties or the opposition are preparing a memo to be presented to the Presidency. The memo includes proposals and mechanisms which, according to them, should be adopted in order to tackle the problems Egypt faces.
Ahead of the Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom's visit to Egypt on 7 June, an Egyptian well-informed source denied reports that the recent Egyptian contacts seek to impose Egyptian security control over Gaza with the aim of securing Israel against the Palestinians.
Concerning Shalom's talks in Egypt, the source said the talks would touch upon the measures to be taken to guarantee the PA control over the territories in Gaza and the West Bank from which the Israelis would withdraw. Egypt insists that Israeli withdrawal should be complete and a step for withdrawal from the West Bank and a step within the framework of the road map peace plan.
We tried to convince him of that. But it is not an easy matter for him."
STATE SECURITY PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE INVESTIGATES CHARGES WITH TORTURING IKHWAN DETAINEES AND DEATH OF ONE OF THEM
The prosecution will also investigate reports regarding about ten detained defendants having been subjected to torture in police stations to which they were transported from Tora prison where they were supposed to be remanded in custody.
Hassan added that Tora prison administration refused to permit members of defence committee to visit the defendants, then it allowed 9 to be visited who were reduced to just four in the presence of all prison officers who refused to bring the rest of the defendants.
Asharq Al-Awsat learnt that a committee of professors of law and ruling National Democratic Party deputies have almost completed a bill on practising political life as a prelude to referring it to the People's Assembly (PA) and the Shura Council (Advisory) in the next parliamentary session.
If, moreover, he insists on that, he would excluded from the slate in favour of another candidate nominated by his party.
The sources uncovered that law professors and experts in law and the Constitution participate in reviewing the bill prior to putting it up for public and extensive discussions. They pointed out that the bill would be amenable to deletion and addition to cope with the Constitution provisions and remove all provisions that are suspected of contravening the Constitution.

Al-Ummah Party leader Ahmed Al-Sabahi is the oldest of all ministers and oppositionists as he was born in 1915.

Such a scandal urged the Palestinian Legislative Council to discuss the case and commission budget committees, financial affairs, control and the legal committees to investigate that case and refer recommendations to the legislative council and the premiership.
Blenski did not have much difficulty doing that as he soon found Palestinian companies willing to offer help. Al Terifi and Baraka companies started getting permits for importing Egyptian cement from the Ministry of National Economy through a subordinate agreement ensuring the companies' collection of financial sums as commission and brokerage.

MP Ismail Al-Da'da' said in an urgent quest for notification that 21 containers of radioactively contaminated fertilizers coming from Israel were released without abiding by any controls over transport, storage or usage.

Reports pointed out a state of chaos in ports which helps smugglers infiltrate commodities to Egyptian markets. They asked for the removal of different loopholes resulting from inconsistence of jurisdictions between ministries and the multiplicity of official bodies responsible for releasing goods.

Egyptian government officially denied that the water-selling issue was discussed in any of the Nile Basin countries' meetings.
It is worth mentioning that Abou-Zeid is currently on a tour to some African countries including Ethiopia and Uganda as he would deliver two messages from President Hosni Mubarak to the presidents of both countries.
The initiative stipulates that two countries at least should participate in any project that would be set up. A technical committee was established to mull over setting up joint projects, the minister pointed out.
The whole world has already discovered the lie of the innocent lamb which Israel has pretended to be for almost fifty years.
All those who know the ploys of that blood-thirsty man still believe that his projects and proposals about withdrawal from Gaza were just maneuvering to get round the American roadmap project in order to ensure that it will be aborted and finished off!
Faced with all such doubts, I cannot help wondering where Sharon's new ploy would finally end.
The Egyptian official, who declined to identify himself in exclusives to Asharq Al-Awsat, denied the news reported about an Egyptian mediation to move Arafat from the West Bank to Gaza Strip and prevent him from returning to the West Bank.
European reports said that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had received a serious offer from an Arab country - not Egypt - to host him permanently for health care according to an American-Israeli scheme aiming to remove Arafat politically in a decent and acceptable way.
However, Presidential Advisor Dr. Osama Al-Baz announced that Egypt and Israel had agreed to form a joint committee for bilateral cooperation.
Well-informed sources told Asharq Al-Awsat that the Egyptian-Israeli security deal, by which two economic and security cooperation committees were set up, was possible after Israeli Premier Ariel Sharon had vowed to stop Israeli ground, air and sea raids on Gaza Strip once Egyptian security men arrive there.
Mubarak and Sharon were expected to exchange letters on the bases that would govern that deal. Afterwards, the economic committee would convene meetings to establish a free trade zone between the two countries similar to the Jordanian-Israeli free zone. In its turn, the joint security committee would convene a meeting under the two liaison officers from the two countries to coordinate security activities in Gaza Strip after the planned pullout.
Egyptian Intelligence Chief Omar Solayman would visit Israel soon to pursue dialogue on these issues and finalize the security deal.
The meeting was attended by Egyptian Presidential Political Advisor Osama al-Baz and Israel's ambassador in Cairo. Following a meeting with the Israeli official at the Foreign Ministry, al-Baz said an agreement was reached on forming an ad hoc committee for bilateral cooperation to maintain contacts on issues of mutual concern and security matters following the pullout. For his part, Shalom said Egypt and Israel have almost reached an agreement that allows Egypt to deploy over one hundred soldiers on the border with Gaza Strip. However, the Egyptian-Israeli peace deal will remain unchanged.
He stressed the importance of respecting the timetable, keeping momentum and avoiding waste of time, which will impede a peaceful settlement.
Under this headline, veteran writer of Asharq Al-Awsat Samir Attallah writes a column to the following effect:
But due to different reasons, Egypt fears--like Israel--that Arafat's weakness may lead to Hamas and Islamic Jihad seizing power over Gaza.
Arafat is asked to cut down the multiple security bodies and unify them under one man.
This is not Egypt's tone nor Solayman's, but rather Sharon's tone and harshness.
On the first day of the agreement that led to the liberation of South Africa, ambassador Klofis Maqsoud wrote, "I seek for a Palestinian Mandela and an Israeli De Klerk".
Those who ask Arafat to resign, should say to us why.
The Military Factories of the Hebrew state succeeded in producing a cruise missile that could be launched from a land launcher, military sources in Israel said. The missile is able to hit its target accurately at a distance of 300 kilometres.
"Israel is now developing a longer-range cruise missile that could be launched from the Israel Navy's Dolphin-class submarines against land targets.
There are no modern defence systems that are efficiently able to intercept developed cruise missiles.
Cruise missiles are characterized by their ability to carry out sudden preemptive attacks, a deep-rooted strategy of the Israeli military dogma. The development of such cruise missiles has been carried out as part of an Israeli strategy adopted after the Second Gulf War - boosting its abilities to hit distant targets independently of external parties such as the US in order to prevent being exposed to ballistic missiles as what happened in 1991.
Iran and some Arab countries have anti-warship missiles which are not able to hit land targets in the depth.
Islamic Resistance Movement "Hamas" slammed the Egyptian initiative regarding as diminishing Egypt's regional and national role. Hamas said that there are some parties who are keen on creating tensions between Hamas and Egypt.
Referring to Fatah movement whose leaders chair the security bodies and represent the backbone of the Palestinian Authority Al-Zahar pointed out that the Egyptian regional role should not be confined to supporting the security forces of one Palestinian faction that has its pros and cons.
He denied that any negotiations had taken place between Egypt and Hamas, voicing his view that Egypt would consult Hamas about the security situation.
Al-Zahar revealed that dialogue with other Palestinian factions to reach a national agreement had come to a halt for two reasons. The first is that there is a defect in the issue of participating in the government, i.e. security bodies are not subject to participation from which was confirmed by Palestinian officials.
He added that the current suggestion aims at setting up and rebuilding three dams, namely Bekhema and Mandaw in Arbil and Badosh in Mosul.
The construction of the two dams on Higher Zab River, Tigris' biggest tributaries, would take five years to be completed, the source said.
The following are the disbanded militias in Iraq:
Badr was formed in Iran early in the 1980s including Iraqis who were forced by the former Iraqi regime to leave the country. Groups of Iraqi Shiite and Iraqi military members, who were against Saddam Hussein's regime, joined it.
Following the downfall of the former Iraqi regime one year ago, Da'wa Party supporters emerged while carrying firearms and used bases in southern provinces and Baghdad. This party was repeatedly disbanded and had several names like Islamic Dawa Movement and Islamic Dawa Party.
It was the only Iraqi opposition movement which had a headquarters in Amman, a radio station that transmitted its programs from outside Amman, and a daily newspaper called "Baghdad", which is still released by the movement.
-Iraqi Islamic Party: it was established early 1980s. It is a Sunni Islamic party led by Mohsen Abdel-Hamid and includes open-minded Islamic academics. DISBANDED MILITIAS IN IRAQ

ARAB EDUCATION MINISTERS PLEDGE TO CONTINUE REFORM
The 3-day conference was held under the chairmanship of Egyptian Education Minister Dr. Hussein Kamel Baha'eddin. UNICEF and UNESCO took part in the conference.
The conference did not discuss external reform initiatives which call for the development of education, especially the plan for reforming the Middle East and North Africa, which is scheduled to be discussed at the G-8 Summit and mostly concentrates on education reform.
Dr. Baha'eddin said the conference invited a number of foreign ambassadors and education experts. "This does not mean that we face pressure regarding development of education in the Arab world," he said.
Is there any difference between the liberalization of economy that all Arab governments have adopted, with the subsequent negotiations for entering into free trade zones and winning the membership of the World Trade Organization, on the one hand and the liberalization that the United States is demanding?
European Atlantic-overlooking countries do not want to change Arab regimes as a large segment of Arab public opinion believes, nor do they have any reason to be keen on protecting the interests of Arab peoples.
Washington is only asking these governments to reconsider their policies in order to weather this acute political crisis and avert the risks of pent-up extremism, terrorism and violence that their peoples have been accumulating over a half-century of humiliation, domestic and external abuse and daily oppression, both on mass and individual levels.
They would have just withdrawn their official recognitions of Arab ruling regimes and asked them to call free elections under United Nations supervision, so as to pave the way for the emergence of ruling regimes that would come to power out of the people's choice to express the people and enforce the required reforms.
What do make matters then look so difficult for Arab ruling regimes?

PRICING OBSTACLES AND FIXING POWER TARIFF FORESTALL PAYMENT OF $3.2BN AS INT 'L LOANS
A lot of requests were submitted earlier to the government's policies committee to move the tariff for the consumption brackets of high incomes, but the requests have not been approved by the government at present. The cost differential between production and consumption reached about 2.7 billion pounds annually to be borne by the ministry due to the increase in prices of power production input. Prices of electric spare parts and equipment rose by 60%. Pays also increased and prices of fuel, especially natural gas, went up two times in 1998 and 2004, which led to accumulation of the Petroleum Ministry's dues on the Electricity Ministry to more than 5 billion pounds (806 million dollars). The Electricity Ministry refused to recognize the new quotation of gas until a fund for financing the cost differential at the ministry is established as a result of the increase of gas prices in accordance with directives of the former prime minister.

This was voiced by the second man in the Turkish army Elkar Pashpogh, who argued that the American policies and their Israeli likes contribute to reviving terrorism, fanaticism, and violence, which handicaps any reform projects.
According the Turkish government leakages, the government sees that it wouldn't be wise of it to turn down the American project which can yield profits to Turkey, including aid, US loans let alone siding with the major powers. The Turkish government, however, hopes that Washington will backtrack on its project. It is to be mentioned that a meeting is expected to be held between American and Turkish diplomats to consider how Turkey will partake in the project, in spite of the Turkish officials denial that Turkey will have a role in this project.
"The state does not reject any request by citizens for erecting new mosques," he pointed out.
Imbabi said that Al-Azhar did not turn down any request for establishing Azharite institutes in any region. He added that no Azharite official or body decided to stop building new Azharite institutes or transfer them to the Ministry of Education.
SPECULATIONS ABOUT CABINET RESHUFFLE IN EGYPT
In the context of change, well-informed sources in the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) think that Egypt is heading for an extremely hot summer which would begin with the formation of the new government following President Mubarak's return from the medical treatment tour in Germany.
In a statement it issued yesterday following its political bureau meeting, Tagamou'h party said that the ruling party secretary general's reports about the dialogue results having been referred to the ruling NDP general congress and about a secret dialogue with parties away for mass media, were not true.
"We told them that they embarrass us, especially as we are in constant contact with different Palestinian forces and we are also on good terms with their leaders, how can we, then, talk with them when a Palestinian leading figure is targeted?" the source wondered.
Egypt did not impose itself on Israel, which said publicly that Egypt should play a role in Gaza Strip following their withdrawal, the source reiterated. "Not only will Egypt play a security role in Palestine, it will help the Palestinians reconstruct different economic and agricultural aspects as well."
ZIONIST PRESSURE ON WHITE HOUSE TO DENY EGYPT ACCESS GUIDED BOMBS
The U.S. Department of Defence approved of the system being sold to Israel, but it objected to selling a more advanced system to the Israeli Air Force.
Al-Hayat learnt that the new government would have an unexpected surprise which is being hushed up before the government is officially announced.
They pointed out that the new government would reflect a futuristic vision of the reform question as ministerial portfolios would be assigned to reform advocates and architects of plans that ensure its achievement.
The Stock Exchange has also been witnessing a state of anticipation, as shares have dropped for the third day on a row and the main index went down by about two percent, thus turning the market inactive after shares had lost a large part of their profits made in the previous days.
Market and traders are in a very normal state". Both the cabinet reshuffle and its date are still shrouded in mystery. "This is conditional upon the return of the president from Germany," Abu Ismail said, pointing out that the president's sickness pulled the rug from under the cabinet reshuffle.
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon forestalled the negotiations carried out by Chief of Egyptian Intelligence Omar Sulyman in Tel Aviv by defining Egypt's role in participating in the implementation of his unilateral disengagement plan to withdraw from Gaza. Sharon confined the Egyptian role to that of a policeman who is commissioned to ban weapons smuggling from Egypt to Gaza Strip, compel President Yasser Arafat to make concessions as far as his security powers are concerned, train Palestinian security elements in banning terrorism. He rejected any mediation role to be played by Egypt or any Egyptian dictates imposed on Israel.
Sharon underlined that it is only Israel that will decide how to implement the plan and will not accept any Egyptian requests or dictates. He turned down the Egyptian conditions of stopping incursions and assassination operations in Gaza Strip with the arrival of the Egyptian security experts, revealing, "Israel will not hesitate to carry out any military activity if terrorist operations take place."
For his part Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that relying on Egypt regarding enforcing the unilateral disengagement plan involves a big problem, adding that he was not sure if Gaza Strip would, not in such a case be filled with missiles and weapons that threaten Israel and its presence.
Israeli Premier Ariel Sharon has recently stated that the trench would be dug after reaching a consensus with the Egyptian side.
Yesterday, Minister of Negotiations Affairs in the Palestinian Authority Saeb Erekat said that Egypt would not allow Israel to dig a canal along the southern borders of Gaza Strip with Egypt.
Such bids would have to be offered by July 12th, 2004. Neither the ditch final width nor length was determined by Israel so far!
Can it introduce such a geographic change to the geography of Egypt-Palestinian borders? Israel does not have any legal capacity in Um Al-Rashrash in the south as it is Egyptian land still under occupation.
"PHARONIC" PARTY CHALLENGE BEFORE SAC
Moreover, Lutfi described as "undemocratic" the decision taken by the party affairs committee, saying, "What is going on in Egypt is unacceptable in all world countries. It is implausible to give the majority party the right to approve or disapprove the establishment of new parties that are supposed to be its rivals".
The court upheld in its ruling the Prosecutor Genral's decision banning his travel, saying that certificates to his health were issued in private clinics! The health report compiled in Qasr Al-Eini Hospital was also prepared by the same doctors, the ruling said.
The NBE, furthermore, added that there was no settlement project between the bank and Bahgat.
Tantawi, who was speaking in a conference on Islamic call and guidance in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa yesterday (20 June), cited some stances of Prophet Mohamed PBUH towards the corpses of the infidels following Badr Ghazwa, as "the Prophet did not mutilate or behead them like what is happening now".
The Sudanese minister called for an Islamic discourse based on moderation and centrism.
The growth rate is expected to hit 3.7% in the fiscal year 2004/2005 and 4.4% in the fiscal year 2005/2006, the report said, adding the average per capita quota in gross domestic product (GDP) reached 1270 dollars in the current fiscal year compared with 1228 dollars expected in 2004/2005 and about 1318 dollars in the fiscal year 2005/2006.
The report pointed out the decline in differential between the dollar rates of exchange on official and parallel markets.
PET DOGS PHENOMENON INVADING AFFLUENT SOCIETY IN EGYPT
He adds that the hospital has about 6 doctors only who do shift work but usually have private clinics. The cost of accommodation in the hospital for any dog or cat ranges from LE6 to LE25 per day according to the conditions of the case and type of room where it would stay and whether it is an ordinary one with other pets or a posh one privately booked for the pet.
He adds that due to the approach of the summer and vacation season, there is a high demand for dog collars and cat bells and their coloured clothes and hair accessories, as such pets travel with their owners to summer resorts where everybody want their pets to look well!
A dog hairdresser very cautiously talked to Asharq Al-Awsat identifying himself as Sayed who works with a specialized vet clinic said that the cat or dog's hair gets the lion's share of their owners' care as they would deny their pets nothing new in that concern because the looks of the pet directly betrays the care its owner gives to him.
"We could not ensure the safety of Egyptian officers in Gaza," the brigades said in a statement yesterday.
"The Palestinian resistance is following up and observing these hands," the statement added, stressing that PFLP operations would hit inside the Green Line with no distinction between Israeli civilians and military men particularly in light of Israeli continued arrests and assassinations of our Palestinian people, it concluded.
MOHIEDDIN: CAPITAL MARKET STATUTE AMENDMENT TO ACTIVATE SECURITIZATION
HUGE REDUCTIONS IN CAR CUSTOMS DUTIES
SALES TAX ON SOFTWARE CANCELLED
BUSINESSMEN'S PRESSURE BEHIND ANTI-TRUST ACT AMENDMENTS
The nine businessmen seek to raise the rate specified by the new bill so that they could preserve their interests and productive and trade positions after it was passed. The current bill provides for 40% as a ceiling for production, which put those investors in a big fix.
5% SALES TAX ON PLYWOOD
25% REDUCTION IN CARS PRICE
Former head of Cairo Chamber of Commerce Mahmoud Al-Arabi said that industrialists did not care about reducing customs on imported fully manufactured goods.
Such decisions would spread comfort among dealers in the market and cut prices, he concluded.
A spokesman for the cabinet said on Thursday that the fresh increase in gas oil prices would lead to only a 6 percent hike maximum in transport fees, which had remained unchanged for ten years. The price of a liter of gas oil, which costs the state LE2.00, is lower than that in neighbouring countries.
Although such a customs reduction will result in 3.2 billion pounds' worth of dwindling tariff resources in the short term, such resources will go up in the medium term as a result of growing economic activities and imports, said Abdel-Nour, who is also chairman of the Parliamentary Bloc of Al-Wafd Party.
LE600 MILLION JORDANIAN INVESTMENTS IN EGYPT
Jordanian ambassador to Cairo said that Arab investment exchange between Arab countries is a positive phenomenon that did not exist 20 years ago, as Arab investments used to be directed to the West. Pumping Arab investments in an Arab country is a new way to boost trade and investment cooperation which enables the investor to get acquainted with raw materials and their resources in the Arab world as well as the competitiveness of Arab products and commodities.
He indicated that through this visit South Korean investors would make use of Egypt as it will serve as a springboard for Korean products to be produced in Egypt and get access to (COMESA) countries as well as European Union markets without paying customs tariffs imposed on their exports from South Korea to those countries.
They ascribed the recent increase in government domestic debts to a huge rise in the value of treasury bonds which hit some 76.3 billion pounds late last April, recording an increase of 12 billion pounds in a month.
Minister of Electricity and Energy, Dr. Hassan Yunis emphasized that there was a plan for embarking on a project to exploit black sand in a few days' time.
He added that its exploitation would save a lot of money spent on the importation of just one of those minerals such as zircon which is a basic element in ceramic industry, in addition to iron, granite, monazite and titanium used in making aircraft fuselage, submarines or railway lines.
LE50 RISE IN REBAR PRICE Rebar barons at the forefront of whom is Eng.
The economic sources pointed out that rebar price on the international markets witnesses a noticeable stability and does not increase, not to mention that the dollar exchange rate on domestic markets whether the official or the unofficial ones was stable. In spite of all these factors rebar price is on the increase on local markets in an unjustifiable way, they added.
The sources asked the government to issue quickly the competition and anti-trust law and not to subject to pressure from some businessmen to add articles to the law to enable them to forge ahead with their schemes that aim at controlling markets.
The reason behind the decline of Egyptian exports to 17.3 million dollars during the first half of 2004 compared with the same period last year is the decline in exports of electric sets and appliances by about 13 million dollars and iron and steel exports by 2.4 million dollars.
Minister of International Cooperation, Fayza Abul Naga discussed yesterday (September 9th) with the new Japanese ambassador to Cairo Japan's contribution to financing a number of new development projects including Burg Al-Arab airport, Grand Museum of Egypt, and solar station in Kurimat in addition to industrial pollution control project.
CHINESE SUPERMARKET CHAIN IN GOVERNORATES
The meeting concentrated on the fields where the Chinese party could cooperate with Egyptian companies. Al-Nazir said that the five agreements between the two parties provide for cooperation in the fields of processing foodstuffs, developing iron and steel industry, promoting Chinese tourism programmes in Egypt, and considering the construction of a chain of Chinese supermarket stores in various governorates in Egypt. Gamal Al-Nazir added that preparations are underway for an extensive conference in Cairo in January to encourage investments in and present the opportunities available to Egypt in the field of attracting foreign investments. He pointed out that total Chinese investments in Egypt amounted to $56.5 million, which centers on the development of Northwest Suez, textiles, cement sacks and fish farms.
He pointed out that the volume of Egypt's imports form China hit $225 million in the first quarter of this year against $186 million in the corresponding period last year.
A report by the Ministry of Foreign Trade ascribed poor pan-African trade relations to most countries' tendency to focus on forging economic ties with their former European colonizers, which reflects upon economic and trade neighborly relations.
EGYPTIAN CEMENT EXPORTED TO MAURITANIA
IRAQI TRADE MINISTER URGES EGYPTIAN COMPANIES TO CONTRIBUTE TO BUILDING HOUSES IN IRAQ
The banking market is waiting for a big number of forthcoming decisive structural changes after the government raised the slogan of major banking mergers announcing the first merger case between Banque Misr, the second biggest public bank in the country and a joint bank facing excruciating crises due to the increase in bank faltering cases (Misr Exterior) whose premises have been turned into new branches for Banque Misr as of last Sunday.
According to banking expert, Dr. Khalid Abou Ras, such measures combined represent the outlines of current government vision of banking reform and aim at encouraging foreign investments to flow into the country in amounts equaling their influxes in the mid 1990's till late in that decade.
The term privatization would not be used again, Mohieddin said pointing out that a new method for managing public enterprise companies' assets would be applied. This method is based on three axes: selling or restructuring in addition to wise management "companies governance" which is based on appointing two deputies for administrative and finance affairs in every company.
LE3.3 BILLION TO BUY RAW COTTON
According to important documents made available to Al-Alam Al-Youm, there was a deficit in faltering loans allocations of four banks to the value of LE3.1 billion till the end of last year.
According to a report prepared by the bank auditors: KPMG Hazim Hassan, BDO Zarouk and Khaled and Partners, Misr Exterior had failed to support the loans allocations with the deficit there reaching LE1.6 billion after taking into account trade and real estate guarantees to the value of LE414 million, which essentially impacts on both the loan portfolios evaluation and the bank final account.
The deficit in other allocations hit LE132.8, thus affecting the bank final account, to quote the auditors' reports.
The current week will witness intensive meetings to take important steps to construct the first center for consumer credit information in Egypt. The center will monitor names of banks' agents who obtain consumption loans or plastic cards.
The source added, "It is wrong to think that more concessions may lead to a change in the Zionist policy. On the contrary, it always turned out that more concessions lead to more strictness, evasions and infinite demands on the part of the Zionist side. We confirm that no one has the right to cede the constants and rights of our nation and people."
CEMENT SCANDAL THREATENS THE PNA, BRINGS CORRUPTION FILE TO SURFACE
PRECAUTIONS OF EGYPT'S ROLE
It will also call on Palestinians factions' representatives to meet in Cairo to crystallize a consensus on its role.
Regardless of the formula of the Egyptian role, it will be better for both Egyptians and Palestinians not to adopt the Israeli formula, as the Israelis have been seeking for another party to shoulder their burdens.
Therefore, Sharon has found his long-pursued aim in the pullout plan.
Certainly, the systematic brutality of the Israelis in Rafah contributed to putting an end to Egyptian hesitance, especially after Washington had passed an anti-Israel resolution in the Security Council.
He wishes, perhaps, that everybody, including the Egyptians and the Palestinians, would abide by his rules of the game.
The Egyptians can not be mere false witnesses: they want to extend help. In all cases, the Egyptians are against occupation and reject its terrorist practices.
HAARETZ: SYRIAN-IRANIAN COOPERATION BEHIND HIZBULLAH'S ACTIVITY IN IRAQ
SISTERLY IRAQ
The Arabs' desire not to let the Iraqi Shiites, the majority in the country, and their Iranian allies come to power was one of the reasons that stopped Washington short of invading Baghdad to oust Saddam's regime in 1991.
Finally, US decision to topple the Iraqi regime was a proof that Arabs are unable or unwilling to stymie the Iraqi regime's desire to fill the vacuum created after Clinton's administration failed to peacefully settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
That very failure lured Washington's administration into choosing for the Iraqis their interim government. The Arabs failed to support Lakhdar Ibrahimi's plan to nominate Adnan Pachachi as interim president and Hussein Shahrestani as prime minister in the Iraqi interim government though Washington seemed ready to carry out that plan in a step to appease the Arabs and the UN. Nevertheless, the Shiite-Kurdish alliance aborted that plan. This raises an important question regarding the post-American occupation stage: If the Arabs were not able to play a role in Iraq through Washington and the UN, what would they do following the abatement of the influence of Washington and the UN?
PESHMERGA REBEL
"The Peshmerga are military and security forces and are not subject to the government's authority in Baghdad," the Peshmega command informed Saleh, a statement that stimulated Allawi.
Well-informed sources with the Ministry of Defence said that many commanders in the ministry, who were previous commanders in the dissolved army, complained to Allawi about the Kurds and the Peshmerga's leadership declining to cooperate with the Ministry of Defence in applying measures on Kurdistan: borders with Turkey and Iran.
Meanwhile well-informed Iraqi sources told Al-Hayat that Saddam told the American investigators that these funds were deposited in German and Japanese banks.
A first US statistical report showed that around 11,000 Iraqi people have been killed and almost 40,000 others have been injured since the American invasion of Iraq last year.
On the cost of war, the report said it would reach 151.1 billion US dollars late this year.
In an indirect reaction to the killing of a South Korean national in Iraq, Shiite top clergyman Ayatollah Mohamed Hussein Fadlullah condemned the kidnap and killing of foreigners given Assurance of Protection (Those who, being foreigners, and not Muslims, enter Islamic territories, and claim safe conduct and immunity from hostilities according to Islamic sharia) in Arab and Muslim countries, as was the case in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Iraq.
Tantawi voiced regret as some people receive knowledge from those who are not eligible and do not differentiate between the concept of jihad in Islam and the acts of terrorism or terrifying secure people. He laid it bare that "jihad has been legalized in defence for one's life, dignity and honour". Terrorism has nothing to do with Islam, but, in fact, it is a setback that afflicted the whole world, he said.
For his part, economic expert Abdel Aziz Al Dekheil said that holding the private sector responsible for the Saudization of jobs and the employment of youth would not achieve the required results. He highlighted that the state should take the initiative by employing youth, as it is a national issue affecting social stability that is not less important than political security. However, he refused imposing Saudization on various sectors without providing efficient cadres as that would lead to higher production costs and prices, to the detriment of the citizen's interest.
In this context, it called the two countries to attend the NATO next summit in Turkey at the end of this month.
Their justification sending forces to Iraq are based on the assumption that the operation would be carried out under the conditions and umbrella of the UN and that their tasks would be confined to guarding UN buildings and securing its personnel. However, the Japanese who justified sending their Self Defence Forces by Iraq's by participation in reconstruction, could not keep away from the military conflict. This means that neither Moroccans nor Tunisians can make sure that none of them would perhaps fall victim to Iraqi resistance operations. How would the two governments, then, behave?
UAE DENIES OPENING ISRAELI REPRESENTATION OFFICE IN ABU DHABI
The UAE had built Sheikh Zayed City in Gaza and pledged to build more than 800 houses in Rafah that had been destroyed by the Israeli army.
These remarks come following reports published by Haaretz daily and transmitted by the radio to the effect that Israeli officials have been holding talks with representatives of the UAE for months. An Israeli jurist is going to visit the UAE to decide on the legal capacity of the Israeli representation office to be opened in Abu Dhabi. Israeli envoys are expected to visit all Arab countries that would be willing to accept them, with a special message from Shalom including a report to the governments on the cabinet's decision approving the disengagement plan, the daily said.
CONGRESSMAN ACCUSES EGYPT OF PREPARING FOR WAGING WAR AGAINST ISRAEL
Egyptian army military trainings consider Israel as the main enemy of Egypt in spite of the two parties' abidance by the Camp David Peace Accords signed in 1979.
Egypt has the right to preserve a military force to defend its interests and sovereignty, the sources added, pointing out that Egypt didn't take the initiative in dragging the region into an arms race.
This came in a statement before the commission by Michel Dion, an economic expert of the US National Security Council, who was an economic expert with the US Embassy in Cairo.
"Moderate pressure from the bottom to the top, which can be created by democratic programs, will not be able alone to oblige the ruling elite to share power."
An American strategy to create reforms and work out an aid program requires an articulate and frank dealing with the present political situation in Egypt, he said.
During the first cultural delegation's visit to the United States, after 24 years of rupture, he said that university and school curricula in Libya met the UNESCO's conditions and did not include any "rabble-rousing" subjects against the United States or the West.
During their meeting with the U.S. Department of State, the delegation pointed out that the English language was ranked second following Arabic in Libya, pointing out plans to teach it in the primary stage.
Strangely enough, the bankers' refusal coincided with a rise in the number of companies operative in that field.
LE 60 MILLION LOSSES IN MISR EXTERIOR BANK: BUSINESSMAN
On September 16, Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) board of directors issued a decision to merge Misr Exterior Bank into Banque Misr. This step came following the financial problems undergone by the bank recently.
As for public banks, National Bank of Egypt considers selling its quota in many banks at the forefront of them are Suez Canal Bank and Egyptian Saudi Finance Bank.
Al-Alam Al-Youm learnt that the two Egyptian and French parties were currently negotiating the price of the share according to which the deal would be concluded, as Banque du Caire had reservations about the French offer because it offered low price per share.
Banque de Caire sold its share in BNP Pribas within the framework of the State plan to sell the contributions of the four public banks, namely the National Bank of Egypt, Banque Misr, Banque du Caire and Bank of Alexandria to joint banks.
Al-Alam Al-Youm learnt from a well-known banking source that the Awda and the ENUB considered purchasing Egyptian joint stock banks which are offered for sale foremost of which is Cairo Far East Bank whose capital is estimated at 76 million pounds.
RASHID: ECONOMY IS MISERABLE
Demand for cars is low due to their high prices, as sales decreased from 100,000 to 42,000 cars annually, he said.
A poll conducted by Alexandria Professional Syndicates Committee on Boycotting American and Israel Goods indicated that 73% of the polled people are not familiar with the qualified industrial zone (QIZ) that were established in cooperation with Israel.
The retreat of investments was due to the decline of exports and spread of bureaucracy, the report emphasized. The report also called for launching an all-out revolution against red tape, dissolving the Investment Authority and establishing a private company able to attract investments.
Foreign investments in the current state plan hits 9% only or 8 billion pounds of the total investments including 2.1-billion-pound foreign grants, said Minister of Planning Othman Mohamed Othman.
The state plan gives priority to resuming uncompleted projects in order to boost national production, he said. The projects to be completed will take 23 billion pounds or 81% of total investments of the government and economic authorities. The investments allocated for replacement and upgrading of projects hit 4.8 billion pounds or 17%. About 603 million pounds only will be allocated for expanding as well as setting up new projects, he emphasized.
He indicated that there are contracts for exporting about 100,000 palm leaves.
The price of the Egyptian exported rice should be reconsidered to be able to compete and define the export target within a limit that does not exceed 450,000 tons with a view to achieving stability, he indicated.
Secretary General of the CCAC, Dr. Hamed Mabrouk said that the council used to set an exportation target, noting that the stability of the pound exchange rates and the tenders in which the holding company takes part on prices will go up.
Ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) Policies Committee Chairman, Gamal Mubarak said that the government would resume regulations of economic reform through introducing fresh policies by the end of the current year in order to encourage investments.
They are also capable of introducing more efficient operation and production rules, he pointed out.
Minister of Investment, Mahmoud Mohieddin said that the main public banks such as the National Bank of Egypt and Banque Misr would not be privatized. But, this does not mean that the government has not already taken a decision to sell one of the four public banks. This step will be announced soon.
The sources pointed that there were another 26 banks whose grace periods were extended for another year by the CBE. Should they, however, fail to raise their capital, they would be merged next year.
The sources emphasized that a committee had been formed to study the banking sector's positions' compared such positions with the positions of banks in some other countries including Israel and Turkey and referred the results to the NDP Policies Committee which approved them.
The sources said that a number of public banks presidents demanded support in the case of having a smaller bank merged with the public bank because the six banks to be merged suffered from financial problems.
He pointed out two criteria adopted when selling the public enterprise sector's companies the first, is selling those companies to investors who are able to run them with economic efficiency in order to preserve the public fund, the second came in coordination with the directives of the political leadership that stress ensuring personnel rights and not harming any worker by selling any of the public assets.
He pointed out that the period of leading the public enterprise according to what is called "one man show" had ended.
However, he pointed out that there is no backtracking on the incentives that were stated in the current investment law. At the same time he pointed out that there are excessive facilities and incentives that would be reconsidered. He called for giving the new board of directors of the General Investment Authority (GIA) with its new members, who have good experience and potential in spite of their relatively young ages, a 3-month period to be acquainted with the problems and the administrative elements in the GIA. Some of those elements, we admit are not qualified enough to deal with investors or perform their task effectively.
He noted that there is a big list of obstacles that face the application of the real estate finance law foremost of which is the registration and defining of income and also of interest rates to the end of the list of problems we need to solve.
The ten companies include fully state-owned companies, mainly Mamoura for Housing and Construction and Alexandria for Mineral Oils. The company would put for sale its shares in the two companies.
SERIOUS STEPS TO ACTIVATE PRIVATIZATION PROGRAMME
They said the real deficit will exceed 9.6 billion dollars during the current fiscal year, i.e. around 8 million pounds over the expected limit. They expressed their optimism about the ability of the new financial policy to activate national economy and attract more Arab and foreign investments in addition to supporting local industry. This, eventually, will increase proceeds in the long run due to the expansion of tax payers base. However, experts see that the problem will lie in how to avoid the crisis in the short run and distribute the burden of financing deficit in a normal way.
The new financial policy gives priority to activating economy, taking into consideration the fact that the budget deficit should not exceed the safe limits, he noted.
Professor of tax accounting at Ain Shams University, Dr. Said Abdel-Monem said the studies conducted by the Finance Ministry about the effect of tax reduction from 40% to 30%, affirmed that the decline in proceeds range from 3.5 to 5 billion pounds.
CONSTRUCTION, DEVELOPMENT OF 16 INVESTMENT ROADS
The cost of those new roads is estimated at 3.5 billion pounds. Another 8 old roads would be upgraded at a cost of 5.5 billion pounds. Those roads are Cairo-Port Said-Ismailia road, Al-Nuqb-Nuweiba road, Sharm El-Sheikh road, Sukhna-Marsa Alam road, Fayoum-Aswan road, Matrouh-Siwa road, Alexandria-Matrouh road and Edfu-Marsa Alam road.
Projects will be presented to the parliament in its coming session, including the establishment of economic courts which are specialized in economic and commercial affairs, the minister said. Such courts will help settle economic disputes which caused the economic crisis to worsen.
Growth rates are also less than required. Foreign investment will not come to Egypt unless obstacles and bureaucracy are removed, he said.
In a few days' time, the NDP office panel will hold a meeting with the government to agree on the proposed amendments to political rights practice law either for updating slates or preparing polling stations.
Moreover, he added, the level of health care and public services would be raised including Notary Public and licence services. In their dialogue with the NDP, opposition parties asked for launching the freedom of forming new parties, which should be subject to the general law. They also asked that no party should be established on a religious basis.
ZAKAREYA AZMI: MUBARAK WILL MAKE SOME CABINET CHANGES IN TIME
At 11 am, Azmi added, the President returns to start his contacts with officials in Egypt so as to follow up work progress.
Alaa Mubarak, the President's elder son, is accompanying him now in Germany. Gamal Mubarak left for Cairo last week after he had been reassured that the surgery was a success.
Ibrahim is expected to travel to Washington next Tuesday to meet Kerry in the following day.
The Egyptian Anti-torture Committee and 17 human rights organizations asked Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to personally and immediately declare his strong opposition to torture and human rights abuses with no reservations within the framework of the comprehensive reform plan.
For his part, deputy chairman of the National Council for Human Rights (NCHR) Dr. Ahmed Kamal Abul Majd agreed with the protesters when he said in a conference organized by the Arab Program for Human Rights Activists on Saturday that council members have a positive orientation to change present realities, noting that torture is a stigma in the face of this country.
Amin Iskandar, a leader of an under-foundation party called Al-Karama (dignity) Party, said some of signatories of a recent statement signed by 500 people were preparing for a public campaign to collect signatures and register them with the Public Notary Office, calling for president and vice-president elections.
Dr. Abdel-Mona'em Abul-Fotouh, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) Group, termed the intellectuals' statement, which calls for democratic changes, as a purely Egyptian reform initiative. Abul-Fotouh called for political reforms far from US or European interference, noting that an abolished emergency and a modified constitution would be conducive to the election of a president from among several candidates.
Ahmed Baha'uldin Shaaban, a famous writer, warned the ruling regime in Egypt against shrugging off a reform initiative proposed by politicians and intellectuals. Any delay in the implementation of this initiative gives a pretext for alien forces to poke their noses in Egypt's home affairs.
In his column, Executive Chief Editor Abdel-Halim Qandil writes an article which runs to the following effect only in part: Only the blind may deny that shiver sent down the back of the Egyptian politics due to implications of a return to the power patrimony scenario.
Under this headline, Hazim Saghia of Al-Hayat writes an article on page 9, some excerpts of which run to the following effect: Cairo scene is perhaps dominated by a galaxy of questions and answers which may be mainly these!
Question 4: What will be Gamal Mubarak's role?
Finally, the maximum reform means a departure from July 1952 legacy (issues transcending direct policy like religious reform which are not on anybody's agenda in Egypt).
The man is close to Mubarak and is not branded corrupt. He is also favoured by Gamal Mubarak and the Americans and is the most concerned among Egyptian officials with regional relations especially the Israeli-Palestinian issue.
Reaching such a goal requires becoming secretary general of the ruling National Democratic Party, a renovation of partisan life and election performance, etc.
Egypt rejects any Israeli forces in Philadelphia border route, said Egyptian Foreign Minister, Ahmed Maher, pointing out that Egypt accepts the presence of international observers instead, who would make sure that the parties concerned abide by their obligations.
On the other hand, the Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa criticized the decision of the US Congress, which includes support of Israel seizure of the Palestinians' lands. The decision neglects the legitimate human rights of the Palestinian refugees, which had been supported by successive US administrations in compliance with the International Law and relevant human rights, he said.
The official confirmed this report by sending a statement of Alexandria, Port Said and Damietta ports movement which uncovered scores of trips to those ports this month only between the aforementioned Egyptian ports and three Israeli ports; Haifa, Ashdod and Elat.
Deputy Al-Badri Farghali emphasized that the report pertains to Alexandria and Dekheila Ports. The problem with Port Said Port lies in the entry of the Israeli Zeim ships into the port through the Suez Canal. He, nevertheless, showed surprise at Maritime Transport Sector officials drawing upon Israeli trade ships for transporting goods and imports to Egypt to the detriment of the national transport fleet. He pointed out the retreat of Egyptian trade fleet quota in transporting the country's imports from abroad in the last few years on behalf of Israeli ships while Maritime Transport Sector officials complain about a retreat of the sector's revenues because Egyptian ships did not work to full capacity.
Minister of Insurance and Social Affairs Amina al-Gindi failed to keep secret the theft of 750,000 pounds from the coffers of the ministry's Divan Sector chairman Mohamed Maher's office in spite of her intensive efforts to prevent the issue from reaching press or police.
She not only broke the law by not reporting the incident to the police but she also provided money in place of the sum stolen from the financial allocations of NGOs, social rehabilitation, social defence societies and social clubs.
It also showed high joblessness, sluggish reforms and poor investment rates compared to other developing countries.
Egypt showed a modest performance compared to other countries regarding most indicators of competitiveness in trade and foreign investment attraction.

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS RECORDS DEFICIT OF $158 MN VERSUS SURPLUS OF $546 MN LAST YEAR
The relative distribution of resources of the balance of payments hitting 30 billion dollars included 22% for the total non-oil commodity exports; 18% for tourism; 13% for oil exports; 10% for returns of oil companies and the foreign companies operating in Egypt; 10% for Egyptian expatriates' remittances; 9% for Suez Canal; 3% for maritime and air transport services; 3% for the formal remittances in the form of aid and grants from foreign countries topped by the US; 2% for returns on deposits of Egyptian banks abroad and less than 1% for government's proceeds which include charges of the services provided by Egyptian consulates abroad.
Moreover, some points are unjustified from the economic, financial and investment points of view, which raises calls for correction. More importantly, there are demands protecting legitimate interests of the economic and social development as well as providing the minimum limit of customs protection for local production and curbing excessive importation, which results in pressure on foreign exchange and the return of feverish speculations with all their harm to the entire economic condition.
The defect came as a result of the tariff amendments which were confined to reducing the average customs duties on imported components from 25% to 12%, a differential of 13%, with a differential of 28% only between components and the fully manufactured cars instead of 75%. As long as 90% of Egypt's production of passenger cars are included in the category of 1300-1600 cc, the prices of Egyptian products became similar to those of imported ones and sometimes higher than them, especially after those amendments. Therefore, production of all cars of less than 1600 cc will stop in spite of the huge investments spent on their production in local factories. The purchase of any local components from the feeding industries of such factories will stop too, taking into consideration that the rate of local manufacture in different plants ranges between 45% and 52% for those cars.
Furthermore, it is suggested also to set up a committee for the Customs Department and the General Organization for Industrialization for reviewing imported cars and components and those existing in storehouses or production lines in factories whose customs duties were paid before the customs tariff cut. This committee should consider customs affairs of the plants so that those plants can dispose of their products at prices similar to those of imported ones with the least possible losses and setting conditions on importing used lorries.

The IBO asked the company to reconsider its relations with Israel and halt its sales to the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) out of its ethical and social responsibility, and in implementation of the international law that admitted to the Palestinian people's rights to have their independent state on their land which Israel occupies and practices the most appalling types of ethnic cleansing on it.
EGYPT AND GAZA

On the Palestinian front, Arafat should unify the security bodies into only three under the minister of the interior, who should be powerful enough to make his presence felt.
The two-month respite may be insufficient to overcome the many complications it is facing, taking into account the two experiments of Mahmoud Abbas and Ahmed Qurie as prime ministers who failed to obtain any security or financial competence that Arafat was required to give up and taking also into consideration that there are scores of officials in charge of the current security bodies who seem to be unwilling to give up either their posts or commitments.

The NATO went flabby after the Russian danger disappeared.
I think Dr. Allawil feels obliged to Iran for refraining from offering any training or security "services" to his Iraq.
Dr. Allawi knows Iraqi forces better than I do.
More dangerous even than drawing upon the NATO umbrella is that emanating from the Iraqi June 30th government threatening to sweep the Sunnite district.
His attempt failed, it is true, but it proved the man's mettle and strong relation with officers especially partisan ones.
Such security forces whose fabric and texture is unknown were placed at Allawi's disposal. Will Allawi's sectarian non-affiliation be enough to guarantee his government forces neutrality so that the sweep may not turn into civil religious and ethnic war massacres?
Saddam's regime, however, is responsible for destroying security of Iraq and exposing it to intervention through its ferocious dealing with the Shiites and the Kurds.

He proposed importing rice to put an end to speculations on it and to help achieve balanced prices. He also stressed the importance of compliance of the Egyptian standard specifications with international specifications and warned against making any violation to international standards as that might impede exportation of the Egyptian rice. He said that a committee, including representatives of the Authority of Standard Unification, the General Authority for Exports and Imports Control, Supply Ministry and Agriculture Quarantine was formed with a view to determining the specifications and developing them through introducing new modifications to them as regards reduction of impurities and raising the quality of rice.
The state's role in the national economy management process should be that of the organizer rather than that of the investor, he said, emphasizing that this may give room to the private sector with its big, medium and small-sized entities to assume a basic role in the economic activity and achieve efficient economic resources management in a way that enables the government to bolster its social role and focus its limited resources on protecting low-income categories.
Poverty control and increasing income of low-income categories will not be achieved through expenditure out of the public treasury but rather through rationalized customs and tax policies encouraging small, medium and big-sized projects to make progress and devise applicable alternatives to decrease tax burdens, he pointed out.
32 BANKS TO BE MERGED IN ONE YEAR'S TIME
The banks to be merged are Exterior Bank, Mohandes Bank, United Bank of Egypt, Nile Bank, Commerce and Development Bank (Al-Tegaryoun) and Islamic International Bank for Investment and Development.
The sources uncovered that the number of banks in Egypt is considerable and is not compatible with the economic conditions. Some of those banks have branches in a limited number of governorates which might reach three or four at most.
Minister of Investment Dr. Mahmoud Mohieddin said his ministry focused on attracting foreign investments, that seek good investment opportunity with accepted risks, through preparing the good environment by taking a package of decisions and laws that would qualify Egypt to get its fair share of the international and Arab investments, especially the Gulf ones.
So the current stage depends on the criteria of the efficiency in the application of such laws in all investment fields.
These bodies would review the companies' performance. Those bodies are the Central Bank of Egypt, the Egyptian Stock Exchange, the Central Agency For Public Mobilization and Statistics and the Finance Ministry the owner of those companies. Those bodies would finish reviewing and evaluating the companies performance in 30 days.
He added that the coming period would witness selecting a number of governorates and areas in Egypt that would be given priority in special investment dealings to help achieve the acquired regional development.
Dr. Nazif's government announced on Monday it would put up for sale its shares in ten Public Enterprise Sector and joint-stock companies as a first batch within the framework of assets and investments management program.
Observers believe the announcement is timely and a "positive indication" that the government is once again willing to rejuvenate the privatization program. The new government wants to develop that privatization program through a program for State's assets management, which slowed down over the last five years.
The remarks were said during Rashid's meeting with members of Japanese Businessmen Association, who are currently visiting Egypt. There are some mechanisms through which industrial sectors and exports could be backed, including modernizing the industrial sector, restructuring the Export Promotion Fund (EPF), making the best use of partnership agreements, cementing human resources' contribution, activating financial resources, boosting exports, developing strategies of the industrial sector, and providing information and communications means, Rashid pointed out.
He said the simulation models prepared by the ministry affirmed that it is possible to make up for that deficit through the proceeds which will come from a boost economic activity in a period ranging from 12 to 18 months.
For his part, former prime minister advisor Dr. Hatem Al-Qarnashawi said the average deficit in the state public budget will increase in the short and medium runs due to application of the new financial policy. However, the question is: Is the increase of budget deficit for activating economy a required aim or not?
He also expected that a real leap would take place in the rates of Arab and foreign investments in Egypt. Reduction of tax to 20% means that Egypt will enjoy the lowest tax rate in the Arab region, which makes it qualified to attract further investments during the coming period.
Magdi Al-Dahan. Al-Dahan told Al-Alam Al-Youm daily that the map was submitted to the Transport Minister Essam Sharaf who approved it. It is also expected to be referred to the cabinet next month as a prelude to implementing it.
Within the framework of looking for a way out of the economic crisis and pumping fresh blood to economy, which has been in a state of recession for years and affected investment rates, Minister of Investment Dr. Mahmoud Moheiddin said the attraction of investment and improvement of its climate depend on a group of current laws and decisions. These laws and decisions need to be amended and reviewed. In addition, new pieces of legislation should be issued to help ease the movement of investment, he added.
The law on competition and anti-trust is given priority and will be discussed in detail during the coming session of the People's Assembly. At the same time, the law on consumer protection will also be presented. Moreover, establishment of control bodies in charge of applying laws and coordination mechanisms will be considered, in addition to activating the work of consumer protection societies, Moheiddin said.
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS RECORDS DEFICIT OF $158 MN VERSUS SURPLUS OF $546 MN LAST YEAR
The relative distribution of resources of the balance of payments hitting 30 billion dollars included 22% for the total non-oil commodity exports; 18% for tourism; 13% for oil exports; 10% for returns of oil companies and the foreign companies operating in Egypt; 10% for Egyptian expatriates' remittances; 9% for Suez Canal; 3% for maritime and air transport services; 3% for the formal remittances in the form of aid and grants from foreign countries topped by the US; 2% for returns on deposits of Egyptian banks abroad and less than 1% for government's proceeds which include charges of the services provided by Egyptian consulates abroad.
The monthly report issued by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) said foreign debt increased to 28.9 billion US dollars late in last June, up one billion dollars in comparison to June 2003. This led to the increase of debt service burdens by around 268.3 million dollars to hit 2.5 billion dollars during the fiscal year 2003/2004. The ratio of debt service burdens to the current toll recorded 9.2% versus 10.1% in the last fiscal year.
The CBE attributed the increase of trade balance deficit to the increase of payments on imports by 3.2 billion dollars or 21.3% as well as the increase of exports by 2.2 billion dollars (27.4%) to hit 10.5 billion dollars.
Moreover, some points are unjustified from the economic, financial and investment points of view, which raises calls for correction. More importantly, there are demands protecting legitimate interests of the economic and social development as well as providing the minimum limit of customs protection for local production and curbing excessive importation, which results in pressure on foreign exchange and the return of feverish speculations with all their harm to the entire economic condition.
The defect came as a result of the tariff amendments which were confined to reducing the average customs duties on imported components from 25% to 12%, a differential of 13%, with a differential of 28% only between components and the fully manufactured cars instead of 75%. As long as 90% of Egypt's production of passenger cars are included in the category of 1300-1600 cc, the prices of Egyptian products became similar to those of imported ones and sometimes higher than them, especially after those amendments. Therefore, production of all cars of less than 1600 cc will stop in spite of the huge investments spent on their production in local factories. The purchase of any local components from the feeding industries of such factories will stop too, taking into consideration that the rate of local manufacture in different plants ranges between 45% and 52% for those cars.
Furthermore, it is suggested also to set up a committee for the Customs Department and the General Organization for Industrialization for reviewing imported cars and components and those existing in storehouses or production lines in factories whose customs duties were paid before the customs tariff cut. This committee should consider customs affairs of the plants so that those plants can dispose of their products at prices similar to those of imported ones with the least possible losses and setting conditions on importing used lorries.
According to the latest CBE report, the government borrowed LE22.9 billion from the banks thus raising its debts to banks to LE126 billon!
AMERICA STOPS PRODUCING GENETICALLY ENGINEERED WHEAT FOLLOWING EGYPT'S REFUSAL TO BUY IT
Minister of Investment Mahmoud Mohieddin and Minister of Foreign Trade and Industry Rashid Mohamed Rashid have started a European tour including Britain, Italy and France to meet financial and business representatives there and familiarize them with the recent radical customs and tax reforms. They will also promote the investment climate and opportunities in Egypt before European companies on the Egyptian market.
In a report on Egypt, the OBG emphasized that encouraging foreign trade and developing industry is the backbone of the government programs in the coming period.
This survey aims at highlighting negative and positive aspects of the investment atmosphere in Egypt and comparing it with the advanced countries so that practical and active steps could be taken and priorities of different bodies could be set to create the most suitable atmosphere for investment, Moheiddin said in press statements on Sunday.
Prices rose to unprecedented levels in FY 2003/2004 due to liberalization of the rate of exchange and speculations, Minister of Planning Othman Mohamed Othman uncovered.
The state plan's urgent projects in villages and districts failed to create job opportunities, he said, pointing out that this program was being reviewed.
The four banks can supply anybody, who is going to perform haj or umrah, with about two thousand riyals at the official rate of exchange once he/she gets the visa and travel ticket, the source said.
The state's foreign exchange revenues increased from 22.2 billion dollars in FY 2002/2003 to 27.4 billion dollars in FY 2003/2004, up 23%.
Growth rates in different sectors also increased last year: building and construction sectors' growth rate went up to 2% against a decrease of 5% in 2002/2003; agricultural sector, 3.3%, which is a stable rate due to the stability of the growth rates of its inputs; tourism sector, 38%; and the processing industry sector, 3.5% against 2.3%, he said, adding that this sector (processing industry) is expected to rise and that great importance is attached to it to increase national economic growth rate.
Communications investments hit 15 billion pounds in three years, Minister of Communications and Information Technology Tarek Kamel said. Fixed phone subscribers amounted to 9.4 millions, while the target is 10.7 millions by the end of 2005, he added.
In light of the economic reform policy adopted by the state and the work for achieving an all-out development in all sectors especially irrigation and water resources sector, the Minister of Irrigation and Water Resources Mahmoud Abu Zeid met with the German Bank KFW's delegation to discuss and follow up the projects that is financed by that bank with investments estimated at 1.5 billion pounds.
IMPORTING WHEAT FROM KAZAKHSTAN AFTER CULTIVATION ON EGYPT'S BEHALF
The visit aims at mulling over the possibility of getting wheat from Kazakhstan through direct importation or through hiring lands where wheat is cultivated and then exported to Egypt.
Saudi investments declined to 0,9 million dollars, down 1.3 million dollars; direct British investments plummeted by 15.3 million dollars to hit 0.3 million dollars; and direct Swiss investments went down by 0.4 million dollars to hit 0.2 million dollars.
However, direct foreign investments hit 1.2 million dollars, down by 100,000 dollars, the CBE statistics added.
It is to be mentioned that the commercial exchange between Egypt and Czech hit 27.6 million dollars during the first half of last year.
In a memo distributed to all the members of commodity council for construction, Ministry of Foreign Trade and Industry uncovered that there were many investment opportunities available in the construction field in Ethiopia.
It pointed out that Ethiopian government issued its directives to Ethiopian competent bodies to rent huge areas of lands to local and foreign investors at token prices with a view to setting up housing buildings on them.
LE1.8 BILLION WORTH OF EGYPT'S TRADE WITH ARAB COMMON MARKET
FIRST BATCH OF SUDANESE MEAT
Following the signing of the contract Minister of Supply Hassan Khidr said that the Sudanese meat would be imported in return for Egyptian goods and commodities, pointing out that the distribution of this meat would be through consumer co-operatives.
The increase in the number of tourists synchronized with a huge increase in the number of tourist nights spent by tourists during the reported period. The number of tourist nights hit during the first eight months of this year 53,934,066 nights, i.e. up 84.8% in comparison with 29,179,383 tourist nights during the corresponding period of 2003.
Minister of Foreign Trade and Industry, Rashid Mohamed Rashid said that 80 percent of the new customs amendments would serve industry as there was a cut in duties imposed on production inputs and requirements and capital commodities including machines, devices and spare parts. Moreover, 20 percent of those amendments only serve the end product.
The axes include laying down a clear industrial policy for different industrial sectors so that the government's intervention in any industry whether through support, investment may become clear the investor.
FORMATION OF NEW CABINET WITH UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF NEW FACES
Expectations point out that an unprecedented number of new faces will join the new government.
It is noteworthy that some members of the policy committee had been appointed in the Shura (Advisory) Council among 44 members that should be appointed by the president according to his constitutional terms of reference.
Those confirmations of Mubarak's stay in his post came in response to requests by some opposition political and partisan trends that ask the president to leave his post as chairman of the NDP as he is the president of all Egyptians.
7220 STATEMENTS PLEDGING TO IMPROVE ECONOMIC POSITION FAILED
About 47 million souls of low and middle brackets suffer from several problems which government failed to solve.
CAIRO INFORMS ISRAEL IT WOULD RECONSIDER PLAYING A ROLE IN SHARON'S PLAN
The sources quoted an Egyptian official as saying, "How can Israel expect us to play the role of firefighter while it indulges in making fires everywhere without a reason." He continued to say, "If Sharon is serious in his pull-out plan, he should prove his good intentions through issuing direct orders asking his forces to stop their, destroying of infrastructure of the PNA controlled territories and assassinations operations which target the political and military cadres of different Palestinian resistance factions.
"Although we know that the current Constitution does not entitle us to hold a conference, or field anybody for presidency, we will ask for having the Constitution clauses amended," he said.
Parliamentary milieus expected that the constitution might be amended next year after the parliamentary elections mid-2005 and the start of a new presidential 6-year term in office on October 16th 2005 lest this issue may prompt anybody to make "initiatives" like what happened during late president Sadat when some people demanded that the presidency of the republic be lifelong, which was rejected by Sadat himself.
The constitution amendment comes within the framework of political reform plans uncovered by President Hosni Mubarak. This issue is likely to be tackled during the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) congress next September, they added.
Such constitutional amendments are expected to tackle political and economic changes witnessed by the country over the last years, including partisan plurality and shift from the guided economy to the open-door policy system, the sources pointed out.
Celebratory manifestations have spreaded, which were considered by observers as a prelude to preparing for a fifth term in office. Mubarak's fourth term in office terminates in October 2005.
The ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) is also expected to hold rallies where its senior officials and ministers will talk about Mubarak's achievements.
To the exclusion of a small number of ministers (namely Defence, the Interior and Foreign) whose nature of work makes it incumbent upon them to follow up their ministries, other ministries have almost been paralyzed.
The deputies pointed out that there is no need to amend the constitution to introduce the proportionate list system, arguing that any tendency to modify the constitution will not take place before the coming presidential elections next year, let alone the success of the experiment of the Shura (advisory) Council mid-term elections in spite of some negative aspects related to capital control over voters in some constituencies.
As regards the Shura Council activities, the council, unprecedentedly, decided to apply the electronic voting system as of the next parliamentary session instead of the current vote by show of hands system.
For their part, PA leadership confirmed the impossibility of applying the electronic system, even after its application in the Shura Council, unless a new bigger parliamentary hall was set up to allocate a seat for each deputy.
It seems that the new guards who are leading the reform process cleverly and silently will achieve their goals gradually in the coming days and that change will include all the members of the old guards, some of them have been in the political scene for long years.
Change is also expected to include the ministries of Parliamentary Affairs, Public Enterprise Sector, Local Development, Manpower, and Environment. Names of some ministries may be changed and other names and tasks may be devised. In a nutshell, change and amendment may include 85 percent of the ministries. This will be synchronizous with a surprise made by President Mubarak himself during the coming few months, as the cabinet reshuffle should be followed by having many important posts, which have been shelved for long years, occupied.
Dr. Atef Ebeid has obviously, so far, managed to meet the needs of this generation in the executive field by assigning leading tasks to some of its symbols. In the legislative field, it managed to do so through referring bills to the parliament so as to serve the economic elite that backs the new orientations in the NDP General Secretariat.
The symbols of that thought think that only very few people did harm to the private sector or its role. They insist on the introduction of changes to education, foreign trade and financial and monetary policies that take no account of the grass roots, free services or subsidizing producers rather than dealers and traders. The papers prepared for the NDP next congress by the new thought advocates point out that the ruling party will put up some options that are very difficult to choose from.
According to observers, it can fairly be said that the new generation symbols are intelligent, creative and innovative but the main problem they would have to face with the people is the fact that their approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict has no obvious features. Nor do they have a clear attitude towards the poor and the unfair distribution of incomes in Egypt. Their main argument is this when every possible facility is readily offered to businessmen, all pockets may expect some sort of gain by the end of the day.
In a meeting held by the Policy Committee, Gamal Mubarak launched sharp criticism at "May" newspaper, which he described as one that does not befit even school paper contributors.
He did not deny its relation to the party either, adding that Al-Ahrar Party, for instance published scores of newspapers and that he himself had given his written approval of Mohamed Abou Hadid becoming Al-Mustakbal Al-Gadid chief editor. Other newspapers have come to the succor of the so called "reform team."
In his writings in Rose Al-Youssef, Abdullah Kamel emphasized his support of any political or regional reform thought coming from the National Democratic Party or the opposition (Al-Tagamo'h for instance) or Bibliotheca Alexandrina.
Al-Masry Al-Youm is another newspaper charged with being "close to" ... as it is financed by a group of businessmen, the class allied with the "reform or patrimony" team and the maintenance of Gamal's influence on the government in presence of the gains made throughout the last quarter of a century.
With Nahdat Misr weekly newspaper the accusing tone grows, but its executive chief editor Mohamed Hassan Al-Alfi replied that the paper was not private property of any person or group.
With "Al-Mustaqbal Al-Gadid" newspaper, the matter takes a new turn as its chief editor in an editorial last Thursday said that the newspaper is an organ of the Policy Committee and wonders why that could be a cause of worry to any person.
He even accused us, just as Abdullah Kamal previously did, of fabricating the patrimony issue which, according to him, existed only in our imagination.
I asked him how the paper is financed.
When I asked businessman, Ahmed Rashwan why he propitiated the Policy Committee group, he did not get angry.
I own three storeys in the tower.
Why should we do him wrong just because he is the President's son? Why shouldn't we just judge him away from his family or kinship?
He would also resign from his position as head of the National Democratic Party (NDP). Who other than Gamal may be able to control the party?"
This House, well-known for international masterpieces like Faust, Ayda, Mme Butterfly and Othello, etc... has tasked an Asian musical band to write that new opera work and compose its music in accordance with a formula recently agreed upon by the two parties.
The opera work whose name has not been defined yet, will certainly cover controversial and dramatic aspects in Geddafi's life, said the opera spokesman, adding that snapshots for important political events in Libya and other countries would be used as background for the work.
Contemporary art manager, Alex Potas says that the House wanted to open new artistic aspects to a wider sector of people.
Another source described Mossa's position as "a step which aims to attract the attention of the AL-member states to his resentment against the escalation of the financial crisis" which is about to undermine the AL and negatively affect the work of its specific organizations and its representative offices abroad.
The volume of financial arrears hit 100 million dollars in addition to 56 million dollars against which some objections have been raised due to the reservation made by a large number of countries about the rates of their contributions in the AL, which resulted in an annual deficit of 5.12%.
Iraq tops the list of the Arab countries that owe debts to the AL as it owes it 50 million dollars; then Libya, 20 million dollars; Somalia, 5 million dollars; Mauritania, 3.3 million dollars and Djibouti, 4 million dollars.
Under the above heading, Dr. Khaled Al-Dekheil, Saudi writer and professor of political science in Saudi universities, wrote to say: The Egyptian move towards Palestine insistently raises four important questions: Why did Egypt choose to carry out this mission at this particular time and specifically with Sharon?
Why did Egypt choose to take over this mission at this particular time?
The Egyptian president visited Washington last May.
This declaration was announced during Sharon's visit to the White House and only two days after Mubarak's visit to it.
This declaration is a big shift in the US policy towards the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Now we come to the second question; why did Israel accept the Egyptian role and the return of Egypt to Gaza, particularly as Israel is known for its flat refusal of any non-American interference between it and the Palestinians?
Political advisor to President Mubarak said one of the aims of the Egyptian move is to prevent Israel from sweeping Palestinian territories and to stop assassinations and violations against the Palestinians.
As Osama Al-Baz hinted, Sharon refused any mediation by Cairo and insisted that the Egyptian role should not go beyond achieving security stability in Gaza Strip and along the border. Al-Hayat newspaper quoted Israeli press sources as saying that Sharon said, "I will not allow Egypt to play the role of a mediator between us and the Palestinians or to launch direct or indirect negotiations with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) because this will make the disengagement plan bilateral and not unilateral. It will also undermine the roadmap principles that provide for not holding negotiations with the Palestinians unless they combat terrorism."
The strange thing is that Cairo knows this better than others and knows that the limits of its role are narrower than it thinks.
In the meantime, the PNA will be keen that the Egyptian role should not be an alternative to it in negotiations.
Egypt, however, cannot achieve either.
And in return for what?
This means that the Egyptian role became dependent upon Israeli political accounts and balances even before it started, just like the Palestinian situation.
All this is based on the supposition that the Bush Administration will win a second term in office.
So, why did Egypt decide to play a role it cannot assume?
FOREIGN DEBT DECLINES BY $368 MILLION
The report added that the total value of short-term debts at the end of the third quarter accounted for 2.784 billion dollars against 1,747,300 dollars in the second quarter of the same year.
This is not a complaint by a Palestinian following the destruction of his house at the hands of the Israeli army or words by an Arab in Israel that usurped his lands, but it is a cry by (Egyptian) citizen Murid Mahmoud Azzarbawi. Israel had usurped 12 feddans owned by his family since 1922. Such lands were officially registered in the Land Registration Department, known as "Taboo", in the Palestinian government in 1937. This is considered a decisive proof that Azzarbawi is entitled to have access to this land, especially as Israel had announced in 1948 following its establishment that the only proof of possession of lands by individuals, whether they were Arabs or Jews, would be determined according to the registers of such a department.
Egypt has kicked off concrete steps towards a technological system to activate and support inventions and innovations in the Arab world through regional cooperation among Arab intellectual property bureaus in the area of building basic capability, developing human sources and crystallizing the current situation and future vision of the Arab Patent Office.
Science, technology and production are three components directly connected with development policies and plans as science is a basis for technology, which is the main pillar of production - the backbone of development. Thorough development requires continued technological development, which accelerates its rates and makes its results more effective. Arab countries are agreed on such concepts, a thing which makes the intellectual property system enter the system of effectuating and supporting innovation in the Arab region and exchange successful expertise in this field among Arab and foreign patent offices.
Although the number of street kids in Egypt hovers between 1-1.5 million boys and girls, the number of mothers among them is unknown and on the increase, as every street girl is exposed to rape on a daily basis, and consequently fall pregnant.
Manager of UNICEF's program for protecting children Nadra Zaki says that the street young girls are the most vulnerable to sexual harassment, aggression and violence.
Although statistics point out that the number of street girls is lower than that of street boys (around 8%), those girls find themselves involved in what can be called gangs, who are professional in drug trafficking and taking, beggary and prostitution.
The World Bank severely pressurizes the Nile Basin countries to discuss some ideas that lead to privatizing and pricing the Nile Water, said Secretary General of the Union of Agriculture and Irrigation Workers' Syndicates in the Nile Basin countries Mohamed Abdel Halim.
On the other hand, the negotiation committee of law experts in the Nile Basin Initiative will hold its meeting in Uganda in the period from 20th to 24th September next.
For his part, the representative of the World Bank urged the Nile Basin countries to conduct amendments in the organizational structure of the Nile Basin countries grouping in order to cope with the joint ventures of water resources development.
In a seminar held by the Dialogue Forum at the Bibliotheca Alexandrina two day ago, the minister denied that the religious discourse renewal came on instructions from America, as alleged by some.
He described reports about a plan to stop building mosques or to cancel religious education in Egypt as "rumors because Azharite education cannot be cancelled.
71% OF FEMALE FARMERS WORK WITHOUT WAGES
CRISIS BETWEEN GOV'T, AL-AZHAR DUE TO STOPPING RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS BUILDING
Zaqazoq denied any foreign pressure leading to such a decision. He said, "50 years ago, Egypt had about 10 religious institutes and 3 Azharite faculties.
The decision's main items included not giving permits for building any mosque or Azharite institute until previous approvals were obtained under the concerned bodies supervision. The rule governing buildings that were constructed without a permit is to have them demolished and have the legal procedures applied. Governors shall take the necessary steps to stop their completion and prevent providing them with utilities. Buildings which did not take the shape of a mosque like "Zawyah" (small places for worship), can be made use of through projects which are useful to the community like illiteracy combating centers.
Minister of Youth and Sports Ali Eddin Helal and Secretary-General of the National Council for Maternity and Childhood Moshira Khattab are expected to inaugurate a sports festival called "Sport and Championship" on Friday evening, organized by the Evangelical Community in the Indoor Hall in Cairo International Stadium. The event is anticipated to attract 50,000 Muslim and Christian children nationwide aged 8-16.
Meanwhile, churches have kicked off the festival of Mark Episcopate, which was inaugurated by Pope Shenuda III, pope of Alexandria and patriarch of Mark Episcopate. Attracting 200,000 Coptic youths this year, the event involves games, scouting, plastic arts, choral, theater shows and others.
The memo included objections to some shots in the film, which they consider as deriding their religion. "The movie also shows quarrels, hot scenes and beating a priest with a shoe in a church, which they consider as an insult to Egypt's Copts," the memo said. Clergymen are not opposed to having Copts shown in dramas, but they object to the use of holy texts and mocking some religious creeds in the film, the memo added, pointing out Egyptian Copts' keenness on supporting arts and creativeness provided that such artistic works should not insult heavenly religions.
There was another serial shown in the last holy month of Ramadan, namely ragul al-aqdar (the Man of Destinies) starring Nour El-Sherif. It shows a number of priests, during the Islamic Conquest of Egypt, seeking material gains at the expense of their religion.
During its inspection tour, the minister pointed out that the cost of the station hit 507 million dollars and financed by the Arab Economic Development Fund, the Kuwaiti Economic Development Fund and the European Investment Bank. The station capacity hit 1500 megawatts, of which 1000 megawatts for gas units and 500 megawatts for steam units.

The Government delegate to the CEA Mohamed Al-Shewi said that the conditions stipulated that the exporting firms have to get the approval of the CEA on their deals before signing them, all contracts have to be registered in the CEA and contracts would be final as soon as the two parties signed them and all buyers shall pay in U.SS dollar.
Under such reforms, all banking entities and those entities which provide similar activities but do not have enough money for this purpose and face competition requirements, will have to quit the market, thus posing more burdens to them even though the monetary stability atmosphere in the country pushed them to demand disengagement with banks. This disengagement materialized late 2002.
He is in the belief that the absence of small-sized entities may allow these firms to fill the gap they left, especially regarding monetary transfers made by exchange firms worldwide.
In exclusive statements to Al-Alam Al-Youm paper, he added that investment opportunities in Egypt are very strong, as Egypt has a distinguished position on geographical and economic maps. Egyptian government's latest decision to cut customs tariffs would be a strong incentive to increase Chinese investment in Egypt.
A group of Egyptian businessmen and investors entered into negotiations with their Sudanese counterparts to set up a second Egyptian-Sudanese bank at a capital of 100 million dollars.
ATEF EBEID NAMED TO AIB CHAIRMANSHIP
The AIB board comprises 17 members, including 5 Egyptians, namely Dr.
Yesterday (25th September), President Hosni Mubarak discussed with the economic ministerial group the way and means of developing economic performance, improving the investment atmosphere and following up the privatization program.
The president approved of the formation of a quintet including representatives of the Central Auditing Agency, Capital Market Authority, Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), Finance Ministry and Bar Association to be in charge of endorsing the evaluation prepared by the holding companies as a prelude to selling.
U.S. ASTA (American Association of Travel Agencies) under Amr Sedqi organized a symposium on how to increase American tourists to Egypt despite unrest in the Middle East. Ways and means of boosting the Americans' confidence in the Egyptian destination were discussed in the symposium.
There should be direct contact with American and Egyptian tour organizers with an advertisement campaign to remove concerns of the American citizens, who want to visit Egypt, he said, adding that tour organizers, writers and journalists should also be invited to get acquainted with peace in Egypt.
Rashid said that the conference is especially important particularly at this tough stage in light of the difficult challenges facing the industry and trade of textiles and clothes in the Mediterranean countries. These include the deregulation of textile and clothes and the cancellation of the quota system that has been valid for over 40 years.
Meanwhile, the government will keep the subsidized loaf of bread as it is without changing its quantities. It was decided to increase the production of white flour bread at a price of 10 piasters, especially as its production experiment led to cuts in subsidy burdens. Flour price per 100 kgm hit 90 pounds for bakeries in comparison to 29.3 pounds for flour allocated for subsidized bread.
In exclusive statements to Al-Ahram, the minister said the government aims to attract 2 billion dollars as foreign investment during the current fiscal year to increase to 3.5 billion dollars by the fiscal year 2005/2006 through taking economic decisions, measures and policies that support the investment climate.
The volume of investment increased 30% last year to 81 billion pounds against 71 billion pounds in the previous year. The real investment rate went up 6%, excluding the effect of prices on investment commodities, said the minister. He added that the most significant thing was the fact that the private sector re-pumped a large part of its profits to the market, as the volume of credit did not increase by the same rate.

The House Press head, Jane Livingstone told Al-Hayat that the basic idea of that opera was to explore the depths of Arab Islamic relations with the Western World through a personality of diverse idiosyncrancies like Geddafi.
The producer says that the work would not be a realistic autobiography - but rather an attempt to explore the depths of the present myth and the counter myth which once regarded Geddafi as "terrorist and crazy", but turning in the recent months into (a docile personality) who meets, shakes hands with and holds talks with British Premier Tony Belair.
MOUSSA HASN'T RECEIVED HIS SALARY FOR THE LAST YEAR TO AROUSE AL FINANCIAL CRISIS

Meanwhile, some Arab countries like Iraq, Djibouti, Mauritania, Comoros and Somalia are not able to pay their financial contributions in the AL budget.
Earlier this year, the AL Secretariat was forced to borrow 3 million dollars from the reserve account and an other 7 million dollars from the restructure account.
Why did Israel accept this role, or rather Egyptian interference, while it refuses, in principle, interference of any Arab or international party except for the US role?
There is no relevant official information to answer this question.
This means that the declaration of the Egyptian move came after President Mubarak's visit to Washington.
In this declaration Bush, approved Sharon's plan for unilateral withdrawal from Gaza. He supported Israel's right to keep West Bank settlements. He also supported Palestinian the refugees' right to return to their 1948 lands. Israel insists on this demand as a condition for settlement.
Can this shift be done without the knowledge of the Egyptian government or other Arab governments?
If the Egyptian move came within the framework of an advance understanding with Washington and within the Israeli unilateral withdrawal plan, then there would no paradox in the Israeli policy regarding the refusal of any non-American interference.
The question here is this: What will enable Egypt to achieve what it couldn't achieve in the past?
What confirms the attitude of Sharon, the initiator of the disengagement and withdrawal plan, is the fact that the Egyptian move is on in spite of the Israeli continuous incursions into Palestinian cities including Gaza in addition to the assassination operations.
What is the Palestinian stance on that?
At this juncture, the Egyptian role seems to be limited and dangerous.
The situation gets more complicated when we know that the Palestinian factions oppose the Egyptian role totally.
What is strange about the Egyptian role is that it is not based on any clear or concrete thing but just hopes and wishes.
Egypt has no certain guarantees, at least declared guarantees, from the Americans or the Israelis.
But if Bush lost the elections, something that is very likely, the new administration will not commit itself to guarantees of a former administration.
Maybe it is well wishing, maybe it is the American aid (more than 300 million dollars) given to Egypt to improve its economic conditions on the heels of the war on Iraq.
Foreign debts till the end of the third quarter of the FY 2003/2004 declined by 368.7 million US dollars in comparison to the second quarter of the same year, a report by the Central Bank of Egypt said.

Strangely and provocatively enough, Israel's nuclear reactor of Dimona was build on Azzarbawi's usurped lands in addition to vast spaces of Ariel Sharon's farm in Negev near Dorout Settlement in Al-Khalsa Al-Qadima land where he spends his leisure time with his family. Many other buildings and settlements were also built on Al-Karin and Om Sayalah lands owned by Azzarbawi's family but the names were replaced with Hebrew ones.

PREMIER OKAYS ABU QIR TO PRODUCE LIQUID FERTILIZER
The company has managed to reach an agreement with the Principal Bank for Development and Agricultural Credit (PBDAC) whereby the company's production surplus ranging between 15% and 16% of total production will be sold to the bank at export prices which are higher than those on the domestic market.

46.1 MILLION TONS VOLUME OF LOCAL CONSUMPTION OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS
He pointed out that the steady increase in the local consumption of the petroleum products is also one of the main challenges as local consumption went up to 46.1 million tons including 23 million tons of natural gas and 23 million tons of petroleum products.
While inspecting the project's site accompanied by Minister of Transport Essam Sharaf and Damietta Governor Mohamed Al-Baradie, Minister of Petroleum Sameh Fahmi said the project would benefit by the facilities of production and feeding lines of Mubarak Gas Liquefaction Complex to provide the requirements of the new project, which aims at producing petrochemicals of high economic value including methanol in order to be able to compete at world markets.

ATTEMPTS TO FOMENT SEDITION WITH NILE BASIN COUNTRIES TO BE FACED - MINISTER
In spite of all the efforts exerted, there are still attempts to foment sedition with the Nile Basin countries. Such efforts, he added, will go on, as there are some agencies and countries that want to shake Egypt's external water stability.
Controversy escalated in the banned Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) Group and Coptic milieus alike, particularly as the Ikhwan Group was included for the first time in the last annual report of the committee since its establishment as a persecuted and besieged group in Egypt.
He belittled the repercussions of having Ikhwan group included in the USCIRF's report.
The committee tried before to meet the group, but the latter refused. "The group has no relation with Saaddedin Ibrahim, accordingly he is not Ikhwan's go-between for anything," Habib added.
The delegation will meet with a big number of members of the Egyptian community, including government officials, religious leaders and human rights activists, the statement said, refraining, however, from naming the members of the delegation or the personalities whom they will meet.
Prominent Islamic figure and professor of Linguistics, Cairo University Dr. Abdel-Sabour Shahin said, "The delegation's visit is a blatant intervention in Egypt's affairs."
Anba Murkus bishop of Shubra El-Kheima Church said, "The problems of Egyptian Copts is an internal affair." He also urged the US to take care of its own internal affairs and not to intervene in the affairs of others.
In related developments western diplomats said that recently issued intelligence reports pointed out Iranian attempts to purchase components which could be used for making nuclear weapons, an accusation denied by Tehran and described as groundless.
However, they exploited the 45-day ceasefire, violated the agreement and did not abide by it. Solaiman wondered, "Those who talk about Darfur today why do not they speak about the real guilty party who did not abide by the ceasefire agreement? The army has moved only to defend itself since the signing of Absha agreement. However, the rebels increased their looting activities and kidnapping of reliefe employees and this is clear to all."
If a cabinet made up under such dim circumstances experienced by Egypt shrugs off the political reform question, then I do not believe that it can achieve anything in other secondary questions.
I wish that somebody can tell me how to convince those people waiting in the queues of bread buyers, and jobless youth to forget about such unimportant issues and problems, and to go with Nazif to invade modern technology.
As for both the monetary and financial policies of the ex-government, 66% of 50 polled personalities said that the financial policy was "weak", 22% said "acceptable", while 12% said it was good. 34% said that the monetary policy of the ex-government was "weak", 36% said "acceptable", while 30% described it as "good".
The new premier will probably rely in dealing with such issues on ideas and policies that are developed in the National Democratic Party Policy Committee. His assumption of the premiership would, therefore, end the state of conflict or disagreement that dominated the relation between the policy committee on one hand and the government, on the other hand, such a development would probably lead to ensuring the upper hand for the National Democratic Party in making the state public policy and converting the government, for the first time, into the party's government after the National Democratic Party used to be the government's party.
Although the government address did not broach the issue of political reform, the fact that some old guard traditional key figures left the government indicates more than a mere change in administration.
As the National Democratic Party (NDP) is the majority party, it is clear that its policies would be concretized soon, which means greater attention to low-income brackets, more jobs to the unemployed and housing units for young men and women.
Declared on Monday, the shape of the new government started to appear step by step as the Stock Exchange witnessed extraordinary movement in a sign that investors would come back once again to Egypt to activate markets, rejuvenate the economy and increase job opportunities.
The new government includes young personalities, who, however, would be guided by old mentalities and according to the mechanisms that the regime has been following for 22 years and would never give up.
Confirming the technocratic nature and Western backgrounds of the new government, many ministers obtained masters' degrees and doctorates from foreign universities after they had graduated from Egyptian universities.
OPPOSITION URGES GOV'T TO START POLITICAL REFORM IMMEDIATELY
Daoud said that he would not anticipate events, but he did not cancel his worry that not a word was released since the government was reshuffled about political reform. This gives an impression that there are no harbingers of hope that such a reform, sought by everybody, would be implemented.
GAMAL MUBARAK'S GENERATION FACING SECOND CHALLENGE!
Such a major objective development in defining the framework of the government formation lacked a most important mechanism, namely transparency in selection. It relied on the Egyptian state's typical strategy of selecting elements close to bureaucratic concepts based on personal acquaintance and choosing the easier option of determining who is required to occupy the position, which may have negative impacts on the hoped for results.
Over a couple of years, the new generation formation lacked elements with any political records or experience in involvement with public opinion through political, election and cultural battles or even through putting up new visions that would qualify it to spontaneously occupy official leadership positions and grant it the required role without artificiality.
It can safely be said, therefore, that what is happening on the political scene so far is only a development and updating of the Egyptian state without coups against its traditional concepts that focuses attention on economic crises to the detriment of political aspects and deal with various social factors in accordance with the rule of "work together" rather than "work for the government".
US CONDITIONS FOR QIZ PROJECTS
The American market only receives 46% of total Egyptian textile and ready-made clothes exports. The quota of Egyptian products to the American market started to retreat in the last few years in favour of the Jordanian textiles that enjoy customs privileges, as Jordan signed a QIZ agreement 5 years ago.
Deputy executive director and senior economist of the Egyptian Economic Studies Centre Dr. Samiha Fawzi said, "The establishment of QIZ in order to maintain the Egyptian exports quota of textiles on the US market is extremely sensitive for many reasons, forefront of which is the fact that the Egyptian textile exports, accounting for 498 million dollars out of a 1.40 billion dollars, have a big quota that affects the structure of Egypt's exports in general and the US market in particular. The bad situation in the region and Israeli practices against the Palestinians do not encourage that step, at least for the time being."
Egyptian diplomatic sources told Al-Hayat that the file of restoring Egyptian-Iranian relations would be reopened soon as Ahmed Aboul-Gheit will officially take up his new post as foreign minister in place of Ahmed Maher.
An Egyptian archeological researcher warned against the danger of Jewish tampering with the mummies of pharaoh kings through a team of researchers recruited by Israel to raise doubts about the Egyptian civilization and its origins like the allegation that pyramids were built by aliens.
US RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS MISSION TO DISCUSS COPTIC, SHIITE, BAHA'I ISSUES
In exclusives to Al-Masry Al-Youm daily, Al-Zefzaf said that Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar and Pope Shenuda will deliver speeches on the occasion of signing the agreement in the attendance of the members of the American religious freedoms mission that will reach Cairo on the same day, to emphasize that there is no persecution against Copts in Egypt.
Abul-Magd said that the issue of Baha'is in Egypt will be discussed during the meeting.
Al-Masry Al-Youm learnt that the American mission will focus on the allegations of persecuting the Copts, Shiites and Baha'is.
Priority should be given to political reform to set up the state of institutions and put an end to corruption, which became rampant, said Al-Wafd Party deputy chairman Mohamed Elwan.
"In my point of view government should give priority to resolutions and decrees that provide democracy with all its forms such as electing the president of the republic instead of referendum," Dawoud said.
"We believe that the new government start up should be through political reform because it is the real entry for solving all problems of different fields," Habib added.
They see that the change was confined to faces other than policies, as the new make-up included old faces while neglecting those with political insights. The new government was confined to a group of technocrats. Others called for giving an opportunity to the new government before judging it. Businessmen expressed their optimism about the new government.
Dr. Abaza expected that the new government would fail so long as it received orders and instructions from above and had no special strategy for its work.
We won't jump to conclusions but we don't axpect too much in light of the state of confusion that accompanied the declaration of the new government," added Al-Shater. Head of the Nasserist Party Dia'eddin Dawoud says the new change is a step that may result in new achievements that realize our hopes for making progress.
Al-Nazer called for giving the priority to the service sector as it achieved a surplus of 4-5 billion dollars in the current account balance for the last fiscal year. It is a promising sector, which requires removing all obstacles to it, especially tourism.
Abdel-Fattah added that Nazif did not take advantage of the opportunity given to him by President Mubarak to select ministers, from whom President Mubarak excluded ministers of defence, the interior and foreign affairs. However, we found that the prime minister did not seize that opportunity but rather kept 20 ministers from the old guard who became the core of the new cabinet. This means that the old government has been simply cloned.
There will not be a real change unless the constitutional power of the President was limited.
Observers consider the proposed changes as a prelude to a new parliament dominated by a majority of businessmen. Well-known sources said that the expected changes include allowing the foundation of new parties and shareholder companies for press and publication.
The oldest minister was former minister of justice Farouk Seif Al-Nasr.
The third person is Dr. Youssef Botros Ghali, Minister of Finance, who had his first portfolio on 22nd April 1993.
He started his career as a minister by being a minister of state.
Following Ghali, three ministers, namely Kamal El-Shazli, Mamdouh El-Beltagui and Ahmed Al-Amawi, have the same terms in office, hence the fourth rank among the newly appointed government. They joined the cabinet for the first time in Dr. Atef Siddki's third and last government on 14th October 1993. This means that they joined the government six months following Ghali's accession.
The newly appointed government seems balanced with respect to age compared to the previous one.
Eventually, Dr. Nazif should necessarily succeed in leading this team that comprises experience and wisdom of the old on one hand and the vitality and broad-mindedness of the youth on the other hand. We hope that that team would perform a clean game in which they would score goals against unemployment and economic recession as well as other problems that hinder Egypt's advancement.

ISRAELI PLANS TO FACE SITUATION IN PALESTINIAN AREAS IF ARAFAT DIED
The first programme has to do with the possibility that he might be killed in an Israeli military operation; the second deals with the possibility that he might have death from natural causes; and the third deals with the possibility that he might die from a disease.
The Palestinian National Authority will collapse, accordingly. The Israeli experts have laid down a blueprint to face such developments from now without waiting until he dies.
* Coordinating and having an open dialogue about the subject with some Arab countries such as Egypt and Jordan.
ARABS AND MINEFIELD OF COOPERATION WITH NATO
Such decisions refer to a harmony among the major powers that control the world and makes the NATO responsible for or, to put it right, commissioned to lead political and security changes in the target countries. This has been enhanced by the fact that the NATO's role at present is both unprecedented and unmatched by any other force on the political arena..
Since 1998 the NATO has become a military and political organization of humanitarian roles. Its geographic scope extended as far as the eastern borders of Russia and its members increased to 26 members extending from the west Atlantic to the far east of the European continent and to the south of the Mediterranean. This means that the theatre of its operations has become very large in terms of geography.
According to Istanbul initiative for cooperation, the far aim of NATO's dialogue with the Arab countries is to reach a real cooperation. According to contemporary international cooperation, the concept of cooperation means more than exchanging views on a defensive, military or political issue. It, to a great extent means institutional intertwinement and harmony as far as politics and stances are concerned and defining tasks and roles to be played by each side. This means that the required cooperation in the medium run provides that NATO should be one of the elements that form the policies of the countries, with whom dialogue took place firstly and then accepted the principle of cooperation, whether under the umbrella of anti-terror war or achieving a political reform.
Of course, there is a possibility that a certain party might arouse the issue of Israel and whether it will accept such a regional security system, which is supposed to be built on the Arab region level.
In an unprecedented step, the US International Republic Institute (IRI), completed yesterday (23rd July) a training course for social and political female activists from Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco. This training course aims to train those activists in occupying leading posts in running elections.

EGYPT BORROWS LE9 MILLION EVERY HOUR
A broad controversy accompanied with a state of anticipation prevailed in economic milieus after a ruling issued by the Supreme Constitutional Court rendering unconstitutional the service charges collected in customs outlets as per the two finance ministerial decrees no. 255 of 1993 and 123 of 1994 and the two amended decrees no. 1208 of 1996 and 752 of 1997. All these decrees were issued in light of the article 111 in the customs law no. 66 of 1966 on applying the ruling retrospectively to future lawsuits or the lawsuits currently presented to all kinds of courts. When the government announced cancellation of such charges on 7 September last, it announced through ministers of finance, investment, industry and trade that that was a positive step towards cutting customs duties with a view to improving the investment climate, thus activating national economy.
In order to make up for the deficit in proceeds resulting from that reduction, the finance minister issued - without legal credit - the decree no. 255 of 1993 on imposing service charges at a rate of 1% on the type and classification of commodities. When the results of the decree reflected positively on the proceeds, the finance minister issued the decree no. 123 of 1994 on imposing additional charges on the same services at a rate of 2% of the value of the consignments subjected to a tax category of over 30%. This, consequently, led some people concerned to resort to judiciary in order to ask for restoring what they paid without right. Indeed, hundreds of rulings were issued ordering restoration of all the paid service charges. 10 years later, the ruling of the Supreme Constitutional Court came to cancel article 111 of the customs law and drops the ministerial decrees on imposing service charges on imports at customs outlets.

Hamas and Islamic Jihad, under Ramadan Abdullah Shallah, maintained "positive neutralism" policy towards Arafat as he is against settlement.
Other Palestinian sources told Al-Hayat that Hamas and the Islamic Jihad preferred Chairman Arafat to any other Palestinian official because he is a "symbol" of struggle for the Palestinian people, an advantage not enjoyed by anybody before except for Hamas founder late Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. The symbolism of Arafat on the Palestinian, Arab and international levels as the PNA Chairman, Fatah Movement head and the elected president of the would-be Palestinian statehood enabled him to lead the Palestinian people, they said.
However, according to Palestinian traditions, no one can intervene in Fatah internal conflict, they said, stressing that Arafat, as usual, has so far got victorious of that crisis.
In this discussion, it was said that there was a tangible danger that Iran might be able to possess and develop nuclear arms within 3 years' time unless its unclear capabilities were destroyed.
In all cases, Iran makes Israel a basic target for its hostility, which is all, too, evident in its political propaganda, its leaders' statements and internal and political discourses and infusing the Iranians with animosity against Israel.
It is not unlikely, however, that they would sway some regimes in the region and, thus, have sophisticated weaponry like F-15 fighters and Apachi helicopters as well as unconventional weapons.
The Israeli military build their future strategy on Iraq's entirely quitting the front with Israel after the collapse of Saddam Hussein's regime and the Western absolute control over the military, political and economic destiny of that country.
It is also a passage for arms against Israel whether from Lebanon, Jordan, or PNA territories.

Each Arab child is born burdened with a huge legacy of debts. The debt share of a newborn babe may reach millions whether those debts were domestic or external. He may grow up with his debts growing too.

These statements coincided with news reports to the effect that an American investigation committee had discovered a relation between Iran and the September 11th attacks in New York and Washington.
"Those members preferred to topple the Iranian regime even before the Iraqi regime," the sources said.
In this context, we can understand the reasons for toppling the two regimes in Kabul and Baghdad.
It can safely be said, therefore, that America "needed" both Saddam and Bin Laden and would perhaps have invented other pretexts if the two men had not done.
Here lies the secret of Washington's willingness to invest hundreds of billions of dollars to launch wars to abort any attempt to control the backbone of American economy regardless of the party that ventures on the attempt.

EGYPT IS A COUNTRY WHICH IS BEING USURPED
The ruling party has no right to use the executive estate or manipulate it as an experiment laboratory because the executive estate is not a partisan power nor is the government formed on partisan grounds, but rather on national ones, otherwise Al-Wafd, Tagamo'h and the Nasserite parties would have the right to hold official meetings with the government and refer proposals to it for implementation.
Today the party is required to nationalize politics at the level of the elite and the upper decision.

He had issued decree 2128 dated 28/6/2004 allowing the setting up of piscine farms on 6% of the fishing area in the lake on behalf of investors and businessmen. This would endanger the lives of the Egyptian people and all the utilities that rely on the Nile water. Lake Nasser is regarded as Egypt's national water bank.

She added that this led to the deterioration of freedoms in general.

There is not intention to import seeds from Israel or to deal with it in seed production or any agricultural field, Leithi said.
We, not the Americans or the Zionists, involve ourselves in such troubles and they exploit our regimes' panic over their future and our lost regional role.
Out of their panic, all our regimes are making concessions to the dragon in order to retain their posts, whether through giving occupation forces access to their countries or showing readiness to play a marginal role on the chessboard under the illusion that they are still efficient and capable enough to move and influence while they realize well that they are no longer part of the equation and that there are other forces controlling all the strategic positions in the game.
Neither did our regime draw upon this experiment nor did we learn the lesson.
It will be rather honourable for us, people and rulers alike, not to be part of the equation.

AMERICAN PLAN TO RUIN EGYPTIAN COTTON
According to an official source with the Ministry of Agriculture, cotton is facing a serious turning point this season due to its price retreat and the price hikes of rival crops like rice. The source said that the cotton-cultivated area had witnessed a slight rise this season due to the price rise of the crop in the last season. The area increased from 450 thousand feddans to 532 thousand feddans. The source warned that the Agriculture bodies would not be able to persuade farmers to grow cotton in the next years due to loss of confidence and the fluctuation of the feddan revenue from one year to another.
The sources pointed out that America had estimated the subsidy minimum this year according to the Russian rather than the Egyptian cotton price, unlike what used to happen in the previous seasons, which brought about a rise in the allocated subsidy sums.

The United States, contrary to its previous wars, moves in Darfur backed by an extremist Europe represented in Britain, France, Germany and almost the entire of Europe in addition to the UN Secretary General. They see that a resolution by the UN Security Council on imposing sanctions on the Sudanese government was too late. As usual, Tony Blair declared hastily that Britain does not rule out a military intervention in Sudan, which was also confirmed by US Department of State spokesman Richard Boucher. Thus, the US Administration and Europe agreed to implement a swift scheme for partitioning and "Somalizing" Sudan now that they managed to turn the conflict over resources to an ethnic conflict between Arabs and Africans.
3. Forcing the Sudanese government, after putting it under the sword of sanctions, to accept the conditions of the Sudan's People Liberation Army (SPLA) in the final round of negotiations. Moreover, forcing it to accept the conditions of the northern opposition which is expected to start a round of negotiations with the Sudanese government next week in Cairo. The US and Europe seek to dismantle the Sudanese regime from inside through the participation of the SPLA and northern opposition with 28% of power each. This means that the current government will be turned into a minority over the coming six years which follow the signature of the final agreement.
As for the strategic part, it is to turn Sudan (the continent country) into a group of states like the Gulf states so that each state would seek American protection against the other, which guarantees full control for the Americans on those resources which are enough to feed one-third of world population. It seems that the US Administration tries now to implement the plan set by the US Department of State in the early eighties. This plan provides for reshaping Sudan and Africa in general and establishing states on a pure ethnic basis under the claim that ethnic conflicts are the reason behind instability and backwardness of Africa. In addition to land, water and other natural resources, there are three strategic goods the US seeks to control in Sudan.
The Egyptian Administration seems no longer concerned with politics, as it doesn't care about the concept of conspiracy. Egypt did not stand strongly in the face of the American wild monster nor did it interfere strongly to end the crisis. Does Cairo wait until the Americans establish military bases along the border of Lake Nasser and the High Dam?
Hamas won't remain onlooker".
HAMAS MEDIATES BETWEEN FATAH, PNA
He declined to identify Fatah officials or the PNA who met with the leaderships of the movement.
Reform should be in line with a Palestinian vision and away from any foreign intervention. "The current time does not serve our people in light of the pressure practiced by Israel on it," he said.
Closure, impeding daily life affairs, starvation, intimidation, assassinations, incursions, regular destruction of homes, bulldozing and confiscating lands to build the separating wall, dishonouring the Palestinians at checkpoints, paralyzing the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and security bodies, arresting thousands, and besieging the elected president would definitely lead the Palestinians only to frustration, which has already started unsurprisingly without asking where or how?
This plan is also a misleading title abounding in "virtues" seen by the Americans and the Europeans as Israeli concession or even a coup by Sharon on himself.
He rejected Oslo agreements and continued rejecting them till he rendered them ineffective. All that he found difficult to get rid of, America's war on terror facilitated it. He even managed to mix the whole Palestinian cause with such a war, which Washington allowed him to exploit to a great extent.
The problem lies elsewhere: Sharon says it lies in the PNA, which should be reformed.

The issue of compensation for Jewish properties is still put forward, but it should not be used politically, as these properties are individual rights. Anyway, the Libyan state nationalized these properties and we consider it a debt on the state. But the right to return is another issue and Libya should make use of its sons abroad.

Minister of Finance Dr. Youssef Botros Ghali said the new budget would take into consideration economic variables on both internal and international levels. The social dimension would be given priority during the preparation of the budget so as to support low-income brackets, as the state would undertake to provide the citizen with commodities and services at prices that suit their incomes. The state would also bear international price differentials. Subsidy on commodities would be increased this year to exceed 12 billion pounds if international price rises continued.
The government continued its endeavours for diversifying the sources of covering the public budget deficit by issuing the second category of government bonds which started 4 weeks ago. Thus, the sovereign bonds got by the government so far totaled 6 billion pounds divided into two issuances, the value of each is 3 billion pounds. Meanwhile, the government issuances for financing the budget deficit were concentrated on the bonds that were of short-term maturity.
However, the fate of bonds indicates that the ascending curve of interest rate on markets will continue, which raises fear that the state of recession will continue due to the increase in the cost of lending operations necessary for financing economic activity.

The new government under Premier Ahmed Nazif is expected to promote ladies to higher positions at banks, a policy that was first initiated by former prime minister Atef Ebeid due to their efficiency, especially as some of them are members of the National Council for Women (NCW). This will also be in compliance with political directives to give women more chances, especially as some prominent female cadres in the banks belong to the American modern school who worked for Citibank and Chase Manhattan.
At the level of private and investment banks, there are prominent ladies occupying leading positions because they had worked abroad. They include managing director of the Commercial International Bank (CIB-Egypt) Sahar El-Sallab, and general director of Misr International Bank Bassent Fahmi who is also in charge of stock exchanges' affairs.
"Choosing women depends on their banking experience rather anything else," said Delta International Bank's president and former governor of the Central Bank of Egypt, Ali Negm. However, he lauded their efficiency, which could be enhanced practically by training courses.
The same opinion was uttered by vice-president of Banque Du Caire Mona Yassin. She added that Egyptian female bankers were interested in work rather than participating in forums, parties or symposia.
However, Yassin ruled out the possibility that any private or public bank might be headed by a lady belonging to the CitiBank due to their limited numbers.

In a message to the People's Assembly, which opposed the QIZ for including economic cooperation with Israel, the minister said he was ready not to put this agreement in place unless all conditions and guarantees that assure Egypt that it would be beneficial to its industry and exports were met.

It is expected that Bahgat will sign a similar agreement with Chairman of Banque Misr Mohamed Barakat to settle the debts of that bank due on Bahgat Group whose value amounted to over 400 million pounds. However, that agreement has not been signed yet as board of directors of Banque Misr is reviewing the items of the settlement agreement.
* Bahgat shall pay basic debts and their interest, which were estimated at about 2.5 billion pounds, which means that banks will not drop any part of the interest of those debts contrary to previous reports.
Three key state-owned banks in Egypt and Bahgat Group have recently reached an agreement on settling the largest debt of 2.2 billion pounds (around 400 million US dollars) owed by the latter to the former. The deal was inked by Hussein Abdel-Aziz, chairman of the National Bank of Egypt, Mohamed Barakat, chairman of Banque Misr, and Mahmoud Abdel-Latif, president of the Bank of Alexandria, on the one hand, and Ahmed Bahgat, president of the Bahgat Group, on the other hand. For his part, Minister of Foreign Trade Rashid Mohamed Rashid told London-based Al-Hayat newspaper that the agreement was a "new chapter in the relationship between the government and businessmen who play a weighty role in economic development of the country." He added, "What is happening in the banking sector leads to drawing more foreign investments urgently needed by the country for the coming period."
3.3 MILLION TONS WHEAT IMPORTS IN 7 MONTHS
Farmers had supplied the ministry warehouses with 250,000 tons of maize since the beginning of the seasons versus 45,000 tons only in the same period last year, which means that the optional supply had increased by fivefold this season due to the good coordination with Agriculture Ministry and attracting farmers through raising the purchasing price.

The structure of Egypt's imports has been changed over the last and current years in favour of European Union countries, Britain, China and South Korea. All these countries witnessed an increase in their currencies against the dollar, notably the euro and the pound sterling. This, accordingly, affected and still affects the value of the final bill of Egypt's imports, especially from EU countries, which seize around 33% of Egypt's imports and 28% of its exports.
According to assistant manager of the United Bank of Egypt Tarek Al-Defrawi, the dollar is still the favourite deposit currency for most of clients regardless of its decline, particularly as former experiments proved that the markup of the euro and the pound sterling against the dollar on international markets is temporary, as this markup is not in the interest of the European side.
Al-Abyad monitored a retreat in companies' dealings in the euro due to individuals' reluctance to sell it hoping it will go on increasing to exceed 8 pounds. In the meantime, companies have surplus in their dealings in the dollar and the riyal due to the stability of exchange market and elimination of speculations and unofficial market, in addition to the increase of the state's foreign exchange resources in the backdrop of revival of tourism, increase of Suez Canal tolls, and increase of exports.

JANJAWEED LEADER UNCOVERS MOTIVES AND SECRETS OF WAR IN DARFUR
His name, consequently, reached the UN Security Council and the American Administration.
A: We are Arab travelling herdsmen. We are also known historically as Sudanese people.
A: For long years, some members of Ghor and Zaghawa tribes have carried out armed robberies regularly for strategic and prospective goals rather than random robberies like that of thieves and highwaymen.
Q: This means that the goal was not robbery itself, wasn't it?
We made sure that they constantly target Arab grasslands and houses. Although there are pastoral non-Arab tribes, they never fought or looted them.
A: Rarely, but the African tribes exploited such skirmishes and turned them into a war against the Arabs.
Q: Have you made sure of the identity of those who did this?
Q: Frankly, are you Janjaweed?
They don't belong to a certain tribe or ethnicity.
If they are the rebels of Darfur who fight the government and intimidate the innocent people, I say such accusations are tendentious and they have their own goals behind their rebellion against the state. We, therefore, sided with the homeland because our perspective is contrary to the sabotage they have done. We squared up to their sabotage, so we were accused of such a groundless charge.
A: I didn't give a hoot out of my belief that they are mere rumours and misinformation.
Q: Haven't you summoned by the government or any other body?
Q: Did you meet him alone?
A: No.
A: I reiterate I don't concern.
Q: Back to the current scene in Darfur, did the Sudanese government arm your tribe or any other tribes?
Q: Are there any foreign fighters among the rebels you are fighting?
In dealing with that situation, the Khartoum government underlined certain routes for pastoral tribes so that they don't force their way through farmers' lands to put their cattle out to pasture. When drought hit the region, pastoral tribes began to move southward to agricultural areas, thus clashing with farmers. Local councils and leaders used to resolve these disputes since the colonial era.
The ambassador went to say, "Now, the international community is about to threaten military intervention to end Darfur issue as was the case during the run-up to the invasion of Iraq. The USA, moreover, presented a draft bill to the UN Security Council (UNSC) on Sudan. However, Arab countries convened an Arab League Council meeting to discuss the issue before referral to the UNSC for the following considerations:
Asked by Al-Ahram about the possibility of foreign countries dispatching troops to Sudan, the ambassador said the Sudanese government is opposed to any foreign troops dispatches and would deal with foreign troops as occupation forces. SITUATION IN DARFUR SIMILAR TO PRE-WAR IRAQ

According to all Iraqi citizens, Iraq has never witnessed any discrimination against Christians in the past.
A long time ago, however, the Arab region especially Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine and Syria, has witnessed a Christian exodus that is ascribed, in the first place, to material reasons and the search for job opportunities abroad.
In Iraq, Christians started in the recent years to have misgivings about the political conflict in the country even though their majority never constituted a political party but co-existed with other religions.
IRAQ: ASSAULT ON CHURCHES AGGRAVATES CHRISTIANS CONCERN
On the other hand, the Iraqi government blamed the attacks on Al-Qaeda leader in Iraq, Abou-Musaab Al-Zarqawi.
Junadem Kuna, member of the National Congress and member of the dissolved council, denied reports that groups of American and Western missionaries came to Iraq following the fall of the former regime, thus inciting such a targeting of churches in Baghdad and Mosul.
In Cairo, Muslim Brotherhood Group in Egypt denounced the bloody assaults and accused the Mossad of committing them.
Muqtada Al-Sadr denounced the attacks targeting Christians calling them attacks against all Iraqis because the Christians are, in the first place, Iraqis. He added that perpetrators do not discriminate between a Muslim and a Christian with a view to embarrassing and complicating the current situation.
In Beirut, former Lebanese premier, Selim Al-Hos said, "The Iraqi scene is haunted by daily tragedies as innocents are abducted and threatened to have their heads cut off for no reason.
84% OF IRAQI UNIVERSITIES WERE DESTROYED
A: There are 20 official universities nationwide: a university in every province except for Assamawa and Al-Emara, where there are some colleges and technical institutes.
A: We expect 80,000 students. there are now 357,000 university students, 35% of them are in technical institutes.
A: Yes, I'm talking about those living in Iraq. Moreover, there is a big number of non-appointed professors due to the dearth of allocations, let alone the professors who fled Iraq due to harsh economic conditions.
Q: How could you overcome this trouble?
A: This is a big problem. We cannot decide who is behind these assassinations which involved Baathist and non-Baasthist professors of different specialties and no political affiliations.
Some advocates of that idea argue that the coalition forces to quit Iraq and if we want to establish security and stability there, we must replace such forces by other (Arab and Islamic) ones. Little do such advocates remember that Washington is still confirming that such Arab and Islamic forces, if they reach Iraq, will be complementary rather than an alternative to the coalition forces!
Now the same scenario is back again.
Secondly, sending such forces represents, in one way or another, confrontation with Iraqi resistance groups the gains of which will only be gathered as both know and expect by occupation forces.
LAHD MILITIA EAT FROM 'GARBAGE BIN'
By such demonstration, Abu-Zohr and scores of Lebanese militia members, who served the Israeli army under the chairmanship of General Antoine Lahd, try to arouse their cause anew.
It is worth mentioning that Israel slighted its agents of Lahd militants since it has no need for their services following its withdrawal from Lebanon in May 2002.
Some of them have jobs while the majority are jobless.
The sources added that such a statement which called upon the Libyan leader to boycott Iran, is from an unknown source. Thus it does not even deserve comments.
A LIBYAN ADMITS TO BEING INVOLVED IN LIBYAN PLOT TO ASSASSINATE SAUDI CROWN PRINCE
In a press conference following Al-Amoudi's confession in the court, Cohen also conveyed Al-Amoudi's apology to the Muslim community in America and all over the Islamic world and to the American people, expressing his sorrow for the consequences of his confession, which may undermine the Muslims' rights in America and consolidate the accusations Muslims are usually accused of.
The penalties of the three charges amount to 23 years in prison.

While head of Democratic National Action Society, Abdel-Rahman Al-Na'imi regarded the proposal as a prelude to the establishment of a Taliban's kingdom in Bahrain, fundamentalist leading figure, Sheikh Aad Al-Miawda said that it is in secularism that danger lies.
On the other hand, head of Democratic National Action Society, Abdel-Rahman Al-Na'imi expected that such an authority would trigger political and security problems.

On the other hand, the Egyptian National Council for Human Rights and MPs launched severe criticism at the report of the American Congress Committee on Religious Freedoms which has visited Egypt recently.
Aboul Majd uncovered that the council had informed the committee on religious freedoms that the issue of religions in Egypt was an internal issue and above any foreign intervention.
Under this headline Abdullah Iskandar of Al-Hayat wrote this article which ran to the following effect: With the Algerian presidency confirming the resignation of Chief of Staff General Mohamed Al-Amari, a new stage in contemporary Algerian history is perhaps in the offing.
Al-Amari is one of the first generation of Algerian officers, who, in spite of their secession from the Liberation Front command (the only ruling party) during the era of Al-Shazli and in spite of the establishment of partisan plurality, considered themselves responsible for watching over the state, its policy and its leadership.
This means that the President pointed out that he will not yield to officers' orders, and the officers revealed that they would intervene when the republic was at risk.
The situation remained the same, in wait for the presidential elections, which would decisively determine the winner.
The main orientations focus on an exclusion policy that was worked out by President Bouteflika who ruled the former chief of staff out of the celebrations of promoting key officers. Al-Amari kept himself away (or was ruled out in favor of Interior Minister and Bouteflika's close friend veteran security officer Yazid Zarhoni) from the red-carpet reception of French defense minister that came to Algeria on the first visit of its kind since Algeria's independence to establish military cooperation, which the former chief of staff preferred to be with the US rather than France.
It is to be mentioned that the tension that has remained since the eruption of Western Desert crisis in 1975, was always attributed to the Algerian military establishment that used Maghreb threat as a pretext to justify its acts.
Asharq Al-Awsat daily has previously highlighted the presence of such forces in this historic place which is of an international importance. The former US Administrator in Iraq Paul Bremer had recommended the US forces withdrawal from Babylon before the end of his task in Iraq on 28 June 2004 but his words have gone with the wind because such an issue was up to the military leadership, Al-Gazaeri said On Thursday (4th August) in a phone conversation with Asharq Al-Awsat, Al-Gazaeri said, "We are worried about the construction works in Babylon whether regarding buildings, digging or changing the features of the city".
SYRIA IS A SAFE HEAVEN TO IRAQI CHRISTIANS
Although the Iraqi Christians represent 5 percent of total population, about 20 percent of the applications submitted to the commission were made by Christians.
However, representative of the Assyrian Democratic Movement in Damascus Amanwil Khoshaba pointed out four reasons for Iraqi emigration: absence of security, terrorist attacks, the impeded democratic process, and lack of services.
SYRIA OPENS ITS MARKETS TO FIZZY DRINKS OF ARAB FREE TRADE ZONE STATES
Economic experts described the new decision as "a step on the right path" after the former laws helped traders to monopolize Syrian markets with low-standard goods for long years.
An expert voiced surprise at Syrian authorities' decision to import woolen carpets from Arab countries while Syrian private sector is still forbidden from setting up factories for producing it.
President George W. Bush has no interest in his re-election year to enter into confrontation with Iran at a time he is trying to disperse the concerns of voters, who would like to bring him to book for going to war with Iraq on "defective and unreliable" intelligence.
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon could probably capitalize on the US election campaign to launch a military attack on the Iranian nuclear program, capitalizing on Western and Middle East countries concerns.
The second is to urge Lebanese Hizbullah to open wide a new front with Israel. However, the second alternative would be a bit difficult due to power imbalance between Hizbullah and Israel and because that could expand the conflict to engulf Syria as well.
Meanwhile, a Fatah delegation is expected to leave for Cairo soon to consider post-pullout stage in the sector and the inter-Palestinian dialogue.
The Palestinian Jerusalem paper quoted Hamas leader in the strip Mahmoud el-Zahar as saying that the movement would take part in the forthcoming Palestinian legislative and local elections provided that they should be carried out in a fair atmosphere.
Fatah member Ahmed Ghonem told Al-Hayat that Meshaal recently announced his group's willingness to take part in politics, and that announcement was then warmly welcomed by the Palestinian mainstream Fatah movement, which asked Hamas leaders questions about the nature of this participation, including whether it will be in the PNA or the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). But, their replies were incomplete."
These plans aims at decreasing the number of daily confrontations and the pressure exercised by the international community on Israel, he added, pointing out that the American stance that represents "a deterrent balance may not continue" in addition to the fact that Washington supports Israel's withdrawal to 1967 borders.
He warned against the Iranian threat, directing a strongly worded warning to Tehran as far as the two issues of "nuclear armament" and "supporting terrorism" are concerned. There is an agency that feeds terrorism. Its roots are in Iran and it passes through Damascus and Beirut. This agency should be politically and militarily dealt with.

The Israeli milieus voiced worry that the new developments may impact on the weapons deals signed between the two countries and consequently, the political relations.
Israel had to complete the deal to be able to keep another more important one which includes selling Israeli weapons to Turkey and upgrading Turkish aircrafts and tanks at a value of two billion dollars.
They suggested that this may be the reason for the Turkish negative attitude towards Israel.

Shukr pointed out that the forum would rally every three months.
For his part, Egyptian veteran communist, Ibrahim Badrawi condemned such an idea adding that it was meaningless. He wondered how the left could unite or how we could hold a dialogue between Egyptian leftists whose trend is so wide and including democratic socialist left and the Communist left with its various tributaries.
Finally, an official with the Ministry of Agriculture admitted that there is American pressure to bar Egypt from cultivating long-staple cotton, the brand Egypt is famous for world wide.

Egyptian Former Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher described the United States as an "influential international force", saying that it has not done enough to understand the Arab world.
Confrontation with the United States is not inevitable because the Arabs are ready to reach an understanding with it, he added. "Strangely enough, the Arabs like the United States by nature. Moreover, they adore the American lifestyle. Nevertheless, US intervention in other countries' affairs sowed the seeds of hostility between peoples," he noted.
Asharq Al-Awsat learnt from Egyptian and American sources that a delegation from the American embassy had held a series of meetings to force an Egyptian journalist to publicly and officially apologize for an article published in the Al-Lewa' Al-Islami paper casting doubt on the credibility of the Nazi Holocaust against the Jews.

EGYPTIAN MILITARY EXPERTS ENTER GAZA IF ISRAEL FULLY PULLED OUT
However, such demands were rejected by the Egyptians.
- Israel shall agree that 300-400 Egyptian border guards be deployed along the Egyptian-Palestinian-Israeli borders to combat arms smuggling.
- In case the Egyptians entered Gaza, there should be full ceasefire by the two parties (both Israel and Palestinian armed factions should vow to Egypt not to abide by the ceasefire actions).
A conference, including representatives of the Quartet (the UN, the EU, Russia and the USA) is expected to be held in the United States in order to sign such an agreement.
Observers see that Sharon should expedite forming his new government ahead of the conference date so that he could pass his plan, as it lacks the required majority.
On Saturday, the Israeli television uncovered that Egypt and Israel reached a security agreement preparing for a basic role by Cairo in putting the disengagement plan into effect.
The Israeli intelligence alleges that arms are smuggled to Palestinian resistance factions in the West Bank from Egypt via members of Israeli underworld, who exploit their service in the Israeli army in smuggling arms from Egypt to the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Israeli Minister of Defence, Shaul Mofaz approved the construction of about 300 new housing units in Ariel Settlement only one week after the Israeli government had approved building housing units in "Maali Adommim".
Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Mahmoud Abu Zeid uncovered ploys by some western countries to arouse the issue of establishing dams and barrages in some Nile basin countries, and cause disputes among them.

The agreement endorsed by the parliaments of both countries provides that Egyptian and Sudanese citizens would be allowed to reside, own real estate, and practise all legal activities in the other country.
Mandour said he had obtained formal verbal permission from Egyptian officials to negotiate Abdel-Rahman's home return.
Clark and Mandour's move towards Abdel Rahman, 67, accords with the Egyptian security bodies' orientations towards Islamic groups detainees. The Egyptian government set free detainees of these groups after they apologized for their crimes. However, a fundamentalist source close to the group stressed the group has nothing to do with Abdel Rahman.
Such an attitude on the part of the opposition reflects an outright rejection of any attempt to select some oppositionists, according to statements made by NDP Secretary General Safwat Al-Sherif, who emphasized that only some of them would be represented.
Premier Ahmed Nazif's government will submit the new bill in the first fortnight of the parliamentary session so that the bill may be issued by December and start to be put into effect immediately.
There has been strong evidence that the reform decisions due to be announced by President Hosni Mubarak at the ruling National Democratic Party's general Congress next month will not include a change in the way the President of the Republic is chosen which is based on a plebiscite about just one candidate.
The nature of such decisions, however, has not been specified by the party sources.
It is noteworthy that Al-Fiqi and Olwi are members of the ruling party's Policies Secretariat headed by Gamal Mubarak, which establishes the argument that the Secretariat has become the springboard for key positions in the State."
The dossiers will mainly include reports by the ministries of justice, the interior, administrative development, manpower, transport, industry and foreign trade, investment, supply, agriculture, health and social affairs on the implementation of recommendations and policies approved by the NDP congress in September 2003.
Recent statements by Shura Council Speaker and ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) Safwat el-Sharif on revamping the Committee on Political Parties' Affairs (CPPA), saying that public figures and members from political parties would gain access to the CPPA, were labeled by political parties' leaders as a move to circumvent reform calls. Justifying their description, political parties' leaders said the planned move by the NDP would be useless as long as the CPPA, which decides on okaying or turning down new political parties, and the law on political parties maintained their restrictions on party life in Egypt.
The real problem lies in the fact that in its dialogue with other political parties, the NDP failed to touch upon the methods and orientations of reforms, neither did it take any concrete steps in this respect.
Egypt 2000 Party leader Fawzi Ghazal said party leaders in such committees and councils are appointed by the president of the republic so the CPPA, in its current status, is a "governmental" committee belonging to the ruling regime, rather than an agency that can serve political parties or democracy in Egypt.
It is necessary to unleash the freedom of forming parties through only "notification" or at most an "independent" watchdog, he said.
Egyptian opposition parties' efforts to formulate a joint programme on political reform have been exposed to a setback following a crisis that erupted between the Al-Wafd and the Nasserite parties due to news reports about a meeting between US Secretary of State Colin Powell and Egyptian intellectuals including two leading figures from Al-Wafd.
It was learnt that Al-Wafd leadership refrain from signing a joint document on political reform with the Nasserite Party.

Oliver Nette said that Egypt could obtain three important advantages from the European neighbourhood policy. Egypt's goods and services could get access to the unified European markets, it could have bigger relations with the European Union in all spheres as border barriers would be broken between them, not to mention the quiet achievement of integration with internal European market.

CRITICISMS AGAINST ABSENCE OF EGYPTIAN BANKS FROM AFRICAN MARKETS
Development of inter-trade with Arab and European countries pushed those banks to open branches there and contract with those countries' envoys to provide banking services to Egyptian importers and exporters.
Omran ascribed the retreat of the Egyptian presence in the African markets in general and the Egyptian banks' failure to invest there in particular to the lack of basic information on such markets or the commodities needed there and the weakness of banking bodies in African countries as well as the absence of coordination among Egyptian foreign trade companies in the continent or unavailability of sales outlets and permanent exhibitions for Egyptian commodities.
He pointed out programmes financing trade movement among countries through the World Bank and international institutions about which the Egyptian private sector does not know much. He stressed that the main role in that field is assumed by the Egyptian banking system.
Ambassador Gamal Bayoumi, secretary general of Arab Investors Federation blasted the absence of banking programmes for ensuring exports to Africa. He pointed out that the capital of the Egyptian Bank for Guaranteeing Exports, as the only bank that finances exports, does not exceed .01% of Egyptian exports to Africa and .001% of Egyptian imports from Africa. He called for raising the banks' capital to two billion dollars.
On the other hand, president of the Egyptian Commercial Bank Mohamed Abdel-Wahab rejected reports about political motives behind the establishment of the joint Egyptian-Sudanese Bank, stressing that it is aimed, in the first place, at increasing the 40-million-dollar trade movement between the two countries.
He also ruled out setting up a unified central bank among African countries due to the absence of unified monetary policy of those countries in addition to legislation differences between them.
According to information obtained by Al-Alam Al-Youm from responsible banking sources, there were two options for privatization in the last few months as either Banque du Caire or the Bank of Alexandria the scale tipped in favour of the Bank of Alexandria for several reasons especially as it is the smallest among public banks.

They pointed out that the nitrogenous fertilizers price on the international markets is 250 dollars per ton so the production cost is not less than 1750 pounds while producing companies sell them to farmers at prices range of 480 and 580 pounds a ton, so the companies subsidize farmers with about 1200 pounds per ton. The total subsidy of fertilizers is estimated at 2.5 billion pounds, which constitute lost profits for this industry. Abu Qir Nitrogenous Fertilizers Company bears 1.5 billion pounds of such a sum as it is the biggest fertilizer producer in addition to the Delta Company.
On the other hand, official sources inside fertilizers producing companies pointed out that the current imposed prices prevent them from achieving profits and discourage the government from making new investments to create new job openings. The volume of losses is evident when we know that the new investments for establishing a fertilizers plant are not less than 3 billion pounds, thus discouraging the existent companies from making technological development or establishing new production units inside the company.
Another team including experts and officials of the Agriculture Minister pointed out that demand for Egyptian cotton had not declined, adding that all the production of the current year and the surplus of last year was sold out and that importation of cotton would lead to neglecting the local production of cotton.

Such losses amount to ten times as much according to the numerous notes submitted by farmers in those governorates. If the FAO estimates on the Internet are then added, the figure turns into a real disaster for which the Ministry of Agriculture is fully responsible as it failed to confront the invasion of locust swarms that started to attack Egyptian borders on October 28th. It is certain that such invasion had already been expected by the ministry's bodies and it is equally certain that the minister of agriculture had been personally warned about that invasion while he was either holiday-making during the feast or perhaps performing an Ummrah (minor pilgrimage) in Ramadan but he little cared about the reports from Mauritania, Morocco about the locust invasion or the losses incurred by Tunisia and Libya.
LOCUSTS DAMAGE 38 PERCENT OF CROPS
It blasted the way the government dealt with the problem, especially official comments on the change of wind directions, noting that the government's relevant excuse is unscientific and illogical.

The company, affiliated to the National Construction Company, is locked in several problems impeding its efforts for expansion at the Arab real estate market, especially financing, letters of guaranty, insurance cost, non-implementation of pan-Arab anti-double taxation deals and its failure to collect its dues.
The Egyptian government has been trying for months to lay down new rules, to be issued soon, for banks to give an opportunity to privatize part of public fund contributions in those banks through increasing capital through public subscription by local citizens. This will enhance the financial positions of banks on the one hand and allow private capital to contribute to banks' funds within limits that have not been defined yet but reported to range between 10-25 percent.
This came in a report prepared by head of the Commercial Representation Office Al-Sharqawy Hefni on the Office efforts during 2004 in the fields of promoting investment in Egypt, increasing exports and promoting Egyptian products in foreign markets as well as settling exporters' commercial disputes.

Chairman of the banking division in the chamber of commerce Mohamed Al-Abiadh denied reports on Dec. 29 about thirty companies approval to raise their capital to ten million pounds. All companies, 100 in number, would go to the constitutional court to solve their problems with the government, as the latter called on each company to raise its capital to ten million pounds, while companies agreed on one million pounds only, he said. There is a period of grace till Jan.10, 2005 for every company to adjust its positions, otherwise it would be finally struck off.
In front pf the People's Assembly where it has the majority, the government was searching for even the least cogent pretexts for its misdeed!
The Egyptian people has already learnt how to interpret any government talk! If the government said left it must be right!
It incites the Congress and the American Administration against us. It does the same vicious act in the Nile Basin countries and tampers with Sudanese affairs by destabilizing the situation in Darfour. It kills the Palestinians as well as Egyptian security men. Is that all unrelated to our national security?
TAGAMO'H PARTY IS FOR DIALOGUE BUT AGAINST THEOCRACY!
Mohamed Habib, Dr. Mohamed Morsi and Seif Al-Islam Hassan Al-Banna and Mohamed Abdel-Qudous.
- Any dialogue held by the Party representatives must abide by the party's principles and documents.
Our party's fourth congress literally emphasized the impossibility of any bargaining compromises or capitulations in the ideological conflict facing the forces and trends of political Islam. A theocracy and religious parties are, therefore, categorically, rejected by the party.
Al-Tagamo'h Party delegation emphasized that all parties to such coordination activities should be committed to the techniques, mechanisms, issues or slogans agreed upon as some members of Muslim Brotherhood sometimes violated such agreements in the past.

The sources confirmed that there is an overwhelming tendency in decision-making circles - include, according to sources, not only Foreign Ministry but political and security bodies as well -, towards setting up the station owing to its political and technological benefits.
Expert with the Atomic Energy Authority Dr. Mostafa Abdel-Baqi said that the idea of setting up such a station is very important as most Israeli nuclear tests that have taken place since 1963 were secret ones.

Having put up for sale air and water of the holy land, two rabbis offered for sale recently the dust of the holy land. They took such dust from a tunnel dug under the Temple Mount. It is to be mentioned that violence acts broke out when such a tunnel was inaugurated.
"They try to link between such dust and the creation of the first man and this is untrue," he added, describing such attempts as fraud and extremist exploitation of people's faith.
The troops of this unit were trained in physically liquidating deposed Iraqi president Saddam Hussein in Iraq. But, the plan was scrapped as five soldiers of the unit were killed in friendly fire in the last training of the operation. At that time, former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak was chief of staff.
But, following the occupation of Iraq by the US and its allies, media sources in Tel Aviv unveiled an Israeli plan to revive Norman's plan, which was said to have been blessed by the US.
In other words, of what value are statements and recommendations or even resolutions so long as they lack an effective means of implementation?
However, let it be known to foreign ministers and to all Arabs that unless practical measures are taken to help Sudan's government to carry out the Security Council resolution before the deadline period of grace expires, the same vicious circle will be in wait for all!
The UN Secretary General during Arab foreign ministers' meeting has pledged to direct a new warning to the Sudanese government about its failure to implement the Security Council resolution items before the deadline!

Hizbullah Deputy Secretary General, Sheikh Naim Qassim emphasized that the threats now and then launched by Israel and which some regarded as terrible did not count for us in the least. We take it into consideration, added, while preparing, but they would not have any moral effect on us. If Israel carried out some of its threats, it would receive a painful reprisal that would teach it how to behave before the faithful and strugglers in Lebanon.
Hizbullah's Deputy Secretary General added that Israel could not be approached for an understanding but should be resisted and prevented from implementing its projects and schemes. We know that there is no balance of power between us and Israel, but we realize too that we are the proprietors of the land and the right and that when we steadfastly work hard and patiently offer sacrifices, the land will certainly be liberated as was the case once thanks to resistance and struggle
The paper added that Powell emphasized to the Arab bodies that tried to mediate that dialogue was on through diplomatic channels between Washington and Damascus but no high level meeting would take place between them until Syria meets all or most American demands.
The statement added, "You will soon hear about how our Imam and his two companions' cause would be solved. We also urge Gaddafi's allies to take the initiative to exercise pressure on that feigned Arab, expose him, unfold his crimes, as he would be ruthless to anybody after he was explicitly accepted in the invaders ranks.
Al-Muradi said that there were advanced military elements in command of field operations both strategically and tactically. Such elements, he added, had acquired combat experience in the Iraqi army.
Regarding reports about Abo-Mussab Al-Zarqawi's role in resistance operations, Al-Muraedi sarcastically said that such reports were promoted by the Zionist information machine adding that any operation which seem inexplicable to occupation forces are automatically attributed to Al-Zarqawi even though such a handicapped Al-Zarqawi whose weight did not exceed 50 kilograms had been killed in Al-Sulaymania city in the second month following occupation!
Regarding the difference between Al-Mahdi Army paying allegiance to Shiite leader, Maqtada Al-Sadr and other resistance factions, Al-Muradi said that there was no difference at all pointing out that resistance groups had provided Al-Mahdi Army with experienced elements during the first round of battles, with Al-Sadr, in turn, providing them with all possible help during Al-Falluja liberation battles. Both parties, that is, helped each other according to field commanders' views with the only difference lying in each particular realm of combat as resistance elements seem to be more seasoned fighters than Al-Mahdi Army.
If America loses the war, the world will be liberated, but if it wins the war, woes will be in wait for other peoples!
MODERN ISLAMIC COSTUME IN LEBANON DESPITE PRESSURE Amid a jungle of billboards decorating Beirut this summer, there is a new addition: billboards for models in Islamic costume.
It seems that the head-dressed women as well as the others are fascinated by the successive waves of changes devised by fashion designers.
A comparison between two Islamic costumes, one was designed about ten years ago and a modern one, reveals how change has taken place in hijab fashion - clothes have become more tight, including waistbands.
Fixed colours are no longer demanded. There may be also a hat on the hijab." The models don't wear hijab in their everyday life.
Girls from the south Lebanon city of Sur are bolder than other Lebanese hijab-wearing girls, he added.
Therefore, we produce more decent clothes to Hizbullah's women and meet the tastes of other hijab-wearing girls."

They noted that Egyptian security officials told their counterparts in the Israeli army staff that the arms were discovered when a group of nomadic arms smugglers were trying to smuggle them to Gaza Strip.
The Israeli television channel quoted the sources as saying that the margin of maneuvering in the face of Palestinian resistance movements would have been slimmed if Egyptian security agencies had dealt with the smuggling of weapons from Egypt to Gaza Strip in the way it has recently done.
The Israeli government calls on Egypt to keep security not only along the short border strip between Gaza Strip and Egypt but also along the Egyptian-Israeli border from the Mediterranean Sea shore at the southwestern end of Rafah City as far as the Red Sea Eilat City.
The Democratic member of the House of Representatives Commission of International Relations said in a news conference that he did not believe that Egypt did enough to prevent the smuggling of arms via its borders, and that it can close tunnels, which Israel alleges used to smuggle arms to Palestinian territories.
AFTER ITS CHIEF EDITOR WAS EXPELLED, AL-LEWA AL-ISLAMI RUN BY SHEIKH FROM POLICIES COMMITTEE
He also submitted several reports to the Arab Anti-Discrimination Organization and to Arab journalists union.

According to estimates of the World Bank, it is the highest population density in the world. A single Palestinian family has seven children, a figure which is predicted to double in the next five years.

raising prices. Moheiddin pointed out that selling the government share, represented in the banks and public insurance companies and Suez Cement or even through selling the National Cement would not lead to an increase in prices, noting that the government had its tools to control the market in addition to the draft law of organizing competition and anti-trust.
Consultant of former public sector minister Gameil Mussad called for selling the National Cement company to which this price rise was attributed due to the high cost of its production due to machinery depreciation, noting that the company is in dire need of comprehensive restructuring to increase its market price from 1 billion pounds currently to about 3 billion pounds.

Experts pointed out that the deregulation of the dollar against the Egyptian pound had no direct effect on the real estate market. It may even have led to a rise in the price of real estate units for Egyptian expatriates and Arab investors who are the main purchasing power on the real estate market. This will have positive effects on real estate companies without any tangible effect on demand.
Mohamed Al Atribi, director general with Chambers of Trade Federation said that the decline in the rate of exchange is regarded as CBE achievement as the dollar price was expected to rise due to the heavy demand for it in the pilgrimage season. This is a good indicator for the economic level as a whole, but successive declines or rises of the rates of exchange does harm to the real estate market as it indicates instability. The stability of the rate of exchange achieves stability and recovery in the real estate markets because it always suffers when prices fluctuate.
Former Minister of Housing emphasized that no binding links can be reached as it is all up to the greed of dealers in the market rather than to any rational mechanisms.
He added that the demand which the real estate market relies on is the Egyptian expatriates and Arab investors. A lower exchange rate may lead to an increase in the prices of real estate units compared with the third quarter of 2004 which witnessed a leap in the real estate market as a result of higher rates of exchange and lower prices of units. At any rate, according to an expert who refused to be identified, the real estate market situation is governed by some contradictory bids. It is certain, nevertheless, that for the time being, the cost of posh housing which relies on inputs imported from Italy, Spain, Czech, Belgium and France will come down. However only construction companies as usual will benefit by such a decline in spite of the likelihood that in this winter season, some discounts might be made to attract customers and activate the market in a season in which people are accustomed to recession.

Under this headline, Abdel-Wahab Badrakhan, Al-Hayat Deputy Chief Editor writes his article which runs to the following effect: The National Conference was a must because it was necessary for Iraq and the World and as it was an essential step on the road to elections and also because nothing should impede such a march.
There were of course some difficulties in selecting the conference members as none in Iraq recognizes anybody else and no party, no authority or leadership or party enjoys legitimacy or religious authority specifications!
But such a lie will never turn into a reality and cannot beguile everybody all the time.
Negotiations should have been entered with Moqtada Al-Sadr long before now as he is not fighting just to be invited to the conference, nor did rise in arms to be called for leaving Najaf.
Such a confrontation seems now to focus on breaking the Sadr trend thus targeting the Iranian dimension in the background. Even if such direct objectives were to be achieved, it would not prevent Shiite-Shiite conflicts from hatching, which would negatively impact on the emergent authority as well as the current government.
Under this headline, Hazim Sagheya of Al-Hayat writes an article on page 9 which runs to the following effect: An incomplete victory was scored by Iraqi Shiites when Saddam was toppled.
While Muktada understated the importance of the big new proposition, i.e. the American presence in Iraq, others or some others game case to that enormous development and its complicated dictates.
History, nonetheless, gives us evidence that giving such masses especially their leaderships rein in political life is a real disaster.
Regarding long term objectives, it might not be too difficult to predict the differences between two trends: one that in its absolute fight against the occupier tends to bet his political ends on regional powers and particularly Iran in this case and on opening countless doors to civil internecine wars especially as no sooner adopters of that project lay hands on one square meter of land, they turn it into a model of narrow-mindedness and fanaticism so repulsive to others while the other project, in its political and engagement with the occupier, opts for developing common quotients between the one fatherland's compatriots and demarcates the Iraqi state-nation in such a way that must keep the Iranian Shiite at some distance, let alone liberating the Iraqi case from subordination to other cases.

Al-Wasat Party had submitted two platforms to the Parties Affairs Committee in 1996 and 1997 but a new platform was submitted after there were signs that the party might be given an official permit.
The apology came in the form of an article published on Al-Lewa Al-Islami's front-page yesterday (August 26), carrying the signature of Minster of Information Mamdouh Al-Beltagui in his capacity as the ruling party's Information Secretary.
The Minister's apology came following reports about pressures exercised on the Egyptian government to apologize for the article.
For his part, Dr. Rifaat Sayed Ahmed who wrote the article told Asharq Al-Awsat that the implicit apology made by the ruling National Democratic Party as a result of American pressure and the deposition of the paper's chief editor together with preventing him from writing his column were not enough. There was American and Zionist insistence on the National Democratic Party in the form of its highest leaderships making an apology for what came in the article to satisfy Zionist organizations.
Defending his article, he emphasized that it had nothing that was anti-Semitic in it nor did it focus on the Holocaust. He reviewed the fallacies on which the state of Israel was built including the "Holocaust". The Egyptian writer described what the Palestinians were suffering now as severer than the Nazi Holocaust.
Having given the Palestinian request the thumbs up, Tantawi sent a letter to the Palestinian ministry inquiring how the team can go to Jerusalem and other occupied Palestinian territories.

FADLALLAH WARNS AGAINST INTELLIGENCE ROLE IN TRIGGERING SEDITION

A woman who comes of age can optionally authorize her guardian to attend the marriage ceremony instead of her. Regarding polygamy, the communique said that such a right is stipulated by a permit from the judge who should make sure that both wives, the old and the new, agree to such a marriage.
Under the government new measures, the husband has to provide suitable accommodation for the woman and her children in her custody. If he, however, can not do so, he must rent a house for her. If that condition was not met either, the woman has the right to stay in the family house, in contravention to the personal status law in operation since 1984, which gives the husband the right to retain the house in the case of divorce.
Islamists, on the other hand, think those measures are blatant violation of Islamic Sharia prejudicing the Algerian personality constituents which are basically Arab and Islamic.
Parliamentary groups are unanimous that there should be pressure to make the law in a prelude to Sharia and to the high ideals of the Algerian people.

Official sources with the cabinet confirmed that the government was in an embarrassing situation as one group of ministers thought it necessary to respond to the demands of manufacturers to make use of the increase in exports which might hit half a billion pounds in the coming period. Another team, nonetheless, rejected lifting the ban on the construction of new miassel factories as such a tendency would be met with strong opposition and would run counter to the countries tendency to combat smoking harm.
The sources expected that Safwat Al Sherif would be deposed from his position as party secretary general to be replaced by Dr. Mufid Shehab, the professors club secretary, or Dr. Zakaria Azmi, the party administrative affairs secretary.
Extensive changes are also expected in the governorates' secretariats especially where many seats were lost by the party in the recent Shura Council elections.
Noticeably, the President's son got a higher percentage than the National Democratic Party leaderships. Safwat Al Sherif, for example, won 10% and so did Kamal Al-Shazli, Dr. Zakaria Azmi and Maj. Gen. Habib Al-Adli got only 1.1% Shura Council Affairs Minister 3.3%.

Noticeably, too, no mention has been made of the emergency law despite its being currently amended by the government and ruling party related personalities to stop such a law which has been valid since 1981.
Although President Mubarak had often denied intentions of passing patrimonial power to his son, it is predominantly believed that Gamal would prepare for taking over provided that he contests presidential elections with more than one candidate. If, then, he won the majority, any mention of patrimonial power would then be out of place.
Dr. Botros emphasized that Egypt was safe apart from some individual cases that constitute no danger.
STATE OF EMERGENCY IN EGYPTIAN PORTS TO BAN CONTAMINATED CONSIGNMENT ACCESS
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Industry distributed the warning among all customs departments nationwide stressing the necessity of not allowing any cosmetic consignment to get access to the country whatever its source was except for those proved to free of contamination.
Such senior officials urged a continuation of such measures and investigations as a prelude to their referral to the judiciary to unveil the truth.
It is commonly known that the People's Assembly standing order entitles the People's Assembly speaker to allow a deputy to give depositions before the prosecution while the People's Assembly is not in session and during its recess.
Formal reports - discussed by the Ministerial Farmland Preservation Committee and the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) Policy Committee - said 586,000 encroachments upon 42,000 feddans were recorded last year.

The textile industry sector was granted 80 million euros from the EU, she added.
The upward trend in public debts, which contradicts official statements in this respect, requires the government to work out an urgent plan to cut public debts and cut down domestic and foreign borrowing, they said. Calling for putting such a plan in place as soon as possible, the deputies said the government should promise the parliament to stop unjustified or conditioned borrowing to fend off any potential harm to Egypt's domestic sovereignty, take steps to schedule such debts and set a time limit to reduce them.
EGYPT EXCLUDES ISRAEL FROM MEDITERRANEAN BODY BUILDING CHAMPIONSHIP
He pointed out that Egypt had hosted such a championship in 2002 without inviting Israel to participate. "This matter is out of the question," he said.
Head of the International Economic Relations Center at the National Planning Institute, Dr. Fadyah Abdel-Salam said that exports were centered on raw materials and agriculture commodities which show the failure of the national industry in promoting its production abroad. She ascribed such failure not to price competition but rather to the technological deterioration from which Egyptian industry suffers as well as to the government failure to develop and modernize industry in a way that enables it to produce high quality products that are able to enter new foreign markets. This failure is also attributed to the Egyptian industry's dependence on intermediary commodities imported from abroad to be used as production input. The deregulation of exchange rate did not provide real price flexibility but rather helped increase the production cost with the same value of the Egyptian pound retreat against other currencies, she said.
The MPs, including Muslims and Copts, reiterated their rejection of what they considered as foreign mandate on Egypt under any pretext.
They suggested that the government should form a lobby including Arab and Islamic countries, which are accused by the USCIRF of violating human rights, to reply to such allegations before the international community.
It is not Egypt that should be taught principles of human rights by any country.
The UN has given Khartoum a month grace to end the conflict in Darfur province, which was considered by the Sudanese government insufficient for a conflict that lasted for years. This confirms that the USA has included the Sudan in its schemes to seize Darfur just as it has done with the South of Sudan to seize petroleum and mineral, agricultural and animal resources.
Consequently, controlling Sudan is only part of a strategic American plan to control the Middle East, then move to control the world after it controls petrol, water and wealth resources as well as the important position of the Middle East (the center of the world) to create a new American globalization and eliminate other cultures. The USA, therefore, is trying to Americanize the world, spread American culture and control the resources of all the world.
Al-Ashri adds that controlling Sudan will lead to the isolation of Egypt from the Arab region so that any strong and liberation Egyptian role would be out of the question especially as Sharon is on Egypt's borders threatening the Eastern gate and Jordan is in partnership with the USA and Israel (Qualified Industrial Zone, QIZ).
Due to America's trouble in Iraq he expected an American intervention in Sudan through seditions and internal conflicts. It will, therefore, lavish money and weapons on Sudan's sons to tear Sudan, to control it without military intervention.
A: Yes it does. I'm currently having a round that includes South Africa, Zambia and Kenya. My interest in making Africa the start of my foreign rounds was meant to indicate the particular interest taken by Egyptian foreign policy in relations with African countries in light of the President 's directives to continue supporting such relations. Africa has always been part of Egyptian diplomacy and a springboard to international corridors.
Due to its distinguished position as the meeting place of the three continents and in light of its regional and international weight and distinguished relations in its Arab, African and European spheres, it can play the role of bridge to shorten the distance between the peoples of the three regions. Cairo had the honour of hosting the first Arab-African summit in 1977 where the current cooperation mechanisms were laid down. We are keen on enhancing the effectiveness of such mechanisms to achieve the common goals and interest. Egypt was also behind holding Africa-Europe summit in April 2000 where Cairo Declaration was passed to lay down the main pivots for cooperation.
Q: In return, is there anything that Africa can offer to Egypt?
Everybody has a right to put forward his views and analyses. However, the issue can be looked at from another angle. South Africa lived under ethnic restrictions for long years, which involved strict international boycotting to which African countries were among the most committed. After South Africa was liberated from the apartheid regime, it became only natural that the continent should open its arms to embrace a partner and a brother, granting it a distinguished status that matches its people's bitter struggle and enormous potentialities.

According to a study prepared by Dr. Hamdi Abdel-Aazim, undersecretary of post graduate studies at Sadat Academy for Management Science, the Egyptian family spends 80% of its income on food and drink.

Those measures include the invitation of all opposition parties leaders (16 in number including 6 parties whose activities were frozen under a decree by the Committee on Parties) to meet at the beginning of next month to discuss political conditions and take appropriate positions.
The leaders of the opposition Al-Wafd, Grouping (Tagamo'h) and Nasserite parties announced on Tuesday that they would take an earnest and sustained action to find a way out of the cul-de-sac in which the country is mired in all areas. No'man Gomaa, Refaat el-Said and Dia Eddin Dawoud, the leaders of the three parties respectively, met together at the Al-Wafd Party headquarters at invitation of the Al-Wafd chairman.
Such an all-around national march will start with a meeting of the opposition parties' leaders at the Al-Wafd Party headquarters at 1:00 pm on September 1st (Wednesday).
The next meeting of all the opposition parties called by the three political parties cannot be a preemptive action in anticipation of the ruling National Democratic Party's forthcoming congress, he said, noting that reform is a long-awaited demand for opposition parties.
Responding to a question whethere the Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) may join such a fresh move, Grouping Party leader Refaat el-Said said, "We will first sit with party leaders, and then we can discuss the next step."
The fatwa (religious opinion) said that Islam provides for meeting both material and spiritual needs in order to preserve the society's security and stability.
Prisoners Assistance Society welcomed the fatwa and in a statement issued yesterday it asked that prison laws be reviewed so that the fatwa might be carried out to avoid sexual deviations in prisons and to help in the rehabilitation of prisoners to integrate in society.
The two deputies said that they would put up their bill to the PA (parliament) in its next session due to begin next November.
The new amendments concentrate on adding new competence to the NCHR so that it can defend Egyptians abroad when they are arrested or kidnapped without any legal justifications, they said, citing examples of kidnapping Egyptians by Iraqi groups who killed some of them or robbing fish boats in other countries. The NCHR could, therefore, follow up how such countries treat Egyptians according to international human rights, the MPs added.
"Cooperation with such ministries aims at laying down a joint vision and achieving integration among different ministries to deepen respect of human rights," NCHR chief Botros Ghali said.
PhD THESIS: AUC SPIES ON EGYPTIAN SOCIETY

Deputy Al-Tibi added that Sharon apparently intended to enhance occupation presence in the West Bank in return for withdrawal from Gaza.
ISRAELI DECREE TO JUDAIZE 7500 SOLDIERS WHO EMIGRATED FROM FORMER SOVIET UNION
A military official says that 60% of the immigrants' sons conscripts refuse to be sworn in using the Torah, but want to use the New Testament, instead, not so much because they believe in it, but as they want to protest against not being recognized as Jews by official establishments.
In the last years, Israel has stepped up its campaign to attract further Jews due to the "demographic craze" and escalating concern about the possibility of the Jews becoming a minority in a Historic Palestine or Greater Israel lands from the sea to the river, according to the Israeli dictionary.
Many view his indefinite political ambitions with suspicion.
Dahlan is a special security man and a politician from a security angle. He considers his marriage to Mrs. Jalilah, an important stage in his life. He met her for the first time in Egypt, while she was born in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. She is preparing to obtain PhD thesis.
However, this network of relations made him the mysterious man of this stage. He speaks Hebrew fluently, lives in posh hotels.
Under this headline, Jordanian former minister of information Salah Al-Qalab wrote an article, which runs to the following effect only in part: The Iranians have pushed the young Shiite cleric Muqtada Al-Sadr to the battlefield though his only asset is his family's record in piety, holy struggle and religious and social status! He lacks experience and knowledge regarding the international game. He was pushed to the battlefield without any concept or government agenda.
In lieu of Hikmatyar, Sayaf, Rabbani and the other Mujahideen group leaders there, namely Muqtada Al-Sadr, Al Shibani, Al Sudani and Al Mahdi Army.
There is no alternative force to fill the vacuum and prevent the country from sliding into a devastating civil war.
The security solution is the dominant one to resolve Najaf battle.
More seriously even is the fact that such a trend was ambiguous as it could be regarded as purely Iraqi and it could also betray the presence of an Iranian dimension, which makes it, in either case, open to a variety of penetrations and manipulations.
Though such a course of action inflicted losses upon them, it remained their only option, which might, in the long run, prove feasible and profitable.
Naturally, Baghdad's Shiites, as well as Shiites in other cities, who have been brought up away from the plots of the religious establishment, neither give credit to Moqtada Al-Sadr and his trend nor bet on him. They rather bet on the "state", hoping that it would take a civilian secular balanced course of action.
Such a reality, of course, needed an authority to be dealt with, represented in Ali Al-Sistani, seemed qualified for reforming a vital role.
It is a disapproval of attacking the sites called holy or spiritual or religious sanctity.
Iraqi Ministry of Industry signed a contract with an American company, which has not been identified yet, to produce GMC cars at an annual capacity of 90,000 saloons, 130,000 pick-ups, and 10,000 4x4 vehicles.

The information attache in the American Embassy, told Al-Hayat that the embassy expected that Libaron would arrive about mid-September.
Deputies in Kuwaiti National Assembly (parliament) of various Islamic affiliations had urged Kuwaiti government recently not to accept ambassador Libaron to express rejection of the absolute American support of Israel. Government sources, nonetheless, said that such a matter was entirely not on the cards due to the distinguished relations between Kuwait and the USA, especially as Kuwait thought it was doing everything possible for supporting the Palestinian cause and bolstering Palestinian people's steadfastness till the end of occupation.
In the mid 1980s, Kuwait had rejected an ambassador nominated by American State Department for Kuwait as he had occupied a position in the American Embassy to Israel. He, then, thought that the Kuwaiti decision was both bold and unprecedented by a third world country.
However, it seems that Iranian President Mohamed Khatemi is aware of that war, as he called for the convention of a meeting for the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) to discuss latest developments in Iraq, asking Arab and Islamic countries to shoulder their responsibilities in Iraq.
Iran believes that it is meant in the first place by the US war on Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr in Iraq.
The Americans, on the other hand, see the matter quite different. They want to put al-Sadr outlawed militia under control. Moreover, they flex their muscles in a provocative way in religious sites to impose their demands and put the gag on Iranian ambitions in the country.
What is more important is to learn lessons from history. The US interests in the region usually pay no heed to friends.
Nevertheless, it is wrong to believe that the United States has failed in Iraq because failure could encourage adventurism towards Iran that time.

In spite of the customs duties exemption which carpets exports have enjoyed since last May Polish imports of carpets hit 100 million dollars.

Banking leaderships ruled out a high demand for shekel in Egyptian markets during the coming period in spite of the developments witnessed by the Egyptian-Israeli relations in Sharm el-Sheikh summit and Foreign Minister Ahmed Abul-Gheit's announcement about sending an Egyptian ambassador back to Israel and agreeing on stopping violence between Israelis and Palestinians.
In case the volume of investments and trade exchange between Egypt and Israel increased, the dollar would be the main currency, she added.
Such expectations have been fueled by an Egyptian governmental plan to put in place the qualified industrial zones (QIZ) deal, which gives Egyptian exports with an Israeli component tariff-free and unrestricted access to the American market, thus opening the door for trade and banking deals between Egypt and Israel in the coming period.
In the meantime, exchange firm officials voiced willingness to show the Israeli shekel on dealing screens and to start shekel deals as soon as relevant instructions are made by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) and control agencies. This was confirmed by Ali el-Hariri, secretary-general of the Egyptian Federation of Chambers of Commerce and an exchange firm owner, adding that shekel deals had been suspended on the Egyptian market since the outbreak of the 2000 Palestinian Intifada, not to mention the drop in the number of Israeli visitors to Egypt and the untransferable and depreciating shekel. Some exchange firms have quiet shekel deals only in Egyptian cities near the Egyptian-Israeli border. The Israeli shekel rate of exchange recorded 1.29 pounds for buying and 1.23 pounds for selling.

For the first time in 25 years, a large number of Egyptian businessmen have agreed on the necessity of pushing forward economic cooperation with Israel.
In this context, el-Zorba wondered: Why do not we cooperate with Israel?
He went on to note "To take the relationship to an advanced level takes a long time as the moral or public aspect should be taken into account. Furthermore, most Egyptians resolutely oppose cooperation with Tel Aviv unless peace is achieved and the Palestinian issue is resolved. The coming period could be a serious touchstone of peace."

construction companies' local contracts increased during the current fiscal year to 11.2 billion pounds compared with 9.2 billion pounds last year, up 22%. This reflects the possibility of achieving a breakthrough in construction sector crisis which all traditional solutions failed to solve due to the cement and iron high prices.
Al-Sayed attributed the problems facing the construction sector to the fierce competition with companies that did not bear the same burdens shouldered by the enterprise sector companies such as the big number of workers in addition to problems that face the companies which undertake projects abroad like letters of guarantees and insurance.
According to the Middle East News Agency (MEAN), the mission lauded the measures taken by the government to carry out the economic reform program in light of an offer submitted by the ministerial economic group to the mission over the recent of the economic developments and the future economic policies the government intends to adopt as well as the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) commitment to support a flexible system for exchange rate according to supply and demand rules.

The plan rests on capitalizing on four axes available in China, which are represented in profiting by political good relations and the Chinese desire to have presence in the region through cooperation with the Egyptian market, the Chinese orientations to push Chinese companies to invest abroad to reduce pressure on the Chinese currency, making use of the Chinese desire to ensure production inputs at low prices through direct dealing with producers, and exploiting the Chinese growing well-offs' interest in having high-quality imported commodities.

Sources said this step is meant to ensure stability of the exchange rate. Moreover, the dollar exchange rate is expected to go down to lower than six pounds soon.

He expected the Egyptian-Libyan banking cooperation to take the form of documentary credits and cadre training. He pointed out that the banks had no political orientations but rather financial and economic ones.
EGYPTIAN OPPOSITION PARTIES MEET ON PRESIDENTIAL REFERENDUM
However, It also did not specify the mechanism of the secretariat.
DOES ISRAEL NEED A SPY IN AMERICA?
He is not an ordinary spy but a super one who works for the US Secretary of Defence Ramsfeld!
By the same token, the USA usually antagonizes any country that Israel may consider a threat to its ambitions, aggressive and expansionist schemes!
Despite such intimacy that emphasizes that the USA and Israel are just one body, the ploy of planting Israeli spies in sensitive American positions completely runs parallel with the Jewish suspicious character which does not trust even its next of kin.
Some of them are now in American prisons serving sentences pronounced against them for charges of treason of the country whose nationality they hold in favour of their Israeli Jewish affiliations.
In his column Dividing Lines, Samir Ragab, chairman of Al-Tahrir Foundation and chief editor of Al-Gomhouria, wrote an article which runs to the following effect:
However, some people tried to get him acquitted under the allegation that his position could not affect political decisions!
Surprisingly, Israel, in an attempt to refute the charge, alleged that it had decided, twenty years before, not to spy on America after the famous agent Jonathan Pollard had been arrested.
Come on and seize it before it evaporates!
All current central banks in GCC member states would be maintained, as they would look after the implementation of the Gulf Unified Central bank, he said, adding that proposals regarding the body that will be in charge of issuing the Gulf unified currency and setting and running the unified monetary policy would be submitted to the GCC Supreme Council.
Israeli newspapers try to draw a rosy image of Israel and show it as the focus of attention of the refugees in Darfur and that it became a haven for those who face the danger of death. Haaretz newspaper mentioned that the Israeli border guard forces arrested five Sudanese who attempted to infiltrate into Israel via the Egyptian-Israeli borders.
Islamic organizations in Saudi Arabia declared that they would offer 40 million riyals to Darfur citizens. The international Islamic Relief Authority would also offer relief materials estimated at 6 million riyals. The authority premises in Birmingham would present some one million riyals in addition to 400 thousand dollars from Islamic Development Bank and 100 thousand dollars from Emirian-Sudanese committee.
Sudan was not in a state of "societal integration". Rather, it was divided between the sects of Ansar and Khatmia and their political terms "nation" and "federation", and between south and north.
That is why the northerners were weak in their 2002 and 2004 tours of negotiations with the southerners. This situation did not exist in the 1972 negotiations in Kenya, which were held ahead of the Addis Ababa agreement between Numeiri and Joseph Lago when the governor of Khartoum was supported by Cairo, Riyadh, Washington and London after he had done without local communists and Moscow. Now, the northern negotiator accepts all that he had earlier rejected (perhaps that is why Dr. Ghazi Salah Eddin declined to lead the Sudanese government's negotiating team in the Mashakos negotiations, or even sign agreements on the "three areas", "fortune sharing" and more importantly "power sharing", something which was clearer in Nivasha than in Kashakos in the 2004 negotiations.)
Now, under the current Arab weakness following the new international changes which the Russians, Arabs and Muslims have been most affected, Sudan is being reshaped by international and regional quarters (the Inter-Government Authority for Development (IGAD) member countries, excluding Egypt and other Arab countries). This proves that African weight in terms of international relations is growing, while Arab one is dwindling away, doesn't it?
LEBANON: EXTENSION AND THE TANGENT!
Though both parties quite know what available margin they were allowed, failed to see Syrian pretexts in true perspective. However, they know in advance how preponderant such pretexts would eventually turn out.
This, however, does not count much for Syrian calculations as any political Lebanese objections are dropped under the weight of national pretexts and the confrontations with Israel and the USA, as all sorts of cares and troubles are then overshadowed by strategies.
All this necesstates a state of complete control in the Lebanese situation regardless of any constitutional concerns.
The preparatory committee of the Iraqi National Institutional Council, which opposes the Iraqi caretaker government and the US occupation, wraps up in the Lebanese capital of Beirut on Wednesday, with a set of recommendations for a future action mechanism to be adopted.
A statement signed by the Iraqi National Union's general secretariat and allied national forces and figures was distributed during the session. In the statement, they announced that they had nothing to do with the Beirut congress or its organizers, and thereupon they rejected its recommendations for several reasons, including the fact that the coordination committee carried out a scheme devised in advance and financed and supported by unknown and suspicious agencies. The committee also imposed a blackout on its activities and started to control the congress in its interest.
Asked why the meeting was held in Beirut, rather than Baghdad, he said, "Baghdad is now a place for violations of the rights of expression and physical liquidation by the occupiers and caretaker government."
The South Iraqi Group also sought to block the congress after it had received a lot of money from the government to do this job.
Sheikh Solyman Kanan from Basra said, "What is happening, including debates, is a natural matter as democracy in Iraq is still immature.
Yassin Gabbar el-Delimi, Al-Orouba managing editor and assistant secretary of the Unified National Nasserite Party from Khaledia, Anbar province between Ramadi and Falluja, was quoted as saying, "This congress includes people from all walks of life and national, religious and ethnic leaders.
But, we know that the congress includes all sincere and loyal Iraqis.
RAILWAY PROJECTS UNDER THE BOT SYSTEM CONCESSION PERIOD EXTENDED

The meeting comprised Japanese ambassador to Cairo and representative of Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in Cairo and a number of Ministry Transport officials.

The minister welcomed the Japanese side's offers to invest in railways and the metro, calling for continuing meetings between the two sides for funding giant projects in the transport field. He also called on the Japanese side to carry out many other projects in Egypt for serving North Africa and the COMESA countries.

STANDARDIZATION AUTHORITY REVIEWS STANDARDS OF CHINESE CARS
"The problem lies in the absence of standard specifications according to which cars, whether Chinese or not, are allowed to enter the country," secretary general of the Car Manufacturers Association Eng. Salah Al-Hadari said.
The project aims at enhancing means of irrigation, soil properties and final agricultural products.

It also thinks that Syria has managed to turn itself into a "regional opposition force" that holds domestic cards in Lebanon and exercises a kind of "veto" on US proposals and solutions in the Middle East region.
And that's why the United States has embarked on an initiative to change the Syrian regional role through turning Damscus's cards of the game into points of weakness.

EGYPT'S UREA FERTILIZER EXPORTS RECORD 179 MILLION US DOLLARS
Under this headline Farouq Al-Ashri, writer and journalist wrote this article which ran to the following effect: Imagine the financial deficit in Egypt's budget reaching LE200 billion!
Former prime minister Atef Ebeid's government had announced that the estimated deficit would be in the range of LE52.3 billion. This means that the current government that took over the responsibility about a fortnight following the start of this fiscal year had caused a fourfold rise in the deficit compared with expectations when the budget was being prepared only during 9 months of the abovementioned year of which another 3 months are left. How much more will that deficit claim by the end of this year?
Unfortunately, according to the official data published on the volume of total investments by the government, economic authorities and the public sector combined did not exceed LE40.3 billion in all economic activities. Where would all such funds have been spent?
According to the results of the latest comprehensive survey conducted by CAPMS on the income and expenditure and consumption rates of the Egyptian family in 1999/2000, the poor spend more on food and drinks compared with other categories. For example, while the 20% lowest income category spend 57.7% of their income on food and drinks in urban areas, only 28% was spent by the 20% highest income category in urban areas. In rural areas, too, higher percentage was spent on food and drinks compared with urban families (67.6% and 48.6%) respectively.

In exclusives to Al-Hayat, Al-Zahar said the movement avoids any activity that may drag it into chaos and carries out reform without being known as a party to it.

The Mossad had asked for the file after the twin suicide bombing operation in Beer Sheva last month and after accusing Hamas leadership especially its political bureau chairman of giving instructions prior to Israeli officials' threats to assassinate him in the Syrian capital.
The security "file" said that Mashaal was the primary official both in the interior and abroad according to the movement's constitution. Moussa Abou Marzouk is his deputy for political affairs. Imad Al-Alami is responsible for communications with Hamas officials in the interior.
BOOBY TRAPS IN DAMASCUS!
Those who know the nature of those leaders movement, should expect the extension of the physical liquidation series to the Lebanese territories where outstanding leaders in Hamas used to participate in festivals especially those organized by Hizbullah.
The Israeli attempt to give the lie to Hamas departure from Syria has yet a graver implication, - exposing Syrian security as penetrated in the depth while Syria's eyes were on its borders with Iraq where it showed cooperation with American military experts to prevent infiltration after it had received a strongly toned message from the Assistant Secretary of State for the Middle East Affairs, William Burns.
The most serious thing about that partnership is that its declared goals are not speculations or bids for deals neither with Syria nor anybody else. The stage of coexistence with reality has come to an end and what is demanded of any country transcends the termination of any regional role for any country in the region so that previous blackmails would continue till any country would, at best, hope for keeping its borders safe or sometimes wish for a guarantee to keep the political structure of that country unimpaired.
PALESTINIAN FACTIONS...IIDEOLOGICAL DIVERGENT VIEWS DWINDLE, RELIGIOUS DISCOURSE OVERWHELMS
Not only did ideological disagreements among resistance factions dwindle away but differences in the means and forms of resistance eroded away as well.
Competition between diverse factions on winning the Palestinian public opinion pushed them to imitate each other in the forms of resistance operations and the development of their action patterns.
Resistance movements had manufactured mortars at the beginning, but Hamas moved from using mortars to 2-8-km missiles called "Qassam", which have become the only means to attack Jewish settlements from Gaza Strip.
During the Al-Aqsa Intifada, more than one Palestinian resistance factions unprecedentedly launched joint military operations, which were almost successful.
Mahmoud Abbas Abu Mazen took over as prime minister in the Palestinian National Authority as a first step towards reform, but he was forced to leave his position some months later out of frustration and under Palestinian pressure, as he sees it, and the refrainment of the Israeli and American sides from offering him any help.
How far do you agree with this opinion?
Q-How can this situation be overcome?
A-To the contrary, we had intentions and determination, so we made many achievements. Many security agencies were unified and we started basic financial, administrative, and legal steps. We went to America and other countries.
Q-Who obstructed the performance of the government?
A-There are non-governmental bodies, there are the executive committee and the central committee, and there are circles and figures that contributed to this obstruction of the government performance.
The majority of the Israeli people seek and want peace, but the opinion has no power. It is the opinion of the government that has power. I know that Sharon does not want peace.
Occupation has nothing to do with reform. Some say that reform should be postponed until occupation is removed, but this is nonsense.
A-Objections are real. The evidence is that the Israeli extremists who killed Isaac Rabin did not kill him for personal reasons, but due to political reasons. Now, they are objecting to the steps relating to the withdrawal from Gaza. That is why their threats could be serious to the extent that they could assault any of the Israeli officials.
Q-Can we imagine one day after ten years of adopting the peace option that Abu Mazen would adopt the resistance option?
At the beginning of the military uprising, some said that this uprising would lead to the liberation of the homeland. The result is that the homeland was re-occupied. They said the uprising would stop settlement, but the result is that settlement doubled.

"The issue of water which is crucial to the Arab-Israeli conflict, represents an obstacle to the establishment of peace in the region, and is taken as a pretext by Israel to delay a comprehensive settlement with its neighbours," Lebanese Finance Minister Fouad Assaniorah said.

KIRKUK: INSISTENCE ON REMOVING ARAB CHARACTERISTICS FROM THE CITY The Kurds are unanimous that Kirkuk is an "inalienable part" of Iraqi Kurdistan that should be reunified. Some people believe that the city is not purely "Kurdish".

Keeping Arabs in Kirkuk means keeping the Arab identity of the city forced by Saddam Hussein's regime.

The MPs who decided to put down the new draft law in February, 2001, pointed out that the decision to raise exchange companies capital to LE10 million which raised objections on the part of exchange companies revealed the gravity of the disaster they sparked and proved that they turned large profits without the existence of real capital

96.		Addressing the Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs on February 3rd, the Indian Foreign Minister reviewed the Indian views on regional and international securities issues adding that one of the globalization requirements is theoretically represented in the necessity of all the world countries obtaining a fair share of the world economy yields. However, what is really taking place is nothing but a race for getting the lion's share of these economic yields rather than entering into partnership with others.

128.		DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE ..
Added to that, exchange companies have managed to raise that rate of exchange to 425 piasters, then to reduce the rate by over 25 piasters in 48 hours, so is it feasible to set certain rules for a genuine rate of exchange under such tension and fluctuations?
Or is there another government and CBE package of measures to solve the crisis in a rational, long-term way? I mean those with a bearing on boosting Egypt's foreign exchange resources especially from exports, tourism, direct foreign investments and attracting Egyptian funds in the banks and markets of the West.
134.		If the government means by such measures to force exchange companies to amalgamate, where are the criteria of such amalgamation?
Even though the minister said there are over 60 countries adopting, he did not accurately specify whether the rate of exchange of 385 piasters that might rise or decline within 1% may be considered as price fixing or not?

Egypt's Mufti, nevertheless, did not support the idea of closing down cigarette and tobacco factories adding that they had workers who keep families. They, therefore, can be gradually converted into factories that produce religiously permissible commodities. He pinpointed that the activities and profits of such factories are religiously impermissible.
HALF THE EGYPTIAN'S INCOME GOES TO FOOD AND DRINK, 4% TO SMOKING
Surprisingly enough, even though the Egyptians never cease to complain about an over abundance of rice, one of their staple foods, as well as the excessive stock piles on the domestic market, their imports of foreign rice exceed their exports. The Egyptian rice is also well reputed at the international level.
According to reports from Central Agency for Mobilization and Statistics, the Egyptian per capita consumption of sugar reaches 31 kilogrammes a year.
Central Agency figures say that 50% of Egyptian money is devoted to food and drink and 4% goes to tobacco and cigarettes and hubble-bubble, and the rest goes to education, transport, housing, medicine and entertainment.
Illiteracy figures went down remarkably too and there has been a 22% increase in computer development annually.

As expected, lawyers have appealed against the conducting of the Bar Association elections, slated for February 17, 2001, something that may lead to the cancellation of these elections, which have been suspended for more than five years.
Leading lawyers are exerting efforts to convince their colleagues who filed the lawsuit of withdrawing them. The leading lawyers are also urging their colleagues to accept any formation of the Association board, so that the Association may not enter a dark tunnel anew and the government may not be given a chance to suspend the elections and choose a new judicial committee to run the Association.
The deputies who represent most political trends represented in the Egyptian parliament such as Nasserites, leftists as well as the Islamic trend emphasized the importance of the parliament discussing the file of air traffic between Egypt and Israel through the parliamentary committee on transport.

Wasel said that it had been proven beyond doubt that smoking was harmful to health, which would do damage to society and would therefore require the imposition of punishment especially at the time when prayers are called for or in mosques or holy places.
Dr. Wasel also considered Haj and Zakat of both users of and dealers in tobacco, wine and drugs as utterly unacceptable. If the money is earned through a haram (religiously impermissible) means, no good act including Haj and Zakat will be accepted. Only if the money was earned through halal (religiously permissible) activities, will such good acts be accepted by Allah.

142.		The report, which will soon be referred to the cabinet for discussion, explained that the widening technological mismatch is obvious as we have not so far introduced internationally accredited accounting systems to be used in banks or companies. Neither do we have state-of-the-art communication systems in general. Furthermore, there is no industrial production for sophisticated electronics.
2.		The domestic trade sector has witnessed a remarkable growth in the 1999/2000 FY compared to the previous year. The growth rate hit 6.85%, which is higher than the growth rate of GDP, either at market prices or the costs of production factors which went up by 6.4 and 6.5 roughly, in terms of fixed prices considering the year 1996/1997 as a basis. As a result, the average per capita quota of production went up by 4.3%, and the domestic market by 12.8% as its growth index hit LE19.4 billion, up LE2.2 billion against last year.
6.		The commercial sector production represents 27.6% of the value of available commodity offered at a rate of about 4.2% against previous year, the report noted. This is provided by two main sources, which are domestic production and imports (after excluding exports from the quantitative aspect). Imports represented 33.8% of the total available commodity on the market, 0.6% higher than the target and at a 5.6% growth rate against last year due to expansion in imports after taking practical steps on the road of liberalizing foreign trade that cope with the GATT. This means that the imported commodities is important on the local market at a time when productive commodities exports value does not go up because of the increase of oil international prices as it does not exceed 7% of the GDP.
The plant investment hits $100 million and is expected to start production as of the beginning of the year 2002.

91.		Both sides looked into the spheres of trade and economic cooperation in light of the big increase in Egyptian exports to India which hiked from about $65 million in 1996/97 to reach $256 million last year, a fourfold rise, something which resulted in the existence of more than $20 million trade surplus in favour of Egypt.
Concerning the Egyptian capital market, Fleming report mentioned that the prices were exaggerated compared to the rates of returns. 10.		The report also cited that the rise of the inter-bank lending rates reflected the unstable economicenvironment. "Over pricing the Egyptian pound by a rate of 40% against the dollar and euro lead to a balance deficit, said the report. Also, government credit had increased by $6.8 billion and foreign assets declined by $3.5 billion," the report added.
Al-Hayat learnt that President Mubarak had recently held several unannounced meetings attended by senior government officials and a number of his advisors. The meetings were devoted to studying how to deal with Sharon's government, the peace process file and clearing the Arab air in a bid to reach a unified Arab position and Cairo seemed to have prepared for dealing with Sharon's win as a de facto situation.
The official nonetheless strongly denied Cairo preparing to take an encouraging initiative towards Sharon. He said, "If Sharon offered anything useful to the peace process, Egypt would be willing to deal with him, but if the matter was mere time wasting, he would have to excuse Egypt as she would not contribute to complicating matters.
In response to Sharon's threats the official said, "We are dealing with irresponsible threats calmly and rationally though we are also taking them quite seriously without letting ourselves be dragged into altercations. Egypt is not a war monger but a peace maker that seeks a comprehensive peace based on international legitimacy and votes for stability in the region.
Regarding clearing the Arab air prior to the convention of Amman summit next month, the source said, through his Arab rounds and communications, President Mubarak wants the Arab nation to be ready but without the least nervousness or agitation.
BAR ASSOCIATION: POLITICAL FORCES FOR BREAKING "MONOPOLY REGARDLESS OF DIFFERENCES OVER CANDIDATES LISTS!
The differences over the vote on the position of chairman reflect the differences inside parties over public issues. The attitude towards Islamic orientations, nonetheless, represents the crux of the matter in some trends while personal reservations regarding candidates represent the basis of divergence in other trends.
In this context, emerges the in principle unanimity among all parties about banning the principle of "exclusion" or "monopoly" in the association council, which is the only point of assent which urged the opponents to try to set up a list comprising representatives of all trends.
It is noteworthy, too, that Ashour also managed to attract the support of sectors of Wafdite lawyers even though there is a Wafdite candidate for the position of chairman - namely, Ahmed Nasser, which strongly indicates that settlement of differences would not so much depend on the influence of a political bloc inside the syndicate as on the ability of each candidate to attract extensive syndicate support for his election platform.
The sources added that the bill, which was due this evening to be discussed by the committee on proposals and complaints would be suspended sine die.

H.D. Asharq Al-Awsat, 5/2/2001
The recent report, no. 160 for January and February 2001, of the specialized national councils under the chairmanship of former prime minister Dr Atef Sedki showed that the situation of science and technology in Egypt at the end of the 20th century had two important features.
The government and the state are the first to blame for the poor level of technological and scientific progress in the Egyptian society as this question is a strategic one that has to do with the society and its entire entity.
One thousand women attended the inauguration ceremony. The exhibition activities will continue till the end of this month.
The recent report on Egyptian economy which has been issued under the title "Strategic Economic Attitudes" and compiled by Al-Ahram Political and Strategic Studies Centre (PSSC), recorded the problems of the privatization program in Egypt in the context of a general outlook of the economy as a whole.
A year later, another report indicated that it had been sold for LE15.6 million. It is noteworthy that the company was highly remunerative till 1991, then it made huge extensions that turned it into a loss-making company and it was offered for sale.
Among these outcomes is that privatization does not mean deregulation of the economy, but rather providing the legal optimum conditions for attracting investments. In addition, the privatization program in Egypt comes very close to consumption of assets balance accumulated by previous generations just to finance the current expenditure of the current government.

The offer included the participant companies, the project targets, the track of land and sea pipelines, proposed water quantities, expected costs, in addition to other detailed aspects of the project.
One of the major bodies launched severe criticisms at the technological and scientific situation in Egypt, pointing out that there is a big technological and scientific gap.
The second one was the effects of computerization and the exploitation of technological sciences on society, which are far from sanguine. The report, which has been compiled by experts in the field of technology, communications and sciences, indicated that such effects cover thought and technology which is not governed by any rules and this is the responsibility of the state, which should have a clear-cut policy for financing and organizing executive programs and then gauging the results.
AHRAM PSSC REPORT LASHES OUT AT PRIVATIZATION PROGRAM
An official report pointed out that the company had been sold for LE58 million.
The report lashed out at using part of privatization proceeds, no matter how little it may be, for paying off the salaries of loss-making companies as it is not reasonable to sell the best public sector company for using its proceeds in financing the wages of workers and early pensioners in the loss-making companies. The report also recorded the most important outcomes of privatization in Egypt.
Moreover, the administration of the public enterprise sector must be developed in a way that guarantees efficient performance along with stringent control to preclude corruption and boost transparency.

More than twenty armed men had attacked Abu Tufaila hamlet on the evening of 4 February and took its residents to a deserted area in the mountains at gunpoint to force them to sign contracts of sale of their property and farmland. The gangsters also broke into the villagers' homes and took all the money and jewels they could find.
The sentences passed by Sohag Criminal Court on 5 February in the case of the second incident at Al Kusheh, in which 96 people were indicted, including 57 Muslims and 39 Copts, seven of whom have escaped, reflected a balance between the judicial and legal aspects of the case on the one hand and the political nature and social impact of the incident on the other.
Meanwhile, the relatives of the defendants on both sides welcomed the verdict. Observers believe that the judge based his ruling on the law when he rejected the prosecution's evidence on grounds of insufficiency, so he did not pass harsh sentences. They also think that he took into consideration the political dimensions of the case when he urged the Church to punish Copts for negligence and hinted at the anti-government campaign by those who had "resorted to America and Clinton." The judge was also aware of the social aspect of the case, as he averted any new clashes that might have erupted as a result of grudges within the families of the defendants if he had awarded harsh punishments.
Finally, let us consider what European peoples did with Jorg Haider, leader of the hard-line Nationalist Party in Austria, whose views were described as a call for Neo-Nazism in Europe. The Europeans decided to isolate Austria and impose several sanctions on it because it had allowed Haider to participate in the ruling coalition in his country. All of us should start preparation from now for demanding Israel's isolation from the international community and cutting all contacts and negotiations with it, on the grounds that it also is under the leadership of a Nazi. We would not be exaggerating if we renewed our demand for preparing a legal complaint that will be sent to the International Court of Justice or the UN Court of War Crimes to demand Sharon's trial for all the crimes he committed against the Arabs and the massacres he led in Sabra and Chatilla, particularly as he was convicted of these crimes by the Israeli board of inquiry that recommended his dismissal from the post of defence minister that he was occupying in 1982 in the wake of his Nazi invasion of Lebanon and his hideous murder of many Lebanese and Palestinians. This is an urgent and immediate duty for the Arab League.
According to analyses and expectations, a heated confrontation between Iraq and the US is about to take place. One of the reasons for such a confrontation may be the expected failure (which is implied in Iraqi official statements) of the Iraqi-UN talks, due to be held in New York late this month.
On the other hand, the Mobilization and Statistics Department, an affiliate of the Iraqi Ministry of Defense, asked reserve officers and soldiers to report to their recruitment departments on February 14, 2001.
The government and the deputies exchanged surprises during the meeting of the People's Assembly's Culture, Information and Tourism Committee, which was presided over by Fayda Kamel.

With such an outlook of the Intifada and in recognition of the blood of its martyrs and victims, we feel it apt to say that we should never, for whatever reason, let it down or back out as such behaviour would be national shame incarnate as well as a historic sin that can never be forgiven. This brave intifada, to our mind, has opened the door to a new epoch of the long Arab- Israeli conflict, the epoch of Palestinian independence and true Arab liberation.
The first thing we should do is this: maintain and bolster the intifada and resistance in rejection of surrender and normalization. The second thing which we think is incumbent is to carry out an objective and faithful review of the settlement march started by the Arabs ten years ago, a topic that may be on the agenda of the next Arab summit in Amman in March. The settlement march has continued for a decade, the decade of Madrid, Oslo, Copenhagen and their satellites!

Sharon is expected to develop sea weapons and nuclear capabilities, and concentrate on strategic cooperation with the United States, said the ambassador.

The fresh modifications also covered the attachment of the judicial inspection to the SCJ instead of the Ministry of Justice. The approval of the SCJ should be obtained first as far as the judges are concerned. The Judges Club should also be considered a private affair of the Judiciary subject only to the judicial power law.
Lawyer of the Coptic families that lost some of their members in the second Kosheh incident said the families would challenge the verdicts handed down by the court on 5 February 2001against the case defendants. They would mainly ask for compensation from those acquitted.
He also ruled out the possibility of the rulings reflecting a political trend with the state It is not reasonable that judges get confused about what is judicial and what is political as the state attends to the interests of all people Muslims and Copts alike as we are Egyptians not foreigners.
Minister of Health, Ismail Sallam said that the blood plasma ampoules imported from Britain numbering 144 only had been sent back to Britain and no patient had been treated with such ampoules.

The second intifada (uprising) that started on September 18th last year has reached its fifth month, claiming over 400 Palestinian martyrs and 22 thousand injured who served both as fuel of recent confrontation and harbinger of continued struggle and sacrifice for sanctities in the near and distant future.

He added the foundation of the existent factories is ascribed to Dr Azeez Sedki's efforts who had set up mega industries and industrial organizations such as the Arab Organization for Industrialization (AOI) that brought into being 190 public sector businesses and contracted the establishment of 1350 industrial projects. However, the present-day industries are not real industries, he said pointing out that some factories import chemicals from Germany and re-pack them again calling this industry. He admitted that it was extremely harmful to stop investing in the industrial field. The minister also admitted that every Tom, Dick and Harry, now speaks about industry and the minister can do nothing about the bad condition of the Egyptian industry, adding that the ministry was unjustly treated in terms of financial resources.

THREE REASONS FOR SHARON'S WEAKNESS: HIMSELF, HIS ALLIANCE WITH RADICALS & HIS POLITICAL AGENDA
The first is the man himself, who is 73 years old and in poor health. Sources close to Sharon say that he has lost the ability to make decisions and is manipulated by his son and others in his inner circle.
By depending on the such groups, Sharon may be able to create a coalition, however contradictory, in Knesset with a membership of 62:63 deputies.
In other words, they voted for security and normal life, believing that the Arabs would scurry for shelter like frightened children when they hear of the arrival of "General Sharon" and that things would go back to running in their safe course.

We must be optimistic about Sharon's assumption of power, because none of the profiteers of the Oslo and Copenhagen projects will attempt to deceive Arab peoples from now on.

THE MISSING DUTY
2-	Adherence to unity.
These ayats stipulate that unity is a religious duty, and they say that as an explicit order. It is a duty that is unlike all other duties of Islam.
They believe in Prophet Mohammad. They do not differ in that respect, either. They believe in a single Book (the Quran). They do not differ in this regard. They pray facing one Kibla (The Holy Ka'ba in Mecca).
The action by muftis and other scholars in that respect will create a new reality that will change criteria and set the masses in motion, because the failure to discharge this duty is a denouncement for every Muslim, as it eliminates the greatest foundation of Islam.
According to a statistic from Obstetrics Departments in Relief Agency medical centres and hospitals in Gaza, 2175 children have been born in Gaza governorates alone since the outbreak of Al-Aqsa uprising, a rate which exceeds that recorded for the same period last year by more than 300 new born children.

The assignment of Robert Statlov the Middle East file as a counsellor in the new US National Security Council discontented the parties concerned with the peace process to the extent that the Arab and Islamic American organizations representatives in a press conference, called on the new US administration to reconsider such a decision.
His supporters cite the argument that he is well versed in Arab and Islamic policies as well as the Congress policies on the Middle East issue. He also took part in many research papers on such issues. He has also taken part in joint working papers such as the report he compiled with another pro-Israeli hard-liner Thomas Friedman, a journalist with New York Times. Their report handled the Syrian-Israeli negotiations and was published in 1999.
The "Tamazight" battle in Morocco was transferred from the field of language and cultural identity to that of political action, after leading figures of the Tamazight elite had called for forming a new party.
Although the Moroccan Constitution does not recognize Tamazight as an official language for the country, the government Radio and TV transmit news and programs in the three dialects of the Tamazight language. Observers and ordinary people are afraid that "political Tamazight" may lead to dividing the country or cause a civil conflict between Arabs and Tamazights. However, Tamazight activists deny that Morocco's unity will be endangered.
There is a secular trend inside the Tamazight movement that wants to establish a national project on a par with the Arab national project, considering its referentiality the international agreements. This created a state of ambiguity among people and contradiction between Islam and Tamazight.

They are the prisoners who were liberated from Al Khiyam Jail. They have become fed up with their deteriorating living conditions, as they receive no attention from the State or any of its bodies.

The Culture Minister's call for teaching sex in Egyptian schools has raised quite a row in the circles of experts, specialists and psychiatrists, who welcome the invitation but on conditions.
The difference here lies in the level at which we should present the different kinds of information to the different age groups."
Dr Hatim Shalabi, Assistant Professor of Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, said, "I do not approve of the calls for teaching sex in our schools. This does not mean that I am a stand-in-the-mud or backward person. I only believe that this sort of subject should be discussed in its appropriate place, because its private nature precludes its discussion in public.
If sex is taught like the other subjects, it will have adverse effects and involve provocative and exciting expressions that may lead to undesirable consequences."

The peace process indicators seem to be far from promising, for the time being. In this respect Al-Baz sees that Barak's hesitation and policy contributed to crystallizing an atmosphere biased to Sharon, an extremist.
HAH Al-Ahram, Al-Arabi, 10/2/2001
In the meantime, we find the Arab countries incapable of imposing an effective boycott on Israel or providing effective anti-aircraft defence in South Lebanon, or helping the legitimate Palestinian resistance in occupied Palestine with arms and technical expertise.
Dr. Refaat Sayyed Ahmed, head of Java Centre for Strategic Studies opines that the Israeli society is one block without any difference between leftists and rightists or between Sharon and Barak. Consequently, Sharon's call for a national unity doesn't mean that there will be war because we are already in war with the Zionist entity. This is due to the fact that the ongoing daily atrocities against Palestinians in the occupied territories are an actual war, but in a new form under the guise of peace, to the extent that the victims of peace exceed those of war.

AL-FIQI: KING FAROUK WAS VERY PATRIOTIC!

The statement issued by 30 Catholic Church leaders who met recently in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi describing the war in South Sudan as, "tragic and immoral". There have been various reactions in government milieus and the opposition ranging from supporting to contending.
The clergy statement that carried the signature of father Michel Astra stressed that "war in the south had lost sight of its aims and therefore turned into war for war's sake, where combatants ignored the fact that those aims could be achieved through different means, excluding war.
A political analyst close to decision-making circles said, "The clergy's statement undermines the effort of Western powers as it admits to the fact that the South (liberated areas) had turned into ruins and can by no means considered a development model as they are areas dominated by murder, looting, bloodshed and human disasters.
This ruling was pronounced by the court headed by Justice Abdullah Aboul-Ezz, deputy chairman of State Council.
We cannot object, in principle, to the funny statements that some of our Cabinet members let fly from time to time, because these statements have a social function: they put smiles on the lips of millions of people who have forgotten how to smile in the midst of their ferocious daily struggle for survival.
Lawsuits that are tried by courts and publicized in the press always end with prison sentences for owners of printing houses who issued cheques to ink and paper suppliers, only to have their cheques bounced by their banks because the Ministry of Education failed to make the promised payments on the textbook bills.

Q: How do you assess the recent smashing victory of the Muslim Brotherhood in the recent Bar Association elections?
Q: But there have been some claims that the elections were held under a secret deal between the government and the Muslim Brotherhood, what do you say to that?
A: I think that you had better take this question to the government. However, I hope that the government would turn over a new leaf and behave similarly in all other elections towards all trends, not only the Muslim Brotherhood. I hope that this will be the government's conduct and pledged attitude towards the Egyptian people from now on and that all elections will be held in an atmosphere of fairness and integrity.
Q: Am I to understand from your words that the Muslim Brotherhood had to flirt with all the political trends to insure control over the Bar Association?
A: I believe that the authorities should change their policy towards the Muslim Brotherhood.
A: So long as the chairman was elected by the majority of voters, we have to respect that, and the Bar Association Council members have to respect it, too, because this is the will of the voters. The Bar Association Council members must deal with the chairman in a civilized way and within a context of fine manners and spare the Bar Association a recurrence of what occurred there in the past years.
Our presence in the People's Assembly and the Bar Association has come through elections. This means that the people want and support us.

EGYPTIAN STRATEGY FOR ATTRACTING EUROPEAN INVESTMENTS
In terms of figures, the Arab and foreign contributions accumulated in non-oil direct investments amounted to LE31386 million up till last June. The European Union countries quota stood at around 26% of the total investments.
The foreign investments issue has become a matter of interest in all Egyptian milieus and fora. The National Democratic Party Economic Committee prepared a coverall study on foreign investments in Egypt. The study stressed the necessity of encouraging this kind of direct investments to withstand strong competition from Eastern European countries and other nascent markets for such investments.
Thus, the situation points out that Egypt needs to create 900,000 job opportunities per annum and show growth rate of 6% annually, which requires providing LE70 billion investments though the available local savings do not exceed LE45 billion. To make up for the difference, foreign direct investments must be attracted. There is an important point cited by the Economic Cooperation and Development Organization of the World Bank in its recently prepared report. The report underlined that Egypt restored its vigour for attracting foreign capital last year after it had suffered a sharp decline in foreign direct investment flows in 1999 compared with most of the nineties.
France, Britain, Italy, Germany, Ireland, Spain, and Luxembourg came first. A part from the European companies, the issued capital of companies operating in Egypt reached LE126 billion up till December 2000. Such capital is of 10,000 investment companies set up under the investment law.

Danish investments in Egypt are not up to the required level, uncovered an economic report compiled by the Ministry of Economy with the participation of the Trade Representation Body.

Second: lack of regular meetings between senior officials and businessmen organizations in the two countries.
The report ascribed the increase of Egyptian imports from Denmark from 1281 million krone in 2000 against 1260 million krone in 1999 to the joint giant projects between Egypt and Denmark, especially the projects of producing gray and white cement in Sinai at investments of 2 billion Danish krone, joint project for prospecting for petrol in Egypt between AP Mallor company and the General Petroleum Corporation, and a project for setting up a basin for ships harbour in port Foad area.

Stalov's institute accuses Egypt of not playing the role that assists the American one in the peace process, as being a bridge between the Arabs and the Jews.
BIG SPLIT IN ALGERIAN SALVATION FRONT
In a statement to Al-Ahram Al-Arabi, Bukhamkham added that if they wanted to set up a political party, they could go ahead. But, it was quite unacceptable that they would hold a conference in the name of the Front without its approval. "We will not recognize its legitimacy" he pointed out, underlining that initiative had suspicious aims behind it. Such aims are mainly meant to implant more disruption and splits among the Islamic Salvation Front.
A conference, held by Cairo University Teaching Staff Club, decided to stop all forms of scientific cooperation with the Jewish universities and extend all forms of political and material support to the steadfast Palestinian people.

Dr. Wasel went on to say that the Palestinian uprising in all its forms, is a sort of legitimate struggle against the usurper and a kind of self-defence rather than a guerilla war. He emphasized that he rejected dialogue with Jewish rabbis as they permitted the killing of Palestinians and expelling them from their lands. They, furthermore, have desecrated holy Jerusalem.
Addressing the 13th Islamic Conference, Pope Shenouda the third, Pope of Alexandria and Saint Mark Episcopate Patriarch, who has always participated in that conference every year, said that the message of the conference was to produce a unanimously agreed upon approach that would enlighten the way for all believers in God.
The fundamentals of Quran, he added, lie in exegesis, the Prophet's Tradition and jurisprudence.
Only erudite scholars should rise to the responsibility of settling such matters, he said.
Israel's invasion of Sinai in October 1956 was not the sole indicator of Israel's ambitions in Sinai. Rather, there were other pieces of evidence of these ambitions, even before the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, as these ambitions are linked to the Zionist ideology, which calls for the establishment of Greater Israel from the Nile to the Euphrates. The ruling far-right extremist Likud Party in Israel hopes to realize this slogan. As for the Labor Party, whose leaders claim that they are advocates of peace, its late leader Yitzhak Rabin stood one day, saying: "If the Likud Party asks for and seeks to establish Greater Israel from the Nile to the Euphrates, the Labor Party, however, seeks to establish Greater Israel from the Ocean to the Gulf."
The successive Israeli governments, in addition to the international Jewish agencies and the Zionist lobby in the US have been pressurizing the American administrations and Congress to, in turn, pressurize Egypt to intensify its economic cooperation with Israel and set up joint ventures in Sinai on the pretext that Egypt would benefit from Israel's expertise in implementing agricultural projects in Sinai!
Here rises the importance of fortifying and defending Sinai through merging the development projects in Sinai with the plans of defense, provided that these projects would serve the plans.
AM/ Al-Ahram Al-Arabi, 2/6/2001
One side of the truth is hellish, no doubt, while the other side is heroic and too much emphasis on the hellish aspect of it may infiltrate into us a feeling of agony combined with frustration and degradation. Focussing on heroism, on the other hand, would invest us with confidence and dignity reviving our hopes in the future.
The Palestinians stood the test and seemed about to demolish Sharon's legend rather than letting their will be broken by him.
MS/ Al-Ahram, 5/6/2001
This time, we wake up at the Israeli challenging tone of escalation, which is being voiced by Israeli leaders on every occasion. We also wake up at the true intentions of this society of colonization that relies on aggression and plans to swallow more plots of land and expel more inhabitants, as if the previous wars (since 1948) were only "exercises" for the decisive battle for which Israel is preparing today.
Egypt should be able to face this challenge with all its dimensions.
WAR OR PEACE?
We do not object to the use of Arab military force against Israel, provided that this decision is made by the peoples, not the governments.
-		When the peoples take the decision of war as the sole alternative they have, questions will be raised: Who will fight Israel this time?
The answer to these questions is found in President Mubarak's warning to the Israelis, who threaten to use military force against the Arabs. President Mubarak asserted that "the June 1967 War would not be repeated again."
The coming war, if agreed upon, should be a comprehensive Arab war, planned by a military command in which all Arab armies are represented. Moreover, all kings, presidents, emirs and heads of states should sign the decision of starting the battle after ratifying its plans, operations and targets in order to endure its consequences.
A number of the People's Assembly (PA) members tabled a motion to amend the bill on allowing the Finance Minister to issue sovereign dollar bonds for Egypt on the Egyptian, Arab and international capital markets within the vicinity of $2 billion.

The report said investigations, made by the European Commission into a dumping lawsuit against Egyptian urea exports, ended in favor of the Egyptian urea-exporting companies. Investigations said there are no justifications for imposing initial dumping charges against the Egyptian urea exports in light of pieces of evidence submitted by the Egyptian side to prove that the European markets were not dumped with Egyptian urea nor was the European industry harmed with it.
The Food Industry Chamber said the gap between production and consumption went down from 844 thousand tons in 1997 to 837 thousand tons in 1999 and 710 tons in 2000.

UMRAH JOURNEYS CANCELLED

The Rice Crop:
The Russian market slipped out of Egyptian exporters' hands due to their rashness, disharmony with the latest developments in Russia and non-provision of products that match Russian tastes. This led to a retreat in the value of Egyptian exports to Russia from $400 million to $5 million only.
The Russian market is a consumption-oriented one and its individuals have a big purchasing power, says Sheta, pointing out that the number of dealers on this market amounts to 280 million people. They used to accept the prices, even if they were high or even if the commodities were of low quality. After a period of change from Communism to free economy, Russian economy started to develop quickly on par with the Western economy, he says.
Besides, agreements binding on the Russian importer were no more concluded. Moreover, the imported companies have diversified and most of them have become private sector.
Ali Essa, Undersecretary of the Exporters' Division at the Chambers of Commerce Federation, is of the view that the main reason for losing the Russian market lies in its instability. Moreover, there are non-commercial factors that impact on this market, represented in non-guaranteed systems of monetary payment and non-guaranteed revenues of exports.
Redallah Helmi, Chairman of the Sharqia Chamber of Commerce, says the conditions of the Russian markets have changed when compared to the pre- economic liberalization period. In the past, the market was closed and directed according to the government's instructions.

This second view is being adopted by Egypt at present.

He went on to say that there were six Arab countries that contracted to import potatoes. They are Lebanon, Kuwait, Oman Sultanate, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The total potato exports shipped to those Arab countries reached 26,000 tons, he noted.

In the midst of a state of tension the like of which has not been witnessed by the Middle East since the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, an unrelenting military escalation by Israel and rising fears of an all-out war, the Arabs, who read in their papers almost everyday about arms deliveries that join the Israeli arsenal, ask themselves: Where do we Arabs stand in all this?
And, is there military cooperation and coordination among Arab States in anticipation of a battle that may be imposed on them?
The Arab air forces have Mirage-2000, Sukhoi and MiG-29 platforms. The number of F-15 and F-16 fighters in the Arab inventory is over 360, and is even higher than the number of aircraft of these two specific types in the Israeli Air Force by 25, although the F-15's and F- 16's of the Israelis are superior to their counterpart Arab platforms in armament and electronic warfare systems.
The Arab submarine force comprises 13 units, most of which are Chinese Romeos and Russian Kilos, while the Israelis have only 6 submarines.
As for short and medium-range surface-to-surface ballistic missiles, Arab States possess 127 Scud launchers that were produced by Russia and North Korea, including Scud-B's with a range of 450 km and Scud-C's, whose range is 650 km. Israel, on the other hand, has 50 launchers that can fire Jericho-1 missiles with a range of 500 km and Jericho-2 missile with a 1,500-km range.
Strategic experts believe that this inventory of chemical weapons, which comprises bombs and missile warheads, creates some sort of balance in strategic deterrence between Arab States and Israel, given Israel's small area and the extensive combined area of Arab countries, as well as the close clustering of Israeli objectives and population centres together as compared to their counterparts in Israel's Arab neighbours and the fact that Israel's ability to take human losses is nowhere close to that of the Arabs.

AM/ Al-Alam Al-Islami, a weekly newspaper, 8/6/2001
However, it does not make sense that Powell would ask Arafat to arrest "those who might plan," Apart from any other argument, the Secretary of State should be asked who would carry the arrest operations and where they would be imprisoned after the Israeli government had destroyed the Palestinian Police stations and prisons and killed their personnel with the most modern American weapons amidst categorical American silence?
Does not this mean that the coming Palestinian generations would be real refugees and terrorists that would be wanted by their national authority under an American report generated by an Israeli complaint?

The official, who declined to identify himself expressed Egyptian authorities' satisfaction with Khatami's reformist view, adding that the Iranian President would now carry on with his reform policies, improving Iranian relations with the countries of the world, especially the Arab world.

But, in terms of geographical distribution 68% belonged to Gaza Strip, 31% to the West Bank and 1% to eastern Jerusalem.
It can be said that the phenomenon of martyrs in the Arab World had an Islamic character, and emerged for the first time in Afghanistan, even though a bit different from that of Palestine and appeared later in Lebanon and went afterwards to Palestine.
Regarding the first point, frustration, despair and poverty along with the other drives to martyrdom operations cannot provide a cogent explanation.
The majority of the members of Hamas who constituted the largest number of martyrs as well as those of Jihad belonged to the middle class. The story of destitution and abject poverty is not quite apparent in the Palestinian territories.
An Arab proverb had it that "a family man tends to be timid and careful about his money."
In 1996, some Hamas sources said that more than 250 young men asked to be put on the martyrs' list while girls complained about their exclusion from that type of action.
Some would be right if they saw a relation between the operations and the settlement process from the angle of the strength of the authority contradictory action.

RETREAT IN POPULATION GROWTH THREATENS DEVELOPMENT IN TUNISIA
The number of Tunisians will not exceed ten millions except in 2005 or 2006.

The earthquake caused by Alexandrian deputy Kamal Ahmed explored exciting developments after he had uncovered several blatant transgressions in the Egyptian bourse file. However, in defiance of its control duties, the People's Assembly refused to set up a committee to investigate into the interpellation content that comprised blatant corruption cases. This caused a state of popular rage against the P.A. and its speakership that decided to skip the issue over and move to the next point in the agenda in response to a request filed by 22 deputies to close discussion.

There is occupation and there is resistance.
Hamas is not the only faction that announced the continuation of resistance as long as there is occupation.

When resistance was eased, the enemy denied our rights more.
Answer: On the contrary, the rate of the rich is bigger than that of the poor.
Question: In your capacity as a man of religion, do not you feel annoyed when these operations lead to the killing of civilians, as these operations are supposedly directed mainly to the occupation soldiers?

Ordinary workers, who depend on the falafel daily in one meal at least, disdain "lord Mac of falafel."

I do not think that the panting for bolstering the cease-fire and calming down the heated atmospheres between the Palestinians and Israelis is a sufficient price for the courageous uprising, that lasted for about eight months!
Some Arab capitals, concerned with this issue, hurried with one another to ease the Israeli reaction and recall American efforts to halt violence under the slogan of saving the Palestinian people from the Israeli revenge, although the move of Arab public opinion pointed to the opposite. Arab public opinion pointed to the fact that the "head" of the uprising, which became a victim, is more precious than a mere security agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis under American pressure and Arab temptation. Arab public opinion is, moreover, aware that the uprising is not a target in itself; rather it is a main weapon in a long battle.
Consequently, the agreements of Wye Plantation, Sharm Al-Sheikh, Taba, Hebron,etc. had fallen as well. US President George Bush did the same, when he announced that he would not abide by what his predecessor Clinton had reached.

In an express and articulate indication to the spying role played by the Israeli Academic Center in Cairo, six leading officials of the Israeli Intelligence Service were selected to chair the center.
According to Maj. Gen. Talaat Mossalem, a renowned strategic expert, the 20-year Egyptian-Israeli relations are enough for an Israeli lobby to exist in Egypt. This lobby may group anyone having interests with Israel.
According to a survey conducted by Abdel-Wahaab al-Messiri on Zionism and Zionists, Israel is now seeking to play a new functional role to penetrate the Arab world, in cooperation with some Arab intellectuals and politicians, in a bid to internationalize the region and make it integrate in the global market and new world order.

AK/ Asharq Al-Awsat, 16/6/2001
Anyway, what happened in Egypt last week (the involvement of the Egyptian minister of finance in corruption cases), occurred in several Arab nations. A couple of weeks back, former Kuwaiti minister of finance Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sobah was censured and attacked by the National Assembly (Kuwaiti parliament) for getting involved in major financial violations when he was in office. Kuwait's incumbent Minister of Finance Youssef al-Ibrahimi was also bitingly criticized by the National Assembly for not referring the former minister to the Public Prosecution. Therefore, the Kuwaiti parliament declined to approve the draft budget of the General Investment Authority which runs over 60 billion US dollars of Kuwaiti investments abroad.
In Sudan, the dossier of corruption, which was ordered by Sudanese President Omar Bashir to be opened, is still heeded by public opinion, which is interested in the dispute between former minister of finance Mohamed Khair al-Zobair and minister of state at the Ministry of Justice Amin Banani, who is in charge of this dossier. Al-Zobair completely denied charges of remissness and covering up for the Central Bank, which, for its part, was remiss to give necessary information.
Foremost among these indicators is the one that this incessant war reached a stage that it has not reached before. The rebels under John Garang, overtly raise the weapon of secession and try to achieve this goal through controlling as much plots of land as possible.
The Sudanese government with its modest capabilities cannot endure the daily financial bleeding of the battles, which amounts to $2 million, especially as the rebels easily get financial and military aid from many forces, foremost among which is the sole superpower in the world. The situation is too serious. The Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) announced that by its control over the Raga City, west of Bahr Al-Ghazal, it would be dominating Sudan's international borders except those with Egypt and Ethiopia. It also announced that for the first time since its establishment in 1983 it has reached the area of Bahr Al-Ghazal, after its activities had been confined to the area adjacent to Ugandan borders.
Egyptian real estate market is going through a serious stage due to a rise in recession rate combined with a decline in sales in spite of a 25% decrease in prices.
Experts see the situation as illogical as housing cannot be left without an effective government cover. Housing interest rate subsidy may well have a strategic significance as it might help in overcoming some social problems like Urfi (unofficial marriage) marriage and the suspension of marriage consummation due to difficulty in finding a flat.
The law aims at creating economic mechanisms for finacing real estate mortgaging through long-term installments. The government believes that it will give a boost to the market and encourage investment in building activities. Contenders think the law would help in marketing luxurious flats, especially on the Northern Coast, an attempt that had been made by housing companies, but with no effect owing to the liquidity shortage and the state of recession. This means that the law, though initiated for helping the poor, will essentially act on behalf of the rich and businessmen exclusively.
Since private sector housing companies entered for investing in the field of real estate, they have focussed their attention on posh flats in the new cities, thus bringing about abundance in luxurious units in contrast to further dearth in low-income units. About 21 posh housing projects are being carried out including 8132 villas and 21452 flats regardless of the State scheme of building 1.2 million housing units by 2002.

The modernization program, he added, should concentrate on three basic elements. First, the Egyptian industry attainment of a competitive edge through controlling costs. Second, achievement of sufficient production for every industry. Third, increasing the technological component in every productive unit via purchasing, transferring, development and invention as the technological component is important for achieving the competitive edge, reducing cost and offering developed commodity.
It should be admitted here that the share of industrialization is on the increase as it preceded the growth of agriculture and other sectors.
As for the role of the European Partnership in modernizing the Egyptian industry, Khamis said the European Union is one of the government supporters in achieving the aims of the industry modernization as it extended LE 1 billion grant (250 million euros) in order to offer help for the modernization program as a first stage.

EGYPTIAN EXPORTS TO NORWAY DOUBLED
"The Norwegian market is one where packing and wrapping materials have a high importance. This is what Egyptian exporters must pay attention to. Norway follows a system of 'advantages,' which exempts some of the products of developing countries from customs duties. Egypt can benefit from this system, which does not apply to garments and fabrics, as these products are subject to some customs duties, he said.
The coming meeting in October is expected to witness the proclamation of an Egyptian- Norwegian business council."
Studies, made by the Bank annually and covering several world regions, said Egypt is one of the promising countries where investment rates grow annually, said the report. There is a big chance for funds, which went out of Southeast Asian markets following the crisis to which they were exposed years ago, to return to the international investment markets anew, said the report, adding that a number of African and Arab states, foremost among which is Egypt, are considered fund-attractive zones.
The agreement was signed at the wrapping up of the Egyptian-Kazakh Joint Committee meetings held in Kazakhstan on June 24.
Trade volume between the two countries is still small notwithstanding a favorable development in Egyptian exports, he added.
The Ministry of Economy warned against "Trovy" radioactive watches assembled in Hong Kong.
AFTER AL-NABAA EVENTS, SEX AND EXCITEMENT RETREAT IN INDEPENDENT PRESS!

Iranian diplomatic sources in Cairo told Asharq Al-Awsat that the inauguration of such a portrait in ceremony held in Serry city North Tehran, last Sunday is of no big value. The ceremony was attended by about 80 persons mostly members of an unknown Iranian group which claims to belong to Imam Ali Bin Abi Taleb.
Khesru Shahi, the Iranian charge d'affaires in Cairo, seems to feel very embarrassed about the recent step launched by the Iranian Ali Followers group, which is unknown in Iran and which is widely known in Cairo to be a façade for the hard line trend that opposes a resumption of normal bilateral relations between Cairo and Tehran.
It even comes ninth on the international level. Surprisingly, the Sudanese lands are planted with mines. According to a national seminar on combatting mines in the Sudanese territories held in Khartoum on 18th June, there are 500 thousand to two million mines in the Sudanese lands claiming 70 thousand victims, while the area, affected by mines are estimated at third of Sudan's area.
In a paper on the social and environmental effects of mines in East Sudan, Dr. Hussein Al-Ebeid pointed out that the district was heavily mined when conflict moved to East Sudan adding that the Ethiopian and Eritrean war, whose theatre of operations covered some parts of Kasla province in East Sudan, claimed a high number of casualties (327), 92% of whom are civilians. The dead hit 242. Ninety two percent of the blasts aimed at means of transport. Seventy nine percent of the victims were men and 4% were children under the age of ten.
KUWAITIS AND IRAQIS SUE SADDAM AND HIS COUSIN IN BELGIUM!
M.S. Asharq Al-Awsat, 26/6/2001
This is an impression that goes against reality and ignores accurate historical proof. Copts have been brothers and sisters to Arabs since Prophet Mohammad married Maria, the Copt who came from Upper Egypt as a gift from the then governor of Egypt. Moreover, the literature of Islamic civilization contains a clear call for an Arab protection of Copts that reached its zenith in the Prophet's Tradition, in which he said, "Treat Egypt's Copts well." This continued as the Arabs of the Arabian Peninsula became enthralled by the ancient Egyptian civilization at the time of Islamic conquest of Egypt.
Pope Shinouda, Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of Saint Mark Episcopate and spiritual leader of all Egyptian Copts, represents another stanchion of the Copts' view of their Arab identity from his distinguished clerical position. He appears to have a stricter attitude than those of all other religious establishments towards the policies and practices of Israel in Jerusalem. It was Pope Shinouda that adopted a stand against allowing Copts to visit Jerusalem and practice their religious rites in the Anastasis Church. It was he who made the famous statement "Copts will not enter the holy city of Jerusalem unless they are accompanied by their Muslim brothers."
I may even add that Arab Christians have made other contributions. The Maronites, for instance, wrote early works that attracted attention to Arab heritage and served as a bridge between these Christian minorities on the one hand and their Arab Islamic cultures on the other.

In an item entitled "our money goes to our enemies," the paper said the Japanese Toyotas of "Afilon" make, whose number is increasing on the Iraqi streets, are basically imported by Kuwait, which re-exported them to Iraq through the United Arab Emirates.
The method of applying "stupid" sanctions on the Iraqi people witnessed paradoxes. Money allocated to an Iraqi citizen under the oil-for-food formula reached $115 yearly, while money earmarked for a dog used by the UN to detect mines in North Iraq amounted to $1414 annually. These dogs eat food imported from Europe.
"No country will be harmed," said the source, adding that all dams are not as giant as the High Dam in Egypt. Most dams in Ethiopia are small ones that are aimed at generating power. They will not affect the quota of Egypt or Sudan, said the source.

He pointed out that the trade balance was tipping in favour of Germany by about 2.6 billion DM while Egyptian exports to Germany reached 548.2 million DM, the German exports to Egypt hit about 3.1 billion DM.
He pointed out a growth in German investments in Egypt in 2000, with an increase of the projects to which Germany contributed to 148 against 145 in 1999. Total capital of those projects hit LE3 billion and 913 million at an investment cost of LE5 billion and 256 million, where the German contribution reached LE648 million.
The Egyptian parliamentarians, both Muslims and Copts, urged the government to stand against any US attempt to dispatch a probe commission to discuss relationship between the Muslims and Copts in the country following the crisis caused by the independent Al-Nabaa paper, in a bid to shun recurrence of "Al-Kosheh Case" scenario. Such commissions are not welcome here and any official or parliamentary US pressure in this respect should be resisted, the deputies said.

Egyptian imports' value amounted to about $47.15 billion in 1996, which subsequently rose to 5.04 and 5.9 billion dollars, a growth rate of 7.05% and 18.5% during 1997 and 1998 respectively. The imports' value then started to go down in 1999, as it reached $5.668 billion and $4.803 billion in 2000.
Moreover, information on trade facilities is being provided to exporters, such as banks, insurance and land, sea and air transport, and wrapping packaging as well as the data and information that exporters may need to snatch available export opportunities.

Hegazi added that Egypt came third on the list of countries that receive German financial and technical aid. The value of aid allocated to Egypt in 2000 within the framework of financial cooperation amounted to 110 million marks of which 21.2 million marks are non-refundable grants and the remaining sum is soft loans.
The report pointed out that a review of development in Egypt in the last two years reveals that the Egyptian economy has achieved a growth rate of about 6% annually, thus rising from 6.1% in 1998/1999 to 6.5% in 1999/2000. Half of the rise in gross domestic product came from commodity sectors (49.9%) and the second half from productive, social and sovereign services, which contributed about the third 32.4% in 1999/2000 and a little more than the sixth in the last year.
Regarding structural change in Egyptian economy structure, the report attached slightly more importance to commodity sectors than at the beginning of the 1990's when their contribution to the GDP rose by 2.20% at the end of the decade, thus reaching 49.4% compared with a previous 47.7%. The rise, however, is definitely attributed to the rise in oil rates, which consequently raised oil contribution from 3.7% in 1990/1991 to 6.1% in 1999/2000.
The report unfolded that the considerable rise in the size of deficit in trade balance which started to exacerbate at the beginning of the second half of the 1990's is only temporary and reflects a structural crisis in the Egyptian economy that is ascribed in the first place, to limited supply of export-oriented production which can also be attributed either to the smallness of domestic production surplus after meeting domestic consumption or to the lack of a competitive edge or poor quality of Egyptian products.

In the past weeks, the battle of Al-Ezz with the iron factories had an important dimension, as the Anti-Subsidy and Dumping Body failed in 13 months' time to prove a dumping case against the Ukrainian billet ore. This shook the position of Al-Ezz Company on the Bourse, especially as Hermes, on June 10, 2001, advised those who hold Al-Ezz's shares to sell them, as the price per share plummeted to LE2. 	Hermes' negative analysis of Al-Ezz was based on the point that the company took the risk and introduced new investments, although it suffers from tremendous debts, and faces sharp competition, high costs and strong possibilities that it may need financial restructuring.
Moreover, the company's sales nosedived by 10% in 2000, as the price per ton of reinforcing iron increased from LE1020 to LE1088.
If a decision is issued whereby dumping or preventive charges are imposed on the billet ore, the local factories will close down their doors because they will be unable to buy billet at its international prices to which the dumping charges are added.

In this context, the experiment of Hizbullah in South Lebanon should be recalled to minds. Hizbullah fought occupation incessantly during the past years, though it was aware that it would gain nothing from its war and victory, except presence in terms of ideology, (Islamic) call and morals in the hearts of the Lebanese people and the nation in its entirety. Hizbullah was aware that at the end it would return to its previous positions; i.e. it would get nothing from the political cake except a limited quota, which it could have obtained easily through charitable acts and without bloodshed and martyrs.
They did not think one day that they would compete with the organized leadership over power due to several considerations, especially as the course of settlement had become clear after Oslo.
The Islamists do not believe that demonstrations alone can liberate lands, dismantle settlements or expel occupation forces only because they are the form that is much accepted by world public opinion.
The Israeli side is aware of this equation. Therefore, its moves in their entirety concentrate on regaining the security essence of Oslo, represented in assigning the task of suppressing resistance to the PNA without paying the required price. Israel, at the same time, wants to establish an independent state on the territories occupied in 1967, whose capital is Jerusalem.
The second is linked to the return to the old bad conditions of the Islamists-PNA relations under which the PNA detained and chased the men of resistance to abort their Jihad actions. This second angle may split the Palestinian ranks and mar the atmospheres of optimism, prevailing since the end of September last.

Egyptian diplomatic sources told Asharq Al-Awsat that Tehran is not serious in speaking about the efforts aiming at improving its relations with Cairo. The sources lashed out anew at what they described as the non-understandable silence kept by Iranian authorities when some hard- liners inaugurated the mural of Al-Islambouli although it well realizes that this will negatively affect its relation with Cairo. A prominent Egyptian official told Asharq Al-Awsat that the Egyptian authorities were about to take an unannounced decision freezing efforts aiming at enhancing relation with Iran until further notice so as to preclude any Iranian speculations over this relation during the period to come.

9 NEW CHURCHES ARE LICENCED
WILL CHRISTIAN VIOLENCE LEAVE THE BOTTLE!
Since the Copts have experienced the demonstration means and realised how effective it is, I expect further demonstration either against the State or the Church in order to get more gains for the Copts if Coptic issues went on without solutions!
Therefore I, unfortunately think that a relapse may be lying ahead together with a retreat in the march towards national unity and citizenship. Every effort of all national forces is, therefore, badly needed to deal with the issue.
The demonstrations may serve as an alarm sounded to the Church so that its caring religious role may be restored. No slogans in support of Pope Shenouda were chanted, thus perhaps implying a degree of pent up anger with the Pope.
Al-Arabi, 1/7/2001
Quoting the commander of the air forces in the Israeli army, the sources indicated that any activity launched against the Israeli army on the northern borders, would cause severe retaliation against those who have influence in Lebanon.

Information indicates that subscriptions by companies that are supervised by Jewish businessmen exceed $300 million at present and are expected to go over the $500 million in the subsequent bond offers.
Political sources in Islamabad that were interviewed by Al Wasat believe that Southeast Asia is currently going through a remarkable strategic change, as evidenced by the feverish stockpiling of weapons by ambitious powers in that part of the world. It appears that there exists a worldwide agreement on supporting India's efforts for beefing up its military capabilities, as India is now able to import arms from the United States, Israel and Russia.
This boost of relations has resulted, as some reports have claimed, in New Delhi's acquisition of the technology for the Israeli Arrow missile, which is another milestone in relations that is similar to India's acquisition of nuclear technology in 1962.
Where the Arab-Israeli conflict is concerned, more than one Arab country have expressed fear of the Indian-Israeli alliance, particularly as this pact brings to mind the old Israeli policy of building a fence around outlying Arab countries.

ME/ Al-Osboa, 2/7/2001
The amendments to the law on practicing political rights include a ban on running in People's Assembly elections by candidates of dual nationality. The amended law will stipulate that a candidate with a dual nationality should first waive his foreign citizenship before being allowed to run in the elections for parliament membership.
The amendments will, however, preserve the gains afforded to Egyptian political life by the presidential decree that stipulated judicial supervision of all the stages of the electoral process. Oversight of elections will be assigned to the Supreme Judicial Council, while the Ministry of Justice will have nothing to do with elections and the role of the Ministry of Interior will be restricted to administration and preservation of law and order during elections, without interference in the electoral process, so as to insure neutrality towards all candidates and protection of voters. The amendments of the political rights law will also include hiking the fine payable by voters who fail to cast their votes in elections, so as to make citizens shed their passive attitude. The recent elections revealed a very low percentage of participation by voters, which ranged between 2% in Cairo and 20% in some other governorates.
The amended law on the People's Assembly will define the characteristics of a member of the farmers and workers category, so as to narrow them down to a more specific description that will eliminate the shortcomings of the current categorization, which were the downfall of many deputies, the most famous of whom was Manpower Minister Ahmad Al Amawi, who went against the court ruling describing him as a member of the professionals category and ran in the elections as a worker.

BIRTH OF NEW PALESTINIAN ORGANIZATION
Undoubtedly, the terrorism of the Israeli military machine exceeded all limits regarding violence, oppression and humiliation. It killed children, women, old people and men, pulled down houses and cut off trees. However, this terrorism unified the Palestinians, deepened the concept of collective resistance, and unified the hands that throw stones at occupation forces.

The Yahud explosion is not mere retaliation, nor is it an assertion of the fragile cease-fire claimed by Israel, failure of American mediation that appointed Sharon the decider of the start of political moves in the region, and melting of the "the frozenness period" mentioned in Mitchell's report. Rather, this explosion is an announcement of the birth of "the national and Islamic forces" organization to liberate Palestine. Moreover, this explosion is an assertion that the Palestinian uprising succeeded in ending all organizational differences among the resistance factions and their unity vis-à-vis the Israeli occupation. This explosion succeeded in taking these factions out of the stage of slogans to that of Jihad.

The activities of Muslim Brotherhood members during this session, in which the Brotherhood representatives were in the limelight, were subject to much controversy, agreement, difference and even denouncement in some cases, as a result of the proposals they made and the issues they raised under the dome of the People's Assembly.
However, observers believe that there are two aspects that made themselves felt in the performance of the Muslim Brotherhood representatives. The first is their keenness on pacifying the government and avoiding involvement in battles with it in the Assembly, so as to ease the pressure on the Muslim Brotherhood, while the second was that of the 500 motions made by these representatives, only 3 were interpellations, despite the fact that an interpellation is the strongest and most urgent motion in the People's Assembly, and the majority of their motions was restricted to quests for notification, questions and proposals.

EGYPTIAN CERAMIC TILES TO JAPANESE UNDERGROUND
FIRST EXPORT PROJECT UNDER FREE ZONES SYSTEM APPROVED
The new statute of operation in the free zones which is currently being prepared by the Authority in association with the Customs Department and the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade would lead to more flexibility that would enable free zones to be engaged in many activities especially those related to the export-oriented fields to foreign markets, he concluded.

Howeida Taha, a female writer from Egypt, writes: There is a similarity between Egypt and Iran, as both countries are two regional powers in the Middle East and have historical roots.
The majority of both peoples embraced Islam, despite difference in doctrines. What is important in the Iranian experiment in the post- revolution era or the era of moving from the Revolution to the State is the weight of young men, who were annoyed of the religious discourse that wants to impose itself on all walks of life. We all remember how young men were delighted and showed support for Khatami in his first electoral campaign when he said in a rally: "my wife goes to the cinema."
On the contrary, Egypt's youths are chained with emergency laws, the security bodies that protect "the seniors," and the influence of their homeland's long history that compels them to content themselves with "destiny."
They did not raise their dreams on the arena without a leadership that represented their will. They did not take to the street like the riffraff. Rather, they gathered consciously around those who expressed them honestly and without deception. Despite suppression and oppression, from which the Egyptian people suffered, their long history is full of those who rejected such surrender and became aware that "passive resistance" by which the Egyptians are characterized is useless in modern history.

ELIMINATION OF EGYPT'S OIL INDUSTRY!
Second Trick: 	The PA was deceived in 1994 when it approved the increase of the price of Egypt's purchases of gas from foreigners. They linked the price of gas bought by Egypt to that of the British Brent. Thus, the price with which Egypt buys gas from foreigners is higher than that on international markets.
Third Trick: 	The PA was also deceived in 1994 again. It approved the extension of oil agreements with the Italian International Company for Egyptian Oil and the American AMECO for twenty years, due to end in 2020. These agreements may also be extended up to the year 2030, although some of them were due to end in 1994, 1995 and 1998. This extension means that Egypt's constant right that the property of these two companies will be transferred to it will be totally rescinded, although it paid the price of such property out of crude oil. This extension also repeals Egypt's right to possess the remaining crude oil in the ground following the end of these agreements.

Many a treatise have already dealt with this point including a very important one by the late, Ibrahim Shehata who, in his My Will to My Homeland said: "The Constitutional provision that the State has a religion is a bit ambiguous simply because the State is an artificial entity that observes the rules of no religious rites and cannot be brought to book for defaulting on any religious duties. He, therefore, thinks it apter to have a provision making it clear that the dominant religion is Islam whose adherents are in the majority, while the rest of the Egyptians adhere to a different creed, with both creeds adherents enjoying the same constitutional immunities and rights, so much so that any assault against either will be considered an assault of religions that requires judicial investigation.

Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade, Youssef Boutros Ghali and Djibouti President's Advisor on Investment Affairs, Fahmi Al-Hag who is now visiting Cairo, discussed bilateral commercial relations and how they could be developed.
Sharp debate has been dominating the economic milieus since Prime Minister Dr. Atef Ebeid announced early this year that there was a national plan to solve the unemployment problem, which aims at providing one million jobs annually in all governorates. Within the framework of this plan, the government committed itself to providing 150 thousand jobs, which were increased to 170 thousand jobs recently. This means that the private sector is entrusted with creating not less than 830 thousand jobs. According to an industrialist, the provision of such a number of jobs by the private sector needs a miracle. He said the volume of investments needed to provide stable and permanent jobs for such a number on a yearly basis hits LE70 billion.

ISRAEL TO SELL HOUSE OF EGYPT'S AMBASSADOR
Historic and traditional relations between Egypt and Russia should achieve more progress especially after President Mubarak's visit to Moscow and his successful meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Al-Baz says. On the other hand, Al-Baz urges Russia to re-play its important role in the Middle East. Russia should quickly grasp the importance of its role in the region as a sponsor of and participant in the peace process between the Arabs and Israel, he says. Russia should not leave the arena to the US to lead the peace process unilaterally, as this results in clear American bias in favor of Israel, he adds. Therefore, the major Arab countries like Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia should encourage the Russians to re-play their regional and international role to save international security and peace, he adds.
There is a remarkable tendency among Egyptian youth to abide by the Islamic tenets and injunctions while looking with disfavour on the style of life that reflects Western and secularist orientations.
At first sight, it may seem that such "Rewish" youths would, in the main, fall into a secularist westernized category, and follow the westernized style of life once they leave youth and "Al-Rawshana" behind. Such a view, nevertheless, may hold ground only in theory, which may even favour the idea, that such youth, having had their fill during their youth, might automatically experience a reverse in their outlook to tradition when they grow up.
This type of religious preacher is the only bridge between the religious and the "Rewish" categories of Egyptian male and female youths, who come in great numbers to listen to his sermons and with whom not only the mosque but also its vicinity become packed every Saturday afternoon.

Palestine or the Arab-Zionist conflict issue has always been on Arab agendas, but it is now entering a new turn or bend where it is converted from a land liberation cause into a cause of rights violations - a captured people, encompassed by Israeli high walls and borders and in the meantime subjected to torture, killing and displacement in such an unprecedented way that all aspects of life whether homes, factories, farms or even children crossing the street are simply hunted down by mental and political psychopaths.
For half a century, the Arab performance in Palestine has been an entire fiasco versus an Israeli steady success, thus turning the issue from one of liberation to one of complete violation of all rights, the rights of the country and the rights of the citizen on Palestinian lands.
The Israeli stratagem was not to face the Arabs "in toto" but to create bilateral tracks.
In other words, if Palestinian resistance operations continued unabated, if the negotiating table, as was the case in Vietnam and Algeria, was made use of in the thick of mutual deterrence and with Arab backing, if that had happened, the results would have been different.
Then, once again, as happened in the Gulf and oil countries, the international element, sector and action have become inevitable and Washington once more emerged with aims that ran parallel with those of Israel rather than the Arabs!

This means that a meeting does not rely on the goings-on at al-Aqsa Mosque and the occupied Palestinian territories or an extremist Jewish group's rebuilding of the alleged Temple Mount at al-Aqsa Mosque.
This is at the Jerusalem Committee level.
He may also want to say that contacts with Arab capitals on an AL summit were unfruitful and that even if it is held, what is it expected to do?
The Palestinians should realize the fact that they should depend on themselves in standing against the demolition of al-Aqsa Mosque and that the Arab governments and Arab incapacity institutions lost their credibility and thereupon their stay is unjustifiable.

SYRIA CHARGES ISRAEL WITH BURYING RADIOACTIVE WASTE IN THE GOLAN
The 40-page report cited an example of national sovereignty violations in Golan. The occupation authorities had brought in many mercenaries from the so-called South Lebanon Army led by Antoine Lahd after they, together with the Israeli occupation, were expelled from South Lebanon when they were confronted with heroic Lebanese resistance strikes. The occupation authorities also attempt to settle them in the Golan, which was categorically rejected by Golan inhabitants who issued a statement announcing that those agents were profaning "our Syrian Arab lands and therefore their presence in the Golan is utterly rejected."
Under the title "Policy of Organized Blackout, Cultural and Historical Distortions," the report dealt with the educational status since the Syrian Arab curricula had been cancelled immediately after the occupation. The current syllabi concentrate upon the texts that deal with tribal feuds and bigotry in addition to erotic poetry with disregard for great poets and men of letters." The names of cities have also been converted into Hebrew names.
The report said that Israeli factories keep on dumping toxic waste in several sites in Golan and the occupied West Bank where there are 50 sites where toxic waste are dumped.

One week ago, reporter Moussa Haal published a report in Akidati magazine which we nonchalantly received with silence and so far no comment or explanation has been made.

The message expressed Egypt's attitude towards the deteriorating conditions in the occupied territories because Israel assassinates and launches missiles at people haphazardly in the streets, and its forces infiltrate into areas affiliated to the Palestinian National Authority, said Maher.
Asked about the US stance, which opposes the dispatch of international observers to the occupied territories and linking it to the restoration of tranquility, Maher said: "We are of the view that the Israeli aggressive policies should be halted first, as these policies are the cause of the Palestinian reaction."
For Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher to describe the Israeli government as a 'gang that assassinates people' and violates all laws and norms, is a good stance. However, it is not enough because it is still confined to the domain of press statements, whose impact evaporates hours after their issuance.
We know the points not wanted by the Egyptian government. However, we don't know what it wants. Does the current deterioration in conditions suit it? Does it want such deterioration to last endlessly?
The others were compelled to do so. However, Egypt does not want to steer, nor does it want to turn right or left. Here lies the causes of the malady and the reasons for the state of humiliation undergone by the region and the nation as a whole.

Egyptian importers' reluctance to deal with Israeli companies came in solidarity with the Palestinian Intifada, the authority said. (Front page)
Neither could the Egyptian diplomacy devise an integrated Arab League backed strategy to confront Israel on the Arab level. Cairo and Amman summits, therefore, failed to produce anything more than general guidelines for resisting the imposition of an incomplete or unjust Israeli settlement in Palestine, and for extending limited material support to its people. Arab rulers also failed to adopt the option of escalation and continuation of the second Palestinian uprising and the resumption of Arab boycotting of Israel.
Even though Maher knows well the importance of an Egyptian- Sudanese integration for bolstering Egypt's overall capability, he, just like his predecessor Moussa, demonstrates slackness as far as the Nile Valley file is concerned whether that reflected on repressing the rebellion in Southern Sudan or energizing the Egyptian-Libyan initiative for Sudanese reconciliation or promoting Egyptian-Sudanese economic relations through free access of individuals, and capital as well as making free ownership a right to every Nile Valley citizen.

Meeting students of universities and higher institutes in Helwan, the minister said the agricultural sector achieved a leap in output.

Egypt achieved self-sufficiency in poultry and egg production, while piscine production skyrocketed from 200,000 tons to 650,000 tons, the minister added.

Among these demands are "sovereignty of law, respect of the Constitution, curbing states of emergency and canceling martial laws, hunting down corruption and lavishness, restricting interference of security bodies in everyday life, so that their work would be confined to matters that have to do with the security of the homeland."
He was the first to point to the role of security bodies as he suggested late last year that security bodies be amalgamated into one branch and high buildings be transferred to "IT institutes for educating this generation as President Bashar Assad wished."

The banks warned that the CBE rejection might urge those clients to buy dollars from the black market to repay the debts. If happened, speculations would return anew and the exchange rate would go up again, something that would pressurize the exchange companies.
Yesterday, a dispute erupted between banks and their clients who had got dollar loans due to the clients demand that part of the compensations that would be obtained by the banks from the Central Bank of Egypt next week be given to them in compensation for the losses they incurred due to the latest jump of the exchange rate, which rose over 30 piasters per dollar in banks.

He expected even more tranquility and stability in the coming period. "This can be taken as an indicator of Egyptian economy improvement", he said.
Mohamed Abu Al-Hadid of Al-Gomhouria writes an article, which runs to the following effect:
But before that, I want to understand.
2-	Hiking the dollar's exchange rate means depreciating the Egyptian pound.
This is true, but the question is: Why does the Egyptian pound know only one way, and that is down, and why has it never won back even an inch of the ground it has been losing?
5-	The Egyptian foreign exchange market is ruled by three governments: the Ebied government, the White government, as attributed to Mohammad Al Abyad (abyad stands for white in Arabic), Chairman of the Division of Exchange Companies in the Federation of Chambers of Commerce, and the Black government, and this is term of my own coining to refer to the black market where illegal trade in foreign currencies has thrived.
I am reminding those who are making such statements that their affirmations are identical to those we had heard and published for the people to read when the "new exchange system" was adopted last January to give the US dollar the momentum with which it went beyond the LE 4 mark by LE 0.20.

Abd Essattar Ashrah adds that the rise in exchange rates has nothing to do with the boosting of exports except as an account on paper only as we multiply the exports dollar figures by 425 piastres instead of 390 piastres for instance and the result would naturally go higher as an Egyptian pound figure. He denied that the decision would grant the Egyptian exports a better competitive position abroad as a considerable ratio of Egyptian products or rather 50% are imported and would be subjected to the new rate of exchange, thus raising their costs in Egyptian pounds.

A: We have no plans, not for the Bar Association elections or other elections, although we are among those who are extremely keen on insuring the independence and effectiveness of syndicate activities and supporting the role of syndicates. I would like to point out that the candidates themselves are the ones who consider the ways and means for their participation in syndicate elections; it is they who determine the interests of syndicate activities through their relations and communication with other syndicate members. If the syndicate members are the ones who undertake this effort, and if public interest is the goal sought by everybody, we do not think that there is anything that could provoke disagreements or cause rifts in the ranks of the Muslim Brotherhood, who are keen on serving public interest. Like their colleagues in the Bar Association, Engineers Syndicate members seek the interests of their syndicate and their fatherland, and we can do nothing for them or other syndicate members but to pray to Allah to grant them success and guide their steps.
What is your stand on the case? A: Egypt is a country that has values and ethics, and we support these values and ethics. We also support and advocate national unity.
Rulers are required to allow their peoples to express their anger and will with money and life; they must work for uniting Arab decisions and actions; they must put into effect the resolutions they adopted in the summit meetings they held in 2000 and 2001; they must revive the common defence agreement and prepare the nation for a decisive confrontation that will restore rights to their owners and liberate all the usurped land. Arab rulers must take a firm stand against the biased American policy, which publicly backs the Zionist entity. We believe that the Arab Nation has several tools and capabilities at its disposal that, used properly by rulers within the context of resolutions that embody the unity of ranks, objectives and goals of the Arabs, will guarantee the end of the enemy and the aggression. Allah says in the Holy Quran, "O ye who believe!

Regarding charging Shukry with conspiring in favor of the Zionist -American Alliance agents, the statement said this is a fake insult that does not deserve any response as it is an indicator of a mental deviation of those who are behind it as they know well its internal and external objectives and reactions.

Both parties have committed errors. The Arabs, however, did commit more errors than the Turkish did.

The higoumen said that no constitutional or legal provision of the Orthodox Copts' statute may ban the person, who obtained a final divorce ruling from the Personal Status Court, from getting married for the second time. Excitingly enough, the pontiff's decision came following a complaint lodged against Andraws with the attorney general of the Cairo Court of Appeal for clinching marriage contracts without any prior license from the patriarchate, pushing the pope to withdraw his "marriage book". In his pleadings, Andraws said that he was stripped of the priesthood for clinching marriage contracts without any prior permit from the religious head so such marriage contracts are not recognized by the church. The non-recognition, he maintained, is incompatible with the law no. 629 for 1955 as prior permit is not one of the marriage pillars or conditions of the marriage contract.

The Arabs: Political failure on
1)	The return of Arab masses to the reactions arena thus forming an Arab public opinion that reacted to Palestine and Iraq issues.
Apart form that, no Arab country did benefit by the modern concepts of security that had been developed in other regions of the world such as the exchange of military thoughts, the holding of regular or limited dialogues on common Arab borders, the exchange of visits and meetings between military dignitaries or giving them access to attending manoeuvres.
When it comes to the Arabs and their regional reactions, the report pointed out that conflict reactions still outweigh those of cooperation in the region. Items of security and politics still play the major role in denoting the directions of the strategic reactions in the region, even though it is the economy which plays that role in most other regions of the world.
The report sees that the prospects of defensive policies in the Middle East is largely linked to the nature of developments in the Arab Israeli peace process as well as the possibility to achieve greater stability in the Middle East.
Regarding the Egyptian political system, the report monitored three political reactions in the internal Egyptian political system, which made themselves evident in the parliamentary elections in 2000. They are as follows:
The report pointed out that Muslim Brotherhood who were once accused of going underground were the only trend compared with others, which tried to understand politics in the latest battle in its most up-to-date sense. The report links between the contestant's political platform and his local influence, social and service activity. The group's contestants were part of the most up-to-date and most organized political institution in Egypt. Some of them set their platform on the Internet and sent regular massages to their supporters through the mobile to keep abreast of the elections results and ensure them that they are with them in the election battle without having to dump Cairo streets with their ideological leaflets. It emphasized that they had an organization that succeeded in producing highly-organized cadres with efficient political talent.

Since Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon took over as such, he has been reluctant to discuss the final status issues - Jerusalem, refugees, settlements, borders, sovereignty and water. The ceiling of a Palestinian- Israeli settlement is determined by the so-called "phased-out long-term solution" based on Israel's withdrawal from at most 40 percent of the West Bank and annexing the remaining territories to Israel.
What is required is a fresh policy and strategy to arrive at a just and comprehensive political settlement based on the liberation of Palestinian and Arab territories, which were occupied by Israel in 1967.
The Arab governments are not articulately interested in this strategy, requiring parties, political forces and popular gatherings to move democratically so that their governments may change their position and take practical steps towards a new Arab strategy based on the use of all Arab strength cards. The launching point is that the Egyptian government should change their stances and scrap the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace agreement so that Egypt can defend its, and Arab, interests against the ongoing Israeli aggression on the Palestinians and the Arab nation.

In either case, allegiance to Egypt would be compromised as no Egyptian who truly cherishes his nationality would have his allegiance to his homeland shared by any other country whatsoever.

EGYPTIAN OPPOSITION PARTIES LOCKED IN CONCERN OVER FREEZE ON "WIFAQ"
The opposition parties reacted to the suspension decision by regarding that the CPP is a pro-government panel acting in line with sovereign decrees, shrugging off the party interests.

The CPP had turned down over 50 requests for founding fresh political parties, a thing which was deemed by observers a restriction of the party founding freedom.
The withdrawal of a small number of party members does not mean a dissension, he said, pointing out that Agroudi did so as he was not chosen as vice-chairman of the party in the recent public congress held by the party last month. The post was occupied by Hamoud Zaher instead.
Although he was selected, Agroudi objected to the decision. The decision was approved by the majority of the party members, while the Party Secretariat has not convened since June 2000. Agroudi said that he is one of the party's six co-founders, the secretary of the party's Arab Affairs Committee and a secretariat member. He further claimed that he was selected as party leader during the party public conference.

Spending on food differs from one family to another within the society's different classes. Studies and researches uncover that poor families spend such large portions of their income on food that the percentage of such expenditure hits 150% of their income.
Egyptians' expenditure on restaurants and hotels amounted to LE2.6 billion annually compared to LE6 billion spent on education annually, according to the latest statistics of the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics in its research on income, expenditure, and consumption for 1999/2000. Total expenditure of Egyptians on food and drink amounts to LE56 billion annually while they spend LE18.7 billion on housing and its requirements, LE12.8 billion on apparel, LE7.2 billion on transport and communications, LE3.1 billion on furniture and household appliances, and LE5.6 billion on culture and recreation.
Excerpts run to the following effect: Throughout the long history of the Arab-Israeli conflict and the confrontation between the Palestinians and the Hebrew State, the recent events stand out as unprecedented. Sharon's government has obviously embarked on a political agenda with clear-cut features, an agenda that has been carefully prepared with items ordered according to priorities. The agenda, to my mind, is based on three main points:
By this, Israel is trying to launch an extensive psychological campaign to strike terror and despair into the hearts of the Arabs first and the Palestinians next.
To my mind, and I hope I am not pessimistic, the current American Administration will not use its weight in the Middle East unless it is urged to do so by Israel, which is unlikely for the time being because Israel is so ravenous and eager to gobble the maximum gains available to it in extremely complicated and sensible circumstances, while the Arabs, on the other hand, fluctuate between "demonstrations" and "silence" though the Arab Street is obviously steaming with anger.
Out of my feelings of national responsibility, which we all share and due to the danger that threatens us without exception, I might venture into suggesting the following ideas in the form of three scenarios: 	First, the Arabs might concentrate on Middle Eastern efforts to stop Israeli daily violations. I do not mind Turkey playing a role here as an Islamic country with close historical relations with the Arabs on the one hand and undeniable military and strategic ties with Israel on the other hand.
Third, I just raise my hands from the very beginning, declaring my good intentions, as I call on all the Arabs to probe into the possibility of using "the Iraqi card" for pressuring the USA, whose current Administration has on various occasions announced linkage between the Iraqi question on the one side and the Arab-Israeli conflict on the other side. If the Arab countries decided to practically reject the siege on Iraq that has continued for over a decade on end, regardless of the various attitudes towards Iraq's policies and leaderships, we would address a strong message to Washington that would urge her to reconsider its passive policy and its absent responsibilities towards the goings-on in the occupied Palestinian lands.
It is only natural, therefore, that we should leave no stone unturned and put forward every possible initiative as it is beyond imaging that we should remain recipients contenting ourselves with changes of emotions on slogans without content.
The government has mastered the imposition of direct and indirect taxes on all categories of the Egyptian people, including taxes on income and even on the death certificate and "death declaration."
In light of the Stamp Tax Law no 11 for 1980, the concept of "government levying of taxes" expands and diversifies.

The value of fees, collected by the government according to the latest published statements, reached LE2.934 billion, while the value of extortions amounted to LE1.533 billion.
The government also imposes taxes on arable land, buildings, entertainment houses,etc.
Dr. Hazem Al-Beblawi, an economist, says apparently there is a new monetary issuance, and it seems that bank notes were printed. He points out that the covering of money issuance in Egypt is made through the issuance of bonds by the government, which it owes to the CBE. In return for these bonds, the CBE prints bank notes. Thus, the government will be using its right to the issuance of bonds, which the CBE keeps in return for the printing of bank notes.

According to Magdy Aref, the Fund Head, the rise in the costs of yarn and textiles production is a main factor that limited the textile industry capabilities to reduce its prices as required to be able to compete with its counterparts in other countries.
Egyptian economic sources warned that Egypt might lose its competitive status in the spinning and weaving industry, as the possibilities of success of the government's plan to restructure this industry plummeted.
In a statement to Al-Hayat, Minister of Public Enterprise Sector Mokhtar Khattab warned that the textile industries might lose their relative advantages.
Meanwhile, a study, jointly made by the Egyptian Industries Federation and the Chamber of Textile Industry, affirmed that about 50% of Egyptians wear imported ready- made clothes. This requires that materials used in this industry should be provided at competitive prices, customs on imported materials reduced to 5%, the sales tax canceled, and the government tax imposed on imported basic production requirements should be reduced to 10% instead of 18%.
In a memo to be referred to the Cabinet soon, the Ministry of Housing and Construction which is concerned with this matter considered that the implementation of the idea would give a big opportunity for directing more allocations to the deprived areas in addition to introducing the state-of-the-art technology and developed administrative systems.

In a first reaction by the plaintiff Dr. Abdel-Ahad Gamal Eddin, who lost the latest PA elections before Lakah, he branded the ruling as historic. "It sets decisive rules for nomination for PA membership. It also determined the impact of dual nationality on loyalty to the homeland, which is a national issue that should not be relinquished," he said.

When the Soviet Union collapsed, the fragile foundation of this bilateral formula was demolished, although the "bilateral sponsorship" structure remained standing in form while it was robbed of its content.
The pro-Israeli American attitude has even become more hard-lined because of the weakness of the Arabs, who have stopped fighting and supporting the resistance a long time ago and are even economizing on propaganda war but have yet to tire from chasing a mirage that is called mediation.

If the local spinneries' proposals are implemented, the total difference between the farmers' prices and the spinneries' will hit about LE100 million, of which LE40 million are related to Upper Egypt cotton, Al-Mussawar learned.
Strangely enough, at a time when Egyptian spinneries seek to depend on Egyptian cotton, as it is a national crop on which farmers depend, a study was issued last week by the Agricultural Policies Support Center, which is financed by the American Agency for Agricultural Development and is supervised by the Agriculture Ministry. The study says the Egyptian spinneries should rely on the importation of American and Greek cotton because the prices of Egyptian cotton are exaggerated.
Therefore, he urges the government to encourage local spinneries to use Egyptian cotton through shouldering price differences, as is the case in most world countries. This will also help local spinneries compete on world markets, he adds.

INVESTMENTS NOSE-DIVE
According to the forecasts of some economists, the sales tax may hike prices by 1.5-2%, thus affecting the annual growth rate of inflation. However, according to the report of the Cabinet's Information and Decision Support Centre, the annual growth rate of inflation went down to 2.2% by July 2001, against 2.5% in June 2000. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Dr Atef Ebeid announced that his cabinet had resorted to the application of the second and third phases of the sales tax, which applied only to the profits made by merchants, so as to finance the state budget deficit that was over LE 20 billion from real resources instead of resorting to the printing of more money - a practice that had resulted in sharp increases in the rate of inflation in the past.
These developments have impacted heavily on the securities market, where the total issued shares dropped from LE 31.38 billion during the period from January to July 2000 to LE 8.58 billion during the first seven months of this year, with a decrease of 72.7%. This nose-dive has impacted on both transactions and prices on the Stock Exchange, where the volume of transaction on Cairo and Alexandria exchanges during the January-July 2001 period was LE 11.463 billion, against LE 30.589 billion during the same period of 2000, with a drop of LE 19.096 billion at 62.42%. This steep decline led to a 17.11% drop in the general index of the Egyptian Capital Market Authority, as the index went down from 602.64 points in June to 585.53 points in July this year. This drop indicates that the prices of shares offered on Cairo and Alexandria stock exchanges have gone down to very low levels that may attract investors, but only if an infrastructure exists that can turn low prices into an element of attraction and give a big boost to transactions on the market to attract new investments. Therefore, Egyptian government officials believe that working for stabilizing the currency market and setting a flexible exchange rate for the Egyptian pound versus the US dollar may help attract investments to the Egyptian Stock Exchange anew.

An economic study made by the Cabinet's Information and Decision Support Centre warned that the public domestic debt was on a climbing curve that had become particularly sharp during the second half of 2000, rising by 7.2% during the period from October to December 2000. The study pointed out that financial policymakers should take every care to keep the growth rate of the domestic debt within the growth rate of the GDP, as there was a risk that the debt could tend to spontaneous growth even if no new loans were extended by the government, because the payment of interest and principal of the domestic debt would entail more lending. Such a situation would destabilize the general financial situation, the centre warned.
Analyst Hani Tawfik, Deputy Chairman of the Securities Society, pointed out in a symposium hosted by the Press Syndicate on the evening of 6 September that it was necessary to make the Stock Exchange independent of the Ministry of Economy in order to enable the management of the Exchange and the Capital Market Authority to make the right decision in an independent manner under the conditions of transaction activities that they were in a better position to see.

EGYPT SEEKS JAPANESE HELP TO BOOST EGYPTIAN EXPORTS
The matter deserves more attention to be paid to the so-called pre-exportation processes, which are the most important points on which exportation is based. According to these pre- exportation processes, export-oriented projects are set up with special specifications, as markets are no longer considered mere consumers seeking the cheapest commodities only. The good quality of the product, the way in which they were prepared and the post-sale services are also important factors for boosting exports.
The government has promised to present a bill on the regulation of competition and prevention of monopoly to the People's Assembly during the forthcoming assembly session for discussion and passage. This bill has been going to and fro, for three years, between the Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade and the Ministry of Supply and Domestic Trade since the annexation of the foreign trade sector to the Ministry of Economy with the advent of Dr Atef Ebeid's cabinet.
On the other hand, the antitrust bill drafted by the Ministry of Supply stipulated that monopoly occurred when the share of an individual or an establishment in a certain commodity exceeded 30%, the deputies stated.
Another case of monopoly was the phenomenon of mergers, where some companies merge together or acquire other company to create larger entities on the market.

World software companies, which have had a close eye on the Egyptian market for some time, welcomed the federation's announcement, describing it as a great step forward. The regional manager of ICPAC, one of the largest suppliers of integrated computer packages, said that Egypt was one of the most important software markets in the world, indicating that the implementation of the plan would provide many job and investment opportunities for programmers in Egypt. Local software companies also welcomed that plan, describing it as a qualitative leap on the march of growth of the Egyptian software industry, particularly as the plan concentrates on job opportunities provided by commercial activities, such as provision of consultation, integrated systems and Arabic-enabled programs. The study estimates the number of software development companies in Egypt at 160 companies that employ some 10,000 programmers.
The depreciation of the Egyptian pound against the US dollar has impacted sharply on Egyptian car and computer manufacturers, who sent urgent complaints to the Prime Minister, Industry Minister and Telecommunications Minister, demanding reconsideration of the customs duty on imported components of automobiles and computers, where imported parts represent up to 75% of the end products.
These fears were echoed by the President of Al Nasr Automotive Company, Eng Abdel Mon'im Khalifa, who said that local production was going through a state of depression. "The government ought to ban imports for at least two years, so as to make it possible to sell stockpiles and protect the local factories against closure because of the heavy burdens on this industry, which still depends on assembly of imported components that represent 75% of its end product."
On October 1, 2001, the Customs Authority will apply the new car import rules. It has been decided to allow the import of car makes of 2002 and ban the import of car makes 2001, unless the owner of such a make is its first owner.
If the car model is not of the same year of entry, the owner should be its first owner, the source pointed out, adding that the owner should prove that he is the first owner through the possession documents and the car license.

However, this does not prevent the report from pointing out that Egyptian teachers are poorly paid. The average Egyptian teacher is paid between LE 80 and LE 400 per month, depending on his seniority, i.e. a maximum of LE 4,800 per year, which is quite a small amount and equals only 1.11 times amount that places a money earner under the line of poverty and is less than one-half of the amount necessary to support a medium- sized family. That is why Egyptian teachers resort to private tuition, through which they can earn ten times their salaries.
Egypt has more than 17 million pupils, distributed at 7.5 million in the primary stage, 4 million in the preparatory stage, 3 million in the secondary stage with its four branches - general, agricultural, industrial and commercial - and 320 thousand in the kindergarten stage. Egyptian families spend 10-15% of their income on giving their children an education. However, the number of pupils who drop out of school every year ranges between 35,000 and 150,000.
The councilmen described the program as a humiliation for Egypt by all means, as it comprises many arbitrary provisions that force Egypt to release all information and data to the Europeans who dominate the program.
The Chairman of the Shura Council's Industry Committee, Mohammad Farid Khamis, revealed during a stormy meeting of the committee that businessmen, industrialists and experts had several strong reservations on the European program for modernization of Egyptian industries, under which Egypt will get 250 million euros in assistance. He explained that the reservations were based on the reality of the European scheme for having Egypt return this assistance to donor countries, as the European Union insisted that the assistance funds go to the studies entrusted by the European Union to European consultation firms.
Dr Raafat Radwan also called for reconsideration of the modernization of industry. Meanwhile, the discussions of the councilmen uncovered a new scandal starred by the government: numbers and data are being falsified, particularly where the exports of Egyptian carpets abroad are concerned.
The delegation includes a large number of owners of commercial and industrial businesses and representatives of the Chambers of Commerce, the Industries Federation, the Egyptian Businessmen Association and investors' societies in industrial cities, said Dr. Ahmed Shiha, Board Chairman of the Egyptian-Russian Business Council. During the visit, a joint agreement will be signed by the Egyptian private sector and a major Russian company to manufacture tractors in Egypt, he said. The Russian firm will provide the manufacture materials and this agreement will last for five years. The investments of this project hit LE75 million and it will achieve an added value of LE20 million, he pointed out.

In what may be described as a "war of petroleum" between Egypt and Israel, sources in Cairo warned against a commercial war that Israel is currently waging on Egyptian petroleum and oil and gas pipelines in all world capitals through the Israeli government's expansion of the Elat-Ashkelon pipeline that was built in cooperation with Iran in 1970 as a substitute to the Suez Canal for carrying Iranian oil to Romanian refineries, but had to be stopped when Egypt countered with an oil pipeline of its own, SUMED.
However, sources in Cairo indicated that the Iranian government was engaged in negotiations with Israel through third parties for restoring the Iranian ownership of the pipeline and was claiming its full rights to ownership and operation of the pipeline, which amounted to 50%.
SYRIAN-IRAQI RAPPROCHEMENT & DETERIORATING MIDDLE EAST SITUATION
During a very short period, Syrian Prime Minister Mohammad Mostafa Miro made a 3-day official visit to Iraq that was the first of its kind in 20 years, only to be followed a few days later by Taha Yassin Ramadan, Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister, who visited Damascus. The two visits were separated only by the visit made by Syrian President Bashar Al Assad to Kuwait, and the significance of the order in which the three visits were made should not be missed here.
On the other hand, the intensive efforts made by Damascus to alleviate the Kuwaiti concerns over the improvement of relations between Syrian and Iraq, as well as the Kuwaiti attempts not to express concern or reservation in that respect, the improvement of Syrian-Iraqi relations is, in the final analysis, an addition to Iraq's balance at Arab and regional levels.
However, despite all this intermeshing and complication, a single fact can be concluded from this myriad of variables: the proper course of action will eventually impose itself, premises yield results of their own kind, and invariable fixed realities dictate the development of actions, draw the course of history and dictate the actions of politicians and politics. The indications are there, defying anyone who claims that the peaceful option in the Arab-Israeli conflict will eventually yield anything. The Arabs will have to admit, sooner or later, that they have to unite themselves and tread the same path, as an eventual result of their unity of destiny and disillusionment with the American dream, not to mention many other turns of events and surprises, of which Syria's return to Iraq and Iraq's return to Syria will not be the last.
Although the court turned down a request for relocating the remains of the dead rabbi outside Egypt, the village inhabitants are happy, now that they are relieved of the suffocating security cordon that is imposed around their village every year to prevent friction between them and thousands of Jews, most of whom came from Israel.

Ninety percent of the Egyptian banking leaderships belong to the "fez age."
Then, the journalist mentions some examples of these leaderships: 	Ali Negm belongs to a traditional and conservative banking school that knows nothing new about the world of banks and banking services.
He joined the founder team of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) founders in 1960.
Under vague circumstances, known by former economy minister Mustafa Al-Saeed, Negm lost his post as CBE governor. Al- Saeed also lost his post owing to the same vague circumstances.
The bank was sold to a group of Egyptian businessmen, and its name was changed to the Bank of Commerce and Development (al-Tegaryoon).
His father was a civil director of the Revolution Command headquarters, and got acquainted with Gamal Abdel-Nasser, Mohamed Naguib and the rest of the Free Officers.
A decision was issued to renew his term twice till he became 66 years of age.
The list also includes Adel Ezzi.
Rifaat remained in this post about ten years, then he was pensioned off.
Anyway, the relative weight of the two banks remained too modest.
Then, he was appointed CBE governor.
In Egypt, there is a strange system to choose joint bank presidents.
As the presidency fell to him as a kind of bribe, he runs the bank in his own favor.
Unfortunately, Al-Razzaz was unable to repair a bank ruined by the elapse of time.
This is the story of the semi-public sector banks.
They chose a young leadership - Ahmed Al-Baradi - who leads a model experiment in running banking work and purging it of old people.

The two states seek to word "a declaration of principles" that includes points, which organize relations between them, including water, security and borders.
Ankara insists that the "declaration of principles" should include an indication of the border issue. It is believed that this issue impedes the agreement on its wording. The Turkish Foreign Ministry insists on linking the settlement of water sharing to the signing of the declaration.

MS/ Asharq Al-Awsat, 12/9/2001
There is also an apparent willingness to take the risk of surgery whatever it is, for there is no risk to fear, now that the pressures have been building against the Copts to an extent that made them set aside, for the first time, that docility and tolerance that "had been" generally regarded as one a unique feature of the average Coptic character throughout the history of Copts in Egypt, even during the "Age of the Martyrs" in the Roman Era, when their suffering and pains were at a peak.
However, this recent demonstration has cast doubts on the simplistic explanation of the Coptic situation that, the closer analysts get closer to it, the more it appears more complicated than many people think.
On the other hand, Pope Shinouda, who stands accused of Church reactionism by secularist Copts, appears as a religious philosopher who calls for not stopping at formalities and rites but going beyond them to reach the real spirit of faith, in implementation of the method that is motivated by the principle "Not by letter but by spirit, because the letter kills but the spirit gives life" (see Watani, 19 August 2001).
In a case filed by Archpriest Andrawes Aziz against Pope Shinouda, claiming revocation of the Clerical Council's decision to repeal his priesthood status, the State Commissioners Authority turned down the Church's defence that the Supreme Administrative Court had no jurisdiction for trying the case. This decision will pave the way for an expected revolt by some 67 defrocked clergymen, which will certainly have a tangible impact on the prestige of Church authority and the charismatic spiritual and political leadership of Pope Shinouda himself.
Rafiq Habib criticized this cultural and political isolationism, indicating that the solidarity and understanding shown by the community and the State towards the anger of the Copts in defence of their just cause during the recent crisis should send a message to Copts that their isolation must lead to cases where their causes and problems were misunderstood.

Most capitalist countries do not stipulate this percentage which poses a heavy burden that precludes banks from carrying out its credit job required by importers and exporters alike, the union pointed out. This will also increase the bank burden required for providing the financial revenue for these deposits included in the insurance reserve, thus unjustifiably increasing the cost.
This reserve should not be cancelled at one go. Rather, it should be reduced gradually to 15% then 12% then 10% till it is completely cancelled. This is not due to reasons related to the Egyptian banking system as work inside it goes on under strict, well-advised supervision by the CBE, but rather give banks the opportunity to study convenient means to invest this reserve in the national economy.

Commenting on the fresh legal principle, parliamentary sources said that it would lead to the ouster of some Egyptian cabinet ministers from the government for having dual nationality, including Minister of Housing Mohamed Ibrahim Solyman and Minister of Economy Youssef Boutorss Ghali, who are also MPs.

To check the Customs Department means that we are exposed to shoulder its mistakes of estimating the duties later on," he said. The most serious, he added, is the two year-period stipulated by the aforementioned article which is very lengthy and has no like in any other economic legislation all over the world. The legislation does not point out how does customs duties are evaluated in case they are re-checked? And whether the exchange rate of currency be counted at the time when the consignment enters Egypt or when it is re- considered after two years?!
Independent MP Abdel-Mon'em al-Olemi said he had already finished the consideration of a proposed draft law on trying cabinet ministers, introducing amendments to the law no 89 for 1958, which was adopted in the era of Egyptian- Syrian unity, to match Egypt's current constitution.
WASHINGTON'S POLICY WILL NOT CHANGE
There is also the protection of United States its interests in the region, he said" Amb Higazi added that the expected change in the United States policy on the Middle East as a whole would only take the form of a change of methods, so that America might appear more flexible or less firm in those situations that called for decisive action for controlling the security situation in the Occupied Territories and interference with the government of Israel for stopping hostile practices, of which there were many, particularly after the heightening of angry reactions on the Arab street. However, he pointed out, the American reaction would remain generally violent, cruel, more strict and rejecting of any infringement on the American role by any quarters, whatever their force or tactics, not only in the Middle East, but in many other parts of the world as well. "The United States will resort to a policy of deterrence and strict action, as was the case in the wake of the bombings at the US embassies in Nairobi and Dar Es- Salam," he concluded.
74-An international war against terrorism is now being prepared for by the USA. A sum of $40 billion will be spent on that war, which will also be joined by scores of nations, such as Israel, Iran and India.

"The anticipated war will take place between a developed Western party and a technologically underdeveloped one. The strike in New York cannot be matched with any devastation that can be inflicted on any abjectly poor country like Afghanistan," he says.

In its contacts with the Canadian banks, the Council relies on the experience of its Chairman Mohsen Badawi in this market, and on the relative advantages that can be enjoyed by some Egyptian commodities on it.

HIZBULLAH: CONFRONTATION WITH ISRAEL HAS NOT STOPPED
"Hadn't we been prepared, Israel would have returned anew to Lebanon and imposed security arrangements and political guarantees on it. We are still confronting the enemy. Those who think that confrontation came to a halt have got it wrong. The enemy is still occupying our Shebaa Farms," he said.
Just as terrorism is abominable, any manipulation of the terrorism combat cover to settle old accounts or implement Israel's dirty trick would be abominable too.
Such truth remains obvious regardless of the heinous crime committed by the terrorists in the USA even though we completely sympathize with innocent American victims.
Arab countries should take an active part in an international coalition against terrorism. Some Arab countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia have been victims to terrorism. The Palestinians have also been victimized by a constant Israeli terrorism, which will only end when occupation ends.
EGYPT ABORTS ISRAELI SCHEME TO BUILD DAMS IN ETHIOPIA
Egypt asserted that it is impermissible to set up any projects along the Nile without getting the approval of all Nile Basin countries to guarantee that the quotas of the Mouth Countries would not be affected, he added.
The President of the United States has declared a state of red alert, mobilizing 36 American military bases all over the world and calling up 50,000 reservist soldiers. The Congress has earmarked $ 40 billion to cover the costs of the war and the compensations to its victims. But all this was done without accurate information about the real enemy against whom these massive numbers of guns, missiles and troops will eventually be used, which was expressed by US Secretary of State Colin Powell, a veteran military commander himself, when he said, "The reaction will be military, and I hope we will be able to find our targets!"
Therefore, it was not surprising that Dr Francois D'Agozin, one of the most prominent French experts on international terrorism, pointed out in Liberation on 13 September the possibility that rightist American militias, one of whose members bombed the Federal Building in Oklahoma in 1995, killing 168 people, could be behind that attack.
Meanwhile, I read a report on the hijackers that was distributed by USA Today and printed by Asharq Al Awsat on 15 September.
The centre also announced the cancellation of a march it has planned to stage in London on 30 September to celebrate the first anniversary of the outbreak of the Intifada. Similar actions were taken by other quarters. Given these developments, are we to understand that we are heading for a new era of international relations, in which the United States will impose its own agenda on everybody, so that we may concern ourselves only with American woes, feeling happy when the Americans do and unhappy when they do not?
When the truth came out, Judge James Parker acquitted the scientist and ordered his immediate release, strongly admonishing the FBI by saying that they "disgraced and insulted this nation and all of its citizens."
Excerpts run to the following effect: Even though the perpetrators (of the attacks on the US) could not be ascertained so far, Western mass media continued their bias while facing the tragedy and went on harping on the cord of the likelihood of Arab or Islamic parties being involved in that attack that, short as it is (lasting only for three hours), inflicted losses on America three times as heavy as those it incurred in its Vietnamese War that lasted for years. Popular contentment in Egypt was so noticeable that it almost turned into delight for a wide sector of society. Nor was this without a parallel in other parts of the world. Such feelings cannot be without a cause.
Slogans connected with human rights, freedoms and non-governmental organizations and the law have become pretexts for blatant interference. When somebody does not use double standards and seeks to adopt such slogans, he only gains the USA and the West hostility and keenness on revenge. How ugly the image of the USA, the West and Israel was when they stood against non- governmental organizations because the latter had denounced Israeli and American racism in a statement issued by the World Conference Against Racism. No sensible man would claim that such organizations are hostile to the West, as they are mostly financed by American and European countries, bodies, institutions and organizations.

"The fall of the Arabs who are linked to the US" as Baghdad claims was a matter to which Odai, Saddam's elder son pointed out in an article published by Babel newspaper. He said: "The Arab region will witness developments under which the fall of regimes, related to America, will be anticipated."
Iraqi Opposition: 	The Iraqi opposition rules out the possibility of having an American military action launched against Baghdad. However, opposition sources assert that "there is cooperation between Baghdad and the Base Organizations in Afghanistan," pointing to meetings by Iraqi intelligence officers with Bin Laden's groups in Afghanistan and other countries.
Criticism of the American stance, despite condemnation of attacks on New York and Washington, was the stance of the Iraqi Communist Party. These attacks "are a terrorist act in the full sense of the word.
The Kurdistani Democratic Party under Massud Barzani, who controls, together with Talibani, the Kurdistan Province that is not subject to the central government in Baghdad, denounced the terrorist attacks. "The Kurdish people have always been condemning terrorism and the terrorists because they have been suffering much for years from similar operations," said the Party.

The fatwa cited Allah's Saying in the Holy Quran "And he amongst you that turns to them (for friendship) is of them, S. 5 A. 51," indicating that the situation "requires Muslim scholars, rulers and peoples to stand as one solid rank in the face of this American, crusading, Jewish, Zionist imperialist conspiracy, like a solid wall, each brick supporting the other, and discharge the duty that Allah has imposed on them for rejecting and denouncing terrorism and providing all forms of support and backing to any Muslim people that falls under aggression."

The PA members have renewed their delegation of Farouk Metawli to be their spokesman and Dr. Mohamed Morsi, representative of the G-17, to run the new plan, which began with the PA official recognition of their presence and non-interference in appointing the independents' spokesman.
The PA statute does not observe the rules that should be set to organize constitutional rights, they added. The Constitution should be interpreted as one entity, whose parts complete one another. A text should not be interpreted away from the others, they pointed out.
These attempts, however, will be a failure because the ruling regime insists that parties will not be established on a religious basis in Egypt, said the milieus.

The Palestinian silence mirrored the caution shown by Syrian officials in handling "America's War Against Terrorism," pending the clarification of the effects of the campaign on the Middle East and the Palestinian cause.
The 60 organizations that the United States regards as "terrorist" include several organizations like Jihad, Hamas, the Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine - General Command, the late Abu Ali Mostafa's Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine and the Popular Struggle Front, although some of them have not launched military actions in years, while others have never targeted American objectives and Hamas, Jihad and the Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine have confined their operations to resisting Israeli occupation.

It clearly seems that the American pressure concentrates on the Arab region countries to obtain full support for the war against terrorism. The US hinted that economic sanctions would be imposed on the states that would not cooperate. Meanwhile, American inspectors started to be much concerned with a possible link between the Iraqi regime and the terrorist assaults.
Material pieces of evidence are being looked for regarding information to the effect that Iraqi diplomats in Turkey visited Afghanistan in 1998. Besides, information said that an Iraqi diplomat in the United Arab Emirates "is active."

Answering a question about Israel's participation in the anti- terrorism alliance, Moussa said: "If Israel joins it, it will be simply absurd because it is a state that depends on occupation, killing and official assassinations against the Palestinian people.

However, no neutral body, other than the US, has informed Egypt that it has been briefed on these pieces of evidence, which prove that Bin Laden is involved in those attacks, Al-Baz added.
The Supervisor General of the Muslim Brotherhood Group in Jordan, Sheikh Abdul Majeed Al Zunaibat, made no secret of his feelings or the political assessments of his group when he analyzed the position of the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan after America's declaration of war on "the Islamists."
So, Al Zunaibat did not hide his assessment that the opportunity may now be ripe for confronting the pioneering stand of the Islamists against peaceful settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Zionist project and globalization, not only in Jordan, but in the Arab World and the Muslim World as well.

Last year, the volume of direct foreign investments flowing to Africa, including South Africa, sharply declined from $10.5 billion to $9.1 billion, something that led to the shrinkage of the African limited quota out of the total volume of the international direct foreign investments, the report pointed out.

On the one hand, the "Islamic voice" in Afghanistan, which has said more than once that it was not connected, either closely or remotely, to the tragic incidents in Washington and New York, remains the "prime suspect" in the eyes of the United States with regard to the thinking, planning and execution of what took place on "Black Tuesday."
Is not this an "amazing contrast" between the ways of dealing with two declared stands, a contrast that defies comprehension?
So, the United States has been quite adamant, from the very beginning, on ignoring any other suspects in the New York and Washington bombings, with the exception of extremist Islamists, as the United States calls them.
Salama Ahmad Salama selected this title for the article he wrote in his column "Close Up" in Al Ahram, in which he said:
Despite what is being said by some, that the United States is seeking to build an international coalition in its war against terrorism, America will certainly not waste its time in bringing together the coalition as it did during the Gulf War, nor will it put the coalition under the umbrella of the United Nations or allow the coalition to restrict its military operations, wherever they are.
We in the Arab World should not be deceived by the cease-fire that was declared some hours ago and the announcement of the Israeli Defence Forces that they intend to pull out of the Palestinian Territories, for these actions are apparently temporary ones that were adopted under great American pressure for convincing Arab countries to join the America coalition against terrorism. Unless the United States clearly states its intentions towards the Middle East, the situation will return to what it was like immediately after America achieves its objective of hitting Usama Bin Laden.
In a not-too-elaborate item, the Moroccan government news agency said that the Moroccan monarch had decreed the appointment of Ahmad Al Midawi as a royal adviser.
According to the same sources, King Mohammad VI held a meeting with a few members of his cabinet at his palace at Tatwan City. The meeting was attended by Interior Minister Ahmad Al Midawi, Justice Minister Omar Aziman, Cabinet Secretary General Abdel Sadiq Rabee' and the two royal advisers, Mohammad Al Qabbaj and Mohammad Al Mo'tassem. The only item of the meeting's agenda was the system of the coming elections, which the political parties wanted amended, and it was found that the Ministry of Interior had not yet completed its share of the work that was supposed to have been done within the context of drafting the proposed law. Faced with that situation, the Moroccan monarch assigned his adviser, Mohammad Al Mo'tassem, and the Cabinet Secretary General, Abdel Sadiq Rabee', the task of consulting with party leaders on the broad lines of the electoral system bill. He also formed a small-sized committee under Justice Minister Omar Aziman for examining the results of the consultations before their presentation to the ministerial committee that will prepare the final draft of the bill, which it was supposed to have been done on 11 September as a prelude to submission to the Parliament during its coming session that will begin on the second Friday of October next.
In November 1993, late King Hassan II appointed Idris Gatto as minister of commerce and industry in the cabinet of Mohammad Karim Al Omrani.
The new Interior Minister thus has to attend to several top-priority tasks, perhaps the most significant of which are supervision of fair elections and adoption of a policy that is based on social and economic considerations rather than a strict security perspective, as per the line directives reiterated by kind Mohammad VI on several occasions.
The Sudanese Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mostafa Othman, told foreign reporters that the demands, names and information presented by the US Administration had been considered and had been a topic of continuous discussion between the security services of the two countries for over a year.
7 MAIN POINTS FOR AVOIDING CONFUSION OF TERRORISM& STRUGGLE
TAX EXEMPTION LIMITS RAISED
The new bill, he pointed out, also aims at streamlining tax evaluation and collection processes through the tax-payer's submitting a single tax declaration including all his income which is subject to the tax. The new draft law is further aimed at confining notification of the tax evaluation elements and its value to only one form instead of two, fixing a final rate for the tax at 10% instead of 20% in case the State civil servants, who are subjected to the tax, get their salaries from quarters other than those in which they are employed, as well as increasing the sum which is subject to the deduction and adding system, from LE10 to LE100, the minister said.

$2.5 BILLION EGYPTIAN ECONOMY EXPECTED LOSSES IN THE AFTERMATH OF AMERICAN EVENTS
He added that we have to expect that although the American government stance is identical with Egypt's stance towards terrorism, it is only natural that American and European investors should reconsider their decisions regarding investments in the Middle East countries including Egypt especially as that region is likely to witness new developments after America had inaugurated actions in a military reprisal for New York and Washington explosions.
He pointed out that in light of the climate of military operations that the USA is bent on launching, Egyptian imports from European countries would also be affected.
An official with Egyptian Commercial Representation uncovered a sharp decline in the volume of Egyptian-American trade exchanges in the last ten days just as the rest of the world.

Galal Al-Zorba pointed out that our losses in the short term as a transitional phase amounting to one and a half month reaches 10% or 15% of our trade with America. Matters, nevertheless, would be very difficult on the long term.
He added that even though there were no Egyptian investments in Korea, Egyptian businessmen should pay heed to investment opportunities available on the Korean market especially as it would give Egyptian products access to other Asian markets such as those of Japan and China.
As for Korean investors in Egypt, they don't face any problem related to communications or understanding the Egyptian side as there are no fundamental cultural differences between them, he added.
"This decision will be put into effect as of 4 October next," said Hassan.
The Front of Al Azhar Scholars issued a communiqué on 21 September that strongly denounced "throwing the blame for what happened in the United States on Arabs and Muslims without possessing irrefutable proof."
However, the front warned against throwing the flinging accusations at Arabs, Islam and Muslims haphazardly, pointing out that it was the Muslims whose blood was being shed, whose sanctities were being violated, whose holy places were being defiled and whose rights were being usurped while the whole world was watching without moving a finger to help the victims, as was the case in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Chechnya, Albania and Palestine.
Al Azhar scholars warned Arab and Muslim countries against a "terrible future," calling on their leaders to follow Mubarak's example to protect the innocent and protect themselves, because that call (for the coalition) implied a scheme that would be acted according to the whims of the countries that would control the proposed coalition, which aimed at punishing an innocent people on account of one man who had not yet been proved guilty.
AWAKENING OF CRUSADE SPIRIT!
The First World War was not a religious war, nor was Saladin a commander in the war and over six centuries elapsed since his arrival at Jerusalem in 1187.
Thus, Muslim groups should not be blamed for thinking in the same way. The difference between them and the crusade spirit in the West is that this spirit lies in secular societies, which jettisoned and abjured the religious characteristic and theological effect in interpretation of events.
MT / Al-Gomhuria, 22/9/2001
These people know what they want and what they are doing, make no mistake about that!
-	Guaranteeing air facilities, i.e. use of air space, and military facilities, i.e. use of some close military bases on the ground.
The mobilization of troops that the United States is currently carrying out for combating international terrorism will make it possible for America to achieve certain military objectives. Perhaps the most significant of these objectives are the following: -	Pacifying the American public opinion with a retaliatory blow delivered within a context of international legitimacy that is supported by a UN Security Council resolution demanding the hand-over of Osama Bin Laden.
-	Having the capability to change the variables of the world energy equation, as American oil companies will cover the larger part of this region through their monopoly over the rights to exploit the Caspian Sea oil, giving the United States control over the global distribution of energy. Naturally, this policy will be implemented at the expense of the industrial countries that use energy, particularly Japan and European countries.
Anyway, if the Gulf War witnessed a rupture in Arab unity, the expected onslaught will lead to another disruption, but at the level of Muslim countries this time.
Huwaidi: what took place is a destruction of the US security theory, which made the US live under the protection of the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, alleging that it is a fortress. Many examples prove this as the US is the only country which has not been hit from within.
Q: Some people ask if Americans may launch suicide operations and why?
Q: If your expectations come true, do you imagine that the US Administration may confess that the operation was launched by Americans?
Q: Do you predict any military action or air strikes against any Arab nation?
Q: What are then the options for the Arab rulers now?
Huwaidi: This decision paves the way for the fall of the superpower state as it is a meaningless edict.
MT / Al-Ahram Al-Arabi, 22/9/2001
In an interview with Al Hayat, General Gul expected the American invasion, if it did materialize, to fail because the American superiority in firepower and technology would cause frustration to American soldiers, who would be fighting against an enemy they could never perceive.
The Pakistani general's view coincides with what was reported on 21 September by Pakistani opposition sources and the Guardian newspaper in Britain, which said that Washington had prepared a plan for the post-Taliban stage and had dispatched Afghan opposition Northern Alliance leaders to Rome to meet with the deposed Afghan king, Thahir Shah, 86, to pledge allegiance to him. According to the plan, the Northern Alliance would join forces with the former king in a revolution that he would stage against the Taliban and which will enjoy the support of the international coalition, so as to establish a new government in the country under the supervision of the United Nations and the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The former official observed that the United States was ready with weapons systems that were superior to the weapons that the Former Soviet Union had employed in its invasion of Afghanistan, including attack helicopters that had armour on their bottoms, guided missiles and tracking equipment that could trace enemy targets in harsh mountainous terrain.
33-According to high level Lebanese official sources, Lebanon may well be the first military target within the framework of the plan.

National Bank of Egypt (NBE) board of directors decided to suspend the attempts to sell the quota it had bought in the oil refinery MIDOR. The quota which had been owned by Israelis represents 20% of the total shares of the company.
It has been reported that such bids were not, on the whole, up to Egyptian expectations that sought to make profits that would exceed the price paid for the deal by the NBE when it bought the quota.
COOPERATION WITH INDIA TO SET UP NEW JOINT INVESTMENTS
India's exports to Egypt hit about $229 million and Egypt's exports to India hit $156 million.
It seems that the stances taken by President Hosni Mubarak towards the recent developments in the region has earned him more popularity. Egyptian milieus hailed his statements voicing objection to the formation of an anti-terrorism international coalition off the UN umbrella and his rejection of any retaliatory act against Afghanistan, as well as harming an entire people just to pursue an individual.
Al-Banna hailed the Egyptian official stand and urged the Islamic governments not todeclare involvement in the alleged US alliance.
The matter was quite clear, either white or black unlike the current position when gray has become the dominant colour and the enemy is still illusory.
MS / Al-Hayat, 23/9/2001
On the other hand, Taliban Movement Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wakil Ahmed Mutawakil reiterated his request to the USA not to hit Afghanistan as no evidence has been presented so far by Washington that Bin Laden had been responsible for the attacks on Washington and New York on September 11th.

Kuwaitis wish the health crisis had not come at that time especially as the Gulf region is on the brink of another war where their country plays an outstanding role.
As for Sheikh Subah Al-Ahmed Al-Subah, brother of the Emir and deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, he has no right to pass over the crown prince and officially take power as according to a well-established tradition in the ruling family, power should be rotated between Al-Jaber and Al-Salim branches.
The second option is that the council of the ruling family in Kuwait should hold an emergency meeting and decide to settle the succession issue. The council should decide that rotation of power between the two branches of the family be passed over. The council should also pledge support to Subah Al-Ahmed as Emir of the country in succession of his ailing brother.

27-As if our friend, Bush Jr., were not content with the rifts that have ravaged the Arabs since the summer of 1990, he now wants to preclude Arab reconciliation and deepen the chasms among Muslim countries on account of his crusader coalition, which aims at polarizing "factional leaders" in today's Arab World but is reminiscent of the collapse of the Andalus Empire.

However, because the United States needs the support of certain ruling regimes and their tools of oppression, Washington has turned a blind eye to the terrorism that some of them are practicing, but it has not hesitated to draw a list of other regimes that it considers as sponsors of what America sees as terrorism when the topic was the interests of the Hebrew State and the Arab-Israeli conflict.
My worst fear is that the victims of the ongoing campaign will include democracy advocates, humanitarian relief organizations and Islamic peoples that have suffered oppression and suppression for long and are aspiring to the day of salvation, when they get back their freedom and identity.

Perhaps, the most serious consequences of this difference is that it has made great countries abandon some of their essential concepts, throwing the United Nations principles to the wind and ignoring international norms for the sake of giving precedence to policies that have proven harebrained and futile with the passage of time.
Western decision-makers have believed, before and after the 11 September incidents in the United States, that the Arabs and Muslims are responsible for terrorism. So, it is only natural that they act out of this conviction of theirs. What is more serious is that the preparations for the anticipated war are being made under the same conviction, with its resultant concepts.
Therefore, those who understand the United States well are apprehensive that its campaign will be restricted to revenge, because, as everybody knows, elimination of terrorism is a long task, and its most difficult aspect is that it requires new policies through which the superpower would demonstrate that it is not interested in the eruption of any armed conflict, but only in leading an international march to peace.
The second interest is the containment of Russia, China and rogue regional powers, including North Korea, Pakistan Iran, Iraq and Cuba, as well as those countries that sponsor terrorism, such as Syria, Libya and Sudan. The second national interest also includes precluding the creation of an alliance between Confucian China and Islamic countries that possess nuclear power like Iran or those countries that are regarded as stanchions of the Arab regional system, particularly Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
Among the direct strategies for achieving these security interests is the preservation of the United States' main role in drawing the course of international trade and industrial growth, controlling energy sources, the persistence of American naval presence in the seas of the whole world, the acquisition of more land, air and sea bases, facilities and areas of deployment near the areas where United States vital interests exist.
This military presence could be put to use to augment the American economic dominance, so as to cement the American influence in the Greater Middle East, which extends from Maghrib through Central Asia and India to the Caucasus and speed up the creation of a regional security system in the Far East, which Washington would lead and coordinate with for managing international and regional conflicts.
There is no doubt that American military presence and political influence in Central Asia and the Arabian Gulf, coupled with the installation of a pro-American ruling regime in Kabul, will create a serious pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran. This will impact on the security of vital security and economic interests, particularly those related to oil and natural gas and how to carry and export them out of the Arabian Gulf and the Caspian Sea areas.
Addressing reporters after his meeting with the Iranian official, Mousa responded to a question on the recent statements of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, in which the Italian head of government has slashed at Islamic civilization and then retracted his words and apologized for them, by saying, "My talks with Foreign Minister Kharazi touched on this topic."

This is despite the fact that the original charge of some of these repentant people, as listed by the US Department of State, which prepares the annual lists of countries and organizations involved in terrorism, is resistance against Israel and participation in fedayeen operations in the Occupied Territories and South Lebanon.
Because the US Administration will be busy from now until the end of the year with the operation for striking and erasing Afghanistan from the world map.

Iraq, after all, has never ceased to be a target for American and British air raids for the last decade.
Labour Party leader Ibrahim Shukri said that even if America bombed Arab countries and the Arab governments refrained from taking any reasonable action. they would be defeating their own purposes as any internal instability now would not be an asset for such governments.

Meanwhile, there are possibilities of a rise in oil prices in case of continuation of military operations in Afghanistan or some European countries being exposed to a very cold snap. Oil prices can also go down in case of political support, e.g. increase of oil production by OPEC member countries as a contribution of its own to the counter-terrorism efforts, he added.

78-OSAMA BIN LADEN,AND ISLAMIC MOVEMENTS IN EGYPT
The Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) does not have anything to do with the methods of Bin Laden and his likes. Even if some Ikhwanite students were confused about the matter, we know that no one is infallible and potential blunders increase when the sentiments are kindled and the situation is complicated. In fact, nothing is more difficult than the situation brought from the September attacks on the US, resulting in a devastating war which is rejectable even if the brutal Taliban regime killed Afghans as many as the martyrs of the US attacks, insulted Islam and fomented a sedition between Sunnah and Shiite. In other words, the Taliban did what the archenemy of Islam could never do.

Under the new decree, Al-Qeyam prayers (Ramadan's night prayers) will be observed in 51 mosques only throughout the republic that can recite the whole Suras of the holy Koran throughout the month. The 51 mosques included only three main mosques in Cairo.

In an exclusive to Asharq Al-Awsat, the IAEA director said that the Arab countries had failed to deal with the Israeli nuclear program since the 1960's. He pointed out that we had ineptly dealt with the Israeli program, which started in the 1960's. When Camp David Accords were concluded, the Arab countries especially Egypt had a chance to raise that question and get an Israeli pledge to renounce its nuclear program.
Within the framework of updating religious discourse and explaining the real image of Islam, Egyptian Mufti Dr. Ali Gomaa agreed with Minister of Information Mamdouh Al-Beltagui and Minister of Wakfs Dr. Hamdi Zaqzouq on exploiting the Egyptian media to square up to allegations that Islam urges terrorism and extremism.
President Hosni Mubarak abrogated 85% of martial laws, he pointed out, noting that Supreme State Security Courts have been cancelled and their cases had been referred to criminal courts.
The victims, however, are women, children, and old people in Iraq so much so that Al-Zarqawi seemed like a scarecrow used by occupation forces to justify their criminal and terrorist aggression against the Iraqi people in retribution against them for the resistance operations launched by his sons against occupation forces in order to drive out those forces and to restore the occupied country's independence. In fact, the occupation forces are to blame for the presence of what is called Abu-Musab Al-Zarqwai or other foreign extremists in Iraq if they really existed at all according to occupation authorities allegations. They are fully to blame as it is they who undermined the Iraqi state's institutions, thus leaving Iraq an easy prey to all types of criminals and adventures including the West's robbers who looted Iraq's antiquities and mostly turning into terrorists after that. Occupation authorities have also opened the door to the forces of domestic religious extremism, which were not allowed in the era of the detained Iraqi president Saddam Hussein.
America is the only country in the world where "no bets" are plausible, which is natural because none in America is American, hence that people's lack of loyalty or affiliations.
Bets are only possible with other nations which have cultural homogeneity, history and civilizations like Egypt, Persia, Rome, Greece and ancient Europe where citizens have the same ethnic origins and a common history!
Why should there be any bets at all so long as America occupies Iraq and can get all it wants in that Arab country?
This is reminiscent of Ahmed Chalabi, the Iraqi Shiite who holds American nationality.
Maguid Abdel-Fattah said, adding that this will shift confrontation with Palestinian organizations to other countries.
The QIZ agreement provides for allocating industrial zones in Egypt to produce industrial products with Egyptian-Israeli components in order to be exported to the USA with customs exemptions and preferential treatment.

PARLIAMENTARIANS WARN AGAINST INFILTRATION OF IRAQ WAR WASTE INTO EGYPT
The deputies pointed out that such scrap including equipment and machinery as well as building waste are contaminated with harmful radiations because occupation forces used some banned weaponry, according to them.

Al-Ahali learnt that the Minister of Tourism had not informed the Minister of Electricity or the security bodies concerned of the visit or of his intentions to convert the nuclear station site into a resort!
Worries prevailed among many of Al-Dhabaa inhabitants as soon as they heard of the news of the dubious visit especially as the evacuation of the native population from the station site had been linked to a propaganda for the positive effects of the nuclear energy station whether on feeding industries which create job opportunities for them and their sons or the improvement of the services of roads, education, health and security, an argument which had been proven to hold ground in the case of other mega national projects like the High Dam in Aswan and the Aluminum Complex in Nagi Hammadi which bolstered the development of the area, the national economy and gave impetus to the development of plans.

ISRAEL RECEIVES ARAB "FILE" ON HAMAS LEADERSHIP ABROAD
Yesterday (September 23rd), Al Fahoum said that Hamas, its officials and the officials of other organizations were "hidden".
The file authors described Al Alami as "responsible" for military action and Nezal as responsible for the "mass media machine" in addition to his responsibility for the political security system, recently set up, which collects information about all personalities and forces on the Palestinian arena and implements propaganda campaigns against Hamas adversaries.
Under this heading, Zuheir Kosaibati of Al-Hayat writes an article, which runs to the following effect: The blast that hit the car of Ezzeddin Al-Sheikh Khalil in Damascus did not come a long time after the open threat launched by Israeli chief of staff Moshe Ya'alon to deal with those supporting terrorism and occupying top terrorist positions in the Syrian capital.
Only a two-day gap separated the confirmation by the Palestinian National Council former chairman, Khalil Al-Fahoum that the Palestinian organization bureaus had been closed down in Damascus and that its telephone lines or rather its mass media arteries had been cut, from blasting Khalil's car despite Hamas' leaders' being hidden, to quote Al-Fahoum's words that tried to suggest that the movement as well as other organizations was either deprived of the privilege of free political and mass media movement or has optionally renounced that privilege to spare Syria further American pressures with the looming swords of Damocles in the form of sanctions.
Damascus assets account has been reduced in the Iraqi paper as well as the Lebanese paper as it relatively yielded to the resolution 1559 of the deployment of its forces in Lebanon, nor would that be to Washington's complete satisfaction as it wants more sometimes using temptation and sometimes intimidation.
Blasts in Damascus, that is, transcends a mere warning message or reprisal to the Beer Sheva buses explosion.
Anyone who wants to read the statements of the Palestinian Fatah military wing of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades will believe at first glance that they belong to the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) or the Islamic Jihad.
Martyrdom operations were limited to Islamic movements, but now they are launched by secular groups, including Fatah and left-wingers, as a key method of resistance acts.
Unlike the first Palestinian Intifada, the Al-Aqsa Intifada saw a boom in specific infiltrations into Jewish settlements and army positions.
Continuing the development of more rockets, Hamas launched "el-Battar" and "el-Banna" rockets, while the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades developed two copies of Al-Aqsa rockets, and the People's Resistance Committee made three models of "el-Nasser" missiles. The Al-Quds Battalions, the military wing of the Islamic Jihad, developed Saraya rockets.
Furthermore, the religious discourse prevailed among the resistance groups, quoting verses of the Holy Qura'n.
During his special visit to Doha, Al-Ahram Al-Arabi asked him some heated and sometimes provocative questions, but he did not give heated or provocative answers.
A-I agree with you that the Palestinian issue entered a dark tunnel, which urged many to think that hope is over. However, I would say that there is still hope to get out of the current predicament of the Palestinian issue.
A-In order to contain this situation, there should be intentions and determination in the authority from top to bottom to start these steps. Only then, the Palestinian people with their different factions and organizations would interact positively with these steps. Even the security agencies do not mind being united or becoming one front or one agency under the order of one minister and Cabinet. This matter is impossible.
So, there were determination, intentions, and strong will.
A-The Palestinian Authority.
Q-Do you think that Israel wants peace indeed?
But, we should uncover Sharon's intentions to the Israeli and international public opinion in order to make them familiar with this man who does not want peace.
The occupation may aim to obstruct the reform, but you have to do your duty.
Q-How do you see Sharon's plan?
The armed military resistance was tried for four years and the result was destruction. We can not face Israel by the force of weapons. Israel is qualified to achieve victory over all Arabs. That is why it is not possible to resort to the war option and succeed. The evidence is that the four years of armed resistance resulted in nothing.
They said that the uprising would remove Sharon from power, but the result is that Sharon has got a popularity that Ben Gurion did not get.
His words had an optimistic tone in a climate which is dominated by pessimism shrouding the Palestinian situation for some time. His gray hair reflects long experience since he graduated from the Egyptian Military Academy in the early 1960s starting a long way in the field of Palestinian security action, the latest position in which was the leadership of the Palestinian police.
Emphasis now is on Gaza Strip in light of Sharon's plan to withdraw from it. In the next stage, therefore, and in the post-Intifada period, so to speak, security and control should be imposed on the Palestinian people who has naturally been greatly affected by the Intifada. There were martyrs and injured and deterioration at all security, political and economic levels. The Palestinian people, however, can emerge out of all this quite hardened and so strong that it can make up for its losses in that war. This is only possible through proper action. That was why the Palestinian leadership thought it was necessary to unify security bodies.
A: We rely on the Egyptian initiative, but we cannot ignore our POWs in Israel. We also demand that Israel stop pursuing the wanted and abide by what agreement may be reached. According to the Egyptian initiative and Sharon's withdrawal plan, withdrawal from Gaza and part of the West Bank will take place next year. Then, there will be a one-year test period after which or rather in 2006, we are going to enter into negotiations of the final status.
Coinciding with Egypt's efforts with the Palestinian factions, the Palestinian efforts will focus on getting Fatah organization together so that it may become a disciplined organization under one command. There must be very strict discipline inside Fatah under one command represented in President Abu Ammar. If that could be achieved and one paper could be agreed upon regarding the national programme coinciding with the ceasefire, we would be able to achieve the first step on the road to the ceasefire which would need the presence of strong security bodies capable of the implementation of the agreement and translating it on the ground into concrete steps at the security level so that there would be security control through carefully studied steps to put an end to many problems that exist in Gaza such as numerous weapons veiled men and the enforcement of law, etc...
We should not forget pointing out the European role which follows up the Egyptian-Palestinian efforts. I would like to point out that all Palestinian and Egyptian plans will be difficult to be carried out on the ground without potentialities and funds. Finance is an essential and vital part. The European countries would undertake the task of financing in coordination with the Egyptian and Palestinian parties regarding our needs in accordance with a gradual plan through several stages and steps that serve Palestinian interests according to the Palestinian reality and circumstances especially in light of occupation. We will gradually implement security tasks until we finally reach an integrated security.
We are certainly against nobody in particular. But we are only against the idea of taking the law in one's own hands. This file is open and an agreement between factions are expected during the next dialogue in Cairo. Generally speaking, such issues are on the cards and on our part, we welcome any body who wants to join us.
The ministers highlighted 6 fields for reform: civil service, e-government and simplifying administrative measures, rational administration of public funds, public resources management, modernizing the legal and judicial system, civil society and mass media.

IRANIAN-TURKISH-SYRIAN ALLIANCE AGAINST ESTABLISHMENT OF KURDISH STATE
The sources pointed out that Khatami would confirm the necessity that both countries, together with Syria, should be ready for any scenario in Iraq, especially due to the idea that Washington is biased to the Kurds and supports their demands in a confederacy on an ethnic basis. This revives Kurdish nationalist ambitions on the borders of Syria, Turkey and Iran. A tripartite coordination is, therefore, necessary to force such a threat that jeopardizes territorial integrity in the three countries.

WORLD BANK FORCES GOVERNMENT TO SELL BANKS
Last September, the government announced that it intended to merge six Egyptian banks with other banks within the framework of a programme for restructuring the banking sector. These banks, where public banks own big quotas, were: Mohandes Bank, Misr Exterior Bank, United Bank of Egypt, the Islamic International Bank for Investment and Development, the Nile Bank, and Bank of Commerce and Development. These, in addition, were the weakest six banks operative in Egypt. The mergers were, therefore, meant to avoid any risks of defaulting in their financial performance. On the other hand, preparations are currently underway to sell the Bank of Alexandria in the next period after inventorying government debts that go around 8 billion pounds to get rid of them through the issuance of bonds. The government, however, has not decided yet whether the buyer should be a British or Gulf bank.
The deals included selling 38 companies the bulk of whose quotas are owned by the government, 16 companies where the government is not the major owner were also sold through a public tender while 32 faltering companies were sold and 28 selling operations were carried out to investors. 20 government companies carried out 21 selling operations of their assets. The privatization led to a decline in public companies labour quota from 7% in 1991 to 2.5% in mid 2002.

The four candidatures are the incumbent president Zin Al-Abideen, head of the ruling Democratic Constitutional Rally Party; opposition Mohamed Abu-Shiha, Popular Unity Party General Secretary; oppositionist Munir Al-Bagi, head of Liberal Social Party; and Mohamed Ali Al-Halawani, chairman of National Council for Renovation Movement (former communist party).
Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, member states of the Arab Gas Pipeline (AGP), approved of an Iraqi request to join the Arab Gas Pipeline in order to benefit by the export facilities it provides, as this pipeline is scheduled to reach Europe via Turkey by the end of 2006.
The project will be finished by the end of the next year, Fahmi added.
"Iraq's participation in such a giant project came following international requests to buy Iraqi natural gas," Iraqi Oil Minister Thamer Al-Ghadban said. "The project will give Iraq many advantages, as it can provide Iraq with its natural gas needs in the first stage while the project will be supplied (later on) with Iraqi huge natural gas reserves," Al-Ghadban added.
The third phase of the AGP in the Syrian territories will be put up in an international bid, which may be won by the Egyptian companies that are implementing the second phase of the project in Jordan, he added.
WE'LL TRY TO EXPAND OUR ARMY, OUR ARMAMENT IS TEMPORARILY EASTERN: IRAQI MINISTER
Al-Shaalan went on to say, "We are also trying to reestablish our air forces and asked Iran to return our 130 plans of different types deposited there by the former regime."

Abdel Moneim said in an interview with Al-Majalla, "The physical conditions of children in refugee camps are Ok in relation to times of plight. It is more than acceptable in light of tribal and seasonal wars between pastoral and farm tribes due to desertification and drought in this region and disputes over water resources".
As regards reports about a famine or ethnic wars, Abdel Moneim said he did not take notice of such things! I saw some burnt houses and stores due to attacks of militant militiamen riding camels and horses a short time ago. When asked about an explanation for those attacks, Sudanese vice-president Ali Othman said," The militias had to enter Tawila village, about 70km off the capital of Nothern Darfur, where the burnt houses were located, after insurgents forced their way into it and hid among its local villagers".
IRAQ: FAMILIES SEARCHING FOR THEIR ABDUCTED DAUGHTERS
God bless the days of Saddam!"
Oh Lord, have mercy on us.
An unidentified source with the Iraqi police told Al-Hayat that there were many shortcomings in the performance of the police.
However, others are unanimous that it is part of Kurdistan and should come back to the homeland.
The first step to solve the Kirkuk crisis is to bring the city back to its normal life and return its original dwellers to it, media official with the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) Azad Gindiani said.
Most Kurdish officials seem worried when they talk about that issue.
However, we don 't call for expelling Arabs from the city as Saddam has done with its Kurdish inhabitants, but we call for providing them with an alternative housing and compensating them.
This policy should be reversed now.
TURKISH FM: ANY ISRAELI ACTIVITY IN IRAQ IS A BIG MISTAKE
Turkey does not have any plan to form Islamic-Arab forces to operate in Iraq currently.
A: We have an obvious opinion that the Middle East region should be a nuclear-free one.
What was the result of these talks?
What the Israeli told us is that mass media reports are divorced from reality.
Any way this Israeli presence in Iraq would be very serious.
Good or bad future?
But, in the first place this is an Arab land that is being partitioned.
So, this would be very grave for the region and would be even graver to the Iraqis.
He added that the American pressure in Iraq constituted a threat to all Arab and Islamic countries. The solution, he added, lay in the withdrawal of American forces as soon as possible.
Safwi told Al-Hayat that the Islamic Republic would not opt for nuclear technology for military purposes, as that was not included in their strategy. Our religion would not allow it. Iran is also member in the N.P.TT and a member in the International Agency for Atomic Energy and abided by its laws.
In a waning tone, he went on to say, "We're ready to face any pressure that may be exercised against us." The armed forces and the Ministry of Defence are ready to defend our country 's independence, sovereignty and interests.
The Revolutionary Guard Commander voiced hope that the Iraqi people would be given the choice to elect its own representatives (in the parliament) and choose a government based on its own will rather than the American administration, a government that has no hostilities with the neighbouring countries but one that works to preserve Iraq's sovereignty and live in peace with neighbouring countries.
Al-Wefak (Accord) Party also withdrew from the committee.
Two weeks ago, Al-Wasat's founders' agent Abul-Ela Madi presented the committee with the genuine points in his party's platform in comparison to other licensed ones.

The new bank differs from the Egyptian-Sudanese Bank as far as the nature of activity is concerned, he noted, as the Egyptian-Sudanese Bank devotes its work in the field of commercial activities and finance of exports while the new bank concentrates on investment activities.
The Sudan numbered 7 at the international level in terms of courting foreign investments and came second at the Arab level following Algeria, he added. The Sudan has guarantees that encourage any investors to penetrate its markets, as the CBS allows Arab and foreign investors remitting their funds abroad at any time without any restrictions.
Minister of Foreign Trade and Industry Rashid Mohamed Rashid said that his ministry is currently implementing a program to enhance Egypt's benefits from COMESA agreement through making Sudan a trade gate for Egyptian products due to its geographical proximity and the close ties between the peoples of Egypt and Sudan. Moreover, Sudan was a big market. The program also includes activating the COMESA regional investment zone which was established in Egypt with a view to increasing the volume of mutual investments among the COMESA member states. In addition to enacting the regional competition law in COMESA countries, making use of exportation of Egyptian investments and services to several African countries, especially as Egypt was one of the first African countries to pass competition and anti-trust law.

BALANCE OF PAYMENTS IMPROVED A report by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) showed a remarkable improvement in the balance of payments and foreign exchange reserve, in addition to an increase in domestic cash liquidity rates and growth of credit facilities. However, it revealed a trade balance deficit during the second quarter of the current fiscal year.

1-AMERICA DREW UP THE WAR PLAN LAST JULY!
The war in Afghanistan and restoring control over Pakistan aborts Chinese plans to set up a defensive alliance with Pakistan and Iran. The American penetration into the Indian peninsula and improving Indian-American relations and the prospective American role in Kashmir problem will obstruct Russia's attempt to set up a strategic cooperation with China, India and Iran.
A: I'd like to say that America is in no hurry to end the situation decisively, nor does it want to sustain human casualties in its war with the Taliban. It rather wants to control North East Afghanistan, the capital, Kabul and to set up a regime friendly to the USA, and launching an extensive civil war against Taliban and Al-Qaeda. During that war, America would have time to plan changing the political map for its alliances in the whole of South Asia and strengthening its presence there, tightening its economic, political and military control on the Arab world and South East Asia. In order to achieve such purposes, America will use cards like the elimination of terrorism, the imposition of free market economies, modern social changes, the formation of interest groups, some of which have already started to emerge in some Arab countries.
The September incidents have embarrassed the American planning and forced Bush to strike Afghanistan to restore the dignity lost internationally and in both Americas. Its calculations were also disrupted as a result of the attitudes of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, China and Iran. It has become more in need of genuine advice from America's friends and allies more than at any other time.
Finally, America changed the concept of globalization into an American hegemony, politically, economically and culturally, a policy which it is trying to impose on the world countries and to stay the uni-superpower and put an end to two main threats - "rogue" countries (according to its perspective) and international terrorism that exposed the fragility of internal security in America.
The official, who was talking on the occasion of the visit paid to Saudi Arabia by French Foreign Minister Hobert Federine, warned that the more time that the war takes, the more fragile and liable to disruption the coalition becomes and the stronger the voices in the USA calling for targetting Iraq. He pointed out that the American party would find it more and more difficult to preserve the support it gained and the more difficult it would be to define clear objectives for military operations in Afghanistan.
The Russian, on the other hand, insist on a big share for the Northern Alliance.
10-MOROCCO: BIN LADEN ADMIRED BY 90% OF MOROCCANS
They also blamed the United States for what happened on that day, with most of them attributing it to the American support to Israel. Al Ahdath is expected to print the results of its poll, which was made on its behalf by the French CSA-TMO organization, on Monday 29 October.
One-half of the respondents believe that creating a Palestinian state is one of several solutions for eliminating terrorism, while the other half said that creating a Palestinian state is the only way for curbing terrorism.
In statements to Asharq Al-Awsat, the Sudanese minister accused Clinton of missing Khartoum's offer. This is Sudan's first official confirmation of US reports on a dialogue made in this respect.
15-MT / Asharq Al-Awsat, 31/10/2001
However, the practices of the Iranian Government are not compliant with or governed by this stand, so there is no doubt that there is some sort of disagreement in views within the Iranian ruling regime, just like what happened during the American strikes against Iraq.
Moreover, it does not become Iran to be only concerned with participation in the so-called post-Taliban recipe, which is a recipe concocted by the Americans and the Russians, or the present and former occupiers of Afghanistan, together with India and the Communist Central Asian rulers, who have not left of Communism in their minds but apostasy.
It now stands to be blocked from Afghanistan in the east, and its relations with Iraq continue to be tensioned.
However, we hope that will not happen, and we do not think that it could happen quickly anyway.
Iran is a military power that takes order from nobody, which is unacceptable in the American equation.
Therefore, taking advantage of the American exposure in the Afghan quagmire will be an act of protection to the whole Muslim Nation.
22-President Mubarak emphasized that keeping Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty would mean a hundred years war.
The president announced that negotiation was the only solution adding that the Palestinian State would be the best guarantee for Israel.
24-CAIRO DENIES INTENTION TO SUPPLY ISRAEL WITH ELECTRICITY

He also pointed out that American intelligence services obtained any sensitive information they wanted by offering green-card opportunities that required applicants, at the insistence of the United States Embassy in Cairo, to fill an exhaustive 20-page questionnaire for each member of the family that sought migration to the United States. American intelligence agencies used those questionnaires for building a mosaic that covered all aspects of the Egyptian community.
34-According to an official source in the Iranian embassy in Cairo, the relation between Egypt and Iran are very good and are currently at their best on all levels. It added that the Iranian Charge D'Affaires Khesru Shahi would return to Cairo in two weeks.
It has been reported in Cairo that Shahi departed Cairo because he despaired of the resumption of bilateral relations especially as the Iranian official had failed to fix a date for this return because he failed to achieve what he considered to be his primary task, namely, the resumption of relations between Cairo and Tehran. Khesro had had the impression that such resumption of relations was imminent, thus closing their dispute files especially on the heels of the visit paid to Cairo by Iranian foreign minister Kamal Kharazi ten weeks ago.
The demonstrations that included the universities of Cairo, Ein Shams, Zagazig and Mansoura demanded that food stuff and medical urgent aid be sent to the Afghani people before diseases run rampant among them and before they are exposed to death due to the cold weather.
40-No official response has been yet made by Cairo or Baghdad towards what has been said by Czech minister of the Interior on 26 October. The Czech minister confirmed the reports about an alleged meeting in Prague between an Iraqi diplomat and Mohamed Atta, the Egyptian citizen whom America claimed to have been one of the 19 perpetrators of the suicidal crashes that targeted Washington and New York. Arab sources closely related to the Iraqi authorities unveiled to Asharq Al-Awsat that those authorities had contacted their Egyptian counterparts in a bid to deny the alleged reports.
42-HALF A WORD!
64-Only two weeks after the referral of two cases of fundamentalists in Egypt to the military judiciary, well informed sources in Cairo told Asharq Al-Awsat they expected an imminent referral within days to military judiciary of a new case of banned Jihad Organization led by Ayman Al-Zawahri, primary ally of Osama Bin Laden. They pointed out that the case might include about one hundred fundamentalists.
Mohamed Abdel-Rehim Asharqawi is considered one of the most powerful and influential leaderships in Jihad Organization and is known to be very close to the organization's leader, Ayman Al-Zawahri. No previous prison sentences have been pronounced against him in Jihad Organization cases. He had been acquitted in the major Jihad case on the heels of Sadat assassination in 1981.
47-M.S. Asharq Al-Awsat, 31/10/2001

In other words, the total cost of ingredients used for producing such foodstuff amounted to 165 million pounds. Another 74 million pounds had been spent on dates, yameesh (dried fruits) and almonds at a rate of 25%, flour and rice, 14% and then came milk products, meat, vegetables and fruits.
However, while his announcement assured the people, it also caused a cloud of uncertainty to loom over the situation, as people began to wonder who will be the vice-president and what sort of capabilities the candidate will prove to have.
However, should there be a vice-president until such changes are effected, I think that the vice-president will be selected from among the figures that have a military background, such as Omar Suleiman, the Director of Intelligence. He could also be one of those who led the Egyptian Army in the 1973 War, like Field Marshal Al Gamassi."
There is Amr Moussa, too. He is a charismatic national figure, and he has a strong presence.
Kamel Zuhairi, veteran journalist and former chairman of the Press Association, said, "The selection of the new vice-president from the military, judicial or economic fields will depend on the political atmosphere in Egypt and the desire of the President. However, I rule out the appointment of the Director of Intelligence, Omar Suleiman, and tend to support the selection of a vice-president from the Armed Forces, as the Israeli danger continues to exist."
58-PALESTINIAN POLITICAL COMMISSIONER FOR JERUSALEM FILE: ARAB SUPPORT IS LESS THAN THE FUNDS PROVIDED BY JEWISH BILLIONAIRE FOR JUDAIZATION OF JERUSALEM
Dr Nessiba indicated that over the past several years that had followed the establishment of the Palestinian Authority, Eastern Jerusalem had gone through a phase of political, economic and cultural "evacuation" and some Palestinian institutions had moved their economic and cultural activities out of the city, so that while other Palestinian territories were witnessing an economic and urban boom, Jerusalem was going into an economic and urban slump.
In an interview that was aired by Interfax, Jack Straw said that there was no evidence on involvement of parties other than Bin Laden and Al Qaida in terrorist operations, although he added that the Iraqi ruling regime posed a real danger on Iraq and the whole region.

67-A COUP AGAINST GADDAFI ABORTED
It is still unconfirmed now whether there is a link between the coup attempt and the decree issued before to dissolve Battalion No. 77, a decree which triggered a crisis inside the Libyan Army.
71-The conflict between the hawks and doves within the Jordanian Islamic Movement, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood Group and its political arm, the Islamic Action Front Party, has resurfaced in the wake of the elections that were held recently for selecting a new leadership for the Society of Islamic Centres, which runs a large number of schools, societies and commercial businesses. The activities operated by the society, whose combined capital is estimated in the tens of millions, supply the Islamic Movement with funds, followers and sympathizers and jobs for its members.
A victory for the moderates means that the hard-liners will lose many of the party's second-echelon positions, particularly in the slums, where most of the population is of Palestinian descent.
73-$ 150 BILLION IN ISLAMIC BANKS FACE CHALLENGES
The study affirms that Islamic banks are facing a number of challenges, particularly those resulting from their focus on specific activities, such as the profit-and- loss-sharing system, as well as the decline of the role of speculation and partnership, the lack of advanced and active secondary markets that could absorb their investments and the restrictions imposed on them by monetary authorities.
The company president, Captain Sabri Saad Abdullah, told Al Hayat that the new company would be named African Airlines and would be called "Afrikia" in both Arabic and English, explaining that several Arab and international quarters would participate in the capital of the new company, which would implement an expansion plan based on the establishment of alliances and the purchase of airlines in a large number of African countries.
The company president continued, explaining that the initial capital provided by the Libyan Government was $ 100 million, with a possibility for increase, according to the company's bylaws. "The new thing about this company is that it is open to foreign investments, not only Libyan capital," he pointed out.
Al Hayat learned that the new company would enjoy the support of a major European company that has shown interest in the project and its economic feasibility.
He added that the $ 500 million deal would go to either Boeing for the modern 800- 737 model, or to its rival, Airbus, for the 320 model, both of which had wide fuselages, and that the acquisition would be made under a lease-purchase deal with a term of ten years. Sabri concluded by saying, "We are also thinking of expanding our operations by acquiring Boeing 800-737 and Airbus 320 aircraft in the second and third phases of the company, so as to cope with the requirements of African market. The purchase negotiations will start as of now."
2-Observers expect the recent cabinet reshuffle to impose a new set of calculations on the performance of the economic cabinet.

The second bill will focus on the central role of the National Investment Bank in financing the State's development plans, in which case it will be operating under the authority of the Ministry of Finance, while it will operate under the authority of the Central Bank in the case of providing funding to independent economic organizations, as per the banks law.

Al- Tabtabai, together with deputy Mokhallad Al-Azmi, an independent Islamist, had offered a proposal to amend the penalty law so that the amputation, flogging and stoning limits be included just as the Islamic Shari'a wants.

They criticized the authorities' resorting to detention and investigation of 64 Kuwaiti Islamists and scores of Arabs, many of them were deported without charges. Such measures, the deputies said, were taken in light of the international hysteria against everything Islamic, according to an Islamic deputy's statement to Al-Hayat.
Walid Shukair of Al-Hayat wrote:
Why not if its plan even in Afghanistan and the anti-terrorism war becomes vulnerable to everyday amendments to the extent that the Super power changes its political-military goals everyday. It is also still groping its way for toppling the "Taliban" regime and searching through carpet bombing for its foe in the hope that falling bombs might find him, killing civilians rather than fighters!

Dr. Morsi pointed out that the PA disregard of the biggest bloc after the NDP inside the parliament created a tense atmosphere and affirmed that the speakership didn't observe fairness which it had previously said it would do. The "selection" of certain PA members, added Dr. Morsi, who represent themselves only in such committees points out an attempt to "marginalize" the role played by the Group's members, although the PA Speaker and the Minister of People's Assembly and Shura Council's Affairs, Kamal Al-Shazli, had commended their performance at the end of the last round.
For the first time since the 11 September attacks in New York and Washington, the United States made the Muslim Brotherhood Organization a party to its war against terrorism. In response to an American request, Italian authorities arrested two of the most prominent Muslim Brotherhood veteran leaders in Europe on 7 November, Yousef Nada, an Egyptian, and Ghalib Himmat, a Syrian. The authorities also imposed a freeze on the accounts of the two Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Italian banks, in addition to other actions against the assets of Taqwa Bank, which Nada and Himmat had established in the Bahama Islands over a decade ago in cooperation with other Islamists, most of whom are counted among Muslim Brotherhood members.
The Americans think that nobody is important but themselves. They believe that they are the power that has only to give orders and everybody would obey, to the extent that they have turned the international coalition against terrorism into a coalition against anybody who opposes their policies or rejects Israeli actions. The PLO, Arafat, Islamic Jihad and Hamas have become terrorists, while Ariel Sharon has become the only face that is acceptable to the Americans.
According to knowledgeable sources, Yousef Nada is regarded as one of the veteran leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood Organization.
Former Chief of Staff of the Egyptian armed forces General Salah Halabi said that the ground operations by the alliance forces against Afghanistan, should they occur, will be limited and targeted at backing up the elements which had been won over to fight the Taliban and march down to Kabul. He added that no one can predict the timing of this operation because so far the results of the terrible bombing are not known. He pointed out that the American news blackout on the results of the war is not part of the war plan but a ploy to cover up the lack of success in hitting any significant targets.
He added that a longer period of war may not change the position of the international parties though it may satisfy the ego of American citizens.

He added that the Afghans had nothing to do with that in the least.
P.A. DENIES WHILE HAMAS CONFIRMS REPORTS OF CIA DRAWING UP A PLAN TO INFILTRATE 250 PALESTINIANS TO ARREST BIN LADEN IN AFGHANISTAN
On the other hand, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) denied such reports in a statement published by Palestinian news agency "Wafaa" The official spokesman said, "Such reports are entirely groundless and are meant to incite (people) against the PNA and its security bodies and to deflect international attention from the ongoing Israeli aggression on the Palestinian people, the siege of its cities and villages and assaulting the Christian and Islamic sanctities.
According to the plan, said Hamas, the remaining part of the Preventive Security members would join the ranks of the Northern Alliance, the arch enemy of the Taliban movement and Al-Qaeda Organization in order to intensify efforts to reach Bin Laden's place before any other person.
Dr. Youssef Wali, the Secretary General of the National Democratic Party (NDP), told a political rally held by the party in Sharkia governorate that he wished the party would be able to win the next local council elections unopposed adding that the current election law makes it possible for any opposition candidate to win.
The conflicts in the trade union and cooperative elections would, for their part, get reflected on the local council elections. Wali cited the example of the reassuring calm that would prevail for the coming local council elections in the governorates of Assiut and Sohag.
ADMINISTRATIVE COURT ORDERS SHURA COUNCIL TO PROVIDE AID TO EXISTING PARTIES
MFA, Al Ahram, 8/11/2001
This step, which is considered a severe blow dealt to the Group, came after a four-month détente between the two sides in spite of the Ikhwan's active and prominent role through protests launched by their elements either in Al-Azhar or at universities against the massacres the Palestinian people is exposed to at the hands of the Israeli army and the US strikes against the Afghan people.
Sources in the Brotherhood said that on November 6 at dawn security forces stormed the houses of a number of Ikhwan leaderships in Cairo, Qalyoubia and Giza and arrested them and confiscated books and documents under the claim that they represent evidence against them proving that they join an anti-ruling regime underground organization in the country.

The Egyptian officer had sustained a compound fracture in his leg and had been driven to Rafah Central Hospital, the sources said, adding that actions were underway for airlifting the injured officer to the Police Hospital at Agouza, Cairo, where he would complete his medical treatment.
Egyptians travelling to Washington said the many papers and documents requested by the US embassy made them feel that the US officials have been gripped by a security hysteria for fear of a recurrence of the September 11 action. Regarding other foreign embassies in Cairo, the British embassy said its security system has not changed for it has a blacklist of non-British persons who committed political crimes or criminal offences on the British soil. According to the blacklist, the embassy can decide on the approval of travel. However, the British embassy has turned down all visa applications, though very few, following the September 11 events.
The Italian embassy has further introduced a telephone service outside the building and has barred anyone from standing there.
A veterinarian, who declined to reveal his name, said his application was also rejected as he is bearded, even though he was scheduled to leave for Germany at the invitation of a German company to take part in an exhibition there.
The government had received a technical study from the Ministry of Electricity asking for converting the authority into a holding company that can bankroll its respective projects by means of selling services and technical consultation to the private and public sectors and foreign agencies.

The Secretary General of the National Council For Motherhood and Childhood, Ambassador Mushira Khattab, and the Manager of the Anglican Coptic Church's Freedom Program, Ehab Al Kharrat, signed a memorandum of understanding on cooperation for protecting young generations against the risks of drug abuse. The cooperation between the two sides will involve several activities that aim at development and protection of children and youths without discrimination on the basis of gender, religion or social disadvantages.
Under this headline Ali Said wrote:
Sidhoum ascribes that gross error (from his own point of view) "to giving credit to the Palestinian struggler who explodes himself in an Israeli restaurant, thus causing death and injuries to scores of innocents." He describes the commando operations victims as innocents, which makes one wonder whether one was reading an Israeli Watani Aharanoth!
I dare say that the Copts are a group which neither has any single body of views nor adopts any definite attitude.
Sidhom, the sectarianist, thinks that demonstrating on behalf of the Afghans rather than terrorism or Bin Laden is sympathizing with terrorism.
Thirdly, Given that the article is a mere personal argument, it has been in the wrong as it failed to reach objectivity as it dealt with the Palestinian and the Israeli positions on equal terms ignoring the wide difference between a victim and a victor.
The Palestinians who are killed while confronting the Israeli occupation are martyrs in the eyes of the whole world. I believe that Sidhoum had missed the bull's eye when he tried to express his views but I don't think that much harm has been done as the paper itself is has a limited circulation and readership even among Christian milieus and, even a comment or reply would therefore be unnecessary!
But, being given first aid, the wounded Palestinians were detained and shot dead in their heads by Israeli forces.
Some observers were perplexed Sa'adat's selection, for he had spend all his life in the Palestinian territories, did not belong to the generation of the founders of the PFLP and had never met the former secretary general and founder of the front, Dr George Habash.
A: If you look at the operation from the point of view of the struggle of our people, you will see that it was not aimed at holding up the efforts of anybody.
This is what has resulted from the Camp David negotiations on the so-called final solution issues in the Oslo Agreement.
This means that the Palestinian Authority, acting under the pretext of denying the occupiers the chance to exploit the new international conditions for expanding their aggression on our people, and bending under direct American and Israeli pressure, has once again opted to gamble on the same negotiations, the same conferences and same mechanisms that have brought out people into the situation they are in today.
We are united with the Authority in the management of the struggle of our people against the occupiers and their programs and policies, but we oppose the authority's view of the Intifada's function and its attempts for employing the Intifada for improving its negotiating position within the Oslo Agreement, which we see as an agreement that was born deformed and has become even more deformed as it passed through the Camp David process.
At internal level, there are contradictions in the domestic situation as a whole. There are irregularities in the rules that govern the relationship between the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people, including the aspects of unity of the people and the respect of its democratic rights, starting with the right to choose its representatives in leading organizations, beginning with the PLO, which symbolizes the political unity of our people and the tool for national liberation. The PLO should shoulder all the responsibilities prescribed for the authority created by the Oslo Agreement, on the basis of a modern Palestinian law that paves the ground for independence, sovereignty and disengagement from the occupation. The people must also be allowed to exercise the right of selecting their representatives in other institutions, including popular organizations, municipal councils and all other institutions of representative nature.
And we agree with Hamas and Jihad in particular on refusing to go back to negotiations and rejecting the calls for bringing the Intifada and the resistance to a halt under the pretext of cease-fire.
In short, the political map of Palestine is starting to take shape on three pillars: the secular, bourgeois Palestinian Authority, the Islamic trend and the Leftist demonstration trend.
Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa voiced his pessimism about the future of the Palestinian cause, saying, "The future of the Palestinian cause is very dim and blurry."
The secretary also termed the anti-Arab Western media campaigns as an expression of an anti-Arab world position that should be faced. (Front page)
The project is being considered in cooperation with the US-based World Organization for people with special needs.

An official source with the union said that a contract had been signed to export 5073 tons of Egyptian cotton of various kinds and categories to overseas markets. The source pointed out that the exportation policy adopted that year in pursuit of exporting cotton was based on a careful study of foreign markets that imported famous high quality Egyptian cotton. Marketing policy depends on maintaining what has already been achieved during the recent period regarding Egyptian cotton markets abroad and opening new markets to increase Egyptian cotton exports to overseas markets, he added.
11-The efforts of Egyptian commercial representation offices abroad have resulted in a number of achievements, which were listed in a report that the Minister of Foreign Trade, Dr Yousef Boutros Ghali, received from the Chief of the Commercial Representation Service, Al Said Qassim.
The report explained that the efforts for promoting investments in Egypt had resulted in creating 10 real opportunities for Indian investments, as major Indian companies would launch projects in Egypt. One of the projects agreed upon was a giant industrial complex that would be launched with $ 450 million for producing phosphate fertilizers at a daily capacity of 2,600 tons, all of which would go to export markets. Another project was a factory that would produce graphite pipes for the iron industry, concluded the report.
It is noteworthy that the PA has hosted a symposium on competition and the freedom of trade attended by members of the Egyptian Franco-cultured lawmen society and 60 French law and judicial men. Sorour affirmed that competition and freedom of trade are, in the first place, the core and mover of economic life in favor of consumers and companies.
17-In a step that aims at boosting Egyptian exports to overseas markets and opening new markets for Egyptian products abroad, the first directory of Egyptian exporters is being prepared. The directory will contain information on all Egyptian companies that operate in the exportation field at present or were engaged in export activities in the past but have stopped temporarily, as well as other companies that have export potentials, including details of what they export or intend to export and how to get in touch with them.
20-The Director General of the Agency for International Development (USAID) in Egypt, Willard Pearson, said that discussions were going on between the Egyptian government and the Agency with regard to helping Egypt bridge over the negative effects that had afflicted the Egyptian economy as a result of the 11 September incidents, particularly where the tourism sector and low-incomed groups were concerned. "We are also working for protecting employment potentials on the Egyptian market and looking for quick options for providing this support by giving Egyptian exports, which have increased by 40% over their volume in the past years, a better opportunity on the American market, and through financial subsidies," he explained.

59-Following the reshuffle of the economic cabinet, the Government will launch a set of important economic measures within the next few days that will include paying the debts owed by government bodies to suppliers and contractors and reducing the subsidy provided to economic organizations.
The shift in subordination of the National Investment Bank from the Ministry of Planning to the Ministry of Finance in the recent cabinet reshuffle is aimed at reinforcing the trend for curbing the subsidy provided to economic organizations, as the Ministry of Finance had persistently demanded reduction of the subsidy extended by the National Investment Bank to such organizations.
President Hosni Mubarak will chair the first Cabinet meeting to be held today (24 November) after the reshuffle to discuss the economic policies of the coming period.
In a report on economic developments and Arab markets during the second quarter of 2001, the Fund said that Egypt came third after Morocco, which was expected to show an economic growth rate of 7%, and Tunisia, which would show a 6.5% growth rate.

Many investors and international companies, he pointed out, showed willingness to enter the market to purchase these companies with the start of their floating procedures.

On the nature of the Iraqi-Turkish blueprint, the official of foreign relations of the Democratic Party, led by Mesut Parazani, said the plan "is a cover-up for opening a second gate on the borders and has already been carried out at the area of West Zakho (Fishkhabour), known as the Turkish-Iraqi-Syrian triangle through building two bridges; the first to be undertaken by the Turks on one of the branches of Tigris (Al-Khabour river), and the second to be built by the Iraqis on Tigris, north of Saddam Lake.
Organizations in the opposition had warned against a large-scale Iraqi build-up to the stretch of demarcation lines with the Kurdish-controlled areas.
The meeting, which was the first of its kind in Saudi Arabia, turned into a dialogue in which Prince Abdullah affirmed that some of women's rights ought to be considered.
He responded to a proposal by Dr Munira Al Alawla, Vice-dean of the Centre for Studies of Female Students at Imam Mohammad Bin Saud Islamic University, that exclusive sections be established in Sharia courts, civil affairs departments and police stations by saying, "I do agree with you, sister. It would be really difficult for a woman to plead her case before a male judge or some other official. However, the decision on your proposal rests with our brothers the judges, and, Allah willing, something good will come out of it."
The statements of Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Abdul Aziz came as a crowning to several statements that Saudi officials have said since early 1999, when a senior Saudi official told reporters that Saudi Arabia was working for broadening the scope of dealing and cooperating with women.
The Crown Prince had previously affirmed during the first meeting of King Abdul Aziz Foundation for Sponsoring Talent that talent was not a monopoly for men to the exclusion of women. "Women are an important part of this community, and we will not allow anyone to belittle them," he had said.

On the Lebanese-Syrian relations, Safir said, "We don't want to interfere in Syria's internal affairs and we want Lebanon, on the other hand, to run its own affairs without the interference of any body else. What we want for Syria, is also required for us, which is fair!
10-LEBANESE-AMERICAN RELATIONS SOURED BY BEIRUT'S REFUSAL TO FREEZE HEZBOLLAH'S ASSETS
While some official quarters are concerned over the risks of escalating American and Western pressures on Lebanon under the pretext of its refusal to respond to the American demands for freezing the accounts of Hezbollah and considering the Party as a terrorist group, other sources have indicated that Lebanon's move for making overtures to foreign countries is based on Beirut's assessment that some Western countries, particularly France, may not agree with the American stand with regard to Hezbollah.

The joint list announced by British Minister of Finance, Jordan Brown, came Less than 48 hours after British Premier Tony Blair had returned from a Middle Eastern round, reportedly intended to energize the peace process. It included Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Palestinian Liberation Front, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and its armed wing, Fateh Movement, the Revolutionary Council affiliated to Abou-Nidhal organization, and Lebanese Hezbollah.
Maher Al-Taher, spokesman of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, told Al- Hayat that his organization categorically rejected the list as "the Palestinian groups are struggling against occupation and their struggle complies with UN principles and charter as well as international law."
He added, "Who installed them as policemen of the world while we should resort to international law and the UN charter?"
Khaled Meshaal, chairman of the Political Bureau of Hamas Movement described the new measures as of little value. He criticized the attitudes of London and Washington confirming that neither had the eligibility or credibility for passing judgements or playing the role of a fair sponsor. Their record places them on the list of people's oppressors who support terrorism especially the Zionist one."

23-It appears that the moderate Peace Community Movement in Algeria stands to pay the price of a political mistake that its leader, veteran politician Mahfouz Nihnah, made in the past. The movement is apparently being asked to foot an old political bill that accrued from its current leader's contribution to the efforts for sending Algerian youths to fight in Afghanistan.
He said that he had personally sent about thirty groups of Algerians to Afghanistan to take part in the jihad against Soviet occupation, adding that a large number of those who had been sent by him and had returned home safely had not taken part in the terrorist attacks that had thrown the country into the whirlpool of violence a decade ago.

In its plans the American administration relies on the fact that the university curricula in some of these countries are based on the negation of the other and possibly fighting it. Hence, the religious discourse should be changed in the universities of Arab and Islamic universities.

First, I think it is important to point out that I am a member of the Nasserite Democratic Arab Party, although I do have my reservations on its leadership, and that I do not intend to leave it.
By so doing, Gamal Mubarak will avoid becoming a part of these Government and State bodies, funding his projects from their budgets, or from the contributions of businessmen, particularly those who owe money to banks. Besides, some of his projects may be regarded, even without proof, as undermining the principle of equal opportunity.
Making this difference clear is necessary, for it will demonstrate that Gamal Mubarak is leading a trend for renewal within the party. It would be preferable if his opinions disagreed with those of even the President himself in public.

Jihad, as defined by the Islamic Research Organization, is "defending the fatherland against occupation and plunder of wealth. This definition is a general one that does not accurately explain the nature of the present situation in many parts of the Arab and Islamic worlds and whether the definition applies to them, nor does it say whether it is necessary for all Muslim countries and all Muslims to declare jihad as Usama Bin Laden is doing.
"I believe that the connection between Al Azhar and the Government has weakened the former's role, as a result of the common conviction that it expresses the official viewpoint.
It is interesting that the Grand Sheikh of Al Azhar, Dr Mohammad Sayed Tantawi, held two press conferences within one week after the September attacks in the United States, although his main role is not to respond to the claims of Western media."
The chief editor of the Religious Status Report in Al Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies, Dia Rashwan, observed that the definition provided by Al Azhar for jihad was closer to the concept of legitimate resistance against aggression or occupation. He also pointed out that Al Azhar had set a specific time for jihad, namely the time when "exceptional conditions" exist.

58-TO WHOSE INTEREST EGYPTIAN STREET IS "CONTROLLED" AND OPPOSITION CARD BURNT?
The campaign against the centrist Islamists in Egypt took place at the same time when Lebanon rejected the US terrorist list, involving all Lebanese and Palestinian resistance organizations, and declined to impose any restrictions on Hezbollah's assets at Lebanese banks. Meanwhile, Syria also turned down any actions against resistance organizations hosted by Damascus, while Arafat was under pressure from the mafia of Western envoys to abort the Palestinian Intifada and suppress its activities. After all, should Egypt be a marginalized and unweighty country, no one will pay heed to what is going on there.
In his article, he sought to intimidate the Saudi and Egyptian rulers for being responsible for generating the terrorists who perpetrated the September 11th attack.
If the motive behind continuously cutting the Islamic trend to size is to secure the single party's hegemony over the rule and its leaders' related interlocked interests, why does the Egyptian regime object to actions by the single superpower against anti-US hegemony liberation and resistance movements to insure its interests in line with its special law, which was cooked to undermine these movements?
Spokesman of the US Department of State Richard Poutcher was quoted as saying, "We receive major cooperation from the Arab and Muslim world. We saw some countries carrying out arrests and others imposing financial restrictions."
Today, the matter recurs through arrests, whose perilous reflections on the regional situation are not felt by the Egyptian ruler.
Passers by in Al-Malik Al-Salih Street near the Nile in Manyal Al-Roudha district are not surprised at the sounds produced by wireless devices hidden by policemen in ordinary clothes who move about or just stand or sit at some corner of the street. Nor are they surprised at the heavy activities of street sellers whose faces never tell their craft as they are disguised to watch some particular person or body!
Egyptians, with their customary sense of humour, relate the situation to the "secret airport" anecdote before the 1967 War when bus conductors used the expression to remind passengers of their destinations and the site was heavily bombed during the war because it was no secret to anybody.
Al-Hayat asked Dr Issam Al-Iryan "Do you think the Americans might bomb your premises after the recent developments?"
Professor of Forensic Medicine and Toxins, Dr. Abla Afifi, who doubles as deputy Dean of Al-Azhar Faculty of Medicine (girls) says that the new subject is about medical good conduct from a religious perspective, which is a completely new idea based on teaching doctors what is religiously permissible or impermissible regarding contemporary issues like organ transplants, surrogate wombs, abortion, circumcision, semen banks, etc.
The new idea has been approved by both Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh and Al-Azhar University Rector. It will be treated as a separate subject with 50 marks. Students are meant to be made conversant with medicine and religion so that they will act as doctors and advocates and promoters of the faith.
For the first time in the history of Egyptian universities, a female Coptic student will be appointed to the post of Islamic studies and Arabic language demonstrator in an Egyptian faculty.
Christine's story rather throws light on the Egyptian street as well as behind walls away from propagandist behaviour in order to point out the nature of relations between social parties, each of which belongs to a different creed, but placed the country's interests above any other consideration when the business of choice was at issue.

In this context, we have made a full success. Today, we can sum up this year's experiment that Arafat can not dare to say that he has achieved anything.
* Preventing the collapse of the PNA as we decided to beat it with points, rather than knock it out. * Regarding the media battle, although many people object to giving army leaders the right to make statements, we have maintained a direct contact with people, explained our positions and raised people's morale.

The Secretary General of Hizbullah Organization, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, said that Lebanon, with its elements of power, was the real target of listing Hizbullah on the list of terrorist groups distributed by the United States Administration, which "seeks to hit three targets with one shot through such action." He elaborated, saying, "The United States wants to turn resistance into terrorism, thus dividing the Lebanese people over this issue and undermining the national unity of Lebanon. This will also drive Lebanon out of the arena of the conflict with Israel and abandon Syria, which Lebanon still urgent needs. It will also lead to demands that Lebanon punish its youths who fought against Israel."

11-A number of challenges face the new Foreign Trade Ministry especially in its efforts to increase exports and develop the infrastructure of the Egyptian foreign trade, as far as imports or exports are concerned. Experts affirm that the basic task of the new ministry is linked to President Mubarak's directives to the government to deal with the exportation issue as a life and death case because the continuation of the development efforts is contingent upon increasing our exportation capabilities to overseas markets.
According to concluded preferential trade agreements, Egypt deals with 12 Arab countries, 32 African, 16 Asian, 7 from both Americas and 19 East European ones.
In statements to Al-Hayat, Minister of Finance, Medhat Hassanin stressed the importance that the State budget be changed into "a budget of resources, programmes and performance, rather than expenditure". The problem lies in the fact that the volume of revenues retreats while that of the expenditure increases, he pointed out.
Hassanin pointed out that there were studies to form working groups in a bid to liquidate the companies that went bankrupt in Egypt. "Egypt's tax and customs resources will be affected in the coming stage due to the introduction of various international agreements, such as; GATT, European partnership, common Arab market and COMESA, something which will overburden the State budget.
He also affirmed that the financing of the development plan was proceeding according to the timetables of the projects listed in the plan.
He added that the Government's commitment to payment of allocations on time as per the timetables of projects completely closed the issue of dues to any quarters, which agreed with the Government's insistence on closing the file of outstanding dues by the end of FY 2001/02 on 30 June 2002.

Accountant Ahmad Atef, Chairman of the Chamber of Printing, said, "We submitted a petition to the Minister of Industry and Technological Development, in which we requested an appointment for discussing this problem. The problem has resulted from Egypt's signing of a number of bilateral agreements with some Arab countries for establishing the Free Trade Zone, which provides privileges and customs exemptions to Arab producers at the expense of their Egyptian counterparts. The distortions in the customs duty tariff have also contributed to the problem, as they make imported raw materials and production requirements that are used in making packing materials more expensive than the end products imported from those Arab countries with which Egypt has bilateral agreements. Some foodstuff producers now import their packing materials from Arab countries, which threatens Egyptian factories and printing houses operating in this field with closure."

The statement pointed out that, domination and exclusion from rights fall into the category of the totalitarian orientations of the ruling party."
In Kuwait, citizen Majid Al Matiri was arrested in the case of assassination of a Canadian citizen last month.
But the scenes that go unobserved are certainly more hideous.
By adopting oppressive measures for combating terrorism, Arab governments will only be raking the embers of terrorism in an unprecedented manner.

"The Government promptly issued statements to denounce the 11 September attacks and expressed solidarity with the United States, but it has not adopted any public stance on the military operations launched by the United States against the Muslim afghan people," he said.
MFA, Al Quds Al Arabi, 8/11/2001
The fulfillment of all legislative requirements for joining the treaty as per Libyan laws will take place as early as possible.
Soad Belqassemi, an Algerian lady writer living in London, wrote: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has not fallen under such a hostile media campaign since the Kuwait Liberation War.
They also accuse Saudi Arabia of funding terrorist organizations, from Al Qaeda to Islamic and nationalist organizations that resist the Zionist occupation in Palestine, the Russians in Chechnya and the Indians in Kashmir.
The American Administration has not stopped at that; it is demanding a comprehensive change in Saudi Arabia, by which the Royal Family would sever all relations with what the Administration considers as religious extremism and terrorism. Such changes would include modernization of the Kingdom to make it compatible with the Western way of life, which, if it does happen, means that Saudi Arabia would be a country that is just a little different from any Western country. All aspects of Islam would disappear, and the Saudis would have to allow their holy country to mutate into something that would be much similar to Los Angeles, San Francisco or even Hollywood.
Saudi Arabia is certainly on the list of those whose accounts must be settled, particularly as a result of the growing importance of Islamist advocates and reformers and the presence of Osama Bin Laden, who continues to charge Saudis in particular and Muslims in general against the West and Israel.
However, it seems that the former current is now predominant, particularly as Saudi security services have carried out sweeping clampdowns on Islamist activists who are believed to sympathize with the afghan cause and censored those prominent scholars who are still alive, for many of the sheiks died over the past few years.
BIN LADEN ASKS HIS COMPANIONS TO KILL HIM IF AMERICANS TRIED TO CAPTURE HIM
Bin Laden believes that it is better for him to die at the hands of one of his close companions or sons, instead of being captured by his foes.
The sources believed that finding Bin Laden "dead" is the "best way out" for the Bush Administration because this is "much better" than arresting Al-Qaeda Leader and referring him to the American Military Court, due to be formed to try Al-Qaeda Organization members.
The first factor is money, which can tempt many people to help the Americans in determining the whereabouts of Bin Laden, especially as the Bush Administration has earmarked $25 million for he who gives information that will actually lead to the arrest or elimination of Al-Qaeda Organization leader.
CONGRESS DELEGATION IN BEIRUT: IT IS TIME FOR HIZBULLAH TO BECOME POLITICAL PARTY
While the American delegation said nothing about his reported wish to meet Hizbullah leadership, a source told Al-Hayat that the delegation did not convey any severe message regarding the party. All it said was simply restoration of the previous attitude to the effect that the Americans do understand the fact that all liberation movements start with organizations like Hizbullah and then develop in the course of time. Now it is time Hizbullah it changed into a party that lays down arms and devotes itself to social and political respects.
National Security Advisor, Condolezza Rice had talked about that in a TV interview a few days ago.
M.S. Al-Hayat, 21/11/2001
He added that the inclusion of Hizbullah and resistance groups on the American lists of terrorism came in response to Israeli wishes and demands.
M.S. Al-Hayat, 20/11/2001
Washington has always maintained a minimum degree of stability to ensure enough strength of the central government to be able to hold ground as a strong negotiator in the peace process that would have to reach results.
He is not like Osama Bin Laden, about whom opinions are divided due to his policies and orientations that are extensively rejected in Arab societies.
That might be called an Iranian scrambling towards Washington under the cloak of contributing to the transportation of troops which is supposed to be humanitarian meant to extend relief and prepare airports for that end.
Some countries in the region have already been arbitrarily reading the September 11th data and the American conditions for integrating into the new order following the disappearance of the third option, any third option can be hazy, gray or temporary to avoid conflict with the White House.
Even Europe has been intervening through the exercise of further pressures on the Palestinians in a bid to complete the mission of the Americans and the Israelis, whose security, in particular, has gained absolutely top priority.
In this context, calls for disarming and taming Hezbollah as well as closing Palestinian opposition file can be understood!
It is the United States that is now eliminating the Russians' enemies in Afghanistan and surrendering the keys of Afghan cities to the Northern Alliance, which will in turn open the doors of these cities wide to Russian influence, for the Northern Alliance is tied to the Russians by strategic relations, ethnic affiliations and common interests, not to mention its permanent need for Russian protection against other Afghan forces.
So, the Afghan bed of thorns is now hurting the foreign feet that are trying to stand on it, and the Americans are facing the most difficult situation that a country's foreign policy can run into.
Will it make a U-turn, pouncing on the Northern Alliance and leaving the Taliban be? And if it does, what will it say to the world to justify the shift in its policy?
It remains for us to know that the Afghan President, Burhannuddin Rabbani, did not enter Kabul until he had received a green light from Russian President Putin to do so during their recent meeting in Duschanbe.

Al-Oleimi pointed out in the same context that the new generation, either that of the Nasserites or the Ikhwanites, should set these scores aside and pay heed to the independents interests in the parliament, especially as there are new problems facing independent MPs in light of the new tendency of using the electoral list system. It is noteworthy that the list system appeals to different political parties. Independents, consequently, are placed in the same trench in defence of their position as independents on the map of parliamentary elections.
In a statement released on 15 November, the organization said that the defendants had been referred to the Court Martial less than one month after their arrest, which raised several question marks about a defendant's right to have adequate time to prepare his defence, given the high speed at which the case had been processed, in addition to the exhaustion of defendants as a result of questioning that went on for over ten hours everyday. The organization described that action as a severe violation of the guaranties required for preparation of legal defence and the presentation of such defence to investigative authorities in a comprehensive manner that made it possible to refute all charges and present all possible defences. It also pointed out the action as a violation of Article 14 of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, which gives every defendant the right to have enough time and facilities for preparing his defence or contacting a counsel of his own choice.
AN AMERICAN ORGANIZED CAMPAIGN TO LIQUIDATE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD
The reports, to be referred to the American President to take the appropriate decision, pointed out that Egypt is the main centre for Muslim Brotherhood adding that one of the assets of the Egyptian ruling regime is that it could contain the power and influence of Muslim Brotherhood.
It appears that the US Administration is not content with combating what it claims to be terrorism in Muslim countries with all the tools and firepower in its arsenal, for its policies have now extended to include teaching the young generations of Arab and Muslim countries new values, so that they may grow up in an environment that is free from extremist and racist influences, as the Americans say.
The American organization has also established a dedicated website through which pupils can chat on the Internet, and has allocated a budget for groups tours for Egyptian and American pupils that aim at consolidating the concepts of coexistence and tolerance among them.
She also called for revitalization of the role of educational institutions in teaching values to the young generations, instead of letting American organizations prey on our children and teach them their venomous ideas and the hatred they harbour towards Arabs and Muslims, which would certainly have grave consequences.

Public Enterprise Sector Minister, Dr. Mokhtar Khattab, rejected the criticism levelled against the ministry's opting for renting rather than selling some companies to investors. Renting is one of the alternatives permitted by privatization as the ministry does not depend on only one alternative, Khattab said. The market conditions and the positions of companies are the determiners of the appropriate alternative, whether to sell to an anchor investor, put up shares for subscription, rent or sell to employees, Khattab added.
The losing companies put up for sale include 14 enterprise for cotton, spinning, textiles and ready-made clothes, 6 for trading, 10 for engineering, 5 for construction, one for maritime transport, 3 for chemicals, one for pharmaceuticals, 2 for metal industries and 7 for foodstuffs including six through partnership with investors.
There have been 66 loss-making companies this year against 42 losers last year, official sources were quoted as saying.
The reform plan was a failure due to the stay of inefficient leaderships in their positions, particularly at spinning and weaving companies and metal and engineering industries, notwithstanding rising losses, the sources added. Sounding the alarm about the impacts of the continued present-day conditions on the businesses, the sources uncovered a rise in combined losses of 42 concerns up to 50 percent of their capitals. They also laid bare that a drive to reform and save major enterprises, including Egypt Helwan for Spinning of nearly 1 billion pounds in losses and Kafr al-Dawar for Spinning of 500 million pounds in losses and Helwan Company for Iron and Steel which incurred 500 million pounds in losses, was doomed to fiasco. Meanwhile, negotiations over the settlement of companies' debts to banks faltered as necessary cash fluidity for clearing settlement down payments was not provided, they pointed out.
11-Minister of Transport Ibrahim al-Demiry said EgyptAir, a national airline, has suffered 350 million US dollars in losses since the black Tuesday event in the United States.

The ADB does not ask for any guarantees or pledges from the government to the private sector enterprises it funds in Egypt, he said, pointing out that what was needed was that the ADB offer to finance the project would not be turned down by the government.
He added that the investment fund divides its capital into investment documents and it is possible to double the value of these documents seven years later when it is liquidated. The fund can be bankrolled by the Tourism Promotion Authority and a group of investors, he said.

46-MUBARAK: RECONSIDERING BANK LOANS CONDITIONS
Regarding some criticism of the BOT system, president Mubarak said; " I have some criticism over the BOT system as it must help us in exportation. What happened mustn't occur again as a certain company had constructed a power station in Sedi Krir and had borrowed the hard currencies from our banks."
An official source in the Central Bank of Egypt said that the banks had stopped all negotiations after the replacement of the Central Bank governor in early October.
He affirmed that the delinquent debtors had also accused banks of not taking into consideration the market conditions and the persistence of the state of recession that had led to a bloating of unsold stockpiles in the warehouses of many businessmen and merchants, now that the purchasing power of citizens had gone down so much that the businessmen and merchants were no longer able to sell their products.
He said, "The bank is also considering financing a number of industrial projects connected with the manufacture of electronics and petroleum production equipment. The Romanian party can supply full production lines for companies operating in prospecting for oil.

He added, "This is very important, so that those with evil intentions may not drag us into a conflict of religions that could lead to worldwide catastrophes.

This was said by Askar Mosinov, Khazakhstan's ambassador in Cairo. He added that economic cooperation relations between the two countries are making extensive progress. He pointed out that in a few days' time, an agreement on a direct air route between Cairo and Alma-Ata will have been signed in order to help businessmen in both countries to promote joint cooperation.
President Hosni Mubarak's decision to cancel the Ministry of Economy has71- "temporarily" deflected the economists and concerned people's attention from trying to find a way for the national economy out of its problems following the 11th September incidents. It also raised many questions about the future of the economic group in Egypt.
Noticeably, Ghali relatively succeeded in controling the exchange market, but failed in the field of exportation.
According to the fresh shake-up, the Ministry of Economy will be scrapped, while the minister of trade is to map out export and import policies.
At an upcoming meeting on November 18, the Cabinet will discuss a draft law to combat laundering, activate markets and redress the deficit in foreign currency resources as exports have been negatively affected by the September 11 events.

2-HAH, Al-Quds Al-Arabi, 27/11/2001
Gil'ad voiced belief that the Palestinian-Israeli conflict would continue even if all Israeli settlements in the Western Bank were dismantled and the Palestinian territories were left by Israel.
7-The Cable and Satellite Council, which supervises television airing from and to Israel, decided to comprehensively consider the issue of Arab satellites which are transmitted to Israeli houses, (particularly among Arabs and 1948 Palestinians). A decision will be made concerning whether the transmission of these satellites will go on or not.
In case the council drops the transmission of these channels, the average citizen can purchase a satellite dish and receives whatever he wants," she added.
What is really serious is the fact that those two crimes were carried out at a time the Palestinian side had abided by the Palestinian cease fire instructions. This emphasized that Israel did not want a halt of violence as it makes use of it as a pretext for the continuation of its occupation and crimes against the Palestinians.
They would have, certainly, broken that strange silence and used all means of denunciation and complaints if those killed were Israelis.

43-EGYPTIAN PARLIAMENT SPEAKER BANS DISCUSSIONS OF INTERNATIONAL EVENTS TO AVOID SOURING EGYPT'S INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
45-M.S. Asharq Al-Awsat, 4/12/2001
A Violation of Sovereignty: 	Former director of Foreign Ministry's International Law Department ambassador Ibrahim Yasier has warned against the agreement items considered to be blatant violations of national sovereignty as well as outstanding constitutional violation.
The agreement contains serious items in the field of judicial cooperation in the field of crimes, information and evidence exchange as well as warrants of houses and persons searching. This is really serious as it would give Washington the right to ask for information and evidence as well as access to bank secret accounts.
- It will not only serve the purposes of American demands but will also serve Israel and the American allies.
Justice Al-Gamal says, "According to the constitution, no state may hand its citizen over to another country to be investigated for crimes that took place on its lands.
There will be no equality in getting access to exchanged information. America will never extradite any American national to be tried before Egyptian courts which means that Egypt has been mandated to America!
In his first quest for notification, to the Minister of Transport Ibrahim Al-Demeri, the deputy of the leftist Tagamo'h Party, Al-Badri Farghali disclosed that the war-tax imposed by the international insurance bodies on the Egyptian harbours exceeded that imposed on neighbouring harbours so as to put maritime routes off the Egyptian sea ports.
Through the agreement explicatory notes, Farghali disclosed that the US had given Jordanian garments access without customs taxes, or any restrictions concerning quantity. The US, on the other hand, imposes customs duties on the Egyptian garments that enter the US and determines its quantities, Farghali added.

They pointed out that that meant that a highly popular political force was discounted.
If, however, the committee on political parties had precluded the formation of any parties, the government must reshuffle its own cards and realize that the 17 Muslim Brotherhood deputies in the People's Assembly are the biggest opposition bloc in the parliament compared with the Grouping Party that has only six deputies, or Al-Wafd which has four deputies or the Nasserite Party that has two deputies or the Liberal Party which has one deputy.
61-MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD INVITE GOVERNMENT TO POLITICAL DIALOGUE
Khalid Fayyad, representative of the Ministry of Awqaf, said that the recent events that followed the war against Afghanistan had sown the seeds of despair in hearts. "These events made us feel that darkness would continue and wrong will prevail, but eventually Allah will send down His Mercy to this nation in a way that is unexpected by the West, which stands idle and watches the annihilation of Palestinian schoolchildren, with their born bodies flying everywhere, but demands that we relinquish most of our land."
Commenting on Al Osboa's article about American pressure on the Egyptian Government for surrendering Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Egypt for trial in the United States under the pretext that they represented the sources of terrorism, Eng Ali Abdel Fattah, a Muslim Brotherhood leader in Alexandria, made a statement on the margins of the party. He said, "America has exploited the 11 September attacks to have military bases in Pakistan to search the country and destroy its nuclear reactor, control the oil of the Caspian Sea, threaten Iran and curb China's growth. It is also trying to control the ruling regimes of world countries under the pretext of counterterrorism, without having any definition of terrorism other than the one that exists in the mentality of the American bully. Therefore, it has demanded that each and every ruling regime in the world submit a report on the destruction and restriction of Islamic movements in its country, including moderate movements and others that are not moderate, so that there would be no chance for the growth of Islam, which is considered as the greatest danger to globalization, westernization and obliteration of identity."
In particular, there is a big question about whether the visit was motivated by the disagreement that had begun to surface between Ashoor and Muslim Brotherhood members in the Bar Association Council, especially in light of Noah's reported anger at these members for neglecting their duty towards him. Or was the visit a gesture of solidarity with a leading member of the Bar Association from the Chairman who should stand by lawyers in their distress, particularly as Ashoor had visited Noah immediately after he had become chairman, and had also promised before the elections to work for the release of lawyers who had been jailed in other cases?
He affirmed that the disagreement between him and the Muslim Brotherhood was nothing more than a difference in views and that he himself had no reasons for any other disagreements. "Besides," he added, "I deal with them according to the law and in the interests of lawyers."
67-MAARIV ACCUSES "AL-WA'D" OF SUPPLYING HAMAS WITH ANTIAIRCRAFT MISSILES
A few days ago, Israeli newspaper Maariv published a lengthy report on Al-Wa'd Organization case pointing out that the 94 member organization had planned about six months ago to assassinate President Mubarak through a booby trap on Al-Galaa Bridge. Egyptian security, however, managed to detonate it before the President procession arrived. The newspaper added that the organization had held contacts last year with Palestinian Resistance Movement (Hamas) which led to agreements to offer technical devices to blast tanks by using natural gas pipelines in Gaza. The newspaper alleged that Hamas had asked some leaderships of Al-Wa'd Organization to provide it with antiaircraft missiles in order to down Israeli helicopters. Some leaderships of the organization have been entrusted with forging passports to infiltrate volunteers into the occupied land and raise donations estimated at thousands of dollars to train fighters of the Islamic Resistance Movement.
Hannoon said in the "Forum" seminar held by a local weekly newspaper that President Zeroual had affirmed to her that the Death Battalions had not worked for government bodies as had been the case in Latin America, but had been employed by the economic interest groups that had emerged in Algeria in the wake of the adoption of the economic open-door policy.
"These 'quarters' seek their own economic interests in Algeria within the context of economic globalization," she said, pointing out that the real cause of the problem in Algeria lay in the conflict between the advocates of American interference and the supporters of French interference.

It is time for us to give these audiences accurate information from original sources.
The importance of the study lies in the fact that it deals with a very serious issue that has not been discussed in sufficient detail by Arab or foreign media before, despite the schemes it involves that run against the most basic principles of international law. This project aims at undermining Arab interests and is a violation of the peace treaties signed by the Zionist entity with Egypt and Jordan. It even unveils the true character of the artificial Hebrew State, a character that is built on wriggling out of treaties and conventions and the belief that only the interests of the Jews must be sought, on the grounds that the Jews are God's chosen people.
The study discusses all the dimensions of the Two Seas Canal Project, as Israel calls it, with an academic approach, supporting its information with documents and analyzing the project's background and obstacles in an accurate scientific manner that mirrors the seriousness of the studies published by Zayed Centre for Coordination and Follow-up on the one hand and unveils the real character of Zionist expansionist projects on the other.
The Arabs and Israel have United Nations resolutions that have been adopted in more than a half-century and were accepted by the Palestinians and rejected by Israel.
Israel wants the Palestinian state to be unarmed.
We have the right to ask: does America have enough confidence that Israel will give these rights to their owners, i.e. the Palestinians?

32-MT / Al-Quds Al-Arabi, 19/11/2001
The United States Administration has persisted in its efforts for frustrating the Egyptian- Libyan initiative on the Sudanese problem since the initiative was proposed on 6 October 1997, just as it had blocked the implementation of Cairo Agreement on Somalese national reconciliation that was concluded in December 1997.
That was why the United States has rejected the Egyptian-Libyan initiative for national reconciliation in Sudan and called for merging that initiative into the IGAD initiative that has been faltering since 1994. However, the IGAD initiative is based on a proposal for a self- determination referendum in southern Sudan, as if it were an occupied territory in Sudan, which is a violation of all international laws and norms, while the Egyptian-Libyan initiative is built on Sudanese territorial integrity and focuses on finding a federal solution to its problems. The Egyptian-Libyan initiative rejects the scheme for separating an essential part of Sudanese soil on ethnic and religious bases that would destroy African relations.

We don't respond to the enemies of Sudan who wish it would be struck", Bashir added.
The source went on to say that since the outbreak of the Afghani crisis and due to the presence of a big number of Afghan refugees on the Iranian borders, the Iranian Islamic Republic has participated in effective humanitarian initiatives and sent humanitarian aid several times through air or land.
On the other hand, the statement showed surprise at the reports of Rifa'i Ahmed Taha arrival (an Egyptian Islamic Group leadership) from Tehran to Damascus.

To simplify his two programs, Dr Hassanain said, "If the education of a primary school pupil costs a thousand pounds per year, I must give the Minister of Education a budget that covers the costs of all the pupils registered in primary schools, without additions or petty expenses, and the Minister of Education must give the community a pupil who received useful education worth the thousand pounds."
Perhaps his turf will include the proposed antitrust organization.
Another loser: Ali Al Si'eedi.
But Al Si'eedi began his actions by closing the file that Abaza had opened.
Ali Al Si'eedi's success depends on the success of the European program for modernization of Egyptian industry.

Managing director of Al-Helal Exchange Firm, Hanafi Abdel-Halim said the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) recent monetary policies were still constant which was obviously reflected in the exchange companies retreating demand for the dollar at a time when there were a slight increase in these companies' supply. This way, companies are compelled to sell their all day proceeds to the banks at a value of about 10 million US dollars. The profit margin of the dollar gained by exchange firms has gone back, as before, to LE0.001 and LE0.0015 per dollar due to the decreasing demand for the dollar by exchange companies and banks' monopoly of all the dollar supply at the market, which would compel exchange companies to buy the dollar at its highest permissible price, thus decreasing the profit margin, he pointed out.
An official source said that the decision came in response to the effects of the 11 September bombings in the United States, which had impacted on world economy and were still casting negative shadows over all markets, pointing out that all the contracts that had been concluded in the past were being implemented.

The Arab Afghans, who arrived in Somalia, agreed at several meetings in Mogadishu to establish a major Islamic country in the Horn of Africa.
Second; the Reform, which focuses on political action and practices educational and media activities.

They tried to justify such fears by claiming that since the Uniscom forces withdrawal in 1998, there has been a big gap in estimating the volume and capacity of mass destruction weapons.

80.		This came in an article by staff major general Salah El-Din Seleim.
I, in person, hope only that the summit brings about a new resolution that will repeat the decision of immediately severing diplomatic relations with any country that would transfer its embassy to Jerusalem.

The area of Galilee repeatedly turned into a battlefield in the recent decade before and after the declaration of Israel.
When the Israeli government failed to attract Jews to the area, it established nuclei of settlements inhabited by a few adventurers. It grants a person or his family of a 3-4 member group a large area of 1000- 3500 donams and provides them with fences, water, power and a makeshift house over a hill or maintain and allow them to freely work on farming, cattle-breeding and others activities.
Official statistics show that notwithstanding all Judaisation projects and concomitant development and construction works for Jews only, Arabs constitute 52 percent of the population there.

I've already sensed that patriotic spirit in all my dealings with him."

An official banking source in one of the four government-controlled banks said that the amount of dollars that the Central Bank had promised to supply to banks to help them open import credits and cover their overdraft represented only 20% of the dollar shortage in banks.
41-Banking sources revealed that imminent changes in the ranks of banking leaderships were being planned, pointing out that reshuffle would be announced once the Government finished drafting the bills on regulating the banking system, which would give the Central Bank of Egypt wider terms of reference for drawing the country's monetary policy and reinforce its authority over the different units of the banking system.

Al Ahram Al Arabi learned that the study was financed by a foreign agency operating in Egypt and is aimed at destroying the reputation of Egyptian cotton in favour of American pima cotton. The war between Egyptian cotton and pima cotton started in 1992, and the two sides are expected to resort to new techniques this year in their bids to control the world cotton markets.
The Fund for Subsidizing the Spinning and weaving Industry attacked the study on the grounds that the comparison it held was incorrect and contained an obvious injustice to the Egyptian spinning and weaving industry, as the study had selected the data from only one Egyptian company that was facing acute financial problems, which raised the overall costs of its yarn products, besides being a non-exporting company to start with. Such a choice gave countries that imported Egyptian yarn the impression that they were facing a case of dumping that gave them grounds for filing complaints against Egyptian companies, the critics of the study protested, pointing out that the study was in fact a sort of provocation at the time when patriotic duty necessitated avoidance of anything that could curb Egypt's exportation capabilities, particularly the publication of figures that harmed the national industry.

Al-Sayed affirmed that competition on Arab markets had become fierce and that the state of recession on the property market had persisted despite all the facilities offered to customers. "The performance of the contracting companies themselves has been affected by encroachment on land and delay of building permits. Consequently, we have made an agreement with Egyptian commercial attaches abroad to make joint studies of overseas markets and sign up insurance companies to cover the risks of contracting operations abroad. A new company will also be established under the B. O. T. system to create demand for contracting at domestic and external levels and enhance the capability of Egyptian contracting companies to land contracts in Arab and African countries. Overseas markets are the best option for getting the Egyptian contracting and infrastructure sector out of its current slump."

This is the reason behind the selection of Ahmed Maher because he was Egypt's ambassador in Moscow and Washington and closely followed up the details of the Arab- Israeli conflict, particularly when he was Egypt's ambassador in Washington. Ahmed Maher also participated in several events related to the peace process, such as Camp David and Taba.

Dr. Mohamed Emara, an Islamic thinker, said the Jews have no right to Palestine's territories. They say they have ancient Jewish synagogues in Palestine. All invaders leave temples in the countries they invade, and the existence of such temples does not give the invaders political or historic rights in the land they occupy.
39- Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar Dr. Mohamed Sayed Tantawi has called for adopting a unified Arab and Muslim stance to support the Palestinian, Lebanese and Syrian peoples in their struggle against Israel's aggression that perpetrated all kinds of brutal crimes against the Muslims and others who are the sons of the Arab homeland in the occupied territories.
42- Under this headline, Fahmi Heweidi wrote an article which ran to the following effect, only in part:
46- We should remember that the land has been the root of the conflict with the Zionists. From the beginning of British occupation of Palestine in 1947 and until the beginning of 1948, its area hit 26 million and 320 thousand donums (a donum is 1000 metres square. According to the contracts registered with British mandate government, the Jews owned one million and 491 thousand donums constituting 5.66% only of Palestine's area.
Such contempt of the Palestinians and the Arabs have been demonstrated by the decision-making elite in Israel and is both approved of and backed by the political milieus in general. No denunciation of such a policy, as far as we know, has been announced by any of such milieus.
Such logic would tempt the Israelis to carry on with their crimes taking it for granted that the main Arab military power would tolerate what is happening!

EGYPT'S IMPORTS ALMOST STOPPED43- 44-Al-Ahram Al-Arabi publishes an interview with Mustafa Zaki, Chairman of the Importers' Division at the Chambers of Commerce Federation.
Now, the rate of foreign components in any investment in Egypt stands at 60%. Almost every new factory imports its investment goods. Raw materials occupy the second rank at a rate of 16% of Egypt's total imports. Wheat is included in this rate, although it is a strategic commodity.
Answer: The private sector's imports represent about 60% of Egypt's total imports. The private sector imports intermediary and investment commodities, constituting 80% of the 60% rate. Importation is made via the factory owners. However, some owners do not desire to make the importation process themselves, so we make it on behalf of them.
This point is said, supposing that the military conditions will remain as they are at present.
Question: Does this mean that our importers have totally stopped importation?

50-The 11 September incidents in the United States have resulted in tremendous pressures on world economies, including the Egyptian economy that suddenly found itself surrounded by several challenges, the most serious of which being the drop in the foreign exchange resources generated by tourism, Suez Canal tolls, expatriate remittances and exports, whose volume has gone down steeply. This state of affairs has put economic policymakers in a very awkward situation, in which they are torn between an acute shortage of foreign exchange resources and an unprecedented demand on foreign currencies. As a consequence, the exchange rate of the US dollar has soared to alarming levels, so that a US dollar now brings close to LE 4.9 on the black market. Meanwhile, foreign exchange from banks have backed up to a total of about $ 3 billion that the Central Bank has to come up with immediately.
Ali Negm, former governor of the Central Bank and current president of Delta International Bank, affirmed that the deficit in foreign exchange inputs was not less than $ 3 billion at present and would deteriorate further as the resources continued to decline. He pointed out that the impact on foreign exchange reserves would depend on the policy that the Government would adopt, indicating that there were three options for covering that deficit. "First, there is foreign borrowing, which will increase the country's foreign debt. Second, the Government could use a part of its foreign exchange reserves, which would have serious consequences, as resorting to this option should be accompanied by measures for decreasing the demand on US dollars by curbing imports, travel abroad for sightseeing and medical treatment and all other activities that involve the use of foreign currencies.
Abdel Rahman Baraka, board member of the Egyptian Banks Union, stressed the need for Central Bank interference for closing the gap between supply and demand on foreign currencies. "However, if the Central Bank continues to interfere under this policy while the balance of trade deficit continues to deteriorate, this will certainly impact on foreign exchange reserves, and we could lose all these reserves within one year or a couple of years" he warned. "However, while linking the Egyptian pound to a basket of currencies will not preclude the soaring of the US dollar's exchange rate, such linkage is better than the current situation, as our trade with Europe is larger than that with the United States and the exchange rate of the dollar against other currencies may go up or down. This will spare us the risks of linking the Egyptian pound to the US dollar alone."

"The delegation carries ideas on the money laundering law, whose final draft is being prepared at present and will be submitted to the People's Assembly for passing shortly, so as to determine whether the proposed bill is in agreement with the international principles for combating money laundering" he said.

As to the importance of unification of specifications in Arab countries and its impact on facilitating bilateral trade among them, the study said that due to Arab countries' involvement in the auto manufacture and assembly industry, Arab specifications organizations had published close to 400 specification, which had created unnecessary technical obstacles that had obviously hindered the access of Arab products to world markets. It pointed out that the multiplicity of specifications and the lack of coordination among them were behind the most serious hindrances of the Arab auto industry, including high costs of evaluation of compliance, which were added to the price of the commodity, delay of clearance of products by tests, prevention of Arab auto industry of mass production, loss of export markets, delay of procedures and adoption of stringent specifications by some countries as a means of protection to their national industries.

1.		"OFFICIAL PRICE" FOR SHURA COUNCIL SEATS
He explained the phenomenon as a tax that citizens impose in their own way on candidates who had money. "Although some may see this phenomenon as provocative, it is just a realistic outlook on the conditions of the Egyptian community, whose members use their own philosophy to insure that the candidate is able to meet their needs and provide services to them, particularly as the candidate businessman has no track record of public work."

31.		Regarding reports about the Vatican acquitting the Jews of the charge of assaulting Christ, the Patriarch said the Vatican meant to acquit the present Jews who have committed other sins. According to the Christian creed, they should not bear the sins of their ancestors who had wronged Christ and crucified him.
Those public figures raised questions about the government's intentions that lie behind this bill at present.
37.		Justice Mohamed Hamed Al-Gamal, former president of the State Council, believes that this draft law, by describing the government's documents as being "top secret" and by preventing Egyptian public opinion from getting acquainted with them for 30 or 50 years, gives the executive power, which is responsible for the people's suffering, the right to hide its bad acts regarding the State budget, the banks' funds and the public affairs policies. This provision protects those who exploit the interests of the Egyptian people.
He wonders: "How can this bill be presented? How can these amendments be introduced?
Hence, such a draft law that bans the publication of documents except upon approval from the Cabinet will not enable public opinion to have access to true information. Thus, this bill antagonizes democracy.

59.		Israeli international services have launched an operation for tempting some 1,500 former members of the army of Antoine Lahad, which was disbanded after the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon last May, to reenlist.
The internal intelligence service, Shin Bet, has joined the scheme, recruiting a 250-man special battalion from Lahad's army from among the populace of the southern Lebanese villages, where the spoken Arabic is close to that of the Palestinians, with a view to attach them to the "musta'ribin," an elite of Arabic-speaking Israeli soldiers that is subordinated to the Shin Bet and specializes in penetrating Palestinian communities.

45-BANKS REFUSE TO BARTER DEFAULTERS' LOANS FOR REAL ESTATE PROJECTS
This comes within the context of banks' remarkable refrainment from extending the finance necessary for the continuation of investment projects activity in new cities or the establishment of new expansions for the existing ones, something which spells danger to several sectors.
New cities: Since private housing companies entered the real estate investment field, they have focussed on building recreational housing units in new cities.

BAZ CALLS FOR ACTIVATING RUSSIAN ROLE MIDDLE EAST IS NOT ONE OF AMERICAN PRIORITIES
Egypt is against this. It tries to provide the factors that help the peace process come out of the dark tunnel that threatens it," he says. "Israel was in a comfortable condition in the past years because it was not facing the challenge of final settlement, and it was covering up behind the Arab rejection, so that it might not uncover its intentions and stances. When the Arabs started to be unanimous in the necessity of achieving peace and Israel started to appear as a hindrance on the way to peace, it sought to delay any talk about the issues of final settlement on the pretext that they are sensitive and difficult," he adds.
We see that the US Administration wants to wait till the inclinations of the government, following the limiting of Al-Turabi's power, come to light," says Al-Baz.
As for the status of the Egyptian Ambassador in Tel Aviv, Dr. Al-Baz says: "The American side asked us about what we intend to do. We said that the Egyptian Ambassador would return when this would be in favor of the peace process."
America is still talking about bringing the Palestinians and the Israelis together for meaningless talks, which are more of a farce than a serious attempt to find a peaceful solution.
America and the whole world would only wake when the Arabs wake first!
The Arab confrontation borders would change too. The strategic option of peace, which the Arabs, have unanimously adopted would be reconsidered. The table will soon be turned against aggressor and oppresor.
I am urging them to despair of the mythical peaceful settlement as a yield of negotiations!
I am urging them to despair of the American partner in the peace process as he has never been other than a colluder in the swindling operation victimizing the Palestinians and tempting them into endless negotiations that gave access to a total reshaping of Palestinian's geography!
Having despaired and completely shaken off all fantasies, nothing would remain before us but to turn from the defensive to the offensive!
This came in an article by Dr. Hassan Ragab.
Al-Fiqi considered that the issue of international protection might not be positive on the whole, as it would lead either to besieging the Palestinian people in their areas, which may consequently turn into secluded beleaguered cantons or the perpetuation of this stage of the Arab- Israeli conflict.

The Qatari News Agency quoted the well-informed sources as saying: "More than one European quarter advised non-reliance on the American assurances as Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Jordanian Monarch King Abdullah II heard talk in the US Administration quarters about Sharon taking a war decision and the best the US could do in such a situation was to prevent the outbreak of this war through the use of negotiations to just contain angry reactions.
The military aggression carried out by Israel against the Syrian forces can be considered a qualitative development at the military level.
MSH/ Al-Ahram, 17/4/2001
The idea of Israel's joining the AL or having the two sides merge into a regional gathering is an old one that has been devised and amended more than once over the past years. However, it was not completed or voiced officially except in 1994 when it was included in a letter sent by Shimon Peres (the Israeli foreign minister of the government of Yitzhak Rabin) on August 14, 1994 to a number of Arab foreign ministers, whose countries have diplomatic relations with Israel and have exchanged diplomatic and commercial normalization with Tel Aviv, such as Egypt, Jordan, as well as Gulf and Magharbi countries.
Peres himself said before the outbreak of the Aqsa uprising that only five years at most separate Israel from joining the AL.
Arab political milieus do not rule out the possibility of dealing with the status quo and using Israel's membership in the AL as a card of pressure in negotiations. They do not rule out the possibility that the AL charter would be amended to allow this.

The Division of Exchange Companies in the Federation of Chambers of Commerce have announced their rejection of the proposed articles, affirming that the articles will result in closure of over 90% of existing exchange companies.
The Chairman of the Division of Exchange Companies, Mohammad Hassan Al Abyad, affirmed that the Government's bid for hiking the minimum capital of an exchange company from LE 1 million to LE 50 million was aimed at reducing the number of companies, as exchange companies would have to merge into entities whose number would not exceed three of four.

EGYPT-COMESA TRADE BALANCE DEFICIT HITS 79 MILLION US DOLLARS
Executive Manager of the Export Development Center Hamdi Salem said that the trade balance deficit with COMESA members is attributed to the fact that free trade deals concluded between Egypt and these countries to facilitate trade exchange have not been properly exploited.

The Economist statements gave the lie to the government's earlier statements which said that the growth rate in the same year had reached 5.5%.

It pointed to the possibility of a rise in the growth rate to 3.1% in 2003 provided that political conditions in the region improve.

DOLLAR SHORTAGE PRESAGING FLOUR CRISIS
In exclusive statements to Al-Alam Al-Youm, Eissa, who is also head of 6th of October Mills Company, said that the Chamber of Grain industry had referred a memorandum to the Cabinet and the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) Governor. The memorandum called for procuring dollars for importers and opening credits for importing wheat and foodstuffs required for production plans.
The volume of contracts to import foreign wheat has gone down due to the shortage of the dollar and its increasing rate of exchange. As a result, contracts retreated by 40% compared with the contracts of the same period last year, he pointed out.
Asked whether that was just an analysis or a deduction he reached through his political post, the Gulf official, who asked to remain anonymous and did not allow the weekly's reporter to use a cassette recorder, said it is information to which I got access as the Americans started, after the fall of the Afghan Taliban, to carry out contacts with political and parliamentary personalities in the Arab Gulf region to gauge the anticipated reactions to the decision. Preparations for a US and British blow to Iraq have taken more than one curve, he said.
Washington also carried out contacts with the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution and leaders of the Tehran-based organization, which spearheads the Shiite opposition, he said. It is the first time for Washington and the organization, which earlier declined to join the US banner of opposition to Saddam Hussein's regime, to share the same views, the official said. The leaders of this organization said their forces are ready to be stationed in the Iranian-Iraqi frontier areas as a prelude to entering southern Iraq, with US forces backing them up.
Iraqi Vice-President, Taha Yassin Ramadan said that Iraq gives priority in all its foreign contracts to Arab countries without exception, including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

Governmental sources affirmed that the first step would be taken in the governorates whose income basically depends on tourism. Religious sermons inside such governorates will be subjected to the supervision of the governorates so as to avoid any speech about militant jihad or inciting hostility against all that is American.

Since the public interest requires that religious matter, in support of the nation's elements unity and to avoid any thing that would undermine it. The travel ban decision, would, therefore, be legally and realistically founded.
Economic centers in Cairo said that the government has two options to finesse the crisis of the Egyptian pound - either it floats the pound, as demanded by some parties or donor countries, or it lets the pound fall to the black-market rate and relaxes the administrative grip of monetary authorities on the central rate of the US dollar, as opined by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE).
A banking source noted that the meager margin of moving the central price is merely a first step to test reactions at the market, which will be followed by similar processes that can lead to a jump in the rate, thus making possible an agreement with the donor countries, especially as the price differential moved by the CBE, with the 3-percent high margin being put into consideration, poses no threat to the informal market dealings, which remain to attract more individuals and comers from abroad.
The complaint filed by the lawyer described the continuing presence of the memorials as an explicit violation of the Egyptian Constitution, as well as the Camp David Accords.
The parliamentary bloc of the Muslim Brotherhood Organization in the People's Assembly, which is formed of 17 deputies nicknamed the G-17, has finished preparation of its response to the Government's statement that was delivered by Prime Minister Ebeid on 8 January.
He went on, saying, "The statement was completely void of any talk about the promises that the Government had made last year. The Government had promised to provide 850,000 jobs during 2001, but what was announced was the appointment of only 170,000 graduates.
He also said that the Government's statement had deliberately marginalized the issue of the Egyptian balance of trade and the reasons for its increasing deficit and had not stated the Government's plan for boosting exports and reducing the chronic balance of trade deficit in the coming year.

MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD DEPUTIES ASK FOR A LAW ON DEANS ELECTIONS
The explicatory memo, attached to the bill, pointed out that the government law under which the dean election system was cancelled, deprived professors of their right to select a dean from among themselves under the current system, most universities turned into cliques and parties. The educational institution administration started to rely on a unilateral point of view and the deans' personal bias. Faculty deans became employees beholden only to those who appointed them or would renew their term in office rather than those who elected them.

KUWAIT: AMERICAN DEMANDS FOR PUNISHING ISLAMIC SOCIETIES REKINDLE DISPUTES BETWEEN ISLAMISTS & LIBERALS
While the Salafite current in Kuwait was alarmed by this development, it may be said that the Kuwait Government was equally concerned over the accusations, for the Government knows that it cannot meet the expected American demands for adopting more actions against the strong Islamic groups in Kuwait, which maintain good relations with it and have demonstrated over two decades of political work that they operate within, not without, the ruling regime.
It is now clear that the actions against the society are the first result of this incitement."

In a communiqué released on 12 January, Hezbollah reiterated its fixed stand of pursuing its policy, regardless of the challenges. It said, "We are not surprised by the renewed American campaign of accusations against Hezbollah, as declared by a number of American officials, with regard to the issue of the arms ship and other issues. The U.S. Administration has frequently adopted the Israeli stand to the letter. Many times has it also thrown the responsibility on Hezbollah for events minutes after their occurrence, without having any evidence, hard or otherwise, which confirms the politicized and terrorist nature of all these biased attitudes. However, what surprises us is all this noise that the U.S. Administration has been making over the arms ship, at the time when it has provided unlimited military support worth billions of dollars every year to Israel, supplying it with the most sophisticated American aircraft and the latest weapons that the Zionist enemy has been using on a daily basis in attacking the wronged Palestinian people and terrorizing regional peoples, under an overt American protection of the massacres committed by the Zionists in Palestine, where they violate all human and moral values and practice state terrorism in its most hideous form."
The United States has no right to apply pressure to Lebanon before the investigation of this issue is complete."
A statement, which was issued by the Social National Syrian Party following its delegation's meeting with Syrian Information Minister Adnan Omran, said that the minister "discriminated between terrorism and resistance of occupation".

The report said that world oil prices declined by 2.4% during September last until the average of oil barrel price hit 25.2 dollars, a fall of 21% compared with September 2000.
The report ascribed the decline in non-oil exports to the fully- manufactured commodity exports which nosedived by 17% to reach 735 million dollars and the raw materials which went down by 18% to reach 120 million dollars.

CBE STARTS COVERING BANK FRAGILE POSITIONS
The covering of banks fragile positions has been effected through the CBE depositing with those banks' accounts at an interest rate of 2.02% annually and for a period from 6 months to 3 years, an average of 2.8 years.
He added that the effect of such covering depends on how far the size of supply could meet the demand and the CBE's ability to pump consecutive sums of the dollar to meet market needs.
According to several car producers, importers and dealers, the prices of local and imported cars will go up by between 4% and 8% as a result of the recent hike of the dollar's exchange rate and the consequent increase in the value of the dollar as the currency of customs duty. Some of them affirmed that all operators on the auto market had already raised the prices of cars, including even the cars that had been on sale before the recent decision to hike the dollar's exchange rate. They added that most auto factories had launched reviews of their production costs in light of the anticipated rise in importation costs, in addition to rationalizing production to the least possible level and pressuring foreign suppliers into giving them discounts, particularly on passengers cars whose production depends on large percentages of imported components. Experts affirmed that the price hikes would not be confined to new cars, local and imported alike, but would also go beyond that to the used car market, where instances of owners cars being sold at fire-sale prices had begun to emerge as owners prepared for unexpected surprises. Car manufacturers, importers and dealers unanimously agreed that the coming stage will witness a decrease of sales and a drop in the rates of operation in local factories and importation of cars from abroad, which will result in price increases and a decline in demand for cars in general.

For 73 years, the experiment of Islamic parties in the Arab World has been on an ebb and flow, flourishing at times and faltering at many others, until 11 September 2001, when Islamic fundamentalism became the main foe of civilization, progress and freedom in the eyes of the West. Slashing attacks did not spare the figureheads of political Islam and their parties, which made 11 September a landmark in the march of the Arab Islamic movement. All calculations were jumbled as a frenzy of estimates began in search for gains and losses.
While most of the active players on the Algerian scene regard the amended parties law of 1997 as the shield that protects them against the possibility of new deviations, others still demand the disbandment of Islamic parties and believe that such parties should not be given the least opportunity for operating on the political scene.
Within the same context, the spokesman of the National Democratic Grouping said, "The crisis that this nation is undergoing requires the unification of the efforts of everybody, so that we may reach the proper political formula."
Kamal Kamazi, one of the prominent leaders of the tabooed FIS, said that the Muslim World was passing through a difficult stage and was facing a ferocious campaign that was not confined to Islamic parties and movements alone as some people imagined. "The United States is trying to sell us this illusion," he explained.
"The Islamic movement is aware that the US Administration does not give the minimum level of human rights to its own subjects or to the immigrants who live on American soil.
The Price in Kuwait: Kuwait has a unique Islamic movement that has no parallel in other Arab countries. Although Kuwaiti law does not allow partisan multiplicity, there are Islamic movements and fora that have managed to control the National Assembly. There are also active charity and relief societies that enjoyed a large measure of independence and a larger measure of ability to collect and spend money, some of which went to supporting fundamentalist movements and groups.
Dr Al Hissawi said, "Despite the great confusion of the concepts adopted by different Islamic groups and the difficulty of identification of these concepts by observers who do not understand the true nature of Islam and its different concepts, moderate Islamic movements have found in these events an opportunity for demonstrating the distinguished nature of their activities and their concept of jihad and change. They have also found an opportunity for expressing the absolute rejection of terrorism that some have practiced in the name of religion. Some Islamic movements have even discovered some shortcomings in their own organizations, due to their failure to address and stress certain matters in a clear manner, or as a result of their failure to deal firmly with those who go against clear-cut rules, so as to show them their mistakes and demonstrate the risk they pose to the nation. Unfortunately, some Islamic movements have dealt with such deviated agendas leniently in the past, sometimes finding excuses for the actions of some members who acted under these agendas, explaining them away as results of ijtihad (interpretations of Islamic Sharia) and deeds that were dictated by reality.
For Hizbullah has become an active partner in government that is embraced and defended zealously by the political leadership after its "Islamic resistance" was capable of inflicting the first humiliating defeat on Israeli occupation on 24 May 2000. Since that historic victory, Hizbullah has become the most influential force in political decisionmaking and solution of the crises that have become even worse after the end of the civil war. Hizbullah, or Party of God, now has 12 of the 128 seats of the Lebanese Parliament.
Faced with this situation, we had to prepare for the confrontation, particularly as the State had put all its capabilities at the disposal of the other side in such a manner that left any honest citizen with only two options: being downtrodden in this country, or facing preparation with preparation to preserve his and his country's identity against forfeit as per the Jewish scheme for dividing the area into warring minor sectarian states to justify the existence of Israel and insure the security and survival of the Zionist entity in the long run. "On 6 July 1975, the spiritual leader of the Shiite sect in Lebanon, Imam Mousa Al Sadr, announced the birth of a military organization within Amal Movement as 'the Movement of the Deprived.' The establishment of the military organization came as a result of the explosion of a landmine in an Amal training camp at the Bekaa Valley that killed 36 and injured 43 others on the first day of the same month." He went on, saying, "After the end of the civil war, Amal fighters took part of the resistance against Israeli occupation, sharing military operations against the enemy and its collaborators with Hizbullah.
Two of these parties have opted to fight a legal battle against the Government, while the third was dissolved a half century ago. However, Egyptian Islamists are still looking for a role to play. Although the law on political parties prohibits the establishment of religious parties, leaders of Islamic groups and parties are still trying to get any sort of licence for their organizations, even if it were in the form of a permit for a party under establishment. However, the more important question is: How does the scene of political Islam in Egyptian look in the wake of the 11 September events?
Eng Abul Ela Madi, a veteran of two attempts to establish his Al Wassat Party, believes that the attacks on Arabs and Muslims make it imperative for everybody, particularly in Egypt, to restore the relations between the political leadership and all political currents, Islamic and otherwise. He affirmed that Egypt needed a historic reconciliation among all parties and factions that would exclude or antagonize none of them and would also steer away from haggling over who removes whom.
"On the other hand, the US Administration's orientation for widening the scope of the concept of terrorism so that it may include some Islamic national liberation movements, such as Hamas, Jihad and Hizbullah, couple with the American double-standard foreign policy on Islamic and Arab causes, could win more popularity for political Islamic movements that follow an anti-American line."
The statement was transmitted by a Russian news agency only a few hours after an Iranian reservist leader had affirmed that Tehran had received "secret" reports to the effect that Washington prepares for a large-scale offensive against Iraq.
It was understood from statements made by American officials including Secretary of State, Colin Powell last week that Washington would not target Iraq unless circumstances were settled in Afghanistan, terrorist organizations were treated in a number of countries and the situation in the Palestinian territories was calmed down.
The Mig News sources emphasized that the Israeli military leaderships had called upon the Americans to start operations against Iraq from its western provinces, which could be used to deal missile attacks against Israel now that the western provinces were the nearest Iraqi points to the Hebrew State.
In the framework of its plan to curb the movement of elements belonging to the Somali "al-Ittihad al-Islami (Islamic Union) accused of logistical involvement with "Al-Qaeda" organization masterminded by Osama Bin Laden, the US is to establish a special electronic reconnainsance network to monitor telephone calls and faxes from and to Somalia, uncovered knowledgeable sources.
UNIFIED STRINGENT SYSTEM RESTRICTING ENTRY OF ARAB, ISLAMIC COUNTRIES NATIONALS TO BALKAN COUNTRIES
Although all Balkan countries have imposed upon the system of entry visa all Arab and Islamic countries, the last of which was Albania began with the start of the new year but it is the first time cooperation is launched not only in the issuance of entry visas between the Balkan countries but also with the European Union countries, and sometimes with the American security bodies.
This idea is not motivated by fear that Osama Bin Laden and those who follow him are taken to represent Islam; it is the outcome of many indications that the US Administration has actually gone into a new psychological state that made it lose its sense of caution and become colour-blind.
Perhaps the party that is most concerned and frustrated as a result of this attitude is that vital part of the Muslim World whose ruling regimes are connected to the United States by close ties of friendship.
America stands by Israel in its quest for igniting a Palestinian civil war or changing the crisis from an issue of liberating land and establishing an independent state into a debate over whether to keep President Yasser Arafat or remove him.
The issue will never be solved by having the Israeli Army occupy all the cities and towns that fall within the Palestinian Authority's jurisdiction.
It has used mass liquidations, employed the most lethal weapons, rejected the intervention of the United Nations or the Red Cross at the surrender of enemy fighters, frustrated all attempts to stop the fighting through negotiations as a prelude to reaching a political settlement, prevented any Arab or Muslim country from even declaring an intention to demand extradition of its subjects and is prepared to use all means of coercion and torture to obtain information.
However, this is not the business of the Americans or any others, for their interference in this respect is a serious thing that could make them exercise pressure for making alterations with regard to essential matters that relate to the very text of the Holy Quran, which several Zionist quarters have been trying very hard to do.
The Arab-Israeli conflict was not triggered by the Holy Quran; it was born and has driven its roots because of the emergence of the Zionist Movement and the establishment of the Hebrew State after a series of massacres and usurpation of land.
The mere raising of the issue of religious education by American quarters is a revival of the old call, whose roots are embedded in the real beginning of colonialism, and which was reiterated by Italy's Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, in his assertion of the need to "Westernize the world" and his call for the West to continue to impose its values on all peoples.
MFA, Al Hayat, 3/1/2002
The ruling regimes of Muslim countries, on the other hand, also sympathize with the terrorists, particularly when they target the West, but they reluctantly denounce terrorism in public, while they leave the means that create and mobilize terrorists as they are, including education, the media, the lack of democracy and the proliferation of corruption, to name some.
-	Speedy action is underway for redrawing a map of international powers and alliances. It is obvious that orthodox Russia has allied itself with the West. As to China, I believe that it will stand watching. Japan will partially join the West if a large-scale conflict breaks out, but it will not merge into the West completely. India will go into a temporary alliance in a bid to weaken its traditional enemy, Pakistani Islam, and an Indian-Pakistani war may erupt on the margins of this conflict.
-	The 11 September events have revealed a serious problem in Muslim countries. While the elite and leaders live in a modern environment and in harmony with the West and have their children attend European and American universities (all the children of Arab kings, princes and presidents were taught in Europe and the United States), the majority of their peoples live in a state of complete isolation from Western civilization and study the sciences and jurisprudence of the first century after Prophet Mohammad's Hijra. This is a problem that makes Muslim countries live in different worlds that exist inside them, not in one world.
How do these people who are called the Islamists think?
Analyses have appeared everywhere, discussing the danger of the proliferation of poverty, the danger of absence of a central government in some countries, the danger of unbalanced and biased policies, the danger of failure to pay attention to the grievances of peoples, the danger of alliance with corrupt, undemocratic regimes that oppress their peoples and rob the wealth of their countries, the danger of the superficial Western view of poor Muslim countries - a view that does not go deeper to probe the suffering of their peoples, and the danger of letting anti-Western sympathies grow through the media, education and religious sermons in these countries, where alliance with their leaders is not enough to curb the growth of hostility towards the West at layman level.
I believe that both scenarios will be conducive to the same outcome: the end of the so- called Muslim world within several decades, so long as there is no hope for any real progress in these countries.
Dr Usama Al Baz, Political Adviser to President Hosni Mubarak, said that Egypt believes that the final solution to the Middle East problem would come about by setting specific conditions for coexistence between the Palestinians and the Israelis and strongly reject the claims of hardliners, Jewish and otherwise, that they could not live together.
-	Third: Israel must make an international commitment not to seek military superiority in the future, as such quest would upset the military balance in the region and threaten Arab interests in it, whatever the Israeli claims, particularly as there are several extremist trends in Israel.

It was announced in Israel that the meeting was very hard and that Azzam was in a serious psychological and health state. The Egyptians refused to let an Israeli doctor see or treat him.
It might be mentioned that during the meeting Tarif stealthily got a camera out of his pocket and shot a photo of Azzam. However, the Egyptian jailers saw him and took the film.
This came during a meeting of the Shura Council's Arab Affairs Committee, a meeting that lasted over two days, to discuss current developments and the circumstances surrounding the Palestinian question.

It is known that the international organization of Merrill Lynch which has close ties with the Egyptian Finance Ministry to the extent of undertaking the marketing of the recently issued dollar bonds on behalf of the ministry, has issued a report saying that the new exchange for the dollar set by the Central Bank of Egypt, within the limit of 460 piasters per dollar, is "unrealistic" and needs to be speedily adjusted.
The Company won an official tender to which it submitted the best offer.
Governmental bodies tried to destroy these companies through tightening the grip on them, economically curtailing them and imposing cheap prices for their services.
Being awarded the auction is considered a national victory.
He also pointed out that he did not see any change in American foreign policy towards the Arab World in the wake of the 11 September 2001 events.
He expressed his and the Arab League's full support of what was said by the Saudi Crown Prince, Deputy Prime Minister and Commander of the National Guard, Prince Abdullah Bin Abdul Aziz, in his address to the recent Gulf Cooperation Council summit about refusing to beg Arab rights from international organizations, as begging was futile and would get nothing for the Arabs.
As to the possibility of striking Iraq and Somalia, the Arab League Secretary General said, "This issue has not been decided yet, although the threat still exists. However, hitting Iraq will terminate the international coalition against terrorism, because it will be unjustifiable, and the sanctions cannot remain in place forever."
Minister of Foreign Trade, Dr. Youssef Boutros Ghali, who was the minister of economy and in charge of running insurance companies and the CBE last year, issued instructions to insurance companies to sell their dollar proceeds be pumped into the markets, promising to provide them when needed, something that has not been achieved so far due to changing the minister and consequent cancellation of the affiliation of insurance companies and the CBE to the ministry of economy which was cancelled later on.

10 EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES' JOINING THE EU TO AFFECT EGYPTIAN AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS
Once these countries become members in the EU, more European aid will be set aside for the agricultural sector in these countries. This will lead to an EU budget constraint and less assistance to the developing countries. The EU will also get more agricultural imports from East European countries, but less imports from the developing nations, the report added.
This was highlighted in a study compiled by Mohamed Ratib, Director of Cairo-based Commercial Chamber's Research Department. The volume of production of the basic components of the Eid cookies included 19.2 million tons of flour, 44.7 million tons of fats, 3.8 million tons of sugar, 76 million tons of stuffing, 3.51 million tons of almonds and nut, 0.71 million tons of eggs, 0.153 million tons of powder milk, 0.485 million tons of starch, 0.76 million tons of coconuts and 0.51 million tons of cacao.
The Egyptian and German sides are scheduled to mull over chances of joint cooperation and investment between German companies operative in the field of small and medium industries and their Egyptian counterparts, said Mohamed Hassan Al-Siba'e, Head of the Productive Cooperative Federation.

They suffered heavy losses due to the rise in the dollar rate of exchange from LE4.15 as a central price to LE4.50, he pointed out.
No response has so far been made to the Chamber's memo, neither by the cabinet nor by the CBE, thus aggravating the crisis that threatens 10 billion pounds; private mills' investments in Egypt, not to mention the growing losses sustained by such mills due to the recent rise in the dollar rate of exchange, he said.
American Secretary of State Colin Powell asked Arafat to liquidate the infrastructure of Hamas and Jihad movements as well as all other Palestinian organizations. He offered that the USA would provide special forces to take part in the assassination and liquidation of the elements of all such organizations, which he described as terrorist.
During their recent meeting, killer Sharon had asked for a, perhaps, token American participation for the liquidation of all Palestinian organizations supporting terrorism in order to lend legitimacy to the combating of Palestinian terrorism, he alleged. He also asked that the USA would made efforts to persuade coalition countries especially Britain and Germany to provide a token contribution on behalf of Israel so as to exterminate the Palestinian organizations in the region.
Under this heading, Dr. Wahid Abdel-Maguid Chief Editor of the "Arab Strategic Report," writes to say: 	Recently, there has been much talk that Iraq may be the next target of "war on terrorism" following Afghanistan.
Now, when will a military attack be launched against Iraq?
Although this time limit appears to be a final deadline for Iraq, nothing confirms that there will be a six-month wait for the military operation to take place.
In such a military operation, involving a ground war this time, it is impossible to guarantee that losses will be limited, especially if talk on the capability and preparedness of Iraq's Republican Guard is true.
This scenario is extracted from that of the war on Afghanistan so the ground march, involving limited US forces, will be preceded by intensive air and missile strikes so as to destroy Iraqi forces, vital facilities, command headquarters and communication systems.
But, Ankara may estimate that supporting Kurdish organizations in this war will help Iraq remain unified as Turkey is very concerned over the partitioning of Iraq, for this will lead to a Kurdish state in the north, thus refreshing Turkish Kurds' dreams about separation.
Or will they take moves to thwart this operation? Will Iraqi leaders review their policies with some Arab countries to close the dossier named "the situation between Iraq and Kuwait" to provide a congenial atmosphere for buttressing moves influencing US policies.
Therefore and in the same context, the events confirmed the urgent necessity of putting an end to the American supervision of the process and to return it to its natural framework, i.e. the United Nations.
Why is it a lie?
It had been arbitrarily kept away from the UN on a mere request from Israel.
Thirdly, in and for the sake of such a process, a major operation of forging history and distorting reality in the region has been performed.
True, they might be regrettable and alarming but they had been imposed due to force majeure - security conditions and Palestinian terrorism conditions!
This would be utterly insupportable to the Palestinians who have lived under the yoke of occupation for long decades.
By the same token, peace is of no importance as the peace process is more important.
Such open linkage between the Palestinian state and the negotiations without a schedule is a virtual rejection of it as a natural legitimate right of the Palestinian people that has been long waited for and endorsed by UN resolutions.
Now, within the framework of Sharon's war against Palestinian terrorism, the American attitudes have become overt rather than covert.
The peace process, in that sense, is a codified violence operation as lying is a sort of assault and violence, assault against the truth and reality!
Ideologies have always been for justification or misguiding, justification of policies, behaviour and goals.
What is even worse is that the Arab countries, especially the moderate ones, politically cover up for the American peace lie consciously or unconsciously.
Under this heading which refers to Abraha, an Abyssinian governor who tried to invade Mecca and destroy Al-Kaaba in 570 A.D, Soad Balqassemi, a London-based Algerian writer, wrote in Al Quds Al Arabi: Immediately after the 11 September incidents in the United States, differences between the US Administration and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia came to the surface. It appeared at first that these differences were small and would dissipate like the dust clouds that loomed in the skies of New York and Washington.
The state of bedlam in the palaces of princes and the councils of government reflects the degree of this fear, which has become so deep that the Crown Prince hurried to hold successive meetings with heads of tribes and big families in the Kingdom, in a bid to win their favour and bring them closer to the Royal Family by explaining the imminent danger.
They say that the aspects of luxury in which the Gulf people live are proof of backwardness rather than evidence of civilization, as civilization, according to the people who write the articles that slash at the Saudis, cannot live side by side with religion.
Therefore, the Kingdom has tried to establish a balance of sorts between popular demands it has to meet and the religious commitments it has to discharge on the one hand and the strategic interests that its alliance with the United States guarantees on the other. So, it has succumbed to some of the demands of the US Administration, while meeting with Saudi clergymen to request them to show more restraint and use lighter tones in calling on Allah to send down His Wrath on the Jews during sermons in mosques. It has called a stop to all religious activities that may antagonize the US Administration, particularly in Mecca, and imposed several restrictions on the activities of Islamic charities and preachers, arresting everybody who refused to comply, in addition to banning demonstrations and all forms of support to the Taliban and Usama Bin Laden. Perhaps the obvious shortening and editing of Qonout (invocation in the prayers) is enough proof of the impact of the American threats on the Saudi Royal Family.
They also wonder about the reasons that make American officials now criticize the Saudi system despite the fact that they know it better than others do; the Americans were even the ones who helped establish and reinforce the Saudi ruling regime, as they did with other Arab regimes that continue to exist today for no other reasons than American support and their oppression of their own peoples. They wonder: has the US Administration suddenly realized that the Saudi system was a theocratic one - a stunning fact that it has not known before?
The US Administration is also paying large amounts to Afghanistan tribal heads and warlords, and even to the foot soldiers of the Northern Alliance, to insure their continued loyalty.
This is also how we can understand why Saudi Arabia has suddenly turned from a friendly country into a backward one that sponsors "terrorism" and breeds dangerous "terrorists" whose beliefs rest on the Wahabite ideology, not to mention that it has turned overnight into a financier of terrorist groups, from Al Qaeda Organization to Islamic and nationalist organizations that resist Zionist occupation in Palestine, the Russians in Chechnya and the Indians in Kashmir.
The US Administration began its campaign by pressuring the Saudi Royal Family into gagging religious scholars, arresting those who opposed its policies, amending textbooks, freezing the bank accounts of Islamic charities, under the pretext that they finance terrorism, and stopping the official Saudi support, finance or moral, to Islamic movements that used to receive aid from the Saudi Royal Family.
While some people in Saudi Arabia are overwhelmed with sadness over what the situation has become there, many others outside the Kingdom feel that what is happening now is only natural, simply because it was expected.
Iranian President, Mohamed Khatami has warned that the fact that Iranian university students are absent on the political arena will lead to explosion.
If the regime was simply rejected by university students this would mean there is something wrong with the community and that things should be put right at those students' request.
According to conservatives, some liberals have infiltrated the university milieus to undermine the regime, while the reformists call for allowing university students to practise their role in criticism and opposing current policies.
Washington proposed, in addition to the participation of the Marines, that a joint working force comprising officials from the CIA and other US agencies be formed in Yemen with a view to coordinating the hunting down operation, according to the source.
US KENYAN-BASED MILITARY ZONE TO BE SET UP
HAH, Al-Osboa, 24/12/2001
Not only is he calling for overthrowing the Palestinian Authority and demolishing the Oslo Agreement, but he also believes that the substitute for the Authority is the clans and families and the local Palestinian security commanders. If Sharon succeeds in his quest, it will not be much time before the same scheme is repeated in Iraq, where tribe and clan affiliations are very deep-rooted in the community, so as to prepare the scene for what the studies establishment describes as cross-border Middle Eastern tribal alliances in which the Hashemites will play a main role.
The efforts for merging the countries of the region into the global system and economy must be doubled, for this is a necessary step that should precede taking these countries further to the "democratic phase."
However, the certain thing here is that the new American orientation will dictate the emergence of new Arab and Islamic elite groups, and survival under these conditions will be for the fittest, or, to be more specific, for those who will be more capable of adaptation.
But scoring military victory would not necessarily lead to easy political gains or a spate of Nobel Peace Prize awards, for military victory and the new "Pax Americana" are separated by myriad risks that cannot be bridged over easily.
However, the problem will not stop at Israeli games alone.
If this happens, Osama Bin Laden will have scored his real victory.

The wide chasm between man and his reality and the long distance that separates him from his legitimate dreams are a sure recipe for loss of identity, mental confusion and the eventual fall into the quagmire of negative rejection that is based on regarding everybody else as an unbeliever, going backward in time and revolting against the spirit of the age.
Ninth: As terrorism is a global phenomenon that is not restricted to any religion, race or colour, its confrontation should also be global, provided that the objective be clear and that the slanting of facts, the faking of situations and the slinging of accusations be avoided. This will necessarily require a high level of Arab awareness and Islamic enlightenment, for we are targeted by a mudslinging campaign the like of which we have never suffered in our long history.
Al-Arabi Executive Chief Editor Abdel-Halim Qandil writes his back page column For the Sake of the Homeland which runs to the following effect only in part: The wrath in Port Said predicts an Egyptian uprising to topple the worn out officialdom!
Yes, we'd better remember Port Said uprising as it is the sign of coming Egyptian wrath the Argentinean way!
Despair would almost kill the souls of Egyptians.
Frankly speaking, never balme your defaulting a Government for we deserve to have such Government. Peoples who do not take their destinies in their hands deserve to have their causes and rights disrespected.
Port Said is yet a new augury as he who fails to defend his rights deserves to be trodden by the Government feet.
Due to our fear and remissness, the Palestinian cause will almost be lost and other Arab Countries will be hit and lost.
We've accepted the handouts and defaulted on any real political or democratic reform that would open up closed windows and refresh both soul and hope in a new Egypt capable of living its age and coping with its new challenges.
It obviously seemed that the talks held by Peres yesterday (January 8th) with the Indian defence minister would make Israel gain a strategic military foothold for its Air Force in a way that would make it directly contiguous with Pakistan and close to Iran and Central Asian countries. The offer put up by Israel to sell advanced defence systems to India reflects to what extent the relations between the two countries have developed.
India's acquisition of AWACS aircraft will ensure its absolute air control on the battlefield against Pakistan in the future.

The party is waiting for the Government's response to such initiative so that the front could be formed, he pointed out.
SUDAN: FEDERALISM PRESIDENTIAL SYSTEM KEY FEATURES OF CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS
MT / Al-Quds Al-Arabi, 6/1/2002
The economists were speaking in a symposium hosted by the Egyptian Committee for Solidarity in Cairo under the title "Economic Conditions in Egypt." Among the participants were Dr Abdel Aziz Higazi, former prime minister; Dr Ali Lotfi, former prime minister; Dr Samir Tobar, former chairman of the National Democratic Party's Economic Committee; and Mohammad Farid Khamis, Chairman of the Shura Council's Industry Committee.
This was an inadvisable action, because such withdrawals represent a foreign debt that the Government will have to repay." Dr Higazi pointed out that news over the past days had confirmed that Dr Ebeid's government had spent the $ 1.5 billion proceeds of dollar bonds that had been marketed worldwide, explaining that the Government now had to pay that money back, plus a 7% interest.
In addition, the development of industrial technology in Egypt is still poor, which makes us dependent on what technologies that the others will give us, and we will never get technologies that would make us compete with the countries that give them to us.
Khamis also called for rationalization of tax exemptions, affirming that it was necessary to grant them only to industries of strategic significance, not to every investor who opened a factory that made worthless good.
The Government has failed to find a good remedy for the frequent shortages of foreign currency, and a review of the system with which the exchange market is managed should be made soon, so as to curb the deterioration of the Egyptian pound.
"We must realize that the recent cabinet reshuffle, including the establishment of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, does not mean that Egypt will weather this economic crisis quickly. We will have at least one more year of economic hardship before the wheels start turning again."
The differences started between the Ministry of Finance and other ministries to which the economic bodies are affiliated as the General Civil Aviation Authority was converted into a holding company with two affiliates - a company for airports and another for air navigation while separating the holding company for civil aviation and its affiliate companies from the state budget.
MMS, Al-Alam Al-Youm, 7/1/2002
The report uncovered that every billion dollars of exports contribute to providing about 270 thousand new job opportunities. This export sector, therefore, should contribute to the assimilation Egyptian labour. The report pointed out that the exports plan focuses on the sectors with relative, especially untraditional advantages such as metallurgical and engineering industries, and creates about 60 thousand new job opportunities.
The report added that the taxes and the customs represented a big obstacle to the development of export performance due to the rise in the tariff average and duties and customs estimates for exporters who import production requirements. The report said that tax exemptions for exporters represent a subsidy that runs counter to the World Trade Organization rules and consequently both the ways and timing of collecting taxes from export sectors should be considered.
A report compiled by Economic Researches and Policies sector at the Foreign Trade Ministry uncovered that exports value had gone up hitting LE12.4 billion, an increase of LE730 million by 6.2% during the two periods in question.

Prominent among the European countries to whom our exports increased this year are: Ukraine, Hungary, Bulgaria, Turkey, Spain, Romania, Switzerland, Holland, Slovenia, Croatia and Belgium. In Asia and Africa, Egyptian exports increased to India, Kenya, Ethiopia and South Africa. Our exports to Canada in North America also increased and to Brazil in South America. Arab free zones exports also rose by about LE196 million.

The demands of ready-made apparel manufacturers have been turned down by Minister of Foreign Trade, Dr. Youssef Boutros Ghali.

The factories have 70 thousand workers and LE1 billion investments.
The recent tariff amendments had cancelled the customs duties on ready-made apparel requirements at the same time as their factories had borne tariffs on yarn and raw materials used for that domestic industry.
In an attempt to avoid the growing demand for dollar on the market now and then, some private banks started to consider fresh mechanisms to attract dollars outside the banking system.

The visit comes within the context of a Canadian desire to encourage Egyptians to travel to Canada and urge Canadian tourists to visit Egypt.

However, Libyan government sources said that relations were expected to improve within the next few days, regardless of the extension of sanctions by the U.S. Administration.
He said the group would not contest the next legislative elections and would not support the Islamic party of Justice and Development in such elections. In his statement yesterday, he pointed out that the talk about fair free elections was just a political façade for dealing with Western bodies.
A look at the Algerian picture in 2002 clarifies the main aspects of the political scene, which is particularly set for the parliamentary and local government elections that will be held in a few months' time, and may be preceded by a call to the Algerian people to vote on a referendum on the country's new constitution.
If the President managed to give his country democratic and fair elections, he will certainly insure a safe start for his aspirations and ambitions, which are based on turning the wheels of economic development so fast as to make up for the three years he spend maintaining a delicate balance among political, economic and security factors, in the hope of putting the country on a course that will take it to wider horizons.
Among the parties that belong to the Islamic current are the Peace Community Movement (Hams) led by Mafouz Nihnah and Al Nahda Movement led by Naguib Adami. It seems that Al Nahda has a better chance than Hams of remaining as a partner in the coalition government, particularly as Hams leader Nihnah, who has not lost the favour of President Bouteflika or the leaders of the two main parties, has not managed to win their favour, either.
There are other registered parties, but they will not play main roles in the forthcoming elections. These include the Republican Alliance Party led by Reda Malik and the Democratic Social Movement Party led by Al Hashimi Sherif.

THE AGE OF THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE LIQUIDATION
The Israeli establishment believes that it is high time the Israeli concept of peace was imposed on the Middle East as Israel really wants a Palestinian surrender, which neither Arafat nor Arab leaders without exception could accept.
As the Palestinian people is up in arms resisting occupation, Arab and Islamic governments should extend all types of support to them and act to preclude Israeli ambitions and desire to impose full hegemony over the region rather than Palestine alone.
On the other hand, Israel's assassination of the Palestinian cause is state terrorism as it is carried out under orders by Israel's government and must be included in the definition of terrorism."
MUBARAK: NO MATTER HOW POWERFUL OCCUPATION MAY BE, IT IS DOOMED TO DEFEAT!
President Mubarak emphasized that the international campaign against terrorism must not deviate from its aims or run away with the ideas intended by some to extend the campaign to other countries which have nothing to do with terrorism to the brand certain states or organizations as backing terrorism with a view to pressurizing them into further capitulations in other fields!

The CBE's Governor Mahmoud Abul Oyoon said during his meeting on Tuesday 15 evening that disengaging the Egyptian pound from the US dollar issue is being mulled over currently through a basket of currencies idea indicating that such a decision is pending the appropriate timing.
About the latest unjustifiable soars in the dollar exchange rate against the pound, the Governor said that speculation operations done in the black market never aimed at economic reform, rather they aimed at profiteering thus turning the dollar into a profit-making commodity. The Governor said that he wouldn't succumb to the pressure exerted by black market speculators through decreasing the pound's exchange rate against the dollar.
CBE GOVERNOR: UNKNOWN FIGURE SETS DOLLAR RATE ON BLACK MARKET ON PHONE!
In a more-than-three-hour meeting with the members of the Cairo Center for Economic Information, the CBE Governor said the increase of the dollar's central exchange rate in leaps made citizens expect that it will go up more and more, something that re-created the dollarization phenomenon once again.
Economic centers in Cairo said that the government has two options to finesse the crisis of the Egyptian pound - either it floats the pound, as demanded by some parties or donor countries, or it lets the pound fall to the black-market rate and relaxes the administrative grip of monetary authorities on the central rate of the US dollar, as opined by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE).
A banking source noted that the meager margin of moving the central price is merely a first step to test reactions at the market, which will be followed by similar processes that can lead to a jump in the rate, thus making possible an agreement with the donor countries, especially as the price differential moved by the CBE, with the 3-percent high margin being put into consideration, poses no threat to the informal market dealings, which remain to attract more individuals and comers from abroad.
The report attributed such a decline to several factors prominent among which is the decrease in hard currency revenues as a result of the negative effect of the terrorism incidents in September, which led to a sharp decline in tourism revenues, oil prices, the Suez Canal and airlines revenues.
SAUDI EXCHANGE FIRMS REFUSE TO DEAL IN POUND

"Mrs Fayza Abul Naga, Minister of International Cooperation, will preside the Egyptian delegation to Sharm Al Sheikh conference," Dr Ayoob explained. "Such meetings are held in response to the needs of developing countries and their donor partners. This conference is held every two or three years. The last conference was in Paris in January 1999."
Responding to a question about the commitment of donor countries and international organizations to Egypt, he said that the details of these aspects of financial assistance would be announced during Sharm Al Sheikh conference, indicating that Egypt's foreign debts stood at some $ 27 billion, which equaled about 25% of the GNP, and that the Egyptian economy was capable of meeting the payments on debts in time.
According to the premier, the number of the unemployed in Egypt hits 1.4 million citizens. He went on saying, "Whether we agree or disagree with that figure, what is more important for us is to look forward and prepare the programmes required for employing 800 thousand citizens who enter the work market every year.
The loans, needed by the industrial sector, will be used in bankrolling medium and long-term projects, he said.
Demand for industrial sector-oriented credit and credit generally has been dwindling away since the September 11th attacks, which have affected both local and international markets, he said.
The peace process necessitates dealing with two parties - Israel and the PNA. If the US severs contacts with Arafat and the PNA, it will be announcing that it sides with Israel alone and will let the Israelis do whatever they want, Moussa says, adding that by so doing America will not be the sponsor of peace and Arafat will have to take decisions in his capacity as the Palestinians' leader.
This stance is very strange and dangerous, the AL Secretary General points out. They speak about the killing of Israeli civilians, but they never talk about assassinations made by the Israeli government overtly and blatantly and considered by them self- defense. They want the Palestinian young men to be peaceful and hold nothing even stones, while they do not ask the Israelis to withdraw their tanks or the settlers to lay down arms and guns!
The Arab impotence with which we are afflicted ourselves is temporary and will not last, he says.
So, let's deprive them of the result they are waiting for. The Palestinians should keep up resistance and they should be backed by the Arab peoples in their entirety. This is the road, which we should follow," Moussa says.
The person who occupies the position of "Grand Sheikh" shakes hands with the person who declared the assassination of Muslims in Palestine as religiously permissible.
The alleged goal of the conference was to urge a return to the negotiating table.
He said, "It was not a conference for inter-faith dialogue but rather a meeting held by representatives of heavenly religions to agree on a formula for appealing to the concerned parties to return to the negotiation table."
Then he replied to his own question by suggesting the likelihood of that being instigated by some binding political directives which Dr. Tantawi could not disobey even though his meeting with the rabbis was not unprecedented!
Head of Al-Azhar Scholars Front, Dr. Al-Agami Al-Damanhouri, who doubles as professor with the Faculty of the Fundamentals of Religion, was not surprised at Dr. Tantawi's behaviour and so did not hit the roof. He believed that holding the conference was less painful and less harmful than his playing host to the rabbis in the "Sheikhdom" of Al-Azhar as he then represented a weighty institution, Al-Azhar whereas in the conference, he just represented the host country. Dr. Al-Agami said that Al-Azhar could no longer claim the right to give religious opinions, as the Holy Quran text is quite clear regarding the necessity of retaliation against aggressors.
The participants to the conference, which was held yesterday in the Suez Canal University warned against involvement of any Arab or Islamic country in changing religious curricula under American, European or Israeli pressure.
For his part, the Islamic world Organization Secretary General, Abdullah Ibn Abdel-Mohsen, who doubles as Secretary General of Islamic countries Organization warned against succumbing to Zionist and Western pressure so as to change religious curricula. He called upon Arab and Islamic universities to undertake their role in confronting the mass media war led by Zionism.

EGYPTIAN MILITARY PROSECUTION: MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH VIOLENCE
The Military Prosecution representative said that the discs seized with the defendants contained references about how far the Muslim Brotherhood are related to violence advocating Islamic groups.

SALAH NASR'S SON, A WITNESS FOR IKHWANITES!
Hani Nasr's relation with Muslim Brotherhood started when he met with Mohamed Gibril, a lawyer from Heliopolis Muslim Brotherhood, in a medicinal company Dr. Hani Nasr had some dealings with. Gibril worked then for the company's Legal Department. The relations between the two got stronger so much so that Gibril became Hani Nasr's private lawyer.

He will also meet with the Egyptian community in Sudan.
Even before the United States began shaking off the debris of the Afghanistan War from its hands, Israel had set the stage for it to engage in hot battles on the Middle East front. Israeli media have incessantly been blowing up the threat of Iraq, while Israeli commanders have made a habit of opening files that could provoke Syria. The Mossad also came up with the story of Karen A, the ship that Israel claims having captured in the Red Sea, so as to put Iran, Iraq and Syria in the same enemy camp. Israeli studies centres have even warned that the three countries may form a strategic alliance to face up to the threats of the Hebrew State.
However, there have been no indications that these three countries have elevated their level of coordination or made any joint planning for facing up to this persistent Israeli threat to their national security.
Mohammad Bassyooni, who was Egypt's ambassador to Israel for 18 years, said, "The result is known in advance. Such a tripartite alliance, which I myself do not think could be formed these days in particular, although I do not rule out the possibility of its emergence in the future, would deliver retaliatory blows to Israel. Israel may also resort to the use of nuclear weapons to deter this tripartite alliance, but we should not forget that Iran also possesses nuclear weapons. Therefore, the air and nuclear war will be undecided between Israel and the three members of the alliance, with one round won here and another lost there, as the total number of weapons in the arsenals of the three countries is only equal to those in Israel's possession. As to the land war, it will be decided in advance in favour of the tripartite alliance, as Syria, Iraq and Iran are superior to Israel in both quantity and combat capabilities of ground equipment.

The MPs warned that the continuation of that law would turn the Egyptian market into a private property of the Chinese and Syrian products in particular as these products enter without customs duties at a time when garment national factories requirements shoulder customs duties and taxes to the tune of 60%, which affirms the lack of equality principle in the competition process.

In his statements, Salah Eddin touched on the application of Switzerland agreement that had been signed by the government and SPLA. He voiced the government relief as more and more that started move about in the area. "We made sure that roads had been opened and a number of government officials had entered some areas that had previously been controlled by the movement. People started to move and this is peace. We'd like to see that the agreement was applied to the letter and a final and comprehensive peace was reached", he said.
Salah Eddin said " The decision was wrong and we officially protested it. The US peace envoy John Danvort was informed of the protest. We have not changed our opinion that the decision by no means supports the peace march in Sudan. It is an improper decision, which apparently sides with the opposition".
He said he would carry on his set duties and tasks regardless of hindrances. Kuwaiti Parliament Speaker, Jasim Al-Khorafi sharply lashed out at Moussa after the latter took action to deliver Iraqi ideas about the Iraqi- Kuwaiti status.

HAH, Al-Hayat, 29/1/2002
The "Intifada" people, with their diverse leanings, from the youngest teenager until Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, term Arafat's confinement imposed by Sharon to his residence in Ramallah as a closure to all Arab governments, leaders, party chairmen, professional associations and popular unions as well as to Arab dignity in all the Arab capitals.
They are also satisfied that the situation is awfully perilous and what is being devised and planned by Israel is not only the fate of Arafat as a Palestinian leader, but the future of the present generation of the Palestinians and the whole Arab political system as well.
CRIME & THE SUMMIT! Under this headline, Chief Editor of Al-Ahram Al-Arabi, Osama Saraya wrote an article, some excerpts of which run to the following effect: The Arab summit has put the leaders in a critical situation.
Would they admit to their inability to pressurize Israel, America and the international community?
We won't be exaggerating if we describe the forthcoming summit in Beirut as the danger summit because if the Arabs failed to face Sharon and the international community's crime against the Palestinian people, their peoples would never trust their current regimes!
Immediately after his release from Tora Prison late February 7 evening, Ibrahim told Asharq Al-Awsat that the hardest day in his life was when the Court of Cassation decision was postponed in the case during the previous hearing of 16 January last. He and his inmates were waiting for the release decision while the postponement decision came as a shock that sent all of them deep into extreme anguish.
380 MILLION OFFICE HOURS WASTED ANNUALLY IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY
The project pointed out that total official and legal holidays granted to public reaches 107 days per year including ordinary, casual, weekly and festival holidays and sick leaves.
A few months after being besieged in his headquarters in Ramallah by the Israelis, President Yasser Arafat succumbed, without official negotiations, to two American and Israeli main requests.
Vowing to stop the activities of "terrorist organizations", Arafat provided a pretext for Israel to claim that its suppression of the Palestinian intifada is part of the wider "war against terrorism" declared by the USA.
It puts forward a formulation to implement the UN Resolution no. 194 - that ensures the right of the Palestinian refugees to return to their lands and homes - in a way that practically weakens the resolution's content itself.
Danger will emerge, should negotiations be resumed with the endorsement of such a formulation as a fresh approved referentiality for arbitration.
The expansive concept of Israel's security includes the Arabs' approval of "Israel's demographical desires" and ensuring restrictions on the sovereignty of a Palestinian state.
In a lecture entitled "Kashmiris' Struggle for Self-Determination" he delivered at the Pakistani embassy in Doha on February 6, he said there is an all-out Israeli-Indian coordination regarding Delhi's policies towards Pakistan and the occupied region of Kashmir.
There are several pieces of concrete evidence proving that India has been keeping up secret ties with Israel since the 1960s in a bid not to make Arabs get angry, he pointed out, adding that security and intelligence issues topped the key priorities in the Israeli-Indian bilateral cooperation.
The regional bureau of the United Nation Environmental Programme in Amman warned against the dangers resulting from the Israeli Dimona nuclear reactor radiation, pointing out that the neighbouring Arab countries, however, didn't submit any relevant complaints.

In a comprehensive interview conducted by Asharq Al-Awsat in her office in the White House on February 1st, Rice said; "The US-Saudi Arabian relations are excellent as they are two friendly countries connected with strategic partnership and common interests. These relations are based on mutual respect accumulated over generations of leaderships of the two countries. These relations will last for a long time."
The USA pays much attention to the position and legitimate hopes of the Palestinian people, which, according to her, "will never be served through terrorism".
HAH, Asharq Al-Awsat, 3/2/2002
One day after the Iraqi Vice-President, Tarek Aziz interrupting his visit to Moscow on January 31st, the Russian official told Asharq Al- Awsat that the Russian support of Iraq could not continue for ever.
CAN AN ATTACK ON IRAQ BE AVERTED?
Can the Iraqi ruling regime avoid the blow?
However, it would be very dangerous to ignore the risks and rule out the attack, whatever encouraging reasons may exist.
The Iraqi regime would not consider these solutions, of course, but would most likely gamble on splitting Western ranks and provoking the anarchic Arab street, which would rise in harmless noise while the Iraqi people is attacked and thrown backwards into a way of life that existed several centuries ago.
So why all this mule-headedness then?
During Operation Desert Storm, President Saddam Hussein did have an opportunity to use any lethal Iraqi weapons against Israel and U.S. forces, but he did not use such weapons, despite all his previous threats to use binary chemical weapons against Israel, whose aircraft had destroyed the Iraqi nuclear reactor.
Political milieus in Beirut are currently preoccupied by talk of the escalation of the American threatening tone against Lebanon unless it responded to Washington's demands that bordered on the impossible, brandishing sanctions that would be no less dangerous than those imposed on Afghanistan.
M.S. Al-Ahram Al-Arabi, 2/2/2002
He asked the Zionist enemy's leaders not to busy themselves with counting the missiles in our possession, what is important for us is not the number of missiles whether their Intelligence departments could know it or not. What really matters is our strugglers' high morale as they carry such missiles with their own stalwart hearts rather than their hands".
He urged everybody to face American arrogance and blatant deviation.
Al-Osboa learnt that technical American delegation representing Departments of Justice, Foreign Affairs, Finance and Federal Bureau of Investigations is currently visiting a considerable number of Arab countries. It has already visited Kuwait and the UAE. The delegation aims at promoting an American project to control the sources of financing terrorists through imposing full American supervision over charity donations in Arab countries.
According to information, that item means that the Arab governments funds that are donated to support the Palestinians must be subject to security coordination with the USA that, in turn, decides whether to prevent such funds from reaching or to determine the bodies that should receive them. This would also apply to all governmental donations.
It seems that the title of "the kingdom of silence," given to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the past due to its seclusion it dwells in, inactivity of the political movement inside it and imposition of a full ban on information about the development of matters inside it has become "inaccurate" at present. The country has gradually started to relinquish its media and political isolation and enter a stage of an unprecedented political dispute, part of which is seen on the domestic newspapers and another one is published on the Internet.
This difference was obvious during the meeting Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Abdel-Aziz held with the men of religion. He asked them to distance themselves away from extremism, take into consideration the Kingdom's current circumstances and not to take any step that might embarrass the Royal Family. Several men of religion, who attended the meeting, hastened to confirm their loyalty to the rulers. However, Sheikh Abdel-Mohsen Al- Turki, Chief of the Islamic World League and former minister of Waqfs (religious endowments) and Islamic Affairs, exploded a bomb in that very meeting.
Concern: 	The men of religion are greatly concerned about the interference by the US FBI agents almost overtly in the ongoing investigations into the files of the religious institutions and the accounts of the charitable societies. They believe that the closure by the Saudi Central Monetary Institution of 150 banking accounts of these institutions and societies was the fruit of these American investigations on the ground that they have ties with terrorism.
The first to ask for the exit of these forces was Prince Talal Bin Abdel-Aziz, a free Prince that is close to Crown Prince Abdullah.
Observers also noted that thousands of Saudis phoned the relatives of the detainees of Al-Qaeda Organization, who are captured in Pakistan and the American Base of Guantanamo in Cuba, to show solidarity with them.
The magazine said the Saudi people pose a threat to the Royal Family bigger than that posed by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
AM/ Al-Quds Al-Arabi, 1/2/2002
"When we devote time to solve the Palestinian cause, we do so out of keenness on Egypt's interests ."
"We are facing a critical situation concerning the Palestinian cause due to the Israeli provoking policies and practices, something that causes despair and frustration, which, in turn, cause chain reactions and falsely brands the Palestinians of terrorism although they only try to repel the greatest aggression of the occupation state."
HAH, Al-Akhbar, 3/2/2002
The main problem of Egypt is stagnation, which affected us just like the whole world. Stagnation escalated after the last September events in the US and some measures were taken by the Egyptian monetary authorities to rebate it".
He added that the Egyptian economy suffered from stagnation, which impacted on the growth rates. Stagnation started by the end of 1997 and gradually escalated in the next years. In the beginning, the officials called it economic stagnation and sometimes the liquidity crisis. Studies conducted by the CBE cited the causes of stagnation including the expansion of private investment in similar fields despite the market limited ability to absorb this expansion, the big financing imbalance in the companies in charge of executing private investment, and the large credit expansion for financing private sector activities by banks.
Meanwhile, the Egyptian foreign exchange reserves amounted to some 14.2 billion dollars in late June 2001, which may help cover Egyptian commodity imports for more than 10 months. This may also help cover about 1.5 double the gap which took place in the balance of trade in the fiscal year of 2000/2001 in case the foreign currency sources are negatively impacted by the world events.
In silence that was only broken by a causal statement made by head of the Egyptian government before the Shura Council a few days ago, the Egyptian government decided to stop the policy of intervening in the foreign currency exchange market not only in response to the desire of the IMF or the advice given by several international agencies but also due to the experience of the last six months during which the State lost more than one-third of the foreign reserves, as admitted by the head of the government, in order to equalise the exchange rates between the pound and the dollar.
ME/Al-Hayat, 1/2/2002
External Trade Minister said that commodities that would benefit by the new system had been chosen after intensive studies to make sure that the exportation potential was considerable and added that the sums offered as incentives in the form of support or subsidy would reach about $340 million in five years' time.
The number of projects and companies that has been approved from January to November, 2001 amounted to 2622 companies, a decline of 19.5 % compared with the year 2000.
The report also said that the total of Egyptian exports had raised from $3.888 billion in the year 1999, 2000 to $7.078 in 2000, 2001, a rate of growth of 10.8%, which is attributed to the growth of both petroleum and non-petroleum exports. The ratio of exports to the GDP rose from 6.5% in 1999/2000 to 7.2% in 2000/2001.
"PARIS CLUB" SET CONDITIONS TO BAIL OUT EBEID GOVERNMENT
The government kick-started the sale of its shares in banks especially Bank Misr, National Bank, Banque du Caire and Bank of Alexandria by the year 2005. It also pledged to promptly sell any companies with state-owned shares within the coming period, starting with Egypt Telecom Company.
The memo of understanding includes 3 commitments that help guarantee export proceeds of Egyptian exports against the risks of defaulting on payment inside the Chinese market in order to spur Egyptian exporters to increase their quota as the balance of payment, which tilts in favour of the Chinese side, he said.
The memo was signed in Peking by Mahmoud Mohamed on behalf of the Egyptian side and Board Chairman of the Chinese company, Tang Roxon, thus putting the memo into effect. The two sides are making ready to provide contacting data channels via the Commercial Representation Body.
The construction of an international amusement park in Marsa Alam was also discussed.
50 MILLION EUROS FROM THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR METRO SECOND LINE
He emphasized that the bank would continue financing Egypt's development projects especially in the field of infrastructure, communications, transport, tourism and energy as well as the private sector.
This can be done through presenting competitive offers in the field of manufacturing computer monitors as well as some components produced by the other branches of the LG Electronics.
A new television factory is expected to be set up in Egypt during the coming three years, he indicated.
However, attention should be focused on laying down new laws and legislations to provide a variety of incentives to attract international companies specialized in this field. In addition, specialized training should constantly be provided for human resources that should keep abreast of international technological developments, he pointed out.
The taxes will be refunded after the crops are exported, according to the new decree.
Al-Wafd, 28/1/2002
The GOI helped set up a total of 1,748 new projects in July 2000-June 2001, the minister said in the meeting.
Anyhow, tourism movement in Egypt will witness a gradual increase during the next months of March and April, unless unexpected international events take place."
Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Ebeid made an urgent and open invitation to Egyptian expatriates to transfer their dollar savings to Egypt to revive the economy. He stressed that such a step would be beneficial to them, their children, and all Egypt.
He also disclosed that the local savings are not enough to achieve the required growth rates. Egypt needs some 10 billion dollars of Arab and foreign investments annually, he revealed. The annual credit volume went down from 18%-20% to 6.5%.
Egypt is now witnessing ironic contradictions that have negative impacts on the Egyptian economy.
Al-Nasr Electric and Electronic Appliances Company, which is fully owned by the Holding Engineering Company, after it bought the stake of the Dutch company of Philips three years ago, is now suffering from many problems that placed it in an unenviable position. It is to be mentioned that Al-Nasr was the only company that produced fluorescent lamps. Sales of the locally produced lamps went largely down after the market had been dumped with similar imported products by 145% in 1997. Last year, the rate rose to 219%, which exposed the Egyptian company to gross losses and a decline in production capacity.
190 PUBLIC ENTERPRISE SECTOR COMPANIES OUT OF PRIVATISATION
If the textile companies were excluded from this list, the total property rights would hit -11.97 billion pounds, that is the obligations due on the textile companies exceed the assets and activity revenues by 26.89 billion pounds.

Investment and Free Zones Authority Chairman, Dr. Mohamed Al-Ghamrawi announced that the Authority had approved the six projects including three under the special free zones system operating in the field of natural gas liquefaction with a view to exporting it to external markets.

Their initiative created a sensation in the Islamists' milieus. The Group's Shura council, therefore, decided to stop armed operations in March 1999.
They, then, started to describe the reasons for the change.
They concluded that if the harm done by an act meant to bring about benefits but found to be a source of graver evil should be avoided.
Concluding the leaders said, "Our goal should be quite clear before our eyes and every step should be calculated in light of how much it would contribute to the final goal. Our supreme goal is promoting the messages revealed to various prophets for the benefit of their peoples. Proselytization or rather guiding people to Allah's worship is our aim.

ISRAELI ATTEMPT TO REACH AL AQSA MOSQUE THROUGH TUNNEL FOILED
Sheikh Mohammad Hussein, Manager of Al Aqsa Mosque, affirmed that the Directorate of Awqaf (Islamic endowments) had immediately issued instructions for filling the hole at the ceiling of the grave with reinforced concrete and building a 20-cm thick wall of reinforced concrete and iron around the grave to prevent encroachments against the grave and preclude any further digging under Al Aqsa Mosque.
The sources pointed out that any success made by the Egyptian current move would certainly leave its impacts on the atmospheres in light of which the Arab Summit was scheduled to be held in Beirut next March. They expected that the US President George Bush might ask Israeli Premier, during their talks that week, to let Arafat, who was besieged in Ramallah, participate in the Arab Summit.
It might be mentioned that Israeli officials had announced following Mubarak's meeting with Israeli Defence Minister, Benjamin Ben Eliezer that Cairo would send an envoy to the Palestinian President to urge him to "take a decisive stand against terrorism."
Speaking about the Palestinian Authority arrest of the Secretary General of the Palestine Liberation Peoples' Front, Ahmed Sa'adaat, Sheikh Yassin said that the Palestinian Authority responded to the American and Israeli pressure and arrested Sa'adaat under the pretext that he is responsible for the murder of the Israeli Tourism Minister. This is untrue as the operation was carried out by the Peoples' Front military wing, Sheikh Yassin said, adding that the military wing is independent in its action from the political wing and therefore neither the Palestinian Authority nor Israel has the right to arrest Sa'adaat. However, Israel wants the Palestinians to fight one another while maintaining its siege on Arafat.
These operations are not an aim in themselves but they are a means required for achieving national goals and deterring the Israeli aggression. He wondered whether stones or guns would benefit the Palestinians in the face of the Israeli tanks, missiles, and fighters. Of course not, he said. Therefore, he added, martyrdom operations within the 1948 Palestine is the available means to the Palestinians to strike a balance in deterrence or terror and undermine the stability and security of Israel. He who says that martyrdom operations harmed the Palestinians does not understand the nature of the battle or why Israel left Gaza and South Lebanon. If they do not want martyrdom operations, they should give us F-16 and Apache aircraft and we will not to resort martyrdom operations.
Hamas started on 14 December 1987 with the start of the first intifada in the first action against Israel. Hamas started the intifada and resistance in the way the world saw and heard. It is not reasonable that Israel should help a group that kills the Israelis. This is not at all reasonable.
" We are above suspicions and accusations, but there are people who always want to put us in a position of accusation", he said. Those must understand that Hamas does not work for anybody namely, America, Iran, and Israel. Hamas works under the banner of Islam, Sheikh Yassin said.
Speaking about whether Hamas would approve any deal to be signed by the Palestinian Authority with Israel stipulating the establishment of a Palestinian State within the 4th June 1967 borders, Sheikh Yassin said that Hamas would not accept this as a final solution as no body had the right to abandon the land of Palestine until new conditions and generations came up and the state of affairs changed. "We do not have the right to abandon a grain of Palestinian soil to Israel".
It is clear that the "axis of evil" is nothing more than one of the many pieces of nonsense that Washington has been doling out to justify its new and never-ending military mania.
Disposing of the need for having allies means nothing beyond eliminating any grounds for consultation and the need to wait for United Nations authorization.
When Iraq, or Iran, for that matter, is involved, Israel is concerned, and the proof is that it has discovered the big "terrorist secret" when it seized the arms shipment and gave it on a silver platter to the big ally as a gift.
The enemy here is the Palestinian Authority, which has to pay for the opportunity of survival that it has been given.
As Arafat had not dead bodies to show, the "Washington Owl," Condoleezza Rice, promptly joined the war criminal Sharon in saying that Arafat's statements, even though they had been printed by the New York Times, meant nothing for them.

HAH, Al-Hayat, 10/2/2002
By announcing such threats, Bush and his aides may aim at tightly secluding Iran and launching a cold war on it with a view to weakening and destabilizing it as a prelude to toppling its regime. The shortest way to achieve this goal is to create the current perplexity in the Iranian leadership and to spread a state of panic, which leads to collapse at the end.
From this point, the overt Iranian desire to cooperate with the US concerning Al-Qaeda case will not solve the problem, as the main request is to pledge to guarantee Israel's security and stop backing Hezbollah and other organizations that antagonize the Hebrew state.
Under this heading, Ahmed al-Raba'i of Asharq Al-Awsat writes to say:
The Gulf nations should ask for an official clarification from Iran on threats to set Gulf oil wells ablaze. By such remarks, Iran declares war on peoples in the region and their sole resources and encroaches upon the independence of the neighboring countries, which have been on amicable terms with Iran. This rhetoric has not been any longer suitable in civilized and modernized societies.

The Supreme Administrative Court stressed that the Democratic Generation party had presented a distinguished platform in three main axes: the first related to establishing economic and political integration with the golden triangle countries - Egypt, the Sudan and Libya, the second is the comprehensive view to the River Nile and the call to set up an organization comprising the 10 countries of the Nile basin and the third is the proposition of an Arab cultural system that is not an alternative to the Arab League.
He said that the (holding) companies of the Public Enterprise Sector still refuse to abide by paying up the government's quota of financial surpluses despite a decree to this effect being issued by Prime Minister Dr. Atef Ebeid and despite the fact that nine months have passed since the approval of the final audits of the Public Enterprise Sector companies.

M.S. Asharq Al-Awsat, 12/2/2002
Terrorism is American-backed Israeli practices against the unarmed Palestinian people, Dr. Hashim underlined.
An Egyptian parliamentary report cautioned against the weakness of political parties, and religious and educational establishments, pushing the youth to resort to extremist organizations.
The abysmal performance of political parties and syndical, professional and youth organizations pushed large sectors of young men to go to terrorist and extremist groups, said the report, which will be discussed by the parliament on February 12.
The report also handled the impacts of economic and social conditions on political life in Egypt, pointing to "low development rates in Egypt and shortage of resources." It further emphasized that "there were many social contradictions which impacted on incomes and fortunes." "The youth could not find a pacemaker to follow due to the distortion of biography of many leaders who participated in making their country's history."
The Islamic group has published four books announcing the termination of violence and bloodshed. This carries several implications including the fact that despite the eight authors being in jail, they said they were subjected to no security pressure neither were there any barter deals as the initiative came from one party only- the Islamic group.
For his part, lawyer Mamdouh Ismail, deputy of Al Shari'a party (under foundation), and one of Al Jihad organization defendants pointed out that the four books had contained reconsiderations and backtrackings and political jurisprudence. Nothing new has come out! The reconsiderations are represented in the propagation of virtue and the combatting of vice, which suffered from some errors in the pre-books era. Backtrackings, on the other hand, were quite clear as Jihad, in the sense of confronting the regime or threatening tourism or Copts, has undergone backpedaling.
He only has some reservations about it simply because it added nothing new.
We, therefore, are for stopping bloodshed or assaulting the innocents. Blessing the Islamic Group's initiative , consequently, is very important as it has rectified the course so that it may be able to rise after faltering and save its youth from prisons and detention camps and forge ahead with its march. Deputy Guide, counsellor, Mamoun El-Hudheibi wonders who would reject such an initiative which ensures that all those groups would follow the same course as that followed by Muslim Brotherhood, rejecting violence at all levels.
The officialdom should, therefore, change its mind and its discourse, though I doubt it! How can such negotiation be confined to security men to the exclusion of thinkers and politicians and other state dignitaries. This would take us nowhere. If the Islamic Group backtracked, so far so good and its new ideology is welcome but the role of the state should not be neglected as the give and take rule of negotiations should be implemented .
Yesterday (February 12th) Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) alluded to hit the American interests anywhere in case the US put into force what came in the statements made by the CIA Chief, George Tenet that Hamas would be on the agenda of the second stage of the US campaign on terrorism.
Yesterday (February 12th), Israel tightened blockade on the Palestinians. It started to implement a new plan to make "security zones" inside the Palestinian-ruled territories under the pretext of the danger imposed by "Al-Qassam" missiles, as one of which was launched last Sunday on a village inside the Green Line.
Reports in Israel said yesterday (February 9) that the Israeli Justice Ministry was collecting information about property left by the Jews in the Arab countries. This is aimed at lodging compensation lawsuits in the future in response to the right of the Palestinian refugees to return. Israel has started a big campaign to register the private and public property, left by more than 900 thousand Jews in the Arab countries from which they migrated, official Israeli sources said.
The property will be registered, lest there should be future needs for filing future compensation cases for the families that left huge property behind, the Israeli Ministry said. The registration is also meant for political reasons; it will be used as a form of facing the claims of the Palestinians to return (to their homeland).

The sources, however, said that most likely Ayman's five daughters survived these attacks because they were in another place.
Meanwhile, the fate of Ayman is still shrouded in mystery. Reports published by Iranian newspapers, said that Al-Zawahri is in Iran. However, Iranian diplomatic sources denied this indecisively. Halt of reports on Al-Zawahri makes all probabilities possible. He may be alive, as he may have succeeded in escaping from the American siege, and he may have died in one of the American intensive attacks.

The reader says in his letter, "An advertisement was run to announce the establishment of the Satellite Company (NileSat) with a capital of $ 170 million, of which government bodies, banks and insurance companies paid 90%. However, according to the law, the remainder of the capital had to be put up for public subscription. All the shares were actually subscribed to, and the bids even exceeded the total value of the shares offered. As luck had it, I was allocated 550 share blocks, which translated into 11,000 shares, for a nominal value of $ 55,000.
"These are the most important indications. To be fair, the company did issue a single coupon that was worth 4% of the nominal value of the shares.
Comment: The drop in the value of shares and the distributed profits is a result of the company's performance. Restoring confidence in the shares requires correction of the current state of affairs and showing a clear and transparent picture to shareholders. This can be accomplished by the company's directors, who control 90% of the shares and are undoubtedly keen on showing profit for their investments, particularly as the money they invest in this company are funds contributed by public banks and companies whose money is owned by the people. On the other hand, the shareholders should adopt an attitude of patience, as all projects make or lose money according to local and global economic conditions.

WOMEN COMPETE WITH MEN IN THE DOCK!
Last year witnessed 9 women having received capital punishment , 719 women sentenced to life imprisonment, 1185 received temporary with prison sentences, while about 3 thousand women received prison sentences and the same number had to pay fines.
Giza, with its 1600 women defendants , two capital punishments, 100 hard labour sentences and 225 temporary imprisonment sentences, comes second after Cairo.
Nevertheless, women are more likely to be acquitted than men. Out of the 12 thousand women defendants who stood before criminal courts 6700 women were acquitted i.e. over one half. On the other hand, over 33 thousand men stood before the same courts but only 11 thousand were acquitted i.e. less than the third. The reason for that was perhaps that in most cases the man would be the original culprit.
Some crimes are still out of the woman's reach unless she has a male assistant.
Drugs are one of the crimes that may lead women to criminal courts and then to "Al Qanatir Woman Prison". Such female drug traffickers have got nicknames. All Cairo and Giza courts know "Rasmeya", the most famous drug trafficker in Sayeda Zeinab and Al Khalafi districts, as well as Ratiba, the empress of Maxiton Forte in East Cairo and Nasr City, and Sabrin, the legendary woman trafficker of Heroin in Al Matariya area.
Cairo Criminal Court President justice Farid Nasr says that the woman's presence in criminal courts has become natural as they have been there in all fields - bank director, businesswoman and senior dignitary and drug trafficker as well.

An official with the bank uncovered that the general assembly would approve the bank's board of directors' recommendation to issue nominal bonds valued at some 600 million pounds that have variable or fixed return and could not be converted into shares. This step comes in light of the high demand for such kind of bonds which were previously issued by many banks, the last of which was Misr-Iran Bank. Through using the bond proceeds clients' needs could be met. It will also make the bank more flexible in the field of credit, provide advanced banking services for customers and boost the bank's activities in financing many vital projects in various fields, such as gas, energy, communications and services. This will be either in form of short-term finance to fund the working capital or medium and long-term loans to bankroll fresh investments or expand already existing projects, thus increasing the production capacity, and meet individuals' needs of loans.

The Group had also called upon its cadres to issue their election cards amid near certain expectations of a serious consideration to participate in the coming elections.
Mohammad Abul Hadid wrote in Al Gomhouria:
The unacceptable political price here was related to Arafat alone and was represented by the arbitrary conditions that Ariel Sharon wanted to impose on Arafat to allow him to travel to Lebanon to attend the Arab League summit.
There are many reasons for that, including: 1-	The Beirut summit itself lost much of its momentum before its start, as more than one-half of the Arab leaders have not shown up for the summit. Presenting the Saudi initiative to this summit or having it endorsed by only the Arab leaders who attended would mean a stillborn initiative. This would serve neither the initiative nor Saudi Arabia itself, nor even the Arab World as a whole.
Launching the Saudi initiative under such conditions would mean that we are confirming a partial inability with a total Arab inability.
This means that everybody wants to collect a political price from the Arabs without giving them anything in return.
On 26 March, our colleague Al Ahram's front page carried an eight-column banner headline that said, "Mubarak makes intensive consultations with Arab leaders upon arrival in Beirut prior to start of Arab summit tomorrow." On Wednesday, Al Ahram's front-page headline said, "Mubarak tasks Ebeid to head Egyptian delegation to Arab summit that starts today in Beirut."
As King Abdullah was also absent from the summit, the unanimity required for supporting the Palestinians was not achieved. The responsibility for that is on those who did not show up for the meeting, not on those who attended the summit, and it remains for us to receive feasible explanations for the failure to show up at the summit.
The Palestinian negotiator said to me on the telephone that everything was possible, including storming the Palestinian territories by troops. The Palestinians can do nothing but resist.
He has even harmed the Palestinians and damaged their cause, proposing only imaginary projects that have served no purpose other than drawing attention away from any Egyptian or Saudi initiatives that were proposed in a bid to find a reasonable solution for the crisis.

THE CARICATURE UNDERGOING PAINLESS TEETH PULLING OPERATION
A Cabinet source said that Dr. Ebeid contented himself with directing Mostafa Hussein to abiding by the principle of objectivity. He reiterated the common argument cited by the Government when it got fed up with criticism: "such daily attacks through the caricature affect the Government policies and embarrass them before international organizations." It also leads to the escape of investments and deprives the Egyptian street of confidence in all Government procedures.

During the company's shareholder's meeting that was held to discuss the elections of the board of directors, it was only natural that the representatives of the Government, banks and insurance companies win the seats on the board.
A project's failure to make profits matching its shareholders' expectations does not mean that such a trend will persist. What is needed here is calling the company's management to account for the results of the company's performance. If the management betters its performance, it can go on running the company, and if it does not, then it has to go.

The proposal aims at employing the bond proceeds in the traditional banking activities including the extension of credits to institutions and individuals. This field has urgently been needed in the recent period now that the Egyptian banks have no longer provided funds for lending during such a period in a bid to avoid the risks of irregularity and defaulting.
The National Investment Bank, which is in charge of paying the debts, will not delay the payment of any other debts, the minister said.

$2.36 BILLION ISRAELI TRADE BALANCE DEFICIT
However, the bank experts found it difficult to assess the negative effects of the terroristic attacks in the US on tourism in Israel.
The reason for that lies in the fact that Fateh's power has grown in Palestinian ranks during the Intifada. This especially happened after the serial of bold and successful operations that have been carried out by its activists against the Israeli army (destroying two Merkava tanks considered the most modern tanks in the world and also the ones with the strongest armour), attacking several military barriers and liquidating the soldiers and officers stationed there. Their operations also included storming fortified settlements.
The other opinion, however, argues that that organization would threaten not Israel but also Yasser Arafat and the current Palestinian leadership status as well as it has now run amok and become so out of control that even its own leader Marawan Al-Barghouthi cannot control it fully.
Hizbollah Secretary General, Hassan Nasrullah urged the Arab summit to raise its voice giving priority to backing the Palestinian uprising and resistance as well as resistance in Lebanon. He said, "any statement that fails to do that is a statement dictated by America but just written by Arab fingers."
He added. He went on to say that it was the duty of the Arab countries to provide the Palestinians with arms as they are being slaughtered and killed. The honourable is the one who offers weapons to the Palestinians and any remissness in that duty would be a crime as it would be a sort of collusion in shedding their blood, part of which would be spared if weapons were at hand.
Never run away with the idea that you are America's friends or allies as it would overburden you with extra conditions and demands, both towards your peoples and Israel so that all your governments would stay in a state of panic so that further capitulations would be made by them.
Addressing his weekly meeting on 27 March, Sheikh Fadlullah said, "The call to Islamic unity is a call for Muslims to tread the line of Quranic Islam, because Islam, which is a religion of dialogue and openness to people, does not want its followers to be confined to sectarian and partisan circles, away from the grand Islamic objective of showing Muslims as representatives of one nation and one community that seeks prevalence of good and persistence of the values of mercy and love in the whole world."
Obviously the Saudi anti-striking Iraq stance has both overtly and covertly encouraged the Jordanian monarch to tour some European countries recently, making statements vehemently denouncing any imminent military action against Iraq, emphasizing that such a position is implicitly and explicitly sponsored by his country. He expected a virtual catastrophe and a state of instability that may destroy the peace process on the Palestinian track in case of striking Iraq.
According to Jordanian follow-up sources, Cheney replied in the negative, insisting on the classical tone reiterating that Washington could neither ignore the Iraqi regime, nor let it behave at will. However, the reply of the Saudi Prince was that the two matters were worlds apart.
According to the sources, the visit is considered one of four measures upon which the belligerent parties in the Sudan have agreed with the US envoy to Sudan and as part of the US efforts to end the war there.
SPLA officials announced that the movement was going ahead with the issuance of its own currency and the establishment of a central bank in its areas in the south.
Arman described Garang's visit as "successful by all standards," as the Colonel had met with all concerned officials of the U.S. Administration and Congress.
Al Hayat asked Arman about the actions being taken for issuing a special currency for the south, which was viewed by observers as a step towards the establishment of an independent state. He responded with, "These steps have nothing to do with the secession of the south; they only come in response to the requirements of administration and services in the liberated areas. Services and aspects of life cannot wait for peace."
Admiral Thomas Welson, the US Military Intelligence Agency Chief, said the Muslim world is under stupendous pressure due to the unfavorable impacts of globalization, terrible overpopulation, deteriorating economic conditions and inability to achieve a balance between modernization and preservation of traditional values and customs, especially following the US led international fight against terror.

The remarks were made by the Christian leader at a rally at the Bar Association on March 31 marking the Palestinian Land Day, with political forces' representatives attending.
In an interview to Al-Hayat, Muhajerani charged the American Administration with backing repressive Israeli measures especially as General Anthony Zinni (the American envoy) is still in the region and that his role is simply to gain time in favour of the Israelis to eliminate the independent Palestinian state project and entirely obliterate the Palestinian Authority and all its institutions that nothing would be left under the name of Palestinian self- rule.
He added that what is happening had reinforced President Arafat's leadership as he has proven beyond any doubt to be the "Symbol of resistance, uprising, dignity, and power in Palestine", thus I think that has become evident to all including Iran.
He thought that there had been a sort of default in that sector and urged the Iranian street to act and demonstrate in support of Palestine.

The statement called on all Arab political and popular forces and institutions to intensify their campaigns and close up ranks and to express the Arab street attitude towards Israeli hooliganism and American bias and to provide all possible assistance to the strategy of resistance and liberation.

Head of Traders and Importers of Medical Equipment Branch said, "The suspension of commercial and economic relations with countries that help Israel must be gradually implemented. Equipment imported from those countries must be listed and the imported from other markets.
Participants in the "July Revolution and the Arabs in Half a Century" symposium, organised yesterday evening, asked that an integrated strategy be laid down to prepare for and wage war against Israel as soon as possible.
He added that distancing Egypt from the Arab nation or destabilizing it leads to the weakness of the Arabs and vice versa.
He stressed the necessity of joint Arab action to face the current challenges.
On his part, political expert Ahmed Yossef said that the Palestinian people is exposed to an all-out genocide war.
Contrary to what the Israelis and the Americans had expected, the Arabs peace initiative was tantamount to a shock to Israel.
Washington was not certain that the summit results would be 100 % in its favour.
Anticipating that Israel n may deport Palestinians, Egypt has recently reinforced its police forces along the borders with Gaza and the frontier Rafah crossing area.
Around 5,000 Palestinian refugees had stayed at Canada refugee camp in Egypt for nearly 28 years before Israel allowed them to return to Tel Sultan area in Gaza.
They voiced their concern over the potential extension of the Zionist aggressions to outside the frontiers, particularly after Israeli Minister of Defense Benyamin Ben-Eleizer said that war has no borders.
Of course, we never expect any of the Arabs to respond in action rather than through "microphones' to that American deception or that Israeli war to exterminate the Palestinians or those impudent military threats against neighbouring Arab countries.
Do they remember that the real and effective backing of this valiant Palestinian resistance could have been and is still able to bleed the Israeli monster for good? Do they remember that the Arab street throughout the Arab World from Al-Mashriq to Al-Maghrib is boiling with anger against the ferocity of Israel and the American bias towards Israel?
Competition over the remaining 20 percent of seats is flaring up, as758 candidates were fielded by the opposition Wafd Party, 193 by the leftist Grouping Party, 22 by the Nasserite, 14 by the Green and 5 by the (suspended) Labour Party.

He pointed out that the total allocations last year were $2.3 billion and the collected rate differentials for them costs investors LE1.5 billion.
The credit, sometimes, remains open for 3 or 4 months until the producer markets his commodities or products and so he is legally considered responsible for the rate differentials as long as the documentary credit remains open.
He demanded that such debts be considered as bad debts.
The door of raising donations was opened on Thursday evening (April 4th).
Al-Arabi pointed out that the Chamber's stance towards the Palestinian cause accepts no compromises as it sticks fast to a full rejection of all forms of normalization with the Israeli entity.
The Korean bank's president emphasized the bank's readiness to extend the line of credit in order to fund the joint production projects.

It might be mentioned that the Egyptian Industries Federation had started a programme to energize the agreements signed with its counter numbers all over the world so as to lay down practical mechanisms to boost Egyptian exports. Export-oriented joint manufacture will be focused on, as it is considered the fastest mechanisms to bolster industry, attract advanced technology and draw upon the expertise of international major companies.

KUWAIT: "REPUBLIC OF IRAQ" INSTEAD OF "REGIME" & "HOSTAGES" NOT "POWS"
This orientation has come up during a recent meeting by a government leading figure with the local pressmen, some of whom expressed reservations about this orientation, opining that the Kuwaiti street will not accept such a "change" from the press, the sources said. They also wondered what Kuwait will get in return for this change. "This is in Kuwait favour and it's up to you", replied the government leading figure.
He added that he believed that the ball now is in the Iraqi court. In the summit Iraq pledged to do so and the pledge will be followed up by the summit to ensure that no infringements are made in that regard.
Such a tendency, nevertheless, was strongly criticized by some deputies. Deputy, Dr.WWalid Al Tabtibai in a statement to the press said: our Mouths and pens are meant to stop criticizing that impudent regime and to repress our groans even though our wounds are still bleeding from the dagger it had stabbed in our backs (the invasion).
Head of Foreign Affairs Committee in the parliament , deputy Mohamed Al Sakr, however, told mass media men that the Kuwaiti press is free and responsible and will deal with that matter according to what it deems right.
"Such discontent and other clear viewpoints have been reported to the government, he pointed out.
A high ranking official in the chamber, who asked to remain unidentified, said that Iraq's acceptance of "international conditions" as well as the rapprochement witnessed in Beirut summit between Iraq and some Gulf states would create extensive opportunities for Saudi contractors in infrastructure projects in Iraq and other constructing projects worth billions of Saudi riyals.
A member of the executive council of the Saudi Exports Development Centre told Al- Hayat that apart from Turkey his country is considered the biggest industrial country neighbouring Iraq adding that Saudi factories which had exported to Iraq through the oil-for- food-formula could treble their exports in a few months after the ban on Iraq is lifted so that they would exceed one billion dollars.
Over 30 Saudi companies and factories had participated in two exhibitions "Reconstruction of Iraq 2002" and "Iraq Project 2002" which had been mounted in Iraq between March 17th and 21st.
Saudi Minister of Education, Dr. Mohamed Al-Rashid said that education of boys and education of girls in Saudi Arabia are governed by one policy as they both emanate from Islam which the nation believes in as a creed, worship, ethics, legislation, government and as integrated system of life. This is a basic party of the general policy of the state, he added.
Milieus close to the Algerian President Abdel-Aziz Bouteflika are contacting activists in the moderate trend of the Berber Oroush (major Berber families) associations to convince them of the effectiveness of participating in the legislative elections scheduled on May 30th next.
In an interview with the Algerian official television in Al-Osboa Al-Jaza'ri (Algerian week) programme, the Socialist Forces Front Secretary General Assayed Ahmed Jedda'e said the party had decided to boycott the elections because no settlement would result from such elections.
1-	Running the elections at their set dates (next May 30th), hence, providing the best possible circumstances to convince the Berber of the necessity of participating in the elections although their participation has not exceeded 40 percent since Algeria's independence.
3-	Canceling the legislative elections, thus entering into a new transitional stage, and this is what the Socialist Forces Front as well as the former prime minister Ahmed Bin Betour are calling for.
Oroush coordination association listed a chain of denunciation activities including the staging of a sit-in in the major squares and another one near the Algerian embassy in Paris on Tuesday and sending a message to the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan.
Head of People's Assembly Committee on External Affairs and former Egyptian ambassador in Vienna, Moustafa El-Fiqi writes a lengthy article, some excerpts of which run to the following effect:
I'd like, in this context, to point out the following:
My reference here is particularly to the Turkish military establishment which, is both the advocate and votary of Ataturk's ideas.
To my mind, the real reason why Turkey is denied access to EU membership basically lies in cultural and civilizational differences.
The Turks' agenda is quite different from the Arabs' goals and aspirations.
The Ataturk oriented Turkish policy remained reserved towards the Arabs, allying itself with their enemies. Its role in the North Atlantic file represented a foreign base in the region where its military base in the region set up and its operations and attacks would be launched until the change seemed obvious in the last decade of the previous century when we found ourselves before political and military cooperation linking Ankara and the state of Israel so much so that mutual military visits became routine work that arouses both enquiries and concern.
We might not have forgotten in the last years how Turkish forces incursions inside Iraqi territories under the pretext of running after the remains of the Kurdistani Workers Party to eliminate them.
Nevertheless, we are still looking forward to a positive Turkish role, which the Arabs may welcome but is not objectionable to Israel, a role that can be just, balanced, objective and sincere.
Addressing the Arab rulers, Mousa said that the deceitful faces of Israel and its eternal ally the US were unmasked. They do not want the Arabs to live in peace, but rather surrender and sign a blank ownership deed under which the remaining Palestinian Arab land becomes Israeli property. "What will you do?" Mousa asked the Arab rulers, calling on them to provide the Intifada with weapons according to the decisions of the recent summit in Beirut.
Addressing Bush from "his own house in Cairo" (AUC) Mossa said he would like to ask the US President who unjustly and oppressively supports the Israeli enemy against the Arab and Muslim peoples, How can you understand Israel's right to defend itself but do not understand the Palestinian people's right to defend themselves and their rights, which are approved by all international laws? How can you do your utmost and use all that you have including a veto, temptation, intimidation and threatening means and even weapons to force Iraq to comply with the UN resolutions and kill more than million children and destroy the economy of a civilized nation while you stand with all your power to defend the Israeli terrorism against the unarmed Palestinian people? Which right or evenhandedness is this?
He added that it is high time for America to restore its credibility by forcing Israel to comply with the UN resolutions 194, 425, 338, and 242 without any double-standard treatment. Otherwise, America in the first place and Europe should expect evil consequences.
SUZANNE MUBARAK: HUMAN BOMBS ARE THE ONLY MEANS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE TO DEFEND THEIR LAND
The Intifada and legitimate resistance are the only weapon with the Palestinians to defend themselves, she indicated, adding that human bombs are the ultimate desperate means for those who have no other alternative.
They also called for cutting oil exports to the Zionist entity and the USA, which supports Israel in killing our people, severing all kinds of relations and forms of normalization, holding activities in support of resistance and considering Friday (April 12th) a day for wrath and protest against brutal massacres.
In a statement issued yesterday by the Federation it called upon the USA to take a just and strict stance towards the Israeli atrocities and relinquish its double-standard policy.
On April 7th, the Egyptian Bar Association staged a mass sit-in in solidarity with the Palestinian people and in protest against the Arab effeteness to protect the Palestinian people who are being exposed to heinous massacres at the hands of the Israelis.
ISRAEL RANKS FIFTH ON EGYPTIAN EXPORTS MAP

The American company will seek the help of an Austrian one in running Al-Amireya. Al-Zayyat offered 13 million dollars which are less than the value of the company's annual depreciation volume.
Alexandria Coptic Melli Council (Coptic Melli community) held a mass rally on April 7 evening. The rally, which was held under the auspices of Pope Shenuda III, condemned the Arab passiveness regarding Israeli massacres against the Palestinian people, and called for supporting the unarmed Palestinian people financially and morally.
In the beginning, I hardly imagined the amount or degree of enthusiasm in the hearts of my schoolmates, boys and girls alike of different ages especially after the warnings they had received from the teachers and the headmistresses, which frustrated us.
On Thursday 4/4/2002 the day we defined for the demonstration, we left the school carrying flags and chanting, "Palestine, Palestine, we're chanting in your support and won't maintain silence.
Even though no previous plan had been prepared for the march, everything was spontaneously organized- primary school students first, then the girls, and finally came secondary school boys.
EGYPTIAN SIWA OASIS SOURCE OF HEALTHY FOOD FOR EUROPE
Head of Siwa Oasis Investors Society, Dr.AAhmed AL Gharabawi presented a summary of the visits paid by the European and Chinese delegations to the forum on "Futuristic Horizons for Siwa Oasis in the Fields of Tourism, Especially Curative Tourism, Agriculture, Investment and Exports" organized by Commercial Representation Body in the Ministry of Foreign Trade for its members.
He also pointed out that the ecotourism hotel in Siwa relies on nature in all its sevices and is looked in advance for a couple of years by foreign tourists, besides the oasis safari tourism potential.
He added that if 40 million olive trees were planted on the oasis, Egypt could rank second among olive oil producing countries in the world, in addition to its high quality.
Under the above headline, the veteran writer Fahmi Heweidi wrote:
We won't exaggerate if we say that nothing of the sort has been done whether at the country or the regional level, let alone the national level. The accountability is shared out by all perhaps on a par. This is no time for speculating on or accusing the other party.
Take, for instance, a small detail that embodied that remissness, the case of peace activists who came from several countries in Europe, America and Latin America. They went to the occupied lands in solidarity with President Arafat and the camps dwellers there. They were reported by the press as having volunteered to act as human shields in the face of Israeli aggression. I have looked in vain for a name or a face of those intellectuals who had raised the flag of peace and talked verbosely about all over the country. They have often been available in posh hotels hymning the songs of peace with Israel.
The peace movements in Israeli have been exposed too. Just as the case was with each previous encounter, when such movements had to stand the real test, they simply vanished, thus finding their identity by supporting the genocide project.
The volume of monetary reserve went down to LE70.338 billion while the monetary volume circulated outside the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) rose to LE43.809 billion, according to a report issued by the CBE on March 31st.

Most prominent of these incentives is the stress that dollar savings owners can have access to any dollar quantities at any time to open documentary credits, repay debts or get loans to finance working capital.
CBE: BANKS LENT PRIVATE SECTOR LE21.5 BILLION IN ONE YEAR
The volume of such assets in foreign currencies hit what equivalent to 45.609 billion pounds, of which 568 million pounds for agriculture, 18.3 billion pounds for industry, 8.3 billion pounds for trade, 14.5 billion pounds for services and about 3.2 billion pounds for other sectors, it pointed out.

An international report expected that the governmental banks would not be privatized in the near future. On the contrary, it expected that the Government would push ahead with the privatization of such banks' administrations and providing them with banking cadres especially those coming from branches of foreign banks operative in Egypt.
In its report the Group touched upon the future of privatizing joint banks in Egypt and the difficulty of getting a license to set up a bank in Egypt in light of the restrictions imposed by the CBE.

INFRASTRUCTURE FEEBLENESS IS THE MAIN OBSTACLE TO INVESTMENT IN UPPER EGYPT
Abdul-Mut'aal said that Assuit Businessmen Society was not a society for businessmen nor did it include businessmen as members but it is a developmental society aiming at developing the community, socially, economically, healthily and culturally, rather than profit making.
Public and private banks are competing over hunting foreign currencies, particularly the dollar, from depositors, investors and businessmen. Most of these banks started to get rid of the restrictions they were setting on accounts, thus expanding in issuing saving coffers in foreign currency, especially the dollar and the euro, without putting conditions such as a minimum of money.
On his part, Dr Muhammad Al-Mugi, general director and member of the policies committee with the National Bank of Egypt (NBE), affirmed that the bank has issued a coffer in euro early this week, adding that 170 clients have opened saving books in euro in 4 days to the tune of 700 thousand euros.
In spite of banks attempts to expand in this direction, this step is met with big approval by dollar resources owners in light of the declining interest rate due on it, hitting about 1.75% annually, pointed out Ahmad Quora, general director of the Societé Arabe Internationale de Banque (SAIB).

The investment protection agreement signed between the two countries would soon take effect, thus enhancing joint cooperation in addition to continuing the federal government program of encouraging the private sector to invest in Egypt, he added.
International companies resorted to some tricks to tempt the citizens into buying their products, the study added pointing out that those companies claimed in many Arab states particularly Egypt that there was no Jewish contributions to those companies which, therefore, have no relation with Israel.
In a statement issued yesterday by the Federation it called upon the USA to take a just and strict stance towards the Israeli atrocities and relinquish its double-standard policy.

JEWS IN AL-AMIREYA YARN AND TEXTILE COMPANY
Al-Mussawar learnt that Dr.BBaha Helmi, President of Misr Banque, which owns Al- Amireya, preferred to keep away from the procedures of concluding the deal. Rather, he preferred to let it in to the Government represented in Minister of Foreign Trade, Youssef Boutros Ghali.
Dr.YYoussef Boutros Ghali, Minister of Foreign Trade, said that a package of measures are underway to protect the local market of international trade harmful practices. On the other hand, the Export and Import Control Authority is studying foodstuff imports standard specifications with a view to upgrading them in light of the latest developments and decreasing exportation cost by decreasing time and effort waste , a task whose provision necessitates tightening the control process in addition to registering a number of international inspection and auditing companies with the authority so that the certificates issued from them about many of imported goods could be accredited, a thing that saves both time and effort in imports release.
All data will be stored on computers and when the goods arrive, those data will be sent to the customs department of arrival, which will verify the documents and take out the sample to be examined. The goods will be released at the same time under reservation until the results of the sample analysis arrive in order that the goods are finally released.
The bills introduce new facilities including the cancellation of the provision that stipulates the elapse of five years before an Arab or foreign owner can dispose of his\her property.
The MPs who put forward the two bills, which were approved by the Ministry of Justice and were referred to a joint committee comprising legislative and plan and budget committees, said that these amendments cope with the pieces of legislation, which have been recently issued to encourage the revival of the Egyptian monetary market especially in light of the severe recession that has recently afflicted it.

Experts of a European Committee that have recently visited Siwa Oasis emphasized that the oasis is a source of organic food which is free of pollution and chemical fertilizers, thus appealing to the taste of the European consumer and meeting the European conditions for a model farm.
For his turn, Al-Said Qasim said that such a seminar came as a prelude to signing a cooperation protocol between the Commercial Representation Authority and Siwa Oasis investors to promote agricultural exports produced by the oasis on international markets in addition to attracting foreign investments to it.
He added that curative tourism came in the forefront of available potentialities that could be exploited through seeking recovery from dermatitis and rheumatoid through burying the diseased parts in the sand, which could also be used for making glass and ceramics.
He added that if 40 million olive trees were planted on the oasis, Egypt could rank second among olive oil producing countries in the world, in addition to its high quality.
The administration of the National Bank of Egypt (NBE) decided to cancel its contract with the European Investment Bank (EIB) concerning extending soft loans to Public Enterprise Sector companies with a view to helping them adjust their environment-related positions as per the Environment Act.

In this case only 5 million euros have been made use of while the contract for the remaining 10 million euros was cancelled.
He also spoke about transporting equipment from Saudi Arabia one year and a half ago.
Ahead of the US Vice-President Deck Cheney's tour in the Mideast, the US denied that it had a base in the north of Doha.
Moreover, the term "tyrant" will not be used in describing President Saddam Hussein and the word "POWs" will disappear and the term "hostages" will be approved instead in describing more than 600 Kuwaitis arrested by the Iraqi forces in the wake of its occupation of Kuwait.
Kuwaiti First Deputy Premier, Foreign Minister Al Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed held a meeting yesterday with members of Foreign Affairs Committee in the National Assembly (the Parliament). He explained what happened in Beirut summit regarding the Iraqi-Kuwaiti "Situation".
There is no new strategy regarding the domestic press, but there is an evident strategy in official mass media."
He recalled to memory the absence of "Hundreds of POWs whom the unjust Iraqi regime denies, resorting to all sorts of altercations regarding them.
The committee rapporteur, Abd El Mohsien Gamal denied any intentions regarding any Kuwaiti-Iraqi rapprochement emphasizing that dealing with Iraq would continue following the policy of caution. He added that a change of official policy towards Baghdad is possible, but we are a democratic country that has freedom of public opinion and a press that can not be controlled.
SAUDI EXPORTERS AND CONTRACTORS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY OF RECONSTRUCTING IRAQ
The same source estimated the Saudi contractors' surplus equipment value at about 17 billion Saudi riyals ($4.533 billion) and the number of machines at about 76.8 thousand machinery pieces, 10 percent of which are operative for the time being.
The number of Saudi companies which export to Iraq has reached about 35 companies since dealings with the Iraqi market started.
The U.NN allows Iraq to sell oil to buy food materials and machines and serve staple goods to relieve the impact of sanctions.
Al-Rashid pointed out that the syllabi of Islamic education were the most important components of curricula in Saudi Arabia. Neither will there be any reduction in the number of its lessons. Rather, there will be ever greater keenness on letting that education emerge more evidently in the behaviour of both boys and girls. This is a priority which cannot be alienated by the Ministry, he added.
It was reported that activists from Oroush associations had received generous offers from envoys close to presidential cabinet officials who expressed their desire that Oroush activists and representatives of NGOs might contest the elections on independent lists with the target of "defending their convictions including the promotion of the Tamazight language in the state's institutions."
Some circles consider the withdrawal of the Socialist Forces Front from the elections a golden chance for the government to create new circumstances for the representatives of the moderate trend in the Oroush organizations with a view to presenting them as a "third party" in such an area where two Berber parties have been monopolizing competition since 1989, namely; the Socialist Forces Front led by Assayed Hussein Ayat Ahmed and the Grouping for Culture and Democracy led by Dr Said Sa'di who called on March 14th for boycotting elections. "Such elections ensure the continuation of the regime no matter what the price would be", Sa'di said.
2-	Putting off the elections 60 days as stipulated in the elections law.
Yesterday and for the first time in two weeks, the Qabalia area witnessed a noticeable calm. The worst confrontations have taken place in such an area since the murder of a young man named Masinisa Karmah in a centre affiliated to the national gendarmerie last year.
A large number of activists in such hard-line organizations have resorted to going underground now that the security bodies have detained some one hundred persons of whom 42 were jailed pending trial on charges of civil disobedience, sabotaging public property and inciting people to violate security and public order.
I have always felt that such a Turkish absent role did not stop at that but got itself involved in a strategic relation with Israel which was reinforced by constant military cooperation.
Second: the Turkish role seems unintelligible without full knowledge of its incentives and ends.
Third: the popular growing Islamic trend failed to impose itself officially. The Al Fadhila (Virtue) Party experiment and the political denouement of Necmettin Erbakan bears evidence to a special kind of evolution indicating the trusteeship role played by the Turkish army under the name of Ataturk's secularism and how that affects the Turkish future state.
Fifth: Turkish enthusiasm for strong relations with Israel emanates from a strong desire to offer strong credentials to the USA seeking its assistance to get access to the EU membership.
The relation between the Turks and the Palestinian cause dates back to the Ottoman period since the international Zionism exercised pressure at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century on the Ottoman Sultan at Constantinople when he was on the brink of political death to elicit from him a declaration that would bolster its presence in Palestine.
Turkey and Iraq In the recent years the Iraqi question has been the direct cause of a Turkish dialogue with the Arabs at the regional level, and with the USA at the international level.
I'd like to refer frankly to the missed out Turkish role in a political settlement of the Palestinian question.
The American University in Cairo (AUC) witnessed a strongly worded attack on US President George W. Bush and killer Sharon. In his address, the Arab League Secretary- General Amr Mousa called Sharon "Dracula of Israel" and described Bush as haughty thug. He warned the US that the barefaced bias against the Arab rights would have evil consequences.
He pointed out that the US-supported Israeli assault comes in reaction to the Arab reconciliation between Iraq and the two sisterly countries of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which underlines the American and Israeli desire that the Arabs would surrender along the line, but they are crying to the moon.
When will Bush understand that the land of Palestine is not one of his estates and that the Arabs are not a herd of cows that can be milked under his decisions? When will he understand that Iraq is not one of his states? When will he understand what happened to Israel in Lebanon and when will he understand that the Arabs and Muslims whom he declared his enemies are the architects of his own civilisation?
Addressing Palestinian President at the end of his speech, the Arab League Secretary- General Amr Mousa said, "From the US President own house, I'd like to ask you to resist and persevere as the whole nation is behind you from the ocean to the Gulf and will set fire under the feet of the enemies.
The Palestinians undergo a catastrophe due to the Israeli continuous aggression, she told Italian mass media.
Over 60 Muslim scholars and Islamic movements' leaders in the Arab World responded to a request by US President Bush, who demanded from Arab leaders not to dub the operations carried out by the Palestinians against the Israelis as martyrdom operations, by issuing a fatwa that makes it inevitable upon Muslims to struggle against Israel, considering such struggle a "religious duty." They called upon Arab and Muslim peoples to exert pressure on their leaders to declare public mobilization and jihad so as to liberate land and sanctities as well as supporting the oppressed people who are being exposed to the Zionist brutality.
INDUSTRIES FEDERATION CALLS FOR STOPPING DEALING WITH ISRAEL
He also called upon businessmen and manufacturers to take candid positions within such a context.
They also called on the Ring Countries to open their borders for strugglers to defend the Al- Aqsa Mosque and the church of Nativity.
The data, included in the Ministry's monthly report, revealed that Israel retained the fifth position on the list of the Egyptian products main importers between January-October 2001 despite the fact that the Egyptian exports volume to Israel retreated to $176 million compared to $233 million in the correspondent period in 2000.
Under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Atef Ebeid, the Ministerial Committee on Privatization has recently approved of letting out Misr Al-Amireya Yarn and Textile Company to a company that would participate in its administration system as a prelude to purchasing it.
It is noteworthy that some Koreans had bidden for a partnership in Al-Amireya through offering to contribute a secondhand factory whose value was extremely exorbitant.
A FIRST YEAR SECONDARY STUDENTS' ACCOUNT OF HER SCHOOLMATES DEMONSTRATIONS AGAINST ISRAEL
Two days ago some of my schoolmates (females) started to think of holding a peaceful demonstration to express our feeling and give vent to our pent up anger.
The highly resounding slogans filled our hearts with enthusiasm.
KHATTAB: THE PROCEEDS OF SELLING THE PUBLIC SECTOR EQUALS EGYPT'S EXPENDITURE IN 45 DAYS
They pointed out the available potentials of the oasis especially the fact that it can cultivate crops all the year round especially vegetables and fruit due to the pure fresh underground water resources as well as harvesting its fruit and vegetables earlier than those of Europe, which gives them a competitive advantage.
Qasim approved a visit by a delegation of the Commercial Representation Body to the oasis, in addition to inviting a number of foreign embassies commercial advisors to participate in that visit in order to get acquainted with the export and investment potentialities of the oasis.
He added that that came in addition to Pharaonic tourism as it was there that Alexander the Great was coronated at Amon Temple after his conquest of Egypt, Cleopatra Bathroom, Pharaonic temples carved in the caves in juxtaposition to the other techniques used for building temples in Egypt.
He pointed out that subterranean water in the oasis came from the Nubian reservoir with its upper and lower parts. 220 thousand feddans can be cultivated by using the upper part only over one hundred years through natural techniques.
The scrambling of such capability to affect and gain recognition has, no doubt, encouraged the USA to go to those lengths of wantonly justifying and promoting the Israeli overwhelming of the Palestinian land. We talk too much about what others plan and do even though such plans and actions can be included in the list of their performance of their obligations towards their own interests or aspirations, which we, in turn, see as wickedness and ambitions.
The Arabs raised slogan has cost them the ability to deter and consequently achieve peace. On the other hand, Israel has reacted to all that with growing confidence that enabled it to exploit peace for the continuation of occupation and to gradually seek to convert that peace into full surrender.
The more Sharon wades into Palestinian blood and after he overran, besieged and starved the cities, the more popular he becomes with his people. After he cut off supplies of water, electricity and gas, after he isolated Arafat and shelled his premises, after Palestinian corpses filled the streets and their injured denied medical treatment or kidnapped from hospitals, Sharon became more popular as 3 out of four Israelis supported him, according to opinion polls.
The ugliest blemish that was unveiled was connected with the American administration as we know quite well how the USA has been biased towards Israel since its establishment in 1948. We, however, used to notice that such bias took place rather coyly. We did appreciate but with varying degrees of respect the attitudes of some American leaderships such Wilson, Roosevelt, Eisenhower and Kennedy but what is done by the current President Bush and his team simply transcended expectations whether in terms of obvious scorn for the Arabs or complete obsequiousness to the Israelis.
His letter runs to the following effect:
The matter now goes beyond a simple obligation to show solidarity with brotherly Palestinians as it is an obligation of self and land defence.
Q: So you're prepared for various scenarios?
Q: What message do you send to the Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in besieged Ramallah?
How do you evaluate that attitude, especially as you know there is a peace treaty between the two countries?
Q: In light of US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, visit to the region, do you expect such a tour and visit to Israel and the Palestinian lands to stop Sharon's war?
In an interview with Al-Ahram, Al-Zahhar denied Israeli allegations claiming that there is a wing in Hamas ready to take over after Arafat. Such allegations are unbelievable and aim at driving a wedge among the Palestinian people. "No wing in Hamas can violate the general framework of the movement or hold negotiations with the Israeli enemy or take over. Israel wants to transfer the conflict arena into the Palestinian street through spreading rumours that cannot deceive anybody."
A scheme to change the region The Arab street strongly moves in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. Even the peoples in Germany, France and Belgium call for lifting oppression and stopping the Israeli aggression. This is clear evidence that the Arab nation calls for adopting a stalwart position against the USA and Israel, Al-Zahhar said.
Palestinian athletes do not search for professional contracts in Europe or famous clubs. They only seek to attain an eternal prestige in the hearts of the Palestinian people.
He answered, "I've been here and I've come to ask about you." We started talking about his career and future championships. In the evening we knew that he had carried out a martyrdom operation where 7 Israeli soldiers were killed and several scores were injured.
A: He was martyr Othman Al-Razayna, the weight lifting champion for whom we expected an international fame thanks to the standard he had attained in 1996 when he was 17 years old. He was awarded a 6-month scholarship in Spain sponsored by the Olympic Solidarity.
Q: How do mothers and sisters receive the news of their sons and brothers martyrdom?
Q: What should the Arab countries do realistically and practically to stop Israeli practices and save the Palestinian people from mortality?
Q: What do we all have to do from the humanitarian perspective?
The PNA was concerned that if the resistance was well- armed, the Israeli army would overrun Palestinian cities. However, the Palestinian cities are not being overwhelmed even though the resistance members have not been well-armed, which is a "strategic blunder'. But, the question of armament today requires a uniform leadership formed of Palestinian resistance members to plan to arm themselves, as well as coordination among the "Arab ring countries" (Israel's neighbors) to support the Intifada.
Selim: The sustained resistance is the only option to stand against Israeli impudence become draft alternatives wanted by Israel are totally rejectable.
MOROCCO CALLS FOR ACTIVATING ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL BOYCOTT AGAINST ISRAEL
Last week the Moroccan parliament called for activating the economic, commercial and cultural boycott against Israel and stopping all forms of relations and contact with it in protest against the military atrocities against the Palestinian people.
On the other hand, Moroccan Jewish businessmen paid a visit last Friday to the Palestinian embassy in Rabat and met with Ambassador Abu-Marwan to express solidarity with the Palestinian people and denounce Sharon's policy.
An operation against Iraq would result in stupendous casualties, Ivanov said, adding that Moscow could not understand the trend for using force against Iraq, particularly as nobody had provided evidence of Baghdad's involvement in terrorist activities.
Meanwhile, Ivanov's deputy, Alexander Sultanov, described the Iraqi situation as very complicated, pointing out that there was a serious risk in the possibility of handling the situation according to the military scenario and warning that such a possibility would mean serious upheavals in the region.
The American ambassador to Russia had announced that the United States might consider granting economic compensations to Russia should Moscow give its consent to the delivery of an ultimatum to Baghdad and the adoption of actions for replacing the ruling regime in Iraq if American- Russian demands that might be formulated during the Putin-Bush summit next month were not met.
ISRAEL DEMANDS 7 BILLION U.S. DOLLARS IN REPARATIONS FROM PALESTINIANS
Israel has not been delivering the Palestinian side's roughly-1.5-billion-dollar quota of taxes and customs proceeds since September 2000, turning its deaf ear to calls by the international community, donors and other parties concerned in the Palestinian-Israeli peace process, mainly including the European Union (EU).
The Israeli Ministry of Finance estimated Israel's economic losses brought about by the Palestinian Intifada at around 28.7 billion shekels and between 50,000 and 100,000 layoffs.
Security bodies uncovered that more than 100 defendants belonging to the so-called "Al- Tahrir (Liberation) Party" in some areas in Cairo and Giza had been arrested. The defendants are of different nationalities, including four British nationals. They attempted to propagate the party's terrorist ideas.
A big number of computer sets were seized with the defendants.
Egyptian sources said the young man was carrying explosives.
The sources have not uncovered the motive behind the attempted infiltration. Extensive investigations are underway to discover that motive which might be a wish to stand by the Palestinian people against the Israelis.
Tantawi described the resistance, steadfastness and the martyrdom operations of the Palestinian people as the ultimate honour.
In his sermon, Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh had emphasized that martyrdom operations were the noblest rank for strugglers in the cause of God, adding that resistance becomes legitimate if it is launched against a foreign occupier and aggressor. Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh also described the Jews as "apes and pigs" while he was lauding martyrdom operations.
Sharp argument has revived once again between Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh, Dr. Mohamed Sayed Tantawi and Dr. Youssef Al-Qaradawi on the fringes of the 12th Conference of Islamic Researches Academy in Al-Azhar. The controversy centred round three main points: martyrdom operations carried out by the Palestinians against the Israelis, the economic boycott of Israeli and American goods; opening the door for volunteers from the Islamic world to join the struggle side by side with the Palestinians against the Zionists.
For his part, Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh said that the operations carried out by the Palestinians against occupation soldiers or in the settlements are martyrdom operations, whereas killing civilians, women and children have nothing to do with Islam so much so that whoever blows himself up on purpose among Israeli civilians would be considered a suicide bomber. He pointed out that it was not valiant or befitting for Muslims to kill civilian women, and children even though the latter might be Zionist occupiers of the land or violators of sanctities or perpetrating genocide operations against the Palestinians.
Tantawi went on to say, "The boycott decision does not lie in my terms of reference as I am a religious scholar who cannot be conversant with everything."
Students of the Cairo and Ain Shams Universities have exchanged among themselves the phone numbers of the Israeli embassy to call it and declare their rejection of the Israeli massacres against the Palestinians and declare their full support of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
Minister of Higher Education Mufeed Shehab, who was also a member of the Committee on Arbitration at Taba negotiations, said the Egyptian-Israeli peace agreement has not achieved security to Egypt and its people. Addressing the Parliamentary Defence and National Security Committee, the minister said "Until this moment we do not feel safe or secure especially under the current circumstances in the Middle East.
Egyptian-Israeli trade and economic relations have been frozen since the outbreak of the Palestinian Intifada in 2000, said Commercial Representation Body Chairman al-Said Qassem.
No arrangements for exchanged visits are being made by the Ministry of Foreign Trade or the Commercial Representation Body, Qassem added.
EGYPTAIR DENIES HALTING AIR SINAI FLIGHTS TO TEL AVIV
In response to a campaign by Pharmacists Syndicate, pharmaceutical companies started a campaign for boycotting American banks.
The Syndicate received two letters from the two companies' boards including their decisions of boycott and depositing of cheques collected from pharmacies with other national banks.
The regional goings-on have unfavourably impacted on tourist investments worth 2 billion U.S. dollars at several areas, especially Nuweiba' and Taba.
-	Low tourist influx from the neighbouring countries (Palestine, Israel and relatively Jordan) -	Low international tourist influx to the region, including Egypt (low tourist movement from the American continent).
Palestinian tourist influx also nosedived by 32.7 percent, against 50 percent in the past two months.
It was striking that the spontaneous demonstrations launched two days ago in Abou- Rumana Street in Damascus witnessed slogans against the Egyptian official stance and Cairo's refrainment from severing diplomatic relations with Israel.
Even though those demonstrations were not official and organized by Syrian opposition forces including Nasserite Democratic Socialist Union led by Hassan Abdel-Azim, Egyptian officials voiced concern over their content.
In a statement by Orascom yesterday, it decided to appeal against the ruling passed by a Syrian court of law to appoint two judicial receivers with a view to running the company due to contradictions in the decisions taken by the board of directors members.
Egyptian political and strategic expert, Major General, Salah Eddin Selim uncovers the worst Israeli scenario in the history of the region. He says, "When Sharon stepped to power, he asked himself, "Why should we leave the remaining 22% of Palestine without annexing it to Israel? If some Palestinians remained in the Western Bank and Gaza Strip, they would be part of a limited self-rule authority.
The principle of setting up a Palestinian sovereign state is therefore declined.
Secondly, the abolition of the Syrian-Lebanese threat posed to North Israel through the liquidation of the military presence of Hizbullah in South Lebanon and striking the Syrian presence in Lebanon even though it has relatively depleted, and the preparation for running a "quasi-regional" war against Syria and Lebanon together during the coming couple of years while bolstering the military settlement in the occupied Golan Heights.
The first option is peace, the second option is hot war and the third option is no-peace and no-war, but cold war.
As for the second option which is hot war, frankly and obviously speaking, talk on regular war, both defence and offensive, is up to governments, which have relevant information and estimates.
Egypt's strategic peace has given full rein to Israel in devouring the Palestinian people and threatening the Lebanese and Syrian peoples.
We should take the following procedures and changes:
Halting any dealings or exchanges of information and official or popular experience between us and Israel.
FEARS OVER CBE MAINTAINING DOLLAR PUMPING POLICY
The indicator that increased such fears was the figure that was underlined by the recent report issued by the CBE regarding foreign assets inside the Egyptian banking body during the last quarter of 2001, which witnessed an increase over the previous quarter by 13 percent out of the total assets which hit 2.5 billion pounds (543.7 million dollars). This means that foreign exchange within the banks is on the increase.
To avoid such a situation and in order that the Egyptian banking units could face up to the reservations of the CBE over meeting their needs of foreign exchange, Arab African Bank Deputy Chairman Ahmed Selim called upon the banks to follow on activating policy to distribute the demand to a number of foreign currencies instead of focusing on the dollar.
The volume of expenditure in the new budget hits LE141.6 billion, up by 11.7%, and the expected revenues amount to LE111.4 billion, Hassanein said.
Wages, salaries and pensions increased by 9% against last year, with a total of LE34.8 billion, achieving an increase rate in current expenses by 10%, hitting LE72.9 billion. Thus total current expenses reached LE107.7 billion, up by 10% against last year.
As for the resources, most of which are self resources, available for financing investments, they amount to LE6.3 billion, up by 54.5% against last year, the minister said.
The minister indicated that the budget has allocated LE400 million for subsidizing exports.
Total external debt amounted to about LE26.2 billion, of which LE10 billion are debts of the government and the remainder is that of the private and joint sectors and economic bodies.
The total public expenditure volume in the budget bill is estimated at about LE141.6 billion, of which LE57.8 billion (representing about 41% of the total public expenditure in the budget) are allocated to catering for social needs of citizens and necessary allocations for employing about 750 thousand youths, announced Safwat Al-Sharif, Minister of Information. About LE34.8 billion were allocated for workers' wages and salaries. This comes within an all-out plan for administrative reform, improving labour conditions and giving workers their due periodic incentives and allowances, the minister said. In addition, LE19.3 billion were set aside for the implementation of infrastructure projects, other than LE6.7 billion in investments through economic bodies budgets with a view to executing electricity projects in cities and villages along with new urban communities and railway projects.
The total estimated investments in the budget hit LE19.3 billion, an increase of 26.3%, the minister added.
The State investments in the building and construction sector represents 55% of total investments in all production and service sectors, Sulaiman said. This confirms the State's interest in building, thus putting it among its priorities through the provision of potentialities, allocation of investments and conducting researches and studies.
Housing projects investments hit LE50 billion for building more than 2.6 million housing units.
During the periodic meeting held on April 9 for following up work at the free zones, head of the authority stressed that any attempt to misuse the facilities, offered by the authority to investment projects in general and free zones in particular, will be faced decisively. He affirmed that these facilities are meant to boost production and exportation and create new job opportunities.
The CBE had said earlier that foreign reserves amounted to $14.17 billion in January 2001, adding that the monetary supply in Egypt increased from LE306.916 billion in December 2000 to some LE309.190 billion ($66.6 billion) during January 2002.
The minister pointed out that getting rid of some companies is considered an achievement regardless of the low prices because selling represents a good economic feedback as it rids the Egyptian economy of annual losses that it can hardly sustain. Khattab pinpointed that international markets still witness a state of depression adding that the Middle East region becomes so inflamed that it will be difficult to guess how the privatization programme would proceed. In spite of the inability to make accurate predictions, it is expected that half the loss-making companies would be sold out in 24 months' time to specialized investors.
Egyptian-European cooperation in the field of partnership and attraction of more foreign investors contributes to accomplishing many benefits to boost exports, Ghali said, stressing the importance of increasing cooperation and coordination between different bodies especially the Ministry of Finance and Customs Department so as to sharpen the competitive edge of Egyptian exports.
He added that within the framework of the back-up program the citrus sector got 2.5 million pounds and the vegetables and fruit sector obtained one million and 46 thousand pounds. The food industries sector got 675 thousand pounds, the yarn and textile sector, 448 thousand pounds, the household upholstery sector, 4 million and 276 thousand pounds and the ready-to-wear clothes sector, 15 million and 235 thousand pounds.
Food industries exports also reported more than two million dollars during the same period. The vegetables and fruit exports amounted to about 7.4 million dollars and the citruses exports reported some 2.1 million dollars.
He pointed out that the number of companies benefiting from the program is still limited due to the fact that this has only been recently applied.
He affirmed that the tax repayment system contributed to raising exports to foreign markets as it encouraged exporters to increase exports, which was notably reflected in export figures.
The experts criticised the government negligence in carrying out the necessary measures for reviving demand for software and raising its sales. They also criticised the government insistence on imposing high taxes on Egyptian information technology imports. This represents the stumbling block in the way of national companies and prevents them from offering software packages at competitive prices.
He added that it took Egyptian companies only a few years to enter strategic partnerships with international programs development companies and play an effective role in offering advice and implementing solutions and systems. These companies offer their customers integrated systems designed and implemented especially to meet the requirements of each customer depending on the latest technological mechanisms in this field.
The national information system projects should be activated and the level of coordination between government bodies, unions, business organisations, non-governmental organisations, and companies should also be raised with a view to creating a healthy climate for activating software markets.
He added that a large number of Egyptian companies operative in the field of information industry had realised the importance of presence and competing on Arab markets as they moved to the field of the development of ready-made programs to meet the needs of local and Arab companies.
The study points out that the companies that deal in digital products are the first beneficiaries of the applications of information technology, due to the nature of the products they handle, which have a digital nature that allows them to be delivered to the consumer directly via the Internet with no additional cost added to the price of the product to increase the consumer's burden.

Al-Menofi expected that new transactions would be reached in such fields in light of the initial agreements that had been concluded during the visit paid by the Iraqi minister of industry to investment projects in the 6th of October City while visiting Cairo last month on the occasion of holding Cairo International Fair.
It is noteworthy that the volume of Egypt's contracts with Iraq in the last ten stages of the memo of understanding had hit some 3.6 billion dollars. Egypt is ranked third at international level and first at Arab level in terms of the volume of exports to Iraq. Total Egyptian exports to Iraq were almost 4 billion dollars in the last years within the framework of Oil-for-Food formula.
The report attributed such a retreat to the decrease in the cotton and garment exports. As for the value of export quotas, the report said that statistics pointed out that the highest rate of quotas had been in dried onions as the exported quantities had met all the scheduled quotas.

This can be performed in a way that doesn't cost the state budget too much money.
In statements to reporters, on the fringe of a forum organized by Centre for Developing Countries Studies and Researches, Cairo University, two days ago, he said, "Such sums decided upon in Sharm Al-Sheikh are just related to the implementation of Egypt government priorities regarding the treatment of the consequences of the September incidents."

While Egyptians, I mean the Egyptians with conscience and normal character, were united in their hearts and minds to show their solidarity with and backing of the Palestinian people and while their eyes and efforts were at the same directed to ensure a minimum even of free elections for the local councils in search of even a small indicator for the possibility of broadening the stifling narrow democratic margin - while normal Egyptians were engrossed in those tasks, the others whom we and you know were engrossed in the dirtiest operations of electoral falsification not seen by Egypt even under the worst ages of transgressing dictatorship.

STOPPING CENSURE AND REPROACH OF RULERS
Although each Arab nation spends billions of U.S. dollars on their armies (15 billion U.S. dollars spent annually by a single country on armament in the past two decades, according to estimates), it can be said so simply that there are no Arab armies and there are only weapon museums. Generals leading these armies are not selected according to their professional efficiency - quite the reverse for having efficient officers at the top of these armies may bring "bad consequences". The multitudinous security agencies, along with the ruler's sons, uncles and other relatives often have more power with the armed forces than the titular commanders. Commanders who accept roles dedicated to them are given awards, grants, decorations and orders, but officers who do their military duty efficiently are removed from their posts.
The Arab regimes then disavow any connection with those pilots especially as they will have suicide tasks, accusing them of craziness, according to the proposal. The advantage of this situation is to harm Israel and make a limited use of accumulated Arab weapons, with the Arab countries facing no consequences. Another solution is that a number of "mentally disturbed" soldiers can attack Israeli border positions and kill any soldiers there, and it will be very great if they can attack the Israeli Dimona nuclear reactor.
Such agreement is considered a renewal of one that had been signed in 1988 and was annually renewed as of 1997 till now.
Such countries are: Algeria, Morocco and perhaps Tunisia. In the second place of importance comes the fact that Spain would enjoy a number of privileges in the forefront of which is considering it as an ally of the first rate just like Canada, Britain and Australia. This is translated into opening the American market to Spanish weaponry and the transfer of some American military technology.
The military cooperation agreement has some implications for Morocco which can be considered negative on the whole as Morocco would find itself all of a sudden, opposite the largest American military base only 30 kilometers away of its Northern shores or rather Tangier.

A good example of this cooperation is that one between EgyptAir and the Lithuanian Air Company.
Regarding the volume of commercial exchange, Zekri sees that the volume of this exchange between Egypt and Estonia is considered very weak and it tilts in Estonia's favour. Estonia is famous for producing timber and paper. Egypt's imports from Estonia is big when compared to the exports although there are export opportunities before the Egyptian products to Estonia. Egyptian exporters and producers should direct to these promising markets as Estonia needs vegetables, fruits, foodstuffs, carpets, ceramics, plastic, textiles, cotton clothes and pharmaceuticals.

ISRAELI EMBASSY LOOKS FOR OTHER PREMISES
They pointed out that the Israelis had started thinking once more of accepting what they had adamantly refused before, which was selecting other premises for their embassy in one of the new cities on the outskirts of Cairo, so that the embassy might be near to the capital as per diplomatic traditions. Meanwhile, the Israeli Ambassador and members of the embassy staff have started thinking of finding accommodations near the new premises of their embassy under special security precautions.
The intellectuals described Ebeid's statements as frustrating and unbecoming to the Prime Minister, particularly as Egypt had made and was making sacrifices for the Arab Nation without waiting for anything in return.
"I hate the sense of inability and surrender to American domination and the claims that there is no way to resist the American pressure and the American schemes that damage Arab national security," General Selim said. "I wish that the professor of disasters would learn from North Korea, which pulled President George Bush's teeth when he threatened it as part of the axis of evil. North Korea has stood fast for four decades in the face of American pressures.
"This requires a strong Egyptian government that would be capable of having all terms of reference to build a comprehensive power structure for Egypt," he explained. "Such a government would comprise men whose solidity has not been eroded by senility, nor has their immortality in office made them soft and keen on enjoying the comforts and pleasures of life."
Therefore, what is required is the preparation of an Arab army for the confrontation, not dependence on Egypt and regarding Egypt as the only solution for liberating Palestine."
All the colours of the rainbow are in Egypt, which is an indication of political multiplicity and a proof of democracy. However, there is an obvious exclusion of the Islamic current.
It does not accept opposition because it rules in the name of religion.
A: That is why we are against the Israeli State.
A: Agendas that are not related to religion in any way. But here in the Arab World, we ask them what their political agenda is, and they answer that the Quran is their constitution.
This was what first sowed the seeds of rift in Egypt and led to the emergence of groups that practiced political work from a religious perspective.
A: Never.
It was the first time for me to see the blood of an unarmed person being shed. The assault came from a Muslim Brotherhood young man, who attacked another youth with "brass knuckles," the brass thing that is worn on the hand to attack people with. It is a conflict built on violence.
Anybody who advocates anything other than that book would be regarded as a traitor and executed by them. What would happen to society?
I am one of those who perform the five pillars of Islam.

American aid influences the Egyptian decision. He who does not feed himself cannot make his own decisions.
Al Taweel was one of the most prominent members of the Egyptian businessmen delegation that visited Israel in 1995 and signed an initial cooperation agreement with the Israeli Manufacturers Society. He was the standard-bearer of normalization of relations with Israel, until Benyamin Netanyahu became prime minister in Israel followed by Ihud Barak who was later succeeded by Ariel Sharon, who has contributed very much to the alteration of the strategy of Egyptian businessmen for dealing with their counterparts in Israel.
Q: Are we to understand that you throw the whole blame on the Government?
Q: How do the businessmen see the way out of the economic crisis?
A: I refuse any cooperation with Israel at present. Such cooperation is unlikely in light of the massacres and destruction of infrastructure in Palestine. Therefore, Israel must be boycotted.
Q: Does this mean that you may meet Israeli businessmen if things calm down? A: No.

On the economic plane, the pumping of petroleum should be stopped immediately, particularly by Gulf States, because oil is one of the most effective weapons. If the United States mended its ways, regained its reason and demonstrated a peaceful attitude in word and deed, relations with it as an economic partner may be restored."

During his 5-day visit, Saleh will get acquainted with work in some organizations affiliated to the Russian Ministry of Defence and will meet dignitaries from a weapon exporting company and MiG Company for military planes.
Western diplomatic sources emphasized that the selected targets are sites for Palestinian organizations inside Syria. This step has been considered between Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and US Secretary of State Colin Powell who wound up his tour in the region on April 17th.
According to such sources, the USA will not prevent Israel from militarily responding if such attacks continued from Lebanon on Israeli sites or if Palestinian elements carried out commando operations from the Lebanese territories against it.
How do you see the future?
A: Nobody, either ruler or ruled, may prevent a Muslim from being martyred or performing the obligation of jihad, but they are citing political excuses to justify helplessness.
Q: Is it true that the Arab rulers do not have any cards to pressure America and is their refrainment from action vis-à-vis the disaster religiously acceptable?
Q: In the latest Islamic conference, no identification of terrorism could be reached and no discrimination between it and jihad was demonstrated. What would you say to that?

Washington has unilaterally drawn up the main features of the final solution in the Middle East, through a combination of the Iraqi and Palestinian problems that puts the two issues in one package! This is what is revealed by an extremely important document that contains an integrated plan for insuring the protection of American interests in the region which was prepared, inter alia, by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Ryan Crocker. The new plan, whose details were obtained by Al Ahram Al Arabi from high-ranking political sources, provides for the intervention of military forces, supported by a number of allies, to put a double end to the Iraqi and Palestinian crises.
-The Arab States that are affected by the refugee problem would support any alternative project that would end the Palestinian presence on their territories, particularly as some Arab governments make no secret of their concerns that the presence of refugees in their countries is a threat to their national security. Crocker gave the example of Lebanon in this respect.
-Arab countries, including Front-line States and Gulf States, were desirous of reaching a final solution for the Palestinian crisis, so that a Palestinian state might be proclaimed, stability established in the Middle East and the risk of a probable military confrontation with the Israeli Defence Forces averted.
However, these arrangements continue to have uncertain prospects, particularly as they have not been announced officially, despite the leaks and individual statements by both leading Iraqi opposition figures and officials within the U.S. Administration. Therefore, it would not be possible to gauge the attitudes of Arab States and millions of refugees before the United States takes any serious steps for turning this scenario into reality.

Lebanese public debt which is about $28 billion exceeds 165% of its GDP, which represents big pressure on the Lebanese lira and urges Lebanon's Bank to intervene so that it might be the only seller of the dollar on the market throughout most of the previous couple of years in a bid to maintain the rate of exchange stability.
As per the new American scenario, which is scheduled to be carried by Powell in his second upcoming visit to the Middle East region within ten days, the U.S. will vow to sponsor a new international conference for peace in the Middle East region in compliance with a vision offered by Ariel Sharon in the last two weeks, which was accepted by Washington, with some Arab amendments introduced to it. According to Arab proposals, the Middle East summit is to be held in Washington late next June with the attendance of Middle East leaders, mainly including Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, after Washington undertakes to force the Israeli occupation forces to pull out of all the Palestinian-controlled areas, thus ending the military presence in the West Bank territories, and halt the Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's confinement to his compound in Ramallah.
Ahead of the Saudi prince's recent visit to Washington, Cairo, Amman, Casablanca and Agadir (where Prince Abdullah was residing during his visit to Morocco) saw several marathon contacts and summits aiming at reinforcing contacts with the U.S. and identifying Arab priorities offered by the Moroccan king and Saudi crown prince in their recent visits to Washington. An Egyptian special envoy left for Saudi Arabia to deliver a message from President Hosni Mubarak to the Saudi prince one day ahead of his travel to Washington, urging an intensive Saudi and Moroccan move to get urgent U.S. guarantees from Bush as regards the withdrawal of the Israeli troops from the Palestinian-controlled areas and the immediate cancellation of the President Yasser Arafat's confinement before the Saudi prince's return to Washington.

King Abdullah accused Israel of trying to undermine the will of the Palestinian people, isolate the Palestinian people's leadership and show the situation in the region as a "security problem," without talking about the real reason of the problem, which was the occupation.
Here we have to say, first of all, that the operations that targeted Israeli civilians were denounced by the Palestinian Authority, on the grounds that the Authority has adopted a clear-cut attitude of denouncing the killing of civilians, regardless of their nationality or the quarter that carried out this or that killing operation.
Resisting the occupation must continue in all forms and by all means, but not with suicidal or other operations against civilians.
Q: How do you see the Israeli conditions for the surrender of the besieged?
A: I think that the Western-American position can only be condemned.
Hence, while the eastern point of view sees the population of the USA as Christians and we as easterners believe that they are Christians, this is a mistake.
MUBARAK: A STRONG EGYPT THE FIRST OF PRIORITIES
President Mubarak pointed out that the ferocious campaign launched against the Palestinian people and their leadership must be stopped adding that Israel had exceeded all limits by exercising her inhuman practices that aim at intimidating the Palestinian people and repressing the resistance of occupation.

The law experts said that severance of Egyptian-Israeli relations does not necessarily mean the breakout of an all-out war in the region.
The peace treaty does not stipulate a ban on the rupture of relations, rather issuance of war threats, calls for violence and provocation or promotion of subversive activities, Abu Al- Wafa added. Consequently, severance of relations is subject to general principles that are granted international recognition, he said, stressing that severing relations can't be viewed as a hostile action against Israel.

Chairman of Medical Professions Union, Dr. Hamdi Al-Sayyed emphasized that the Union had decided to boycott American medicines and specified the alternatives from European production which are by no means inferior to their American counterparts.
He pointed out that Sharon would inevitably fall down after the table is turned against him and would reap in sorrow what he had sown in folly in the last weeks.
He added that Egypt's role in this stage would be to support the Palestinian attitudes based on international legitimacy resolutions. He described the current situation as involving a renunciation of some provisions in the partitioning resolution as even though an aggressive state was granted the right to exist, no Palestinian state could obtain such a right in addition to the constant Israeli attempts to intimidate and tame the Palestinian people and impose a status quo on them. This matter, he added, could pose a direct threat to Egypt.

Contrary to the claims of Israeli media that Israel has succeeded in eliminating the infrastructure of Palestinian resistance, Ambassador Taha Al Farnawani, Director of the Palestine Department in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, believes that the resistance will continue so long as there is an occupation with such viciousness and brutality.

DEFENCE MINISTER STRESSES IMPORTANCE OF TRAINING EXERCISES FOR FACING THREATS
Cairo has conveyed to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat an American message to the effect that the United States will "apply pressure to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to force him to adopt a binding timetable for withdrawal to the positions that existed before 28 March 2002, stopping the construction of settlements, abandoning the policy of storming and dealing with the Palestinian Authority with Arafat at its head.
The sources explained that Arafat had told the Egyptians that he would not leave the Palestinian Authority's territories at that stage, pointing out that Cairo had requested the Palestinian President to exert efforts to insure the unity of the Palestinians behind the (Palestinian) leadership and control of street and deny the Israelis and the Americans a pretext for demolishing the arrangements that were being made, particularly in view of the general acceptance of the Arab peace initiative and the American proposals regarding the Palestinian state.
PA EXPRESSES SORROW FOR CONGRESS' SUPPORT OF ISRAEL
The statement accused Israel of using the language of force, suppression and terrorism of the state against the Palestinian people.
The message also included Egyptian reservations about a new Middle East peace conference, saying that the Egyptian leaders saw that the proposed conference should be held in an international, not regional, context based on international legitimacy, the source said.
Unfortunately, what the United States cannot see and what Ariel Sharon cannot understand is that these bold and brave operations will not stop so long as Israel continues to occupy the land of others and usurp their money and property and violate their sanctities.
Prior to the last operation in Tel Aviv, Ariel Sharon announced on CNN that the attacks launched by Israel in the Palestinian territories had moral and strategic justifications that were identical to those of the American campaign against Al Qaeda Organization and international terrorism.

Two girls, whose names have not yet been disclosed, are among the detainees, Egyptian sources told Asharq Al-Awsat.
Following are excerpts from the interview. Q: But you were criticized for excluding military intervention.
A: Yes, and anyone who says otherwise will be aiming at making somebody else adopt the military option, so as to involve that somebody else in a situation where he would be subject to sanctions.
A: All those who are calling for war should know that treaties are binding to countries.
A: It is natural that I should say that. The evidence around us confirms it. The United States is the only power in the world; it is the arbiter and the determiner of movement.
Q: Do not you think that what you said may tarnish or have a negative impact on Egypt's relations with Syria and Lebanon?
Q: Should your asking the Arabs to reinforce your economy with a hundred billion dollars be taken as an indication that the Egyptian economy is still in dire straits?
A: Having reached the point where I am achieving an effective economic force does not mean that I need investment. As I said, all countries seek to attract investments. There is not better evidence than that the United States itself is calling for attracting investments and that it received 240 billion dollars last year.
"It is necessary at present for the Arabs to regain the world's respect, not love. What makes us play a bigger role in the world is the others' respect of us, not love," he said, pointing out that support, given to the Palestinians up till now, is human rather than political.
Israel has gained a lot in the past few years and those who speak about its isolation are living in illusion because the means, used in the 1960's and 1970's, are not, by necessity, the correct ones at present, he said. "We need a new discourse and method that will lead to a different situation," he added.
Third; Israel is fighting, for the first time, on the land over which there is a historic conflict after Israel had the long arm before that and Israel's land was away from the Arab capability. Now, every Israeli is threatened, something that will compel the Israelis to review the situation in its entirety.
I, and others with me, had frequently said that Ariel Sharon did not have a political view for peace.
I believe that the starting point of Sharon's view was immediately after the failure of the round of talks between former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat at Camp David under the auspices of former American president Bill Clinton.
Accordingly, a plan was drawn up that rests on three main pillars, as follows: The Palestinians must be returned to zero point, politically, economically and militarily, so that they may realize that their current high ceiling of ambitions is impossible to reach.
Any points of reference that do not serve this security are worthless and must not be heeded. Now, what has Ariel Sharon succeeded in doing, and what has he failed to achieve?
During his talks with President George Bush in the White House, Ariel Sharon tried to achieve the following three objectives:
Therefore, he presented a visualization of the final solution that was based on "selective" adoption of the existing points of reference if they could not be detoured.
The actions towards that end have already been launched: the Saudi Ministry of the Interior stands accused of transferring funds abroad to finance terrorism; Syria and Libya have been added to the axis of evil; and the screws are being tightened on Iraq with declarations that a military strike against it is imminent.
I do not think that I could put the current situation into plainer language. Before the last bombing near Tel Aviv, I was talking to brother Khalid Mash'al, Chief of Hamas Politburo, about the status of Islamic resistance after the Israeli military campaign, and he said, quote, there is occupation and resistance of occupation, and not all the forces in the whole world can change this equation, unquote.
Whether the occupation was "static" or "dynamic" in terms of its nature, the resistance would remain capable of draining the enemy's resources as it had done in the past, he explained. In Mash'al' view, the logic of occupation is not valid but was based on using force for realizing ambitions and that force is capable of crushing the resistance and denying the aspirations of the people.
I asked him whether he expected a change in the foreseeable future, and he answered, "No, and Sharon will persist in his attitude, while the Americans will promote his view after watering it down somewhat."
Brother Mash'al also said, "It is haram (against Islam) to abort steadfastness and resistance today to go back to vicious circle of negotiations. The greatest danger is to seek negotiations prematurely and enter a new maze."

Negotiations are currently underway between Egyptian and Dutch businessmen to set up the first joint business council and establish the first joint chamber of commerce, said head of the commercial department at the Dutch embassy in Cairo.
Yesterday morning, President Hosni Mubarak met in the presidency headquarters with the Indian businessmen delegation that is visiting Egypt now under chairmanship of Raul Begag, board chairman and executive manager of Begag Auto Ltd. Company.
By establishing industries in Egypt these businessmen will be allowed to enter these markets and enjoy customs privileges, thus achieving the main target of free trade agreements represented in attracting investments and exploiting our commercial relations with other sides.
The volume of the Egyptian exports to India is still small despite the fact that it increases by 10-12% annually, which is considered insufficient and unsatisfactory rates.
GAMAL MUBARAK: WE WON'T ACCEPT ANY SPECULATIONS IN EGYPT'S ROLE IN PALESTINE

ANTI-AZHAR GRAND SHEIKH SLOGANS FOLLOWING FRIDAY PRAYERS
Shukri rejected the Arab governments insistence on peace initiatives, adding that the establishment of the state of Israel had been the result of UN resolutions helped along by international gangs and mafia. The Arabs and Muslims must support the Palestinians to establish their state.

Al-Azhar deputy grand Sheikh added that according to the Holy Quran, the Prophet's tradition and the scholars unanimous opinion Virgin Mary had never been married either before or after the birth of Jesus, Christ as that in itself was a miracle. What Anis Mansour wrote is utterly rejected as it is not approved of either in our Muslim faith or in the Christian faith.
VERBAL DECISION TO CUT OFFICIAL TV MEDIA MATERIAL ON PALESTINIAN EVENTS
Faris Saad of the state-run Television Channel Three said in case of verbal orders to reduce or ban anything, then no one can speak about them as they are merely verbal instructions and lack in evidence. But, generally, such instructions are frequently issued at the Television, he said.
Live programs are different as presenters are recommended to commit themselves to the red lines especially under critical circumstances such the current ones as the Arab, particularly Egyptian, street is boiling, so balanced shows are always recommended to quieten the disgruntled people, Bakry said.
The deputy had asked to be familiarized with the minute annex of the session that contained the codification of the Sharia, but it turned out to be unavailable. The bills put forward by deputies, Salah Abou-Ismail and Hassan Al-Gamal in 1984 also have disappeared completely, which urged the parliament to mount an investigation into why they had disappeared as well as the sources that got them and how much they needed to suppress these documents.

The Muslim Brotherhood members at Egypt's parliament started a campaign against the government to push it to turn down the 2 billion U.S. dollars in annual U.S. economic and military aid to Egypt, and to clinch financing deals with Arab and Islamic finance funds instead.
The Muslim Brotherhood and Nasserite Party members launched biting broadside against the U.S. Administration as Congress announced that it would provide Israel with 200 million U.S. dollars to help it in its campaign against what it described as terrorism, along with more funds to it later on, even though resistance against the occupation is legitimate.
The sources said that the ministerial committee formed by the Cabinet last March for reconsidering election laws had not finished its work yet, while the ruling National Democratic Party's Legislative Committee continued to study the new election system to insure its conformity with the current Constitution, so as to preclude challenges of the new laws on the basis of unconstitutionality.
The mission is chaired by Dr Gamal Ma'moun, deputy dean of Mansoura University's Faculty of Medicine.
50.4% RISE IN PRICES OF EDUCATIONAL SERVICES AND ONLY 6% IN ACCOMMODATION AND FUEL
A fresh debate took place on the rewards and allowances of the members who receive money even though they do not work!
The questions appeared to be hot and shocking to the reverent assembly as a key official at the parliament affirmed that the crisis is still going on amid the continuing absence of members. As per the parliament statute and the constitution, he said, the deputy must attend sessions and should be a pacesetter especially as he gets a minimum of 3,000 pounds per month in rewards and allowances. Thus, if he does not attend sessions, he should be deprived of such sum or at least the 100 pounds in allowance for attending a single sitting, 50 pounds in allowance for attending a committee session and 100 pounds for a single extraordinary session.
He added that many members achieved a lot of gains, with some having set up companies in the names of their relatives and got big loans under insufficient guarantees. Some also got import and export permits. Many violations are being perpetrated in the name of immunity so it is not amazing that members sign for their absent colleagues, he said. Parliament budget:
Most societies concerned with women's issues as well as the National Council for Women never cease using highly resounding slogans about the freedom of woman and their suffering because of segregation in all walks of life, especially in the world of work.
Hijab does not constitute a condition in the employment contract so that it may be a reason for dismissal or being fired.
She went on to say, "How should they prevent an Egyptian female pilot among only a score in the whole world from raising Egypt's name and motto and taking pride in her Islamic uniform represented in Hijab? Where is the role of Al-Azhar!
They are many and to mention just a few let's mention names like Nivin Al- Guidni, Afaf Abdel-Razik. Does that befit an Islamic country?
They declared a state of alert confirming their absolute rejection of Egypt's joining of that document.
They called the Al- Azhar and Islamic and Christian religious men to show solidarity and declare their attitude towards the document. The document project has renewed talk about what had been discussed by the National Conference on Population such as permitting abortion for women and girls and encouraging extramarital sex relationships through giving girls access to reproduction health services, which runs counter to the values and tenets of Islam and Christianity.
The official said, "The political side is the greatest challenge for the Fund's performance. Our duty is to help the nations that have economic problems, as their expenditures exceed their proceeds. The IMF makes financial programmes that is appropriate to the situation of each country, putting in mind the social dimension, but we had to promote our performance and put priorities for each case."
"The IMF is committed to help Egypt according to Sharm Al-Sheik agreement, signed lately at the Conference of Donor Countries, but Egypt had to meet the stipulated conditions related to the exchange rate and budget deficit," Abdul-Shakour added, pointing out that the IMF had started to doubt the figures and statements which it had received from Egypt since 1995, as the IMF considered it a serious indicator if it had been proven that this information was not real.
They are speaking about the budget deficit whether it is 3.7%, 4% or 6% and if hiding these facts were intended or not," Youssef said.
15 SYNAGOGUES IN EGYPT ENJOY SECURITY!
He says, "There are about 15 Jewish synagogues in Egypt, 9 of which have been registered. The Jews' lane is one of the most important districts that have several synagogues.
The other synagogue is that of Saggad Issac in Al-Dhaher, which is known for Kareem Synagogue after the person who supervised its constructions in 1926 A.D. According to Dr. Rabi', the most famous of synagogues is Shaar Hashmaim, which in Hebrew means "the gate of the sky". It was built in Adli Street in 1902 and is the best preserved among synagogues in terms of architectural and decorative elements.
According to Mohsin Rabi', director of Jewish Antiquities in the Supreme Council for Antiquities, renovation operations have been embarked upon since the 1980's starting with Bin Ezzra synagogue which was built in 882 A.D. representing the oldest Jewish site in the world.
Arab diplomatic sources hoped that the chapter of Cairo-Damascus tension, which came to the surface following the recent Israeli incursions into the Palestinian territories, was closed in the recent meeting, which was held between President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdel-Aziz in Sharm El-Sheikh.
`	The sources said tension developed from politics to other aspects of relations, referring to economic and media problems between both countries. For example, the Egyptian government imposed dumping charges of 150 percent on Syrian yarn, freezing the export of around 13,000 tons to Egypt.
A source of the Ministry of Information told Al-Hayat that the recent number of Al- Ittijah Al-Akher was not released for criticizing an Arab leader.
Palestinian resistance against the Israeli occupation is a legitimate right, he said.
In what appears like the beginning of a largest-scale settlement campaign in the occupied Golan, Israeli authorities have started getting more than 1,000 settlement housing units built in the occupied Syrian territory.
Kafr Kana local council managed to have 2,700 donum of the village land inside 1948 Palestine restored to its control.
EGYPT, INDIA TO ESTABLISH JOINT INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL PROJECTS
The federation will organize meetings between Indian company owners and Egyptian makers on Wednesday to open communication channels between the two sides for common cooperation in the domains of technological transfer, modernization and joint investment for export to the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and European Union (EU) markets and others, he said.
There is no doubt that South Korea is one of the Asian tigers that have covered much ground on the path of economic growth, which has made it a partner of several countries that wield much weight in world economy.
Korea is also a commercial and economic partner of many countries in the world, particularly in the Middle East, for two main reasons, the first of which is the need of regional countries for a certain level of technology in different economic sectors at a cost that they can afford. This sort of technology is available in South Korea.
A: These relations have witnessed significant growth over the past three decades, particularly since the early 1990's, as manifested by bilateral agreements, including commercial and economic ones, at both government-to-government and business-organization levels.
Moreover, despite the existence of an advanced industrial and technological base in Korea that is different from those of Western countries, Korea is willing to establish joint investment ventures in Egypt, particularly export-oriented ones that target regional markets. This runs in parallel with the interest shown by the different commercial service organizations in cooperation with Egypt, particularly the South Korean Export-Import Bank.
Basis for cooperation: Q: How can Egypt benefit from South Korea as a world economic power?
I believe that the executive program of the plan for developing Korean investments in Egypt can focus on a number of industries, such as the engineering, textile, electronics, telecommunications and chemical industries, and the infrastructure. However, what is more important is benefiting from the Korean experiment in the field of attracting foreign investments.
-Technical cooperation in the field of roads -Finding out a mechanism for settling commercial disputes between Egypt and Libya -Waqfs and Islamic affairs -Tourist cooperation -Urban planning -Effectuating the agreement of owning and benefiting from real estates and agriculture lands by citizens of the two countries The two parties reviewed the studies of setting up the biggest project for agricultural production on an area of 400 thousand feddans on the borders between Egypt and Sudan.

Chairman of the Shura Council's Industry Committee Mohamed Farid Khamis emphasized that Libya actively participates in the Egyptian petrochemical complex in Suez and it was the first country to export the polypropylene gas to the plant erected there.
Al-Shamikh also pointed out that the electric linkage between Egypt and Libya has been embarked upon.

The remarks were made by the the company head Eng. Adel Al-Shahawi, who said that stopping the implementation of the deal of exporting rice to Syria caused the company heavy losses, attributing this to the dearth of export-oriented quotas and lift of subsidy on rice exports under the pretext that the rise of the dollar rate of exchange gives competitive advantage to exporters.
On June 7th American trade representative, Robert Zolik will start a visit to Egypt during which he will meet Premier Atef Ebeid, ministers of the economic group and members of American Chamber of Commerce. He will also discuss the possibility of reaching an agreement between Egypt and the USA to set up a common free trade zone.
A source said that the issue had been resolved in the aforementioned framework prior to the visit paid by Egyptian Foreign Trade Minister, Youssef Boutros Ghali to Washington last November as well as the visit paid to Cairo by the Undersecretary of American Ministry of Trade for Middle Eastern and North African Affairs in the same month, which means that the American Administration did not mind serious negotiations provided that Egypt showed more flexibility regarding several issues.
It was known that Washington focuses on economic cooperation with Egypt and stresses the possibility of forging ahead with the reform and restructuring in a bid to transcend the impact of the September 11th incidents. In Sharm Al-Sheikh's conference last February the USA announced offering $1.8 billion as loans and grants over three years. The American Administration also earmarked $1.2 billion of that sum to speedy expenditure, $45 million of which this year out of $2.1 billion obtained by Egypt from donor countries.
Exports amounted to 119.24 million U.S. dollars this year against 144.33 million U.S. dollars last year, down 17.38 million U.S. dollars.
Minister of Industry Dr. Ali Al-Saidi said India's year in Egypt would be a start for the intensified cooperation with India in the industrial activities and technology transfer as well as exploitation of chances between Egypt and India.
On his part, Dr Abdel-Mone'm So'oudi, chairman of the Federation of Industries, affirmed that the visit paid by the delegation of heads of major Indian companies to Egypt comes within the framework of discovering cooperation chances to be followed by mutual visits by officials of the two countries.
THE PRESIDENT ENDORSES AGREEMENTS GRANTING EGYPT $550 MILLION
LE1.8 BILLION REQUIRED TO COMPLETE INDUSTRIAL ZONES UTILITIES
Most industrial zones suffer from non- completion of some sanitary drainage projects particularly sewage stations.
The report pointed out that the state's role is focussed on the infrastructure projects that the private sector refrains from in addition to qualifying and improving the investment atmosphere as far as the legislative and organizational aspects are concerned. The state is interested in providing qualified and trained manpower that suit the investors' needs, it said.
Local fluidity analysis indicates that the monetary supply increased by 900 million pounds and the quasi- money by 19.8 million pounds.
The volume of deposits in banks also witnessed a remarkable increase by 23.1 billion pounds to reach 260 billion pounds by the end of the last fiscal year, the report said.
"We sent several memos three months ago to the concerned ministers to speedily provide companies with dollar needs so as to be able to import production materials but to no avail," they indicated.
Some foreign firms resorted to judicial bodies to pass rulings imposing exorbitant outage costs on Egyptian companies, they indicated.
Minister of Tourism, Dr. Mamdouh El-Beltagui stated that the decline rate in touristic influx to Egypt hit 16% only between last January and late April instant year compared to the numbers recorded in the same period last year. Decrease rate in touristic nights reported 9% for the corresponding period , estimates of International Tourism Organization have shown.
EGYPT ALLOWS FOREIGN BANKS' BRANCHES TO DEAL IN GOVERNMENTAL BONDS
Among the foreign banks' branches that are expected to deal in this market are Citibank and American Express because they are the nearest to meet CBE's conditions. Meanwhile, four other branches of foreign banks operative in Egypt should settle their positions to meet the aforementioned conditions if they desired to work in such activity.
Following the ministerial meeting held on May 21st, which was chaired by Prime Minister Dr. Atef Ebeid, an official source at the Cabinet said that the meeting discussed the means of activating and boosting the volume of works carried out by Egyptian contracting companies on the Arab markets.
Should a charge in prices unexpectedly take place, thus leading to a collapse of economic balance in a way that affects contractors' commitments, the contract value should be increased by the rate of the fluctuation or the contract may be cancelled by either party whether the suppliers or the Government.
Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) Governor Mahmoud Abul-Oyoon admitted that the geographical distribution of Egyptian banks is unsound as they are concentrated in such greater cities as Cairo and Alexandria.
The banks which will fail to increase their capital will be doomed to compulsory merger, the governor added.
Banks are small-sized and fragmented, he said, but denied their inability to lend.
The index of manufacturing companies on the Exchange rose from 817.7 points to 823 points, a rise of 5.40 points.
In return, it offered to buy the Misr America International Bank (MAIB) whose paid-up capital is 75 million pounds.
However, he said, the CBE and the bourse have not been informed of that owing to lack of serious negotiations.
The CBE governor Mahmoud Abul-Oyoon held a meeting last week with the bank's board of directors in which he called for devising an urgent plan for restructuring the bank and removing its obstacles.
OUR RESOURCES CAN NOT MEET PUBLIC SPENDING: MINISTER OF FINANCE
The capital resources, including self-initiated resources, grants as well as the proceeds of privatization programme are estimated at 13.8 billion pounds, he pointed out. The 2002-2003 state public budget has been unfavourably affected by the September 11th events in the United States, and changes in the exchange rate, said Hassnein. Egypt's foreign debt burdens and purchases of basic commodities such as wheat and oil have consequently increased, he said.
Minster of Finance Medhat Hassanin announced that the new budget of the FY 2002/2003 totaled 141.6 billion pounds against 126.8 billion this year (2001/2002).
5.2 BILLION POUNDS SERVICE OF FOREIGN DEBT IN EGYPT'S BUDGET
As for the sales taxes, the expected proceeds are estimated at 20.6 billion pounds against 19.8 billion pounds, up 800 million pounds.
MOSCOW TO WASHINGTON: OUR WEAPONS TO IRAN IN RETURN FOR YOUR WEAPONS TO SAUDI ARABIA
"If this issue is raised during the summit, what I just mentioned will be among Moscow's explanations, to which Russia will add its concern over American conventional arms exports to Saudi Arabia."
The summit that comprised the two presidents Bashar Al-Assad and Hosni Mubarak as well as the Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah had focussed on those countries open denunciation of all forms of violence in the Middle East and pinpointing the genuine "desire" for peace with Israel. It also ignored the issue of the conference on which Israel seeks to impose conditions regarding participants and the representatives of the Palestinians.
He added, "Arab denunciation of martyrdom operations was a basic demand imposed by Washington."
THE NEW SAUDI ROLE IN THE FACE OF THE ISRAELI ERA
That role, furthermore, was bound for a stage which is farther than mere insinuations or proposals, a stage of action and practice. This was actually what happened when Prince Abdullah paid a visit to the USA last month and had lengthy talks with the American President George W. Bush, a visit that inaugurated a practical phase of the new Saudi role.
The strategy, according to the newspaper emanates from the Arab peace initiative and the proposals made by former American President Bill Clinton in the second Camp David summit at the end of his term of office.
In this context, Prince Saud Al-Faysal said, "In this we need not reinvent the wheel," in an indication to previous accords.
It is an ancient relationship based on bilateral strategic interests.
On the other hand, while entering as a direct party in the quest for peace process under the present conditions, Saudi Arabia is facing a big challenge.
What form of coordination will occur between the two Arab countries in this stage?
Furthermore, the region is undergoing what may be called the Israeli era when Israel with international backing can almost do whatever it wants!
There are positive indicators, but not yet amounting to any clear cut or binding political programme especially as there is division of opinion regarding the settlement issue in the American administration, in addition to the Congress by-elections expected to be held at the end of this summer.
The source declined to link the Saudi measures to the 11 September events in the United States, noting that Saudi Arabia was strict about combatting money laundering ahead of the events.
A Kuwaiti governmental source, on anonymity condition, said "I know nothing about the message." but, he told Asharq Al-Awsat that the message includes inaccurate and exaggerated information. The Islamists in Kuwait inside or outside the National Assembly (parliament) "abide by security and social regulations and behave according to their constitutional rights."
The family knows and speaks highly of this position."
All the members regarded that the interpellation, which will be presented to Minister of Finance Youssef al-Ibrahim, who represents the liberal trend in Kuwait in the near future is "a constitutional right."
Reuters reported that Arab indignation about America's backing of Israel and its bias towards the Israeli policies stands behind the boycott campaign adopted in Arab countries against the American products.
The Shiite Islamic trend has fielded candidates in the second session where they competed with Al-Islah (Reform) Society, a Sunnite Islamic trend that was ranked second but the numerical differential between them and the Islamic National Reconciliation Society in the number of winners was great.
The only logical explanation given to this phenomenon, according to observers is that the Bahraini woman who participated in balloting did meet the wish of the master of the house thus using the card given to her at home before she got on the bus prepared for transporting women to ballot stations by some religious societies that took part in the elections.
The symbols of democratic and liberal forces consider their failure a result of lack of coordination between them compared with the Islamic societies' success in mobilizing their forces to demonstrate their power in the street.
A statement issued by the United States Under-Secretary of Commerce said that the U.S. Government strongly insisted and reaffirmed its resolve to firmly implement its policy that opposed tightness of commercial restrictions or boycott of Israeli commodities.
Over 57 percent said basic services, mainly including health, education, electricity and water, have greatly deteriorated.
The results of this evaluative poll tended to say "checkmate" to the government for including many negative points in the incumbent government.
KHARTOUM PROVIDES ADDIS ABABA WITH OIL AND OPENS AN OUTLET FOR IT ON THE RED SEA
The two countries also agreed on opening the land road between them and making Ethiopia get access to Port Sudan Harbour on the Red Sea. They also reached an agreement over the disputable areas and re-demarcation of joint borders.
JORDAN ADVISES BAGHDAD TO OFFER "CAPITULATIONS" TO PROMOTE RELATIONS WITH SAUDI ARABIA
Meantime, Iraqi official contact with Jordan was depleted as the Jordanian dignitaries and ministers had not visited Baghdad for several weeks even though the joint supreme ministerial committee is supposed to be held in Amman but failed to obtain a definite date for that meeting. Jordanian officials do not see such a low ebb in contact as a retreat on the bilateral coordination level, according to Jordanian Premier Abou Raghib who declined to talk about a lukewarmness in the relations between his country and Baghdad.
ALGERIA: 10,000 CANDIDATES & 129 FREE LISTS CONTESTING FOR 389 SEATS IN PARLIAMENT
The deputies of Qabaliya Oroush and a number of oppositionist parties and figures have rejected conducting the elections, urging citizens to boycott it and declare "an electoral boycott" under the pretext that these elections are "futile and won't lead to a solution" to the country's problems.
There are 10,000 candidates, representing 23 parties, and 129 free lists contesting for the 389 seats of the National People's Assembly (first chamber).
Sheikh Abdullah Gaballah will stay a source of controversy on the Algerian political scene.
A: In case of free and fair elections, as we hear they might be, I dare say we'd explode a surprise and win with a majority.
To explain, I'd like to say that many prominent leaderships have joined our party to contest the elections under its platform, which clearly reflects the confidence of the masses in us.
Q: You often criticize the government and warn against rigging the elections, which contradicts your expectations of your party's results which are based on extreme optimism or am I erring on the inaccurate?
The regime here rewards those involved in the rigging and punishes those who stand against or refrain from participation in it.
The matter is based on two things: first voting, second strict and firm control of the sorting out process, as soon as the boxes are closed in order to be able to confront the officialdom controlled by a trend that advocates and promotes westernization and believes in the extermination of the other opinion.
As for his statement about forestalling the Islamic trend, I'd like to put things in a nutshell. If you could forestall us by holding free fair elections, I would be delighted to congratulate you on your win, but I'm dead sure that such fair elections would bring about his utter defeat!
Unless we had taken that opportunity, we would have met the same lot of those failed to get a license.
How do you see such a view?
Its goal is to create new generations that move in its orbit, fascinated by it as a model.
Q: May I just pause a minute at your argument that the Algerian people had avenged themselves on the secularist trend and westernization by voting for FIS?
Q: Do you think that what Osama Bin Laden did in Afghanistan had done harm to the Islamic nation?
Resorting to force and changing by force, therefore, is considered wrong.
AL-ADL WAL EHSAN DENIES PARTICIPATION IN MOROCCAN ELECTIONS
The Moroccan Al-Ahadath Al-Maghribiya newspaper said that dissidents from Al-Adl Wal Ehsan Group, the almost outlawed movement and the most strongest fundamental group in Morocco, together with other dissidents from Al-Tawheed Wal Eslah (Monotheism and Reform) Movement would discuss the establishment of a political party. The two groups are intensively contacting Al-Adl Wal Ehsan to assure it that they will not adopt any opposing stance against the Group, the paper said.
Meanwhile, a group from Al-Tawheed Wal Eslah movement has worked since mid- 1990s within the framework of the "constitutional popular movement" before it converted into the Justice and Development Party, which holds 14 seats in the parliament.
For them, the bill was the possible settlement that removed the barriers before any of them voting against such a law, particularly as it was obvious that it would undoubtedly be ratified in its original formulation in case of being referred to the parliament.
The law stipulates three percent as a minimum number of votes as per which a seat in any constituency could be won. This very percentage could exclude the minor parties with a view to not "Balkanizing" the political map and dissipating forces in the forthcoming parliament. It also constitutes reconciliation between those who completely opposed adoption of this point (minor parties) and those who were calling for higher percentage reaching a five percent (major parties). Most of the remaining seven items of the bill were general.
Letting these points unframed, not to mention the postponement of explaining their details, were aimed, according to experts, at ensuring an unanimous issuance of the law, as later negotiations could determine their detailed features, which would not raise much more difference in general due to their technical outline except for such aspects related to the partitioning of constituencies and laying down electoral registers.
It will also strive for providing the appropriate circumstances to exemplify the new concept of authority that was called for by King Mohamed VI in his speech in Casablanca a few weeks after he took over the reins, he said. The government is committed to the strict and sound application of the law, serving legitimacy, squaring up to all forms of corruption in the forthcoming elections, respecting the will of voters and creating political elite qualified to consolidate the credibility of a political action.
The volume of direct foreign investments flowing into Egypt has increased sevenfold during the period 1980-2000 increasing from 2.3 billion dollars to 19 billion dollars.
While Egypt was classified in 1985 in the seventh rank among the developing countries, which are the most attracting of direct foreign investments by 4.7% of the developing countries, it was not included among some more than 10 countries that benefited from the direct foreign investments, the study said.
In Asia, direct foreign investments hit a record amounting to 143 billion dollars. In east and central Europe, direct foreign investments unprecedentedly hit 27 billion dollars.
The plan, Osman said, aims at striking a balance between different provinces, governorates and urban and rural areas.
The initial results of the study show that Egypt achieved a 5.6% growth rate during the 1996-2000 period despite the fact that the conditions undergone the world and by which Egypt had been affected led to slow growth rate over the following two years, the minister said. However, indicators show that the growth rate would went up to 6.5 annually on average during the coming five-year plan of 2002/2007, he added. The study indicators also pointed to the decline of poverty percentage among the population from 19.4% to 16.7% during the period between 1995/1996 and 1999/2000 through using a minimum poverty line reckoned on the basis of the needs included in the sample survey and the maximum poverty line used for reckoning the same sample, which is measured according to the availability of healthy housing, education, health care. The rate went down from 51.4% to 42.6%.
He also pointed out that although the current year's budget had targeted collection of LE5 billion from proceeds of sale of public companies, only LE0.5 billion had been actually collected.
GHALI: ECONOMIC ZONES ARE INDEPENDENT FROM EGYPT
El-Shazli said that the special economic zones are part of Egyptian soil and under its sovereignty, stressing that every activity in Egypt is subject to Egyptian security and laws.
All of the affiliated companies, 20 in number, gained profits during the FY 2000/2001. In response to a question about the plan devised by the Holding Company for the year 2002/2003 the minister said, "The plan aims at making the companies achieve works at a value of 7.5 billion pounds, an increase of 15% against last year. It also aims at achieving a distributable surplus of 218 million pounds that can be distributed and total expenses of raw materials and fuel of 3 billion pounds at a rate of 82.6% against 2.9 billion pounds last year.
The first of such measures is represented in making the low-income categories obtain housing units and subsidizing the interest rate of such units (70-90 metres) which were set up by the housing companies whose financial positions were stable and are not indebted to banks , the source added.
At present, the Egyptians live a state of imbalance due to life pressures, foremost of which is how to find appropriate accommodation for those who want to marry, something that made youths suffer from serious psychological and social problems, as they need many times as much as their governmental salaries to lead a moderate life.
Experts see the scene illogical enough, saying that the low-cost housing should not be let without active government's cover on the grounds that subsidizing the interest of such kind of housing is a strategic demand in order to get rid of social problems such as the Orfi (clandestine, unregistered) marriage as well as the suspension of marriages without consummation due to the difficulty of getting an apartment.
Market indices point out that there is high demand for housing units by the low-income categories. The supply of such units are still limited while the number of the closed units hit more than 3.5 millions, most of which are posh and moderate-cost ones.
IN RESPONSE TO PRESIDENT MUBARAK'S DIRECTIVES: INDUSTRY MODERNIZATION PLAN AMENDED
He pointed out that a research is being considered to set up a fund for financing modernization operations in parallel to the Industry Modernization Programme. The programme would extend soft loans to finance modernization executive processes.
Operation problems of Maghara's mine affiliated to Sinai Coal Company have preoccupied a lot of MPs and even dominated the Manpower Committee with a view to defending the rights of the company workers; a thing that motivated MP Al-Kashif Mohamed Al-Kashif and MP Huda Zurkana to put in interpellations with the Assembly (PA) together with accompanying CAA report calling for a halt to the operation of the mine to preserve public funds. The PA's Committee on Industry presided over by Dr.AAmin Mubarak supported this request and Minister of Industry, Dr. Ali Al-Sai'di, decided to stop work in the mine to put an end to losses drain and preserve public funds. Once the numerous risks of closing the mine appeared represented in gas explosions and environmental harms, the committee demanded that an investor be sought to rescue the project.
The announcement of the new company's establishment and the completion of its cadres came at a time when negotiations under the auspices of the Egyptian government was about to draw to a close between the Libyan side and the National Bank of Egypt (NBE). The negotiations revolved around the NBE's selling of its quota in MEDOR or the bulk of it to the Libyan side. The NBE's quota in MEDOR amounted to 39% of which 20% were the original quota of the bank while the other 19% were the Israelis's quota which the bank had bought a few months before.

There are some problems being solved by the Egyptian side in addition to American obstacles being solved by the American side as a prelude to mulling over the establishment of the free trade zone between the two countries.
The Egyptian and American sides didn't exert sufficient efforts to achieve progress for activating this agreement, Welch indicated, asserting that he would exert some efforts in that field during the coming period.
In his speech to the conference, Binnet called for setting definite targets for the monetary policy, claiming that the Egyptian financial system failed to develop in spite of reforms made.
Dr Mustafa Al-Sa'eed, economy professor with Cairo University's Faculty of Economy and Political Sciences, described Binnet's demands as a simplification of matters as the real world is more complicated.

60 YEARS OLD: NEW READING OF EGYPTIAN-RUSSIAN ECONOMIC & TRADE RELATIONS
Moreover, four visits have been paid to Moscow, thus making the private sector bear the responsibility in failing to raise these relations to the aspired after level that achieves the interest of the two sides. In the meantime, many countries, including Israel, managed to invade Russian markets either by its commodities or investments.

IRANIAN "REVOLUTIONARY GUARD" CALLS FOR MAKING READY FOR CONFRONTATION WITH AMERICA
Addressing a gathering of "the Revolutionary Guard" and Volunteers elements in Gabhar area in the border governorate of Sistan Va Baluchestan, south-western Iran. Safwi criticized the Iranian reformists' stands, saying "some see that the American threats are not serious, thinking that a dialogue could be conducted with the United States and negotiations launched with it."
Palestinian Presidential Secretary General, Al-Tayyeb Abdel-Rahim accused Hamas leaders abroad of being just a hired tool seeking to destroy the national project.
Well-informed sources said that Cairo was exerting efforts so that Dahlan-Rajoub meeting could be positive and both of them could be convinced of lowering their differences especially in light of reports about Dahlan's taking over the Palestinian security agencies after they have been united, something that means that Rajoub would be in a position subordinate to Dahlan's. "The issue of uniting the security agencies is still categorically rejected by Rajoub who visited Cairo a few days ago and met with Egyptian political and security officials who assured him that the request could be regarded as an international Arab-supported one," the sources added.
The 1991 elections resulted in (Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) winning the majority of parliamentary seats in the first session before the suspension of the second session and the cancellation of the results.
The Minister undervalued the importance of the calls for boycotting the elections in the two provinces of Tizi Ozou and Begaya in Kabaliya Zone adding that the percentage of the first did not exceed 4% compared with the national turnout and did not exceed 3% in the province of Begaya.
He emphasized that the authorities had turned that request down under the pretext that they wanted to enable the citizens to express their views and choose their representatives.
He, however, added that the blasts and assassinations witnessed by several provinces recently came within the framework of a plan to undermine the elections.
However, two years ago, America shifted to those desert countries whose production excelled that of Venezuela, Mexico and Iran.
Even though Nigeria was the African giant of paramount importance in exporting oil to America, Angola has come ninth among most important oil exporters to America.
Some observers hope those companies will contribute to developing the positions of African countries which are considered among the poorest regions of the world. Human rights groups, nevertheless, throw doubt on that argument, because most available companies do not create job opportunities for the indigenous population and oil revenues usually go into the pockets of profiteering categories.
The American orientation towards Africa seems to be related to the calls launched by various lobbies on behalf of the industrial groups that urged finding alternatives to the Arab oil.
PRESIDENT TO ISLAMIC CONFERENCE: DIFFERENCE IS CLEAR BETWEEN HIM WHO RESISTS OCCUPATION AND HIM WHO INTIMIDATES PEOPLE
Those facts are mainly the following: Firstly: all religions including Islam are essentially meant to be platforms for love, peace and goodness and therefore cannot be a source of evil for any people in the world. Nor can it be imagined that any violent or terrorist acts can be motivated by religion.
Fourthly: Islam emphasizes the call to dialogue and rejects the call to conflict between cultures as cultures actually interact rather than conflict
He added, "The mistakes of an individual or a group of individuals should not be blamed on religion itself, the truth of which should be explained by its specialized scholars and jurists. There should be a difference between a true Muslim and a Muslim who is a Muslim by name only while his acts remain a long a way from the true concept of the faith."
Its stand for the continuation of the resistance and martyrdom operations had not changed nor does it support those who offer capitulations in the hope of obtaining privileges that are illusory.

The ruling was based on the fact that, "wearing Hijab cannot be a reason for the worker losing her job." "This is considered revocation of the Airline dismissal decision under the pretext that Hijab does not go with the official uniform which female workers should wear."
Salem regarded the ruling as a victory for Sharia principles, women's right and the working woman. She told Al-Hayat that she would carry on with the judicial procedures and would not stop unless she got a final ruling entitling her to go back to work. "I'll try to find legal means to achieve that end," Salem said.

Egyptian public resources, including taxes, customs, sales taxes, duties, profit surpluses and others are by no means matching our requirements of public expending, said Minister of Finance Medhat Hassanein. The annual growth of our resources is relatively increasing in a way that does not match the annual growth of public expending.
The new budget is designed to ease the effects of internal circumstances on citizens, protect low-income people, rope Arab businessmen and investors in to invest in Egypt, increase the private sector's involvement in the gross investment up to 60 percent in lieu of 20 percent 20 years before, create more job openings, pay heed to scientific research, facilitate service procedures and control increase in population, he added.

The economic growth rates were not only low, but they were on the wane year after year as the implemented investment rate retreated from 21% in 1997/1998 to 16.9% in 2001/2002, he said.
The rise is due to the adoption of several laws which provide for increasing insurance advantages, together with laws on special incentives to increase pensions, the report indicated.

An official source with the Ministry of Foreign Trade said that the bureau was continuing communication to discuss the position of dumping duties imposed by South Africa.
The minister mentioned that the investments necessary for establishing Al-Nubariya power station hit about 430 million dollars.

It criticized allocating no sums for the two new projects, emphasizing that such a tendency threatens to stop work in the two projects.
Finance Ministry official sources said that the only solution to that problem was that the Planning Ministry would reinclude the investments in its plan for completing the two projects and financing the two holding companies in Toshka and Sinai Development Authority.

3 GOALS FOR THE BILL ON PRIVATE ECONOMIC ZONES
PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY: ECONOMIC ZONES LAW SUSPICIOUS
MP Ragab Hilal Hemeida said, "What had been hidden was uncovered after the Premier had defined the sites on which the special zones would be set up."
For his part, Dr. Sorour called on deputies who owned lands in the special zones to identify themselves.
In his reply to the deputies' accusations, Premier Dr. Atef Ebeid pledged to refer to public prosecution any offences regarding the land ownership contracts granted to some investors. He added that the National Democratic Party government would not accept any accusations of alienating the country's lands.
The projects, he said, come after 95% of Egypt's total area had been left idle over 7 thousand years without any exploitation.
In cooperation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) an integrated project for customs reform is being prepared, said Prime Minister Atef Ebeid.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSONS DENIED ACCESS TO INVESTMENT IN SINAI
Government officials justified the decision as being a sovereign one that includes all projects, companies and establishments in the two governorates according to national security requirements.
The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) said on Tuesday that its net foreign monetary reserves lost 163 million U.S. dollars over one month, hitting 13.644 million U.S. dollars last February against 13.807 billion U.S. dollars late in January 2002.
The banking system's net foreign assets continued their decline by 435 million pounds, hitting 20.1 billion pounds against 20.5 billion pounds.
In the fiscal year 2000/2001, the balance of trade achieved an improvement of about 13.7% to hit 8979 million dollars as both the petroleum and non-petroleum exports have increased. Non-petroleum exports hit some 2667 million dollars, up 7%.
Export proceeds covered import payments by 43.1% against 35.8% in the previous fiscal year, the report said, pointing out a remarkable retreat in the trade balance deficit and a stability in the surplus of the balance of services as well as shrinkage of the deficit of the current balance of payments for the year 2000/2001 to stand at only 33 million dollars against 1.2 billion dollars in the last fiscal year despite the retreat in the surplus of the balance of remittances by 0.9%.
NORTH SINAI'S SHARE OF INVESTMENTS ALLOCATIONS UP TO 2017 IS LE 64 BILLION
"The budget for the first year of the new five- year plan, covering the period from 2002 to 2007, is being drafted at present," he explained. Maj. General Abdel Hamid indicated that work at Sheikh Jabir Canal Project was underway, including the construction and lining of bridges and the laying of general irrigation networks in five sectors within the area between Km 45.5 and Km 86.5.
He also mentioned the inauguration of Mubarak Peace Flyover, which cost LE 670 million, last October, indicating that the project for connecting Sinai to the unified power grid was going on, with 220-kilovolt cables laid between Al Kantara and Al Arish and 500-kilovolt cables extended between Al Shatt and Ras Al Naqab. "Surplus electricity is exported by North Sinai to other Egyptian governorates," he said.
The project of developing the foreign trade sector, which has already started, is aimed at improving performance and upgrading the apparatuses of the Foreign Trade Ministry. This project provides for improving the capabilities and skills of workers to match the international variables of the policies of foreign trade and reflect the mechanisms of the liberalization of trade within the framework of the international organization. Thus, Egypt can play an effective role in applying international agreements in a way that guarantees its rights and makes it fulfil its commitments. This also helps Egypt take part in the coming negotiations in a way that maintains Egyptian interests.
THREE CONDITIONS OF SOCIETE GENERALE TO FINANCE EXPORTS
Financing exports also provides foreign currency resources to the banking market, he added.
The ordinary general assembly of the bank will discuss the results of the bank's activities in 2001, which indicated the continuation of profit shortage during that year due to allocations and expenditures consuming the activity proceeds in addition to the avoidance of allocations so as to face up to bad debts.
This is the third time in a row the bank increases its capital during 3 years to reach the limit laid down by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) that is the capital should not be less than 100 million pounds.
A recent study compiled by the Investment Policies and Securities Sector with the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Trade uncovered that the new capital market draft law will contribute to solving most cement companies shareholders' problems that have to do with shareholders' rights, especially those of the minority, declaration and transparency.
In spite of the Capital Market General Authority intervention and success in raising the per-share price to LE30, the minority's objection to the price persists as they see that it is worth more.
The study also indicated that most companies that announced their 2001 budgets achieved a rise in net profits compared to 2002, except for one loss-making company.
The project will be set up on an area of 720,000 square metres at Damietta Harbour with American and German contributions of about 25%, said Al-Ghamrawi.
He also approved a request submitted by the Egyptian Spanish Gas Company (Figas), which is operated under the free zones system in Damietta, to have its stocks circulated in the Stock Exchange provided that the company takes the entire procedures that should be taken into consideration when circulating shares.
The report uncovered that the value of medicine consumption in Egypt hit 5.2 billion pounds last year of which 4.5 billion pounds were local production and 700 million pounds for imports.
Figures never tell lies or try to beautify an ugly truth.
This shows a decline in consumption compared with that in the 1980's when food represented 50% of the family income in cities and 60% in the countryside as the new and other family burdens had come at the expense of food.
The report uncovered that total expenditure on cafes and hotels amounts to LE2.8 billion, out of which LE1.2 billion is spent on tea alone.
Egypt's coffee imports amounted to the value of about LE125 million.
Trade Research and Studies Centre Director Dr. Mohamed Youssef says that such a rise in the volume of expenditure on the mobile phone is attributed to several factors such as the heavy traffic that make it necessary for businessmen to send messages concerning their appointments.
LE12 billion is devoured by private lessons that have spread undeterred like cancer in the Egyptian society.
Following are excerpts from an article by Mohammad Abdel Hakam Diab, an Egyptian writer residing in London.
It would have been much better if the Prime Minister had done something to alleviate the effects of this suffocating crisis and boost the production and exportation potentials of the country to the desired levels, not con the people with promises that the donors had made in Sharm Al Sheikh months ago but have not kept. He should have provided alternative solutions to deal with the current conditions, in which Arab and European countries cannot absorb any more labour. Since the responsibilities of the Egyptian Government have become similar to those of "seasonal labour contractor," the skill level of Egyptian workers has been going down and down, making them unable to continue to compete with their Korean, Indian, Sri Lankan and Pakistani counterparts, to name just a few, which has made a bad unemployment problem even worse.
Dr. Atef Ebeid is just a civil servant who occupies the post of prime minister at the peak of the country's executive power. He cannot assimilate or understand what is going on, otherwise he would have discovered that the danger potential had considerably increased and could not have been confronted by simply abiding by an American agenda. Unless a change takes place to produce a shift in the course of current developments, the USA and the Zionist state are likely to succeed in creating a leadership, political and security vacuum in the Palestinian self-rule territories to produce anarchy, thus giving the chance to Arab and Jewish elements to trigger a civil war that would erode away the internal front and undermine the gains made by the uprising at the levels of deterrence, steadfastness and high morale. They would have, thus, killed two birds with one stone. In addition to weakening the internal Palestinian front, frustration would return to the Arab street thus revitalizing the official Arab stance, and enabling it to exercise more repression against the unarmed citizens with a view to aborting the potential of the Palestinian uprising turning into an Arab one.
The question now is: Will Arab rulers remain idle until this dream is realized?
MARTYRDOM OPERATIONS HARM NATIONAL INTEREST: RAJOUB
"It is wrong to talk about and put forward the topic in this way for this means that we are under the U.S.-Israeli tutelage, a thing which is untrue."
Neither threat nor ridicule alarms me.
In my estimation, although I understand the frustration of Palestinian citizens and movements, such operations harm our issue for our national unity and harmony with the regional and international dimension is one of the most important elements of force to face this occupation.
Chief of the Palestinian Preventive Security in the West Bank Gebril Rajoub dismissed as untrue reports that he chose Egypt as an optional exile as a result of recent broadside pressed against him following the recent Israeli incursions into the Palestinian- controlled territories.
Rajoub cushioned the divisions within the Palestinian agencies, especially his dispute with Chief of Palestinian Preventive Security in Gaza Strip Mohamed Dahlan.
The agency made this announcement in its press release on the survey it had made on the impact of Israeli actions on the economic situation of Palestinian families just before the storming of Palestinian cities.
The results of the survey indicate that 96.8% of families in Palestinian territories agreed to clearing the Palestinian market of Israeli goods that could be replaced with products from other origins.
As to the confidence of interviewed families in local products, the results indicate that 93.4% of the interviewed families trusted local products, while 77.1% trusted Arab, non-local products, 55.9% trusted foreign, non- Arab products and 24.1% trusted Israeli products.
The sources added that his meeting in Cairo two days ago with director of Egyptian Intelligence Omar Solayman focused on ways and means of benefiting by Egyptian know how for training Palestinian security in running intelligence operations.
They pointed out communications between Cairo, Riyadh and Ramallah to convene the Palestinian National Council in Cairo (its old seat).
In a statement to Al-Hayat he said, "There is no contact between us and the Saudi Arabians or Egyptians. As a Hamas leader, I say that the reports about contact to hold such a conference are completely divorced from reality."
Halting such operations means putting an end to resistance and acquiescing to occupation.
Stressing that Hamas moves in public rather than "behind the scenes," Rantisi pointed out that the anti-resistance action had not stopped behind the scenes since 1948 and that all the schemes in that regard would, as usual, be foiled.
He added that all the forces that signed such a document supported the continuation of resistance.
Responding to a question about whether Hamas would continue its martyrdom operations against Israeli civilians in the Palestinian territories that were occupied in 1948, Sheikh Yassin said, "Is there a civil community in Israel?
The resistance will not be defeated: In reply to a question about whether the Israeli storming of the West Bank had negatively impacted on the effectiveness and capabilities of the Palestine resistance, Sheikh Yassin said that the claims of Israeli generals to that effect were the products of the generals' imagination and wishful thinking.
Commenting on Hamas' stand on the changes that the Palestinian Authority intended to make in its organization and services, Sheikh Yassin said, "The Palestinian people has been calling for change and for combating corruption for several years, but nobody listened to them when the situation was calm. What concerns us now is that the calls for reform are coming from Israel and the United States to throw the blame on the Palestinian people for Israel's destruction of Palestinian cities, towns and villages and claim that it was the bad shape of Palestinian management that brought the aggression, destruction, murder and homelessness on the Palestinians."
Sheikh Yassin commented on the trial of Ahmad Sa'adat, Secretary General of the Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine, for the assassination of Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Zeevi by expressing regret and denouncing the trial of Sa'adat and his colleagues. He pointed out that by arresting and prosecuting Sa'adat and his colleagues, the Palestinian Authority had committed not one crime but several, as it had admitted that resistance and self-defence were rejected and that those who defended themselves were criminals that should be prosecuted. "Besides," he added, "putting these people in jail under American-British supervision means that they are on the terrorist list."
ALGERIAN COALITION GOVERNMENT PARTIES HEAD FOR HOT ELECTORAL BATTLE Signs have begun to emerge of a fierce battle between the two partners of the Algerian government coalition, the Democratic National Grouping and the National Liberation Front, during the legislative elections slated for the thirtieth of this month.
Meantime, the residents of tribal areas have intensified their protests, making strong calls for boycotting the elections. At Al Kasr in Begaya Province, demonstrators burned more than 100 poll boxes, while a number of boxes was also destroyed in Amizor, another town of the province. Knowledgeable sources said that 43 out of 52 municipalities in the province did not have poll boxes, not to mention that voter lists had been torched in 35 municipalities. It was noted in this context that about 90% of the citizens whose voting cards had expired have not come forward to claim new ones. The same sources also said that a large number of the government officials who were supposed to supervise poll stations had returned the summons sent them by the Government, out of their fear of the reactions of their compatriots who had decided to boycott the elections.
Zarhuni affirmed that the pressure of the Islamic paramilitary groups would not affect or pose any difficulty for the smooth running of the legislative elections slated for 30 May, pointing out that the Government had adopted exceptional procedures that had made it possible to foil a number of attacks in the central part of the country.
As to the tensioned situation in the tribal areas, the Minister of Interior indicated that the voters in those areas did not represent more than 5% of the total electorate, which meant that the turnout would not be affected much.
The plan, which will extend into 2005, earmarked large investments to the tune of $35 billion, to which Libya contributes 60- 70%, while the remainder was left to the private sector and foreign investments, according to Libyan official sources.
NATO OFFICIAL: MANOEUVRES IN ALGERIA MAKING READY FOR EMERGENCIES IN THE MEDITERRANEAN
The NATO force, which has anchored in Algiers Port, consists of six ships including frigates and destroyers coming from Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain, Greece and Turkey.
The arrival of NATO naval forces at Algeria comes within a plan drawn up by the NATO in 1994 to which Algeria joined in February 2000 to boost such dialogue and protect the region, he added.
Algeria, which has been suffering from a wave of violence since early 1990s, looks forward to establishing cooperation in the field of fighting terrorism and modernising its armed forces, as most of its weapons are former Soviet Union-made.
This announcement was made by Russian Defence Minister Sergey Ivanov following his talks with the Algerian Chief of General Staff, General Mohammad Al Amari, who is visiting Moscow at present.
ALGERIA DENIES COOPERATION WITH ISRAEL IN THE FIELD OF MEDICINE MANUFACTURING
INDIA INVADES EGYPTIAN SOFTWARE INDUSTRY
The aforementioned factors spurred the Egyptian companies, especially the big ones, to mostly depend on Indian labour with a view to decreasing production cost, enhancing the competitivness edge and getting access to Arab markets, he said.
Thirty years of technological retreat undergone by the Egyptian industry brought it back to early twenties of the last century.
When the public sector was put up for sale, all of us found the complete deterioration of the technological positions to the extent that there was a number of huge industrial sectors such as textile and weaving sector that has not been developed since 1956, thus bringing it to a collapse in the face of the foreign competition in this sector, said Dr. Gazzarin.
The State found itself in dire need of private sector support that is currently dominating the industrial activity as well as the help of the remnant of public sector to technologically modernize industry and update productive technology through the industry modernization programme financed by the EU at a value of 250 million euros. It is a step towards restoring the industrial leap even if it falls short, the centres for training the Egyptian personnel should be revived so that they could gain more advanced technical skills and redress the legislative and customs deformations that have been inflicted on the domestic industry for long. Some foreign full-manufactured commodities get access to Egypt with customs duties not exceeding 10 percent while the customs duties imposed on raw materials exceed 40 percent of their value.
The answer is that the Egyptian industry has been suffering from deterioration since late 1960s to early 1990s, i.e. about thirty years. How could we, then, correct the mistakes of this long period in only ten years?" Fawzi wondered.
It is unreasonable to pay tax on a machine that will produce commodity units on which another tax will also be collected, he indicated.
This makes investors stop the implementation of their projects or invest their funds abroad. In case an industrialist tried to obtain a loan to finance the importation of production technology, his efforts will be of no avail, as banks do not admit to such kind of lending. If they admitted, in rare cases, they lend the investor a meagre loan that is not sufficient for developing a limited number of machines.
TOSHKA PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION RATE WANING
Egyptian cotton has achieved a marked success at the foreign markets as some 241,000 bales of cotton have been exported since early this season.
The surplus of uncontracted quantities of diverse Egyptian categories hit 178364 tons. There are also still around 30,000 uncontracted tons of very long-staple cotton, mostly Giza 70, and roughly 52,000 tons of long-staple cotton such as Giza 89 and Giza 86.
The visas will be granted within few hours, the source indicated adding that Egyptian embassies in Morocco and Tunisia will start granting visas to the two countries' nationals directly without recourse to the viewpoint of concerned bodies in Cairo, along with allowing the two countries' nationals to bring any number of maids with them.
The remarks were made by Cairo International Airport Security Director Maj. Gen. Mohamed Salama. The nationals of these countries will be granted 6-month entry visas at the airport without having to obtain prior visas from Egyptian embassies there, he said.
THE FIGURES SPEAK: STATE LANDS IN THE HANDS OF BUSINESSMEN
Talaat Mostafa got 1550 feddans of land to build Rehab City in the new communities beside getting 315 feddans in Sheikh Zayed City and 221 feddans in Shorouq City.
Farid Khamis got 3.5 million square metres in the Red Sea region to build a tourist project at investment costs of one billion pounds while Wagih Hanna got 1.5 million square metres to build the Abu Soma Centre project in the Red Sea at costs of one billion pounds and Mohamed Abul-Enein got 13 million square metres in the Gulf of Suez.
Abul-Enein says that the situation is different in the area of industrial development because that field requires infrastructure of a special kind in electricity, water, and gas. The state cannot complete the building of such infrastructure because of the high costs involved.
About the fate of the lands distributed Abul-Enein says that three groups of businessmen have returned the land in full to the government while the others gave up half their lands. About 53 plants were built in the Gulf of Suez that were linked to the names of businessmen like Sawiris, Mohmamed Farid Khamis, or Abul-Enein. He pointed out that he built an industrial complex for the production of ceramics in Suez while Farid built at a petrochemicals plant.
It was expected that the referral to trail decision would be passed immediately especially as the investigations had lasted for almost 7 months before they were officially announced. Public opinion is therefore, burning with desire to see the law taking revenge on those defendants if they proved to be guilty. Delay, however, gave the chance to malicious rumours that tried to cover the whole case, and then, sometimes were rude enough to claim that the whole matter would lead to nothing.
President Mubarak, therefore, sided with local production, but official importers got round the President's decision and started importing steel pipes from the French Pontamayson, which is highly influential!
The corruption case, however, soon exploded and all the company's officials were sent to prison of appeal and the company almost stopped operation. Hushed reports now indicate a tendency to sell Al Nasr Company for Castings after it and its officials have been exposed as if it were an estate run by Dr Abdel-Wahab for his own personal interest!
The grand total of the Japanese aid to Egypt puts Japan second after the USA in the list of the donor countries, he pointed out.
She said in a press exclusive yesterday that some 20-215 million Canadian dollars would be allocated annually for financing the projects and providing assistance for Egypt.
Chairman of Egyptian Businessmen Union in Australia, Safwat Al Banna, who currently heads a delegation of Egyptian businessmen on a visit to Cairo says, "We've been taken aback when we heard about the idea of closing down EgyptAir route to Sydney as of next July especially as it coincides with the President's call for linking the Egyptian expatriates to the motherland and using all possible means to boost that relation.
Planning Director for Arab Channels in Australia and Asia, Ahmed Salih says that the Egyptian economy cannot stand further closures of new markets these days when everybody suffers, adding that withdrawal and giving up before competitors would destroy trade and tourism investments between Egypt and Australia. He says that the year 2001 witnessed the foundation of Egyptian Businessmen Union in Australia and the signature of agreements with Egypt in the field of exporting Egyptian products. This was followed, this year, by the signature of a historic agreement allowing the ban on some Egyptian food products in Australia to be lifted. A review of trade would reveal an obvious increase in exports to Australia during the last couple of years, an increase which is both regular and promising of sustainable progress in the future, such an increase will definitely be affected by the suspension of EgyptAir route through which Egyptian exports found a way to Australian markets.
Among the projects covered by this loan is one for erecting new barrages to improve irrigation in 750,000 feddans in Qena, in addition to generating electricity at the project.
He pointed out that the proposed projects would cut the hours of waiting north and south of the new lock.
The report says that exports to these countries have gone up by noticeable rates ranging between 43% and 288% during the reported period. Exports to India went up by a remarkable 62% from $ 155 million in 2000 to $ 250 million in 2001, while exports to Iraq rose by 43% from $ 63 million to $ 90 million, exports to Romania increased by 60% from $ 15 million to $ 23 million and exports to Switzerland climbed from $ 4 million to $ 16 million.
Egyptian exports to Kenya doubled to $ 20 million, while exports to the European Union dropped by 31% from $ 1901 million in 2000 to $ 1310 million in 2001.
Chairman of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones Dr. Mohamed Al- Ghamrawi said there are big potentialities for setting up joint investment projects between Egypt and India in the auto feeding industries.
GULF OF SUEZ ZONE PUT UP FOR CHINESE INVESTMENTS
TRADE EXCHANGE AND INVESTMENTS WITH CHINA INCREASED, CHINESE AMBASSADOR
He added that the establishment of a direct and regular airline between Egypt and China is being considered in order to increase the trade exchange volume and the influx of Chinese tourist to Egypt.
Egypt's main exports were crude oil, petroleum oil, metallurgical products, cotton, yarn, molasses, scrap copper, nectar concentrates, frozen vegetables and farming produce.
Dr Bahgat explained that the African Development Bank was making $70 million in urgent loans available to Egypt to finance those projects by extending credits to some of the banks operating in Egypt, pointing out that the total of loans extended to Egypt by the bank had reached $500 million and that the total was expected to be doubled to $1 billion in cooperation with the World Bank after the ongoing study on restructuring was finished.
It was decided to send a senior official with the ministry of agricultural to participate in the meetings of the countries participating in the project which will be held late this month in the bank's headquarters in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire.
The joint Egyptian-Ugandan Business Council will hold its first meeting during the last week of June current in the Ugandan city of Entebbe after it has been set up for the first time on June 1st under the chairmanship of Dr. Ibrahim Kamel, the chairman of Kato Aromatic Group.
Ministry of Housing and Egyptian contracting companies contribute to this new company. Eng. Hassan Abdel-Aziz was appointed chairman of this company. Earlier he visited some Iraqi cities to consider the demands of the Iraqi side concerning the Egyptian companies' participation in the reconstruction of Iraq.
The Minister of Local Development, Mostafa Abdel Kader, said that as per the Prime Minister's decree number 636 for 2002 on the operating system at the Investment services compounds, the system of investment services compounds would be established in 4 stages, with the first stage carried out in Cairo, Alexandria, Ismailia and Assiut.
He also reiterated that the establishment of investment compounds was done by authorization from the Minister of Local Development.
- Approving or endorsing any decrees, procedures, documents or contracts that must be acquired from the relevant minister for completing the rendering of investment services that fall within the jurisdiction of the relevant ministry.
- Rendering the services that fall within the jurisdiction of the respective authority or organization.
Article 6 stipulates that the attached system for authorized representatives and liaison officers of ministries and other authorities and organizations shall be adopted at investment services compounds.
According to a statement issued yesterday by International Euromoney Institution that undertakes to organize the conference for the seventh year running in Cairo, the great breakthrough achieved by the conference last year encouraging the institution to go ahead with organizing that conference considered to be the biggest capital markets conference held in the Arab region annually.
Figures never tell lies or try to beautify an ugly truth.
This shows a decline in consumption compared with that in the 1980's when food represented 50% of the family income in cities and 60% in the countryside as the new and other family burdens had come at the expense of food.
The report uncovered that total expenditure on cafes and hotels amounts to LE2.8 billion, out of which LE1.2 billion is spent on tea alone.
Egypt's coffee imports amounted to the value of about LE125 million.
Trade Research and Studies Centre Director Dr. Mohamed Youssef says that such a rise in the volume of expenditure on the mobile phone is attributed to several factors such as the heavy traffic that make it necessary for businessmen to send messages concerning their appointments.
LE12 billion is devoured by private lessons that have spread undeterred like cancer in the Egyptian society.
Following are excerpts from an article by Mohammad Abdel Hakam Diab, an Egyptian writer residing in London.
It would have been much better if the Prime Minister had done something to alleviate the effects of this suffocating crisis and boost the production and exportation potentials of the country to the desired levels, not con the people with promises that the donors had made in Sharm Al Sheikh months ago but have not kept. He should have provided alternative solutions to deal with the current conditions, in which Arab and European countries cannot absorb any more labour. Since the responsibilities of the Egyptian Government have become similar to those of "seasonal labour contractor," the skill level of Egyptian workers has been going down and down, making them unable to continue to compete with their Korean, Indian, Sri Lankan and Pakistani counterparts, to name just a few, which has made a bad unemployment problem even worse.
Dr. Atef Ebeid is just a civil servant who occupies the post of prime minister at the peak of the country's executive power. He cannot assimilate or understand what is going on, otherwise he would have discovered that the danger potential had considerably increased and could not have been confronted by simply abiding by an American agenda. Unless a change takes place to produce a shift in the course of current developments, the USA and the Zionist state are likely to succeed in creating a leadership, political and security vacuum in the Palestinian self-rule territories to produce anarchy, thus giving the chance to Arab and Jewish elements to trigger a civil war that would erode away the internal front and undermine the gains made by the uprising at the levels of deterrence, steadfastness and high morale. They would have, thus, killed two birds with one stone. In addition to weakening the internal Palestinian front, frustration would return to the Arab street thus revitalizing the official Arab stance, and enabling it to exercise more repression against the unarmed citizens with a view to aborting the potential of the Palestinian uprising turning into an Arab one.
The question now is: Will Arab rulers remain idle until this dream is realized?
MARTYRDOM OPERATIONS HARM NATIONAL INTEREST: RAJOUB
"It is wrong to talk about and put forward the topic in this way for this means that we are under the U.S.-Israeli tutelage, a thing which is untrue."
Neither threat nor ridicule alarms me.
In my estimation, although I understand the frustration of Palestinian citizens and movements, such operations harm our issue for our national unity and harmony with the regional and international dimension is one of the most important elements of force to face this occupation.
Chief of the Palestinian Preventive Security in the West Bank Gebril Rajoub dismissed as untrue reports that he chose Egypt as an optional exile as a result of recent broadside pressed against him following the recent Israeli incursions into the Palestinian- controlled territories.
Rajoub cushioned the divisions within the Palestinian agencies, especially his dispute with Chief of Palestinian Preventive Security in Gaza Strip Mohamed Dahlan.
The agency made this announcement in its press release on the survey it had made on the impact of Israeli actions on the economic situation of Palestinian families just before the storming of Palestinian cities.
The results of the survey indicate that 96.8% of families in Palestinian territories agreed to clearing the Palestinian market of Israeli goods that could be replaced with products from other origins.
As to the confidence of interviewed families in local products, the results indicate that 93.4% of the interviewed families trusted local products, while 77.1% trusted Arab, non-local products, 55.9% trusted foreign, non- Arab products and 24.1% trusted Israeli products.
The sources added that his meeting in Cairo two days ago with director of Egyptian Intelligence Omar Solayman focused on ways and means of benefiting by Egyptian know how for training Palestinian security in running intelligence operations.
They pointed out communications between Cairo, Riyadh and Ramallah to convene the Palestinian National Council in Cairo (its old seat).
In a statement to Al-Hayat he said, "There is no contact between us and the Saudi Arabians or Egyptians. As a Hamas leader, I say that the reports about contact to hold such a conference are completely divorced from reality."
Halting such operations means putting an end to resistance and acquiescing to occupation.
Stressing that Hamas moves in public rather than "behind the scenes," Rantisi pointed out that the anti-resistance action had not stopped behind the scenes since 1948 and that all the schemes in that regard would, as usual, be foiled.
He added that all the forces that signed such a document supported the continuation of resistance.
Responding to a question about whether Hamas would continue its martyrdom operations against Israeli civilians in the Palestinian territories that were occupied in 1948, Sheikh Yassin said, "Is there a civil community in Israel?
The resistance will not be defeated: In reply to a question about whether the Israeli storming of the West Bank had negatively impacted on the effectiveness and capabilities of the Palestine resistance, Sheikh Yassin said that the claims of Israeli generals to that effect were the products of the generals' imagination and wishful thinking.
Commenting on Hamas' stand on the changes that the Palestinian Authority intended to make in its organization and services, Sheikh Yassin said, "The Palestinian people has been calling for change and for combating corruption for several years, but nobody listened to them when the situation was calm. What concerns us now is that the calls for reform are coming from Israel and the United States to throw the blame on the Palestinian people for Israel's destruction of Palestinian cities, towns and villages and claim that it was the bad shape of Palestinian management that brought the aggression, destruction, murder and homelessness on the Palestinians."
Sheikh Yassin commented on the trial of Ahmad Sa'adat, Secretary General of the Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine, for the assassination of Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Zeevi by expressing regret and denouncing the trial of Sa'adat and his colleagues. He pointed out that by arresting and prosecuting Sa'adat and his colleagues, the Palestinian Authority had committed not one crime but several, as it had admitted that resistance and self-defence were rejected and that those who defended themselves were criminals that should be prosecuted. "Besides," he added, "putting these people in jail under American-British supervision means that they are on the terrorist list."
ALGERIAN COALITION GOVERNMENT PARTIES HEAD FOR HOT ELECTORAL BATTLE Signs have begun to emerge of a fierce battle between the two partners of the Algerian government coalition, the Democratic National Grouping and the National Liberation Front, during the legislative elections slated for the thirtieth of this month.
Meantime, the residents of tribal areas have intensified their protests, making strong calls for boycotting the elections. At Al Kasr in Begaya Province, demonstrators burned more than 100 poll boxes, while a number of boxes was also destroyed in Amizor, another town of the province. Knowledgeable sources said that 43 out of 52 municipalities in the province did not have poll boxes, not to mention that voter lists had been torched in 35 municipalities. It was noted in this context that about 90% of the citizens whose voting cards had expired have not come forward to claim new ones. The same sources also said that a large number of the government officials who were supposed to supervise poll stations had returned the summons sent them by the Government, out of their fear of the reactions of their compatriots who had decided to boycott the elections.
Zarhuni affirmed that the pressure of the Islamic paramilitary groups would not affect or pose any difficulty for the smooth running of the legislative elections slated for 30 May, pointing out that the Government had adopted exceptional procedures that had made it possible to foil a number of attacks in the central part of the country.
As to the tensioned situation in the tribal areas, the Minister of Interior indicated that the voters in those areas did not represent more than 5% of the total electorate, which meant that the turnout would not be affected much.
The plan, which will extend into 2005, earmarked large investments to the tune of $35 billion, to which Libya contributes 60- 70%, while the remainder was left to the private sector and foreign investments, according to Libyan official sources.
NATO OFFICIAL: MANOEUVRES IN ALGERIA MAKING READY FOR EMERGENCIES IN THE MEDITERRANEAN
The NATO force, which has anchored in Algiers Port, consists of six ships including frigates and destroyers coming from Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain, Greece and Turkey.
The arrival of NATO naval forces at Algeria comes within a plan drawn up by the NATO in 1994 to which Algeria joined in February 2000 to boost such dialogue and protect the region, he added.
Algeria, which has been suffering from a wave of violence since early 1990s, looks forward to establishing cooperation in the field of fighting terrorism and modernising its armed forces, as most of its weapons are former Soviet Union-made.
This announcement was made by Russian Defence Minister Sergey Ivanov following his talks with the Algerian Chief of General Staff, General Mohammad Al Amari, who is visiting Moscow at present.
ALGERIA DENIES COOPERATION WITH ISRAEL IN THE FIELD OF MEDICINE MANUFACTURING
INDIA INVADES EGYPTIAN SOFTWARE INDUSTRY
The aforementioned factors spurred the Egyptian companies, especially the big ones, to mostly depend on Indian labour with a view to decreasing production cost, enhancing the competitivness edge and getting access to Arab markets, he said.

The report added that Arab nationalities and those with undefined nationalities living illegally in Kuwait decreased from 22.87% to 22.46% for the former and from 5.17% to 4.79% for the latter.
The sources pointed out that Washington started communications to assure Iraq's neighbouring countries that their interests would not be threatened after the current Iraqi regime is toppled.
The sources added that President Bush's Administration considered Turkey the most important ally in the region as far as cooperation for the implementation of the plan is concerned. This is due to Turkey's geographical position and its role as a democratic secularist Islamic country which is an ally to Washington.
The plan makes the central government in Baghdad in control of defence affairs, foreign policy and energy (oil) with a decentralized system of government, representative councils and security bodies in the three zones.
They added that the Kurdistani zone in Iraq now enjoys a sort of self-rule. The central government in Baghdad does not control large parts of the south either.
In a statement of which Asharq Al-Awsat received a copy, the party politburo commented on some mass media reports quoting diplomatic sources, that the American Administration was planning to set up a (Federal Democratic Republic) in Iraq after toppling Saddam Hussein's regime including three separate entities run by elected local representative councils in unified Iraq governed by a central federal government in Baghdad. The statement said that the party regarded Washington's plans as "blatant interference in a case that was none of its business." We believe that neither the U.S.A. nor anybody else has the right to exercise hegemony or interfere in any of the affairs of sovereign countries under any pretext, to affect or control the destiny of some countries militarily, politically or economically, tempted to do so by its own power.
The minister commended the results of the negotiations he held during his recent visit to Saudi Arabia which was considered the first visit paid by senior Iraqi economic official since the relations between the two countries were severed in the aftermath of the Second Gulf War in 1991.

The Saudi Minister of Labour and Social Affairs stated that the Saudi market is open to all nationalities, explaining that the decision of attracting labour from any country is up to employers who shortlist the personnel. "I've discussed this matter with the Iranian delegation," he said.
In an interview with the Iranian News Agency (IRNA) at the conclusion of his visit to Kuwait, Admiral Shamkhani said that events proved that the United States had paved the way for the growth of Iraq's military power and that the Iraqi authorities had not launched any military action against their neighbours without coordination with the Americans.
IRAN ACCUSES AMERICA OF PREPARING FOR STRIKING IT NEXT YEAR
Addressing a rally mourning the death of Jenin martyrs, before the Palestinian embassy in Tehran, he said "The American Administration has taken a decision to complete hitting Afghanistan by 2001, Iraq by 2002 and Iran by 2003. The situation in Palestine, nevertheless, as well as the Palestinian people's resistance has disrupted some parts of the programme."
According to the same source, after Rumsfeld's visit Ismail Khan's forces prevented Herat's Afghani Shiite leaders from visiting Iran, arrested them for the charge of espionage and transported them to an unknown place.

From the Evangelical Church Priest Makram Naguib, a theologian, said:
Thirdly, it is strange that the statement attacks the Egyptian government which respects and venerates our churches. There can be no comparison between the Israeli savagery which all the world sees and what is happening in Egypt where there is dialogue and coexistence.

FINANCE MINISTRY DEMANDS THAT BANKS BE SUBJECTED TO SALES TAX
Finance Minister Dr. Medhat Hassanein earlier sent a memo to Abul-Oyoon in which he called on him to ask the banks to rapidly register their activities with the Sales Tax Department and pay off the State's dues in implementation of the law and to preserve the State funds.

The profits of investment banks went down sharply over the first quarter of the current year.
Al-Ahrar also learned that economic organizations, such as the Post Authority, have preserved their stability in the face of worldwide fluctuations of exchange rates.
Egyptian banks are now making ready for dealing with the variables of the austerity policy that would be adopted by the Government in the coming stage. The Government has already made preparations for imposing this policy on the dealings of the affiliated bodies, after reports had it that the external lending prices might probably increase especially after the recent report issued by Standard and Poors, which decreased Egypt's credit classification regardless of many criticisms that have been leveled at this report. the Government attached more importance to the assistance and loans the donor countries have previously pledged to give. However, the inflow of such aid has been conditional on a batch of terms about which the monetary authorities have reservation, foremost of which is the attitude towards the policies on the rate of exchange.
In light of such conditions, the banks also are making ready for increasing dollar lending and deduction prices and other foreign currencies, something that might make such an activity a bit difficult unless there is demand for the dollar under the new return prices, thus aggravating the state of recession on the commercial market and, consequently, there will be a retreat in the returns of activity at banks.
Abdel-Aziz confessed that there were troubles impeding the expansion of the banks and financial institutions in the field of real estate finance in spite of the fact that the new law and its executive statute had been endorsed. However, what is important here is to just start and then deal with these problems, he said.
He pointed out that that can serve the personal interests of some deputies who own about 20 million square metres of land.
Hemeida asked for a re-appraisal of such lands in accordance with the privileges that would be granted to special economic zones and pointed out his reservations that he had presented in 18 amendments to the law articles.
He added that what the government has been doing was simply cutting corners, which serves no public interest.

They were referred by Mubarak to a court-martial only one week after they had been arrested.
ALEXANDRIA WOMEN ASK FOR KHUL' IN 487 CASES IN ONE MONTH
According to information Al-Hayat obtained, there were some major smuggling operations of "human goods" across the borders. Through such operations, Russia and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) manpower are infiltrated into Israel via Egyptian territories in spite of the strict security measures imposed by Cairo on border outlets in Sinai.
A well-informed source added that about 100 Moldavian workers travel weekly through that route which witnesses a boom due to the tough living conditions in their own country.
The tourist expert told Al-Hayat that the most difficult stage is the way from Egyptian lands into Israel.
EGYPT COMMITTED NOT TO ENTER MILITARY NUCLEAR FIELD: MINISTER OF ELECTRICITY
There are many other countries which signed the treaty and no one says that their hands are tied.
But, Egypt can get the peaceful nuclear technology and this is what we are seeking to do. In this context, we signed two agreements with China and South Korea.
Minister: We have two reactors, an old research reactor (2 megawatts) from Russia, and the new high-tech Argentinian reactor, which has been in use for three years. It was inaugurated by President Hosni Mubarak and his Argentinian counterpart.
We announced tenders in the 1980s but the establishment was put on the back burner due to the explosion of Chernobyl Reactor.
Minister: For Egypt, it is by all means impossible. We should respect the signed agreements especially as Egypt always seeks peace.
We have efficient cadres and scientists as Egypt had a nuclear energy establishment late in the 1950s. So, we would not be starting from ground zero. We, however, lagged behind others in the field of peaceful uses in some matters.
To whom are these words directed?
The uttering of words haphazardly is no longer of value.
PALESTINIAN INTELLIGENCE CHIEF: WE WON'T ALLOW AL-AQSA MARTYRS BATTALIONS OR ANY OTHER ORGANIZATION TO VIOLATE THE LAW

ISRAELI DELEGATION CONSIDER PURCHASING OF WATER FROM TURKEY
In an interview with Al-Jazeera Satellite Channel, he said his movement "will consider participation in the Palestinian elections, provided that they are fair and their ceiling does not stop at Oslo Agreement."
Hamas' conditional offer to halt the martyrdom operations and acceptance to take part in the Palestinian elections is an initiative that should be given what it deserves by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and the Arab countries concerned with peace. Besides, Hamas' joining the structure of government under these circumstances will help the PNA overcome its local and foreign crisis and serve President Arafat's orientations towards political and security reforms.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said yesterday that Israel is terribly concerned over the success of the latest trial of the Iranian missile Shehab 3.

These schools specialize in preparing religious cadets for military service, and all their graduates are recruited by elite units and intelligence services.
The schools are headed by some of the most extremist rabbis, such as Rabbi Rabinovich, manager of the military school at Ma'aleh Adumim Settlement east of occupied Jerusalem, who issued a religious opinion in 1995 legalizing the assassination of former Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin.
It might also be mentioned that the manger of the military school at Atsmona Settlement south of Gaza Strip, where five cadets of the school were killed by a martyrdom seeker from Ezz Eddin Al Qassam Battalions three months ago, is a retired Israeli Air Force brigadier general.
Israel has paid great attention to these relations and provided them with all material and scientific capabilities to permanently maintain their intimacy. Israel has, moreover, set up scientific and research centers to activate and push those relations forward.
Marking the elapse of a full decade since the start of the Indian-Israeli relations, the Jewish Political Institute in Israel issued this month a study entitled "The Jews of India - Horizons and Ambitions."
Depending on statistics compiled by the modern Jewish Encyclopedia, he claimed that the number of the Jews in India approached one hundred thousand in the year 1990, of whom some enjoy big economic and commercial status. They play an important role in many sectors, such as the cultivation of fruit and vegetables and the trade of clothes and textiles.
The first delegation of the Indian Jews reached Israel on May 15, 1994.
Netanyahu sides with Indian Jews: It is clear that all Israeli officials pay heed to the children of the Indian Jewish sect, something to which former Israeli premier Benjamin Netanyahu pointed frankly. He said the absorption of this sect in Israel would benefit it strongly and affect it positively at all levels.
He said these relations are similar to those found between twins, who cannot separate from one another, especially as these relations have been established on the exchange of benefits and achievement of joint interests. Since the establishment of the Indian-Israeli relations, 66 Israeli delegations have visited India, while 48 Indian delegations have visited Tel Aviv, not to mention the secret visits that have not been disclosed.
At the internal level, Israel is facing the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) and Jihad. At the external level, it facing Hezbollah with which Israel entered into war for more than 18 years, in addition to other organizations, which Israel claims that they enjoy the support of Islamic countries, foremost among which is Iran.
Because all foreign circles, from the American the trade representative to the IMF and the World Bank and the assessment organizations and the representatives of the donor nations, do not stop exerting pressure to push the government to further "liberation" of the exchange rate, the Egyptian decision makers have become convicted of the need to take a step in that direction to preserve their "good" relations with these quarters.
They pointed out that resources had not risen by rates that could fill needs, particularly as the Suez Canal tolls and expatriate remittances had gone down while the U.S. dollar's exchange rate had soared and the privatization program had failed to realize its objectives.
The experts also said that the privatization program had failed to realize its objectives, as its proceeds were expected to reach not more than LE5 billion, one-half of which would go to payment of the public debt, which would aggravate the finance crisis that the Government was expected to face next year.
The study discussed yesterday by the annual conference of National Planning Institute Researches said that the volume of domestic debts has exceeded the government investment value in the recent years.
Chairman of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones Dr. Mohamed Al- Ghamrawi emphasized the free zones attractiveness of foreign, Arab, and local investments, pointing out that the number of projects in the free zones increased to over 817 companies by the end of last December.

The foreign contribution to the issued capital reached 25% of the total contributions.
The Governor of Giza, Counselor Mahmoud Abul Lail, said that the governorate would start accepting businessmen's applications for allocation of the remaining land along Cairo-Alexandria Desert Road within a few days.
FOREIGN CONTRIBUTIONS TO CAPITAL OF INVESTMENT COMPANIES RETREAT

A field study conducted by the Real Estate Investors Division head, Eng. Fatehullah Fawzi uncovered a number of important facts that may require an immediate amendments in the 2002/2003 plan concerning the housing sector.
This way, many real estate projects under actual implementation have defaulted, while their targeted stages have not been completed yet.
If 115 real estate companies at the 6th of October City monopolize 10053 feddans and implement about 3,000 housing units annually, the implementation of the same results and expectations on the rest of the new cities - in case they have a movement of construction - about 8,000 housing units, therefore, should enter the real estate market in the new cities annually.
"All of us know well the result," he said.
Fawzi emphasized that the private real estate sector should by no means bear the subsidy of accommodation. Through subsidy development and expansion could not be achieved, nor could it provide job opportunities at private companies. Subsidy is a task that can be carried out by the State that can provide certain funds for subsidizing the housing of the low-income categories annually to implement 250,000 units. This needs 10 billion pounds in the form of subsidy. Of course, these funds are not available, as the subsidy provided by the State to build about 700,000 housing units ranges between 2.5 to 3 billion pounds.
The project uses solar cells and wind energy to extract water. The value of the water unit will be settled with the Ministry of Water Resources at rates not higher than the currently acknowledged ones.
Al Behira Governor, Eng. Ahmed Al Leithi said that the economic returns of Edco first line for gas liquefaction in Edco hit $400 million. He added that the project included the construction of a giant station for the liquefaction of natural gas on an area of 390 feddans near Edco coast at a total cost of $900 million in order to benefit by the big reserves of gas fields in the area. He added that the project would begin its actual production in 2005 and would direct its first line production to export to France to cover 10% of her needs of natural gas.
The Industry Committee pointed out in its report that the feasibility study prepared by an English company for Al-Maghara coal had personal interests, which led to the failure of the project and waste of investments to the tune of 1.2 billion pounds.
40% DECLINE IN CAR FEEDING INDUSTRIES PRODUCTION DUE TO FLUCTUATION OF DOLLAR Car Feeding industries Association Chairman, Eng.
POTATO EXPORTS UP 39%
The total of Egyptian potato exports until June 8th hit 242,236 tons against 170,153 tons last season. About 181,837 tons were exported to the EU, 565,074 tons to Arab countries, 30,000 tons to African countries and 268 tons to Eastern European counties, he said.
There are hidden reasons behind Israeli insistence on importing Egyptian cottons and attempting to exploit Egyptian distinguished long-staple cottons for manufacturing textiles and ready-to-wear clothes in Israel. Through these products, Israel seeks to attract American and European markets and work for denying Egyptian products access to the markets which Egypt is looking forward to recover, especially those of Russia and former Soviet republics.
The governor's advisor for investment affairs Dr. Haza' Khalil stated that the foreign company would incur all the financing costs of the project without seeking the help of the Egyptian banks. The company would provide all the equipment and apparatus used in the project and prepare healthful waste dump to be established with the latest systems that meet the environment conditions without burning the refuse, he said, adding that the project would be entirely supervised by the Environment Affairs Department to ensure the use of the international conditions of discarding the waste material.
Fayza Aboul Naga said that such a grant is funded by the American economic aid programme to Egypt, under which $200 million are offered to the private sector for importation from the USA this year. The accord aims at providing short- and medium-term credit facilities to meet the needs of the private sector of American goods such as raw materials, medical and capital goods through Egyptian commercial banks that are taking part in the programme implementation.
In a symposium on the future of gold industry and extraction in Egypt, Sami Al- Rajehi, Chairman of the Australian-British Company, which prospects for gold, says that this new factory, set up for the first time in Egypt, includes a unit to produce gold, purify it of stains and turn it into bullion through the use of the most up-to-date world technologies in this field, particularly the method of electronic sedimentation. Besides, this factory will include a unit for extracting gold widely and building a power station. The new factory is targeted to produce gold in Egypt for the first time in March 2003. The new factory will extract gold from a quantity of ten million tons of stones yearly.
The German Construction Bank (KFW) started the implementation of the second stage of two financing programmes for private sector companies, one of them is known as "industrial private sector programme" while the second is "joint projects between public and private sectors."
The investments directed to the environment and industrial safety would obtain a grant ranging between 15% and 30%. He pointed out that the programme could be benefited from either for financing investments in the new industrial ventures or modernizing and expanding industrial production lines on condition that most of the shares should be owned by the private sector and that the company in question should be operative on the field of manufacture, treatment or others. In addition, about than 25% of the finance should be made use of the improvement of the environmental level.
More than seventy Egyptian and Italian companies will discuss today (June 17) in Cairo the means of the Egyptian-Italian participation in the field of manufacturing auto components for exportation to international markets. These discussions will be held under the symposium of "investment in the manufacture of car constituents and its feeding industries," organized by the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones in Egypt in cooperation with the Italian Embassy in Cairo, the Unit of Promoting Italian Investments at the General Authority for Investment, the Egyptian Industries' Federation, the League of the Producers of Car Components and the companies of manufacturing and producing cars in Egypt.
A meeting is scheduled to be held today on 17 June at the General Federation of Egyptian Chambers of Commerce between Egyptian businessmen from different fields and their Hungarian counterparts to discuss ways for promoting economic relations and cooperation between Egypt and Eastern European countries.

The draft agreement of this project was tabled to the Russian side during these meetings, he says, adding that an agreement has been reached over the exchange of information on measures that easily facilitate the entry of Egyptian vegetables and fruits to the Russian territories.
The delegation will also discuss the means of removing any obstacles facing the flow of trade between the two countries in order to effectuate this protocol, which aims at consolidating commercial relations between both sides.
In exclusive statements to Al-Alam Al-Youm, the Egyptian Ambassador in South Korea said that those discussions came within the framework of the Egyptian program to increase exports to South Korea after they declined from $259 million in 1999 to $110 million in 2001.
The first lawsuit was filed by Banha for Electronics against the Korean Daewoo for Electronics because the latter has repealed its agreement with Banha, signed a year ago. Under this agreement, Banha for Electronics manufacture the products of TV, video and radio of the Daewoo trademark at the Company's factories in Egypt. Daewoo has recently given the agency to another client in Egypt. In its lawsuit, Banha asked for LE250-million compensation to make up for the losses it incurred.

Egyptian-Libyan consultations are underway to establish a joint agricultural development zone at a cost of $100 million aiming at boosting agricultural cooperation in their pursuit to build up an integrated society after Libya had shown its willingness to reclaim part of desert areas abundant in water in Egypt. Meanwhile, officials will meet soon to underline Libya's contribution to "MEDOR" project.
Official sources expected the foundation of a Libyan-Egyptian bank soon with a joint capital from both governments, private sector and banks as well as the organization of symposia and conferences for the representatives of firms, banks and concerned bodies in Libya and Egypt to mull over the future of investment and preparation of an investment map in addition to a database for the two sides. The database will present the opportunities and systems of investment available in Egypt and Libya particularly through joint ventures and provide accurate data about domains and opportunities of integration and cooperation, the sources added pointing to reconsideration of agreements regulating cooperation and follow-up processes so that a free trade zone could be established according to modern concepts and recommendations be turned into agendas to study deficiency points and put solutions as per set schedules.
It is to be mentioned that the NBE purchased this share from the Israeli side in last April upon the desire of both the Egyptian and Israeli sides in light of the deteriorating conditions in the region. This share is estimated at 38% out of the company's capital standing at $1.2 billion.
First Undersecretary of Foreign Trade Ministry, Al-Said Qasim, who doubles as head of Commercial Representation Body said that the study aimed at enhancing trade exchange movement between the two countries within the framework of enriching Arab economic action. He pointed out that the study cares about stocktaking and reviewing the agreement and showing the obstacles facing trade exchange movement between the two countries and analysing the commodity lists enclosed with the agreement and what actual contributions they made to the movement of the goods between the two countries together with the statistical tables that demonstrate the facts.
The study says that the application of the agreement between the two countries is still nascent and consequently can not be considered responsible for the decline of bilateral trade movement.
The study noticed the lack of any big changes in the commodity structure of exchanges between Egypt and Tunisia as trade exchange movement went on dealing in the same commodities as before signing the agreement especially concerning coke, whose exports reached about $10.1 million and $4.3 million and $13.9 million in 1997, 1998 and 1999 respectively.
KHATAMI TO VISIT UAE SOON
The two sides were keen on not pointing to their differences over the three islands of Major Tunb, Minor Tunb and Abu Moussa. Moreover, at the end of the visit they agreed on not giving any press statements to reporters.

The report said that Israel's relations with the Arab countries with whom it has diplomatic relations had retreated considerably since the outbreak of the Palestinian uprising in September 2000.
However, the civil peace and concord promised by Bouteflika when he came to power have not been forthcoming, nor has the country tasted the stability that everybody has been looking forward to since the referendum in which the President's proposal won over 98% of the votes.
Restoring stability will not come about with a smashing military victory, for the establishment of security depends on political conditions, the most important of which is reconsideration of the Government's plan for dealing with the Islamists.
Therefore, the estrangement between the community and the State will give ammunition to those who call for boycotting the current elections, on the grounds that the boycott will be a message of rejection not only in the Kabylie areas, but also in the majority of the other provinces where the people feel deprived of their share in the country's wealth.
Eritrean President Assiyassi Afourki reiterated his country's refusal to join the Arab League, which he described as an ineffective organization that stood for nothing in the Arab World.

Those who are trying to get us out of the area may have other aims in mind."
Sudan: Al Hayat asked President Afourki about the development of relations with Sudan, and he answered, "We have entered a new phase in these relations. Whatever we have to say on the policies of the Sudanese Government, we have opted for entering into open cooperation on both the issues on which we agree and the problems that we seek to solve through dialogue.
Somalia:
IRAN DOES NOT DRAW ANY BOUNDARIES OF DIALOGUE ON THREE ISLANDS: IRAN'S MD
IRAN LAUNCHES A MISSILE INCLUDING ISRAEL IN ITS RANGE
We also know that the experiment of the latest missile whose range is 1300 kilometres had been successful, which causes concern."
He added, "for the time being we have no plans to develop to Shehab-4 missile, but we managed to increase accuracy and the explosive charge of the Shehab-3 long range ground-ground missile.
Its formation will be on a par with the transport and electricity police. The amendment also stipulates that a specialised institute for the judiciary police be set up.

This maritime tour, launched on June 5, was organized by the Greek Orthodox Church. Sheikh Fawzi al-Zafzaf, Azhar's former undersecretary and current head of Inter-religion Dialogue Committee, represents Al-Azhar in this tour.
AL AZHAR SUPPORTS BAN ON SALE OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES, DEMANDS PUNISHMENT FOR VENDORS & CONSUMERS
The former Mufti, Dr Nasr Farid Wassel, had spearheaded a campaign against the sale of spiritual drinks in Egypt, making strong slashing attacks on media that had run advertisements of beer and other alcoholic drinks. He issued a fatwa (Islamic legal opinion) that such actions were "haram (against Sharia, or Islamic laws) and acts that spread corruption on the Earth if the advertisers or vendors are Muslims."
Flogging punishments: The Jurisprudence Research Committee had received a request from the incumbent Mufti, Dr Ahmad Al Tayeb, for determination of the Sharia stand on the bill on banning alcoholic beverages that had been submitted to the People's Assembly by deputy Hussein Ebrahim to amend some of the provisions of law 63 for 1976 on banning the drinking of alcoholic beverages. The most significant provisions of the bill include that "any individual who drinks alcoholic beverages shall be punished with forty lashes. Proving the crime of drinking alcoholic beverages will be done in court by either of two means: an unforced confession from the culprit, or the testimony of two adults, sane males or, if necessary, a male and two females or four females. Testimony should be based on actual witnessing of the act, nor hearsay."
The space reconnaissance system has a special significance for Israel for the following reasons:
3- Also by using its spy and warning satellites, Israel can also reinforce its missile defence strategy against that asset in Arab armies which has become a nightmare for Tel Aviv: the surface-to-surface ballistic missiles that can hit objectives in the heart of Israel. A case in point is the missiles that Iraq fired on Israel during the Kuwait Liberation War. Spy and warning satellites can detect the launch sites and timings of Arab surface-to-surface missiles and project their trajectories in the atmosphere or space, and consequently expect their impact areas and send warning to the rear command to take defence, prevention and after-impact clearing actions.
Israel has also cooperated with Kazakhstan for launching a small satellite, the Girwin-2, from a Kazakh base that specializes in launching and monitoring satellites and spacecraft and in which Israel participates by 50%. The satellite, which was carried to orbit by a Russian Zenith missile, carries sensors and is controlled out of Haifa. It was launched in July, 1998. Israel believes that by launching 25 of these small, cheap satellites, it will be able to cover all the Arab and Islamic areas, including Iran, which recently made a successful test firing of its Shihab-3 ballistic missile that has a 1,500-km range, and Pakistan, which also carried out three recent test firings of its Ghuri and Hatf strategic missiles that have ranges of 2,000 and 920 kilometres respectively.
Al-Assad reviewed some communications which took place just before the recent tripartite summit was held, pointing out that the three countries had been exposed to heavy unprecedented pressure by the American Administration in a bid to issue a statement regarding the so-called terrorism or martyrdom operations.
He also complained that some Arab parties had responded to American concepts to change the Palestinian leadership and put forward names like Mahmoud Abbas and Ahmed Qurai' and others, but Syria, though not getting on well with President Arafat refused mere talk about that, and rejected any attempts to impose options on the Palestinian people.
Regarding the Lebanese file, Al-Assad said that he would withdraw from Lebanon if the Lebanese people wanted it. He, however, added that he was at a loss for he could not decide what exactly the Lebanese people wished. He added that the situation in Lebanon is ready for a return to partisan disputes.
The second part is pertinent to security reforms as the four teams in Washington negotiations decided to retain three in lieu of 13 Palestinian security establishments now, which will follow up the dossiers of negotiations and contacts with the Israeli side, hold meetings of the high-level security committees, monitor the activities of anti-Israel Palestinian factions and movements, and thwart violence and bombing attacks in coordination with Israel and a number of the Arab neighbours.
According to the Egyptian side, until quite recently Arafat was opposed to the political and security reform plan, but the U.S. frankly asked a number of Arab countries to necessarily move to deliberate on the PNA to accept the drive in exchange for a U.S. vow to put a full visualization to save the Middle East peace process. In two 10-hour separate meetings with Arafat, Jordanian Prime Minister Ali Abul- Ragheb and a high-level Arab security official could persuade him to go to Washington for security negotiations as a first step to improve the current situation in the occupied territories.
Israel seeks to promote its Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's plan to announce the Palestinian state early next year and prolong the final negotiations for ten years, while Europe and Egypt try to make Israel set a timetable for negotiations, a thing which will be emphasized by President Hosni Mubarak in his meeting with U.S. President George W. Bush during his visit to Camp David next week.
Indications show that Sharon may okay the Palestinian state in Gaza Strip as he promised or the U.S. will seek to implement the vision of Bush and his Secretary of State Colin Powell on a Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank, rather than Hebron and Jerusalem, the sources added.
AL ADLI: AL QAEDA ORGANIZATION PLANS NEW TERRORIST ATTACKS
Egyptian authorities arrested a young man who was trying to smuggle weapons to the Palestinian resistance through Rafah town.
A number of Egyptian civilians, including girls, had also tried to cross the border to participate in the Intifada, including Mohammad Ahmad, a 13-year-old boy from Giza; Usama, a young man from Mansoura, and Gamila Bashari Ahmad Mohammadain, 35, from New Salehiya area in Ismailia.
He added that although the government is the party's government and should abide by and implement the party's policies in all fields, the present conditions require a clarification of the relationship between the party and the government.
At the economic forum held by the Chamber of Commerce in Alexandria two days ago on international cooperation and energizing the private sector, Fayza Abou El Naga said it was foreign aid that cover the gap in financing the private sector because the volume of saving in Egypt could not so far reach the level that could provide such finance.
She added that as of June (this month) debts started to be exchanged for domestic currency in order to contribute to domestic development projects. This has already been the case with an $18 million debt to Italy and a $30 million debt to the International fund for Agricultural Development. A big project will be set up on an area of 56 thousand feddans at Al Nobareya for small industries. Negotiations are currently underway using the same technique of exchanging debts with Germany.
She explained that the volume of foreign assistance and financing to the Egyptian private sector from the early 1990's to date had reached $2.6 billion, plus $600 million that had been allotted to the Social Development Fund for spending on small and medium enterprises to create new jobs and boost Egyptian exports.
This was said by Minister Plenipotentiary and Commercial Representation Body's Asia Department Director, Mohamed Al-Aref, who added that the transactions of exporting Egyptian cars to China, which are being prepared, concentrate on the exportation of Asian and European cars that are assembled in Egypt.
The Commercial Representation offices try to provide the required information about the Chinese markets, export chances and joint investments to present them to the Egyptian companies and institutions through the Commercial Representation web site, he pointed out.
Last year, Egyptian car exports increased fivefold that of 1999, as exportation was the substitute to which car producers in Egypt resorted to face up to the retreat in the volume of sales on the domestic market, Al-Hadari said.
A NEW CREDIT LINE AGREEMENT BETWEEN "COMMERCE FINANCE" AND NATIONAL BANK OF EGYPT
Al Manai lauded the role played by the national agencies in Egypt and the important role played by the programme in developing the productive and cooperative capabilities of the Arab producer and exporter, cementing Arab countries' economies and encouraging trade exchange in a bid to enhance the march of Arab economic integration through its credit facilities on soft conditions and commercial data services and promotion.
SOME ECONOMIC BODIES TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO HOLDING COMPANIES
The execution of the program will result in important results that include restructuring domestic public debt to reduce its volume and the cost of its funding.
A recent report by the Central Bank's Economic Research Department affirmed that the increase had come as a result of the rise of both local and foreign assets, with local assets going up by LE19.8 billion to LE114.8 billion that represented 68.2% of the total assets of the Central Bank at the end of last year.
They pinpointed that dealing in the euro will play a main role in alleviating the pressure on the dollar in local markets, keeping the dollar exchange rate stable against the Egyptian pound, and putting an end to the already present dollar black market.
109 	Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) approved the rise of Misr Iran Development Bank's (MIDB) paid capital from $109 million to $150 million. MIDB presented a request to the CBE asking for hiking up its capital in the framework of increasing the participation of the Iranian side.

Dabbous denied such charges, emphasizing that no control body has investigated him regarding the Egyptian-American Bank deal. Capital Market Authority also did not accuse him of profiteering from the Egyptian American Bank deal during the negotiations period with the British Standard Chartrade that bade to purchase it.
It might be mentioned that Dabbous is the Banks Union deputy chairman and representative of foreign banks at the Union.
It will also meet the people's requirements of necessary foodstuff commodities, he added.

MINISTER OF PLANNING: RATE OF INVESTMENT DROPS BY 9% & KEEPS FALLING
The Minister of Planning said that private investments are linked to government investments and that there is a correlation between the two; i.e. a rise in the rates of public investments leads to a rise in private investments and vice versa.
Egypt's share of world foreign investments fell to 0.09% whereas China gets foreign investments of 40 billion dollars and Malaysia gets 5 billion dollars.
PLAN TO SETTLE ARAB INVESTMENTS IN EGYPT
These remarks were made in a press conference held by Al-Ghamrawi on the occasion of the issuance of the republican decree no. 79 for the year 2002 concerning the provision of investment services.
The Egyptian government is trying to diversify the sources of international finance to make up for the slowness of donor countries and institutions in meeting their commitments, by which they abided during the Sharm Al-Sheikh Conference last February.
It is to be mentioned that the Arab finance institutions and funds are the ones that are much committed so far to the extension of assistance and loans, which they promised to grant to Egypt during the Sharm Al-Sheikh conference. During the past period, the Arab Development Fund extended about $400 million. The Egyptian government is seeking to activate its contacts with those institutions to make up for its need of foreign finance sources within the framework of rules laid down by the new general budget, to be effective as of next month.

CONTRACTING COMPANIES THREATEN TO REVOKE CONTRACTS WITH RECONSTRUCTION MINISTRY
The Ministry of Reconstruction is currently receiving all the complaints in order to attach them to the detailed memorandum as a prelude to submitting them to Dr. Atef Ebeid. The memo deals with the situation of the prices of reinforcing iron and their impacts on the construction and building movement. The preliminary results indicate a 25-percent increase in the cost of building medium-cost housing and houses for the low-incomed people.
The minister also said that 20 new cities and urban communities had been established so far, with 515,000 housing units built there with investments totaling LE11.4 billion.
41.9 A report by the Central Auditing Agency (CAA) uncovered that 8 external companies made losses that exceeded 60% of their 164.4-million-pound capital.
In addition, the actual inventory of the finished as well as the unfinished production stockpiles and commodities on the one hand and what is noted down at the book deposits of both Trade Timber and Misr External Trade companies on the other hand are not identical.
The cumulative deficit and the non-coverage of the long-term resources for the fixed uses have resulted in the continuation of the emergence of working money at a negative value in 3 companies, namely Al-Nasr Export and Import, the Ploughs and Engineering and Misr External Trade.
For example, in Al-Nasr Export and Import Company, the clients' assets and the bill receivables hit 392.6 million pounds against 233.4 million pounds last year. This percentage hiked by 20% in Misr External Trade, while the Public Company for Chemicals hiked from 97.8 million pounds to 119 million pounds. Generally, they are regarded as dealings with the private sector.
In response to the question raised by the opposition concerning NGOs draft law, the minister said these organizations have the right to practise national action, not political activity.
Those organizations announced the foundation of the committee on the defence of democracy. In a statement, they attacked the Government and accused it of tending to tighten the grip of the executive estate on non-governmental organizations and dominate them.
Suspension of dealings in the shekel by exchange companies took place in solidarity with the Palestinians and in denunciation of the massacres and intransigent aggressions the Israeli enemy.
HEAD OF CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IN EGYPT FACES A QUANDARY AS HIS APPOINTMENT TO HIS POSITION IS CHALLENGED!
The Muslim Brotherhood members of Egypt's parliament are preparing to get engaged into a new heated debate with the government over agricultural normalization with Israel, relying on information that Israeli agronomists are now carrying out agricultural experiments in 570 feddans in the Valley of Technology in Ismailia in northeastern Egypt.
There are forty Israeli experts working at Nubaria farms areas in western Delta, where barley cultivation experiments have been carried out since last April. Experiments are being conducted at Al-Sheikh Zuwaid area in North Sinai, too.
This road accommodates no more than 1% of the volume of commercial transport of containers, he said, stressing the importance of reconsidering the valid tariff that is paid by those who take the land road and raising the Russian quota of it for Russia gets only 25% of the transit charges while other countries get about 60%. It might be mentioned that the issue had implicitly cropped up during the dialogue about the East and the West over the issue of energy, something that means that Russia is serious in looking for all possible economic alternatives.
Muslim Brotherhood Group in Egypt has called for supporting Kashmir people's struggle against Indian occupation. It accused America of trying to "liquidate" the Kashmir people.
It also asked that an urgent Islamic summit be held to face the American-Jewish attack in Palestine and the American-backed Indian attack against Kashmir and Pakistan.
"In Egypt, there are about 350 and 400 Indian programmers thanks to the leap India achieved in such a field, as its software exports hit some 8.5 billion dollars, let alone the large number of experts, trainees and skilled labour particularly in the software domain," said the Cabinet's Information and Decision Support Centre head Eng. Ra'fat Radwan.
The Egyptian software sector has no need of foreign labour, said the Egyptian Federation of Industries' Chamber of Software Industry head Sayyed Ismail. Egyptian programmers have the efficiency and skill that enable them to work in major Arab as well as foreign companies in the region, he added. In addition, the partnership agreements related to training and programming signed with international software firms could qualify and train the Egyptian labour in such a field, he pointed out. The plans drawn up by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology provide the highest level of training and could meet the requirements of the software market, he said.
The reason behind Israeli scientists being interested in having their inventions patented in Egypt Out of 1387 requests submitted by researchers and scientists from the four corners of the globe, 73 Israeli scientists, researchers and amateurs have requested to have their inventions patented in the Scientific Research Academy (Patent Office) in Cairo.
In Egypt, there are now 25 patent agents. Like law offices, such agents follow up the registration procedures, as they have full experience in the methods applied. Registration charges applied in Egypt are about one thousand pounds. Cairo is considered the cheapest worldwide in this regard, he pointed out.
"Sovereign bodies are entitled to monopolize any invention, ban manufacturing it and compensate his inventor because the State will benefit from it. Some of those bodies also have the right to turn down any invention that might do harm to the national security or its registration in Egypt might deprive the country of the opportunity to manufacture it at a certain time," said the Egyptian Patent Office head Eng.
The Mufti vehemently turned that request down confirming that neither he nor anybody else had the right to interfere into the Islamic faith's matters. Al Tayeb emphasized that martyrdom operations do emanate from our creed and cannot, therefore, be declared as impremissible!
Our talk was confined then to the importance of reaching a peaceful solution. The ambassador also praised the values which the Egyptians adhered to regarding respect of creeds and cooperation between their adherents as well as the efforts made by Islamic institutions in Egypt for promoting understanding between various creed adherents inside and outside Egypt. The meeting did not deal with the issue of martyrdom operations.
Recent indicators confirmed that the tax burden on taxpayers lately has reached more than 60% due to the policy of exaggeration and overestimation adopted by some tax officers lest they should be accused of siding with taxpayers or accepting bribes from them.
It transpired that Al-Gammal had sent more than one official memo to the World Bank and the donor countries accusing the Government of placing restrictions on his dealings with the funds offered Egypt by countries and international institutions through the fund, adding that Dr Atef Ebeid restricted his freedom regarding spending such funds through laying down strict controls for that issue and preventing him from taking any decision to cash any sum exceeding LE50 thousand without referring to him beforehand.

PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE: LE860 ANNUAL COST OF EDUCATING A STUDENT
THE FIGURES SPEAK: STATE LANDS IN THE HANDS OF BUSINESSMEN
Talaat Mostafa got 1550 feddans of land to build Rehab City in the new communities beside getting 315 feddans in Sheikh Zayed City and 221 feddans in Shorouq City.
Farid Khamis got 3.5 million square metres in the Red Sea region to build a tourist project at investment costs of one billion pounds while Wagih Hanna got 1.5 million square metres to build the Abu Soma Centre project in the Red Sea at costs of one billion pounds and Mohamed Abul-Enein got 13 million square metres in the Gulf of Suez.
Abul-Enein says that the situation is different in the area of industrial development because that field requires infrastructure of a special kind in electricity, water, and gas. The state cannot complete the building of such infrastructure because of the high costs involved.
About the fate of the lands distributed Abul-Enein says that three groups of businessmen have returned the land in full to the government while the others gave up half their lands. About 53 plants were built in the Gulf of Suez that were linked to the names of businessmen like Sawiris, Mohmamed Farid Khamis, or Abul-Enein. He pointed out that he built an industrial complex for the production of ceramics in Suez while Farid built at a petrochemicals plant.
It was expected that the referral to trail decision would be passed immediately especially as the investigations had lasted for almost 7 months before they were officially announced. Public opinion is therefore, burning with desire to see the law taking revenge on those defendants if they proved to be guilty. Delay, however, gave the chance to malicious rumours that tried to cover the whole case, and then, sometimes were rude enough to claim that the whole matter would lead to nothing.
President Mubarak, therefore, sided with local production, but official importers got round the President's decision and started importing steel pipes from the French Pontamayson, which is highly influential!
The corruption case, however, soon exploded and all the company's officials were sent to prison of appeal and the company almost stopped operation. Hushed reports now indicate a tendency to sell Al Nasr Company for Castings after it and its officials have been exposed as if it were an estate run by Dr Abdel-Wahab for his own personal interest!
ISRAELI WEAPON DEALS TO INDIA & MILITARY COOPERATION WITH CHINA RESUMED

The male birthrate exceeds that of the female by 79 children, while the female birthrate always exceeds that of the male by 1-2%, which is a natural percentage worldwide, he added, pointing out that there is an obvious increase in the giving of birth to twins in Gaza, the last of which was a woman that gave birth to a triplet after she had given birth to twins. She has, therefore, five children in two batches.
MOHAMED AL-DURRAH'S MOTHER IS WITH CHILD "A GIFT TO SHARON"
They are making atomic bombs, but we are producing more Intifada men. Hardly is one of them martyred when another takes over."
Resistance leaders say that the unification of Palestinian security services in four agencies responsible to one person is a scheme whose practical concept was concocted by Ariel Sharon and which is aimed at hunting down the resistance, bringing armed operations to a halt, effecting a state of disarmament and preventing provocation, i.e. doing what the Americans are now doing in Afghanistan.
Islamic factions have rejected the American proposal so far. They believe that the project of the Palestinian state that President George Bush has talked about is ambiguous and draws no specific line for the end of the path. It appears that Bush's talk is just aimed at appeasing, or is just talk without real content and is not different from that of Ariel Sharon.
I asked him to give names, and he replied, "Unfortunately, the corruption is so big than it cannot be described by mentioning names. It might be easier if we talked about the few clean-handed people who are not corrupt.
Khalid Mash'al reiterated the motto of the Islamic movements, which is "So long as there is occupation, there will be resistance. If the occupation ends, the resistance will end." He gave me reasons for the continuation of resistance, saying, "First, the resistance can renew itself and regain its strength.
"Fourth, resistance is no longer a monopoly for Islamic factions. A fair competition over struggle that has been honed by the experiment of last month now exists.
The enemy has been hurt bad several times, and we do not fear him." Finally, brother Khalid Mash'al said that Hamas would not participate in a national unity government to stop the resistance, but would remain ready to enter into a unified, joint Palestinian leadership that worked on a clear basis. "The objective is ending the occupation, and the means to attain is resistance," he said.
The American envoy cited President Bush's confirmation of Washington's seriousness to "try to find a formula to launch the peace process and offer hope to the region's peoples", adding that a political solution is possible and will be based on the referentiality of Madrid and the Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 as well as the land-for-peace principle.
He added that control of the newly captured position reinforced the government's control over several oil-production areas, including Edrayil, the second largest oil-production site in the whole country.
Economists told Asharq Al-Awsat that such decisions would make great breakthrough in the drinking water, post and railway sectors' projects. However, they require investments of hundreds of billions of riyals. They will open the door in the future to domestic and foreign investments in oil, gas and oil prospection sectors, which are now considered closed before such companies, they said.
The report, which was issued by the committee on the reconciliation and treatment of revenge cases affiliated to the Shura Council, said that vengeance cases exclusively concentrated on three peripheral provinces in addition to the countryside of Sanaa province.
It is noteworthy that arms are extensively spread in Yemen.
A candidate for elections in Al-Raml constituency in Alexandria surprisingly lodged a lawsuit, calling for cancelling the expected elections there, a couple of weeks ahead of the electoral battle.
The date was fixed following a series of 18-month judicial battles by the Muslim Brotherhood represented by its two candidates Mrs. Jihan al-Halafawi and al-Mohamdy al-Sayed since elections in the ward were suspended in October 2000 A state of waiting and caution has started to prevail among the Muslim Brotherhood, awaiting what the case to be examined by Alexandria Administrative Judiciary Court next Thursday (June 20) will bring. Meanwhile, Isa called for abrogating the interior minister's decision on setting a date for the elections among all the 26 candidates, reiterating that the decision to call voters to cast their ballots is null and void for this decision should be made by the president of the republic as the call for general elections is decided by the president according to the constitution and law on exercise of political rights, even though complementary elections are carried out upon a decision from the interior minister.
A popular conference has also been held in Al-Azhar, participated in by symbols from various popular and political forces in Egypt.
Diplomatic sources told Al-Hayat that the visit Turkish President, Ahmed Nagdat Caesar would pay to Tehran next Monday would coincide with some attempts made by Ankara to coordinate efforts with Iran and Syria against any scenario to set up a Kurdish state in north Iraq.
Turkish sources expect the visit to result in leaps in bilateral relations.
Caesar will announce in Tehran his support of president Mohamed Khatemi and the reforms he is undertaking in a gesture to supporting the reformists against the conservative trend.
The Dutch interior minister on Friday called for penalizing mosque imams who condemn U.S. President George W. Bush's bias towards Israel against the Palestinian people.
KUWAIT DIVESTS ITSELF OF DIRECT INVESTMENTS ON INTERNATIONAL MARKETS
He added, "The process proceeded excellently, but there were other issues that had to be arranged.
Kuwait was among the leading countries which thought about investing its reserve since the 1950's. It agreed with the British government to open an investment office in London which provides a special legal status to its investment activities. Kuwait will celebrate the 50th anniversary of launching the office next year.
POWELL TO AL HAYAT: WE'RE FOR A "TRANSITIONAL STATE" AS A STEP TO THE STATE OF PALESTINE
He emphasized that the conference would deal with the security, political and economic-human tracks together and "in parallel".
A DUBIOUS PLAN IN WASHINGTON
Secondly, Haaretz newspaper diplomatic correspondent talked about the features of the American ideas in an elaborate report published two days ago. He said that the peace conference proposed to be held in Turkey in the middle of next month under American-European auspices would call for Israeli withdrawal to the borders of 1967 in return for comprehensive and complete normalization and removal of settlements in return for omitting the right of return for 6 million Palestinian refugees.
Fifthly, Israeli incursions and sweeps in the West Bank have become an ordinary matter that elicit no protest from any Arab or foreign leader. It has become no business of anybody to ask about the suffering of three million Palestinians facing hunger, humiliation, indignities, arrests and killings piecemeal, which suggests that such silence is deliberately meant to bring the Palestinian people to their knees and prepare them for accepting any settlement in order to get out of their current trial.
The current American Administration has only one perspective through which it sees the situation - security - and the anti-Islamic terrorism issue has become of top priority to it which decides the size of its alliances with Arab countries.
What is needed is holding Presidential and parliamentary Palestinian elections at first in order to choose a new authority, a new leadership that enjoys the confidence and support of the Palestinian people. It is only then that it can negotiate on their behalf. Other options would border on treachery, selling of the Palestinian cause dirt cheap, which would be unforgivable either to this people or all other Arab and Islamic peoples.
Bush contacted Sharon who, in turn, rejected the Egyptian proposals, calling for holding an unconditional meeting with Mubarak.
"We hope that this step will be executed next October at most," he said, pointing out that Egypt exerted many efforts to strike its name off the list of the countries that don't cooperate in combatting money laundering. Among these efforts is the issuance of an independent law that criminalizes these illegal operations and pursues them, if any.
Abul-Oyoon said the delegation familiarized the members of the group with the steps taken by Egypt since it was listed among the non-cooperative countries in May 2001 up till now.
Egyptian economists and bankers voiced their resentment of not removing Egypt's name from the list of uncooperative countries in the field of combatting money laundering issued by an international institution which is responsible for that sector in different countries.
Commenting on the decision of the institution, former head of Banks Union Mohamed Abdel-Aziz told Asharq Al-Awsat that impeding removing Egypt's name from the list of uncooperative countries in the field of money laundering is considered a continuation of the foreign pressure on Egypt, pointing out that banks adopted several measures to prevent money laundering cases. One of these measures is the principle of "Identify your Client" which has been generalized in the other financial sectors including insurance.
A bank official said that due to those losses, the general assembly in its recent meeting asked that the bank capital be reduced to LE22.4 million and then increased through new stocks from old shareholders as a step towards structural reform.
If the capital increases kept within the prescribed quotas for individual banks, the board will stay as it is unaltered unless there is a change in the quotas for then the board of directors will have to be altered in accordance with the new contributions.

Head of Banque Misr Dr. Baha' Helmi explained that 19.8 billion pounds worth of those facilities were extended to industrial projects in foreign currency in order to ease the importation of their needs of equipment, raw materials and intermediate commodities.
Former minister of industry and technological development Dr. Mostafa Al-Refai emphasized that there should be technical bodies affiliated to banks in order to study and evaluate industrial projects and enjoy dealing with related governmental bodies and entities, which have a large amount of information through the industrial map that includes an inventory of the existing industrial installations (20,000 in number).
INDUSTRY MINISTER: EGYPTIAN BANKS UNQUALIFIED TO SERVE INDUSTRY
The Supreme Council for Industrial Coordination has been formed, he said, pointing out that it included the Ministry of Military Production, Arab Organization for Industrialization and the Ministry of Industry and would comprise the ministries of finance and planning later on.

The Holding Company for Engineering Industries general assembly will be held today (June 27th) under the chairmanship of Minister of Public Enterprise Sector, Dr Mokhtar Khatab.
Minister of Public Enterprise Sector Mokhtar Khattab said Egypt's spinning and weaving industry would see a great boom in the coming five years as exports are expected to increase three times and a half as many as the current figure. Next year, these exports are forecast to rise by 15 percent and then 30 or 40 percent annually in the following years, he said.
The latest report of the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics said that the value of Egyptian exports rose from LE4.418 billion during the period from January to March in 2001 to reach LE5.241 billion during the same period this year 2002, a rise of 18.6%.
Chairman of the statistics Agency emphasized that on the other hand, there was a retreat in our imports of some goods during the same period. Our imports of timber and its works declined from LE533.1 million to 494.9 million, a decline of 7.2%; petroleum products imports from LE783.1 million to LE416.2 million a decline of 46.9%; different types of alloys in elementary forms from LE405.7 million to LE335.1 million, a decline of roughly 17.4%.

The decline hit roughly 50 percent in the first six months of this fiscal year 2001-2002.
Foreign investments far from the Egyptian stock exchange retreated by 45 percent hitting 260 million U.S. dollars last year in lieu of 472 million U.S. dollars in the previous year.
Meanwhile, domestic debts rose up to around 246 billion pounds on account of governmental borrowing of around 30 billion pounds from general and commercial banks last year.
STD Chairman Mahmoud Mohamed said a package of facilities has been in place, including the cancellation of compensations given in such cases equalling the value of the the tax and the possible payment of taxes through monthly instalments. All lawsuits filed by the STD against the companies and individuals will be withdrawn, if they pay taxes without compensation, he said. The STD will also be reconciled with those who sued it in exchange for cancelling such cases and paying tax dues, he added.
THE CABINET ARE CONSIDERING APPLYING COMPULSORY INSURANCE ON 4 MILLION EGYPTIAN EXPATRIATES
Decision To Impose Dumping Charges On Syrian Yarn Stayed The Minister of Foreign Trade, Dr Youssef Boutros Ghali, issued a decision for staying the implementation of a previous decision to initiate the imposition of dumping charges on Syrian yarn, which had been passed in the wake of several complaints by local companies that they had been damaged by these exports as a result of the unfair competition created by their sale at prices that were lower than original prices.
In addition, there is a plan to be implemented in the FY 2002/2003 to replace and renovate the electricity grids feeding the sectors of production, services, and housing in the cities and villages that have been earlier supplied with electricity.
He explained that all the equipment and input of the program would be produced by the sister companies of the electricity sector and the investment companies in order to broaden the use of the local product.

Premier Atef Ebeid stressed the government's commitment to raising the efficiency of services rendered to the public, and rendering these services at reasonable prices that suit all brackets of society. This came in his meeting with the National Planning Institute's professors and experts. In the last twenty years the state has spent LE393 billion on renewing and developing infrastructure and services, the premier added, pointing out that the government still needs hundreds of billions during the coming years for developing these services as electricity sector needs LE92 billion and education sector needs LE100 billion only for developing schools.

These operations, he said, are scheduled to come to an end next September as a prelude to completing the first stage and starting its experimental operations next April with an annual capacity of 1.1 billion cubic meters to Jordan to be increased to 3.5 billion cubic meters by 2013.
In light of this conditional offer, any change taking place in the net debts and commitments on implementation would result in a different value of stocks.
Egypt's investment commodity imports declined by 391.5 million pounds to hit 1.8 billion pounds during the first three months of the year running compared with the same period last year, a fall of 17.5%. Finished commodity exports amounted to some 1.4 billion pounds, a rise of 171.7 million pounds during the reporting period.

The monthly Economic Bulletin issued by the Centre of Information affiliated to the Cabinet said that a slight decline of the pound against the dollar of about 0.1% took place last month. In the meantime, the pound value went down against the euro by about 5.6%, which led to a rise in the price of the euro from 406 piastres for selling and buying at the beginning of circulation operations on the exchange market at the beginning of this year to reach 428 piastres for selling and 426.5 piastres for buying during last week only.
Following long consideration by the government as well as pressures from donor bodies to transfer the affiliation of public economic bodies to the National Investment Bank (a public bank affiliated to the Ministry of Finance) after they had been affiliated to the government which had born about LE38 billion of their debts within the public debt item and retained 6 economic bodies which it regarded as strategic necessities.
What encouraged Dr. Atef Ebeid's government to do so was the expected growth in governent bills and bonds markets, which would have a special secondary market in September. This move will also give a change to some fiscal settlements and secure the state needs of domestic liquidity especially as the quota of bills and bonds is the biggest among the domestic public debt components (about LE140 billion against LE107 billion for the government loans from National Investment Bank).
This was said by Minister of Electricity and Energy, Hassan Younis and head of Egypt Electricity Holding Company's general assembly.
Banking sources uncovered that the Government was exerting pressure on the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) and banks to convince them of decreasing the monetary reserve on deposits from 14% to 12% with a view to granting the banks more flexibility in the field of credit, thus entering into new projects that could activate the market and liberalize some liquidity exceeding 6.2 billion pounds due to the decreasing of the rate of monetary reserve on banking deposits by 2% as the total deposits with the CBE at present exceed 310 billion pounds.
In addition, the instability of the lending rate will negatively impact on the investment field and the ability to attract fresh investments, in addition to lessening the domestic saving rates which the Government is trying to increase to 25% so as to achieve a growth rate in the State public budget hitting 6%.
Some importers uncovered that banks had raised credit opening fees from 2% to 6%.
Over the past few days, the local exchange market witnessed a shift in the field of speculation in foreign currencies. Speculation brisked up in the euro, pound sterling and Swiss franc after it had been restricted to the dollar.
The euro exchange rate averaged 452 piastres for buying and 460 piastres for selling in banks while the rate in the unofficial market exceeded 485 piasters.
Explaining why there is high demand for European currencies, he said that there were many reasons mainly including the remarkable rise in the euro against the US dollar and the enormous transactions between Egypt and European Union countries.
He pointed out that the euro became a high profit-making currency particularly as there were strong expectations that the euro would continue to go up. Citibank, a major international bank, expected that the euro would exceed the US dollar.
The foreign cash reserve funds amount now to some 13.7 billion dollars including 85% investments in the US dollar and 15% in other currencies. Most of them are in the euro and pound sterling. Therefore, there is no fear for the CBE foreign reserve investments of dollar decline against the euro.
Therefore, it has become dangerous now to buy the euro and make investments in it through reserve funds as the international market has not stabilised yet given the over-6%-rise in the euro against the dollar and the upturn of euro that started about three weeks ago. The purchase of euros now means burdening foreign cash reserve with a larger cost and loss of profits that would be achieved if the basket of reserve was varied and euro was introduced in large amounts about four or five months ago.
The Egyptian Export Development Bank is one of the banks that have credit ceiling with the Arab Trade Program as relations started between them in 1980 with a credit line valued at 8 million dollars, which rose to 15 million dollars.

The report pointed out a remarkable increase in the domestic credit by 30.5 billion pounds at a rate of 9.5% during the period from July 2001 to March 2002. This is ascribed to the noticeable increase in the credit granted to the private sector which amounted to 16.8 billion pounds at a rate of 9.4%, thus taking its debts to the banks up to 195.3 billion pounds or 55.4% of the total domestic credit by the end of March 2002. Meanwhile, there is an increase in the credit granted to the governmental sector standing at 4.9 billion pounds against 20.2 billion pounds during the period in comparison.
The report highlighted the stability witnessed in the foreign currencies during the reporting period and the continuous stability of the lending and deduction rates at 11% till the end of May 2002. Interest rates on deposits and loans were stable during the last six months, as the interest rate on the deposits hovered between 9.47% and 9.57% annually for three months, while the interest rate on deposits ranged between 9.50% and 9.64% annually for six months and between 9.46% and 9.57% annually for one year.

This is attributed to a deficit in the trade balance by 27.5% as a result of the retreat in the payments against imports by 21.1% and against exports by 13% due to the retreat of the petroleum exports. The balance of services registered a retreat of 42.8% due to the retreat in the investment revenues by 61.6% and travelling proceeds (tourism) at a rate of 22.3% in comparison to the reporting period of the last fiscal year.

Minister of Industry and Technological Development Dr. Ali Al-Saidi emphasized that the Egyptian banks are unqualified to serve industry barring three banks mainly including the Industrial Development Bank (IDB).
Al-Saidi stressed that 65% of the capacities of mills and rice mills are not exploited. These mills are being counted up and a schedule is being set to develop them through locally produced machinery and equipment.

A report of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) a few days ago monitored an increasing flight of foreign investments from Egypt by 300 percent.
Foreign financial aid nosedived 160 million U.S. dollars, or 20 percent, last year due to the government failure to use huge amounts of foreign grants allocated for the government.

MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS CRITICIZES CALL FOR BOYCOTTING US PRODUCTS
Opposition blocs at the Egyptian parliament announced their opposition to the state draft budget, development drive and new five-year plan just a few hours before the parliamentary session on the drafts on Monday.

The lawsuit filed by the committee chairman Dr Moustafa Kamal Helmi against the Islamic Labour Party was based on the pretext that the latter had modified its platform and goals according to which it had been founded without notifying the committee in accordance with the law provisions.

WILL THE GOVERNMENT RAISE THE OFFICIAL DOLLAR RATE OF EXCHANGE TO FIVE POUNDS?
The most serious question so far directed at the Atef Ebeid government since it was formed is this: Egypt has over the last six years obtained 35 billion dollars from foreign countries, banks, and institutions in the form of grants and loans in implementation of 628 agreements with these quarters.
These loans and grants total more than 35 billion dollars. Egypt obtained these funds in implementation of 628 agreements.
$1.2 BILLION INVESTMENTS OF COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECTORS
To elaborate, out of a total of 6 million lines, the current usage only hits 10 percent, the report said. Last year, the new lines increased by 25 percent. So, the Government expects this sector to be an important source for investment, employment and income. To prove the priority given by the Government to this sector, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology has been set up in 1999 to lay down a national plan for communications and information technology with a view to developing this sector.
The current available growth rates point out that competition between the two cellular phone companies could be boosted especially as a third company is about to provide the same service. This will make both of them concentrate on increasing the number of subscribers through providing more innovated and improved products at more competitive prices.
The deregulation of the mobile phone sector showed the importance of competition as Telecom Egypt's revenues, for instance, hiked by 25 percent because another company has set up a new network without much cost. Telecom Egypt managed to overcome the sharp decrease of the international tariff, the report noted.
Smart Village The report pointed out that the IT exports totaled 50 million dollars last year. The Government seeks to increase them to 1 billion dollars. To attain this end, the Government started to set up the Smart Village project. It laid down the infrastructure required by communications and IT companies and allocated many free technological zones in which the price per square meter hits one dollar.
SHARON MULLS OVER EXPELLING ARAFAT TO CYPRUS
Sharon regards that his new idea to arrest the Palestinian leader and transfer him to Cyprus by air is a renunciation of his previous idea to assassinate him and a compromise which rules out the use of violence, the advisors added. The fresh thought invented by Sharon will also be largely seconded by both Israeli and U.S. public opinions and pave the way for restructuring the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), hence, returning to the negotiating table, they added.
The conferees called for decisively rejecting and confronting the American threats to Iraq, insisting on the necessity of immediately raising the blockade imposed on it and cancelling all that might threaten its sovereignty. They also called for cancelling the so-called no-fly zones in the north and south of Iraq and supporting the Iraqi steadfastness with all possible governmental and popular means.
Water analyzed in 1953 contained tritium units, ranging between 13 and 15 units, and has started to contain more units since the 1970s, prompting an Egyptian study to reach the reasons for the increase of this element in subterranean water in the geological layers of the Eocene period, he said.
Yesterday, The Egyptian Government denied any possibilities of the Israeli Intelligence Agency (Mossad) penetrating the ranks of Egyptian scientists inside or outside the country.
State Minister for Foreign Affairs, Fayza Abul-Naga regarded the call for boycotting the American products as a position that could do harm to the Egyptian economy.
The rightist, leftist and Nasserite blocs agreed to announce their opposition to the drafts, while some of the 17 Muslim Brotherhood members voted against the drafts and some others abstained. Abstention gave the latter the right to mention their abstention reasons.

The campaign was regarded by the official circles as a heresy and religious incitement campaign, which led to violent clashes between students and the police, created a political crisis, division inside the party and a dispute over its leadership.
In the same sitting the court decided to turn down the foundation of a new party entitled "Al-Tarabut Al-Arabi" (Arab Solidarity), on the pretext that its platform is not different from other existent parties' platforms, as a new party should be according to law provisions.
On the other hand, the news was met with angry reactions from the Copts especially those in the lawyers milieus. Lawyer, Naguib Gebrail said, "We're worried about the implications of that ruling which the Copts reject especially as their wounds had not healed yet. We'd rather such a ruling have been delayed in the current conditions when national unity needs commenting especially as that newspaper's chief editor is also its owner. Naguib Gebrail pointed out that he had filed a lawsuit requesting that the ruling be reconsidered as it can not be appealed against.
A statistic by the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics said that the Egyptian factories had produced 53 billion cigarettes in the year 2002; a rise of 2 billion cigarettes over 1999.

The move will help reduce the state subsidy of these projects, inject new investments far from the state budget, and use technology and modern management systems.
There is a belief prevailing among a number of economic, security, and political circles that the current stability in the rate of exchange of the pound against the dollar is brittle. It has come as a result of security and administrative measures and as a result of the restriction of imports particularly of consumer goods and not as a result of increased resources of foreign currency through the development of exports and the improvement of the country's economic competitiveness relying on Egyptian materials and input.
Where did this money go?
Egypt got 59.2% of these funds in the period from 1995 to 30 June, 2000 when the CAA conducted its follow up.
Contrary to the Egyptian economy as a whole, communications and information technology (IT) sector are witnessing a rapid growth, as the new investments in the communications sectors hit over 5 billion pounds (1.2 billion dollars) last year. As for the investments pumped into the IT sector, they hit 250 million pounds, according to a report specialized in the investment atmosphere in Egypt issued by the Consultation Agency for Arab Communications.
The first step taken by the ministry was the deregulation of this sector in 1998 when the mobile phone service branch at Telecom Egypt was privatized and sold to French, Egyptian and American investors.
Liberalization of communications sector The aforementioned step was followed by a major one, i.e, liberalization of the communications sector through the fixed lines and denationalization of Telecom Egypt with the target of enhancing its competitiveness in a liberalized atmosphere, as the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology planned in 2000 to put up the company's stocks for sale at the Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchange so as to procure funds required for filling the technological gap in its network and enhance the poor productivity that ensued from untrained workforce that receive low wages. However, the negative circumstances witnessed by the domestic as well as the international markets especially as far as the retreat of the international communications companies' stocks were concerned together with their high rates of expenditure on developing a third generation of mobile phones put off the Ministry's plans sine die. Telecom Egypt, nevertheless, is currently urging an anchor investor to purchase a big strategic quota in the company.
Tackling the current position, the report highlighted that the Government had become convinced that Egypt had been qualified to be a pivot for the IT field in the Middle East due to its geographical location amid the optic fibers network that links the Middle East with other world countries.
IRAN ENHANCES "ISLAMIC JIHAD" BUDGET AND EARMARKS FINANCIAL AID TO PALESTINIANS
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's close advisors said after U.S. President George W. Bush turned down Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's proposal to set a timetable for declaring the Palestinian state, Sharon would seek to prevail on Bush to force Arafat to go into exile, possibly to Cyprus in their bilateral talks at the White House on Monday. But this information contradicted reports in Tel Aviv on Sunday. Sharon's talks in the U.S. have been the sixth since he assumed power.

ISRAEL DUMPS DIMONA REACTOR WASTE NEAR EGYPTIAN BORDERS: EGYPTIAN WATER EXPERT
He said he collected all relevant researches and those closely related to nuclear reactors, their waste and isotopes and concluded that Israel focussed in its studies on a certain area in Negev Desert. Israel carried out over 500 researches on the area. Trying to hide this fact, it did not mention in its several studies that the reasons are due to the Dimona nuclear reactor. But, when satellite photos were deeply studied, the Egyptian expert accurately posted the position of the reactor, which, he said, is just 65 km south of the Egyptian borders.
In his reply to MP Ali El-Refai who lashed out at the government for disregarding the research papers of Egyptian scientists before the Parliament, Minister of People's Assembly and Shura Council Affairs, Kamal Al-Shazli said that Egypt by no means agrees that the patriotism of Egyptian scientists should be suspected or distrusted or that it should be reported that the results of their researches end up in the hands of the Mossad.
In response to a question about her estimation of some Egyptian quarters adopting the call for boycotting lists of American products, she said those moves do not serve Egypt's interests. Justifying her stand, she said that such products contain materials that are produced in Egypt. "Hundreds of Egyptians work at such projects and, therefore, the boycott will do harm to the Egyptian raw materials and input that are used in producing such commodities. It will also make the rates of unemployment among Egyptians who work at such restaurants and companies hike."
The new year's state draft budget, if passed, will aggravate poverty through increasing commodity and service prices with illusory rises in pay, they said.
EXAMINATION OF LABOUR PARTY CASE PUT OFF TILL AUTUMN
An administrative decree was therefore passed freezing its activity and suspending the issuance of its organ.
The examination of 3 other lawsuits to found new parties has also been postponed - Al-Sharia, Al-Nil and Mubarak Al-Nahda in addition to another lawsuit demanding that Ibrahim Shukri not be recognized as Labour Party leader.
Furthermore, before the ruling had been pronounced , St Mark Episcopate Patriarch and Pope of Alexandria, Pope Shenouda III had stated that he was not sure how the Copts would react if the court ruled that the newspaper should be republished adding that he would not comment on the ruling whatever it was. Had that ruling been pronounced by any other court whose rulings could be revoked, the church could have appealed against it, but the ruling ,however, was pronounced by the Supreme Administrative Court, the highest judicial body whose rulings are irrevocable. We are contented that in the whereases of the ruling, the court condemned the newspaper's report. The sources added that he wished the newspaper's officials would not return to their old practices of publishing pornography or sexual scandals no matter what religion the citizen embraced.
Another statistic on total expenditure on food, drink and tobacco in February, 2002 indicated that border governorates spent the most on cigarettes which consumed 7.4% of that total.

He added that the goal behind setting up such a university was to enhance the common grounds between Muslims and Christians in Egypt.
A new organizational sectorial agency under the Ministry of Housing and Public Utilities is also to be established to monitor the technical, financial and economic aspects in order to protect consumers and attain high technical and health quality, taking the social dimension into consideration.
Because all foreign circles, from the American the trade representative to the IMF and the World Bank and the assessment organizations and the representatives of the donor nations, do not stop exerting pressure to push the government to further "liberation" of the exchange rate, the Egyptian decision makers have become convicted of the need to take a step in that direction to preserve their "good" relations with these quarters.
This really serious question is directed at the Atef Ebeid government from the Central Auditing Agency (CAA) which is a major control organ.
The CAA revealed that amendments have been introduced to the Egyptian-American agreement on a category entitled "cash transfer grants". Egypt got a total of three billion dollars under this category placed in a special account with the Central Bank of Egypt by the Ministry of Finance.
According to the report, the communications sector achieved a growth rate of 22 percent. The State-owned communications company (Telecom Egypt) achieved a growth rate of 17 percent. The number of subscribers to MobiNil and Click Vodafone hiked by 146 percent, while the two companies' revenues have also increased by almost the same percentage.
Other parts were sold to Click which is another financial federation to which Vodafone is considered the main contributor. The IT sector was liberalized in 2000, thus decreasing the fees of subscribing to the Internet from hundreds of dollars monthly to almost free of charge access at present.
Commenting on the postponement of putting Telecom Egypt up for privatization, minister of communications and information technology said that the company would not be floated at any price thanks to the company's good financial position. Telecom Egypt is considered one of the strongest communications companies in the Middle East, as there is no communications company in the region that has 6 million fixed lines, the minister said, stressing that the company is not hasty to take a privatization decision for it is just a practical decision.
In addition, Egypt has the largest number of university graduates, most of its population are youths and has low-wage rates.
Asharq Al-Awsat learnt that Iran had decided to enhance its financial aid to some organizations that object to Israeli -Palestinian peace and to earmark a special budget to some Palestinians who had lost their organization's financial sources. A source close to Iranian Revolutionary Guard said that the leader of Islamic Jihad movement, Ramadan Shalah had met with Iranian Guide, Ali Khameni, last week and received promises that his movement's budget would be separated from Lebanese Hezbollah party's budget. A 70% increase in its budget would also be introduced to meet the expenses of mobilizing Palestinian youths for suicidal operations. Last year, some differences between the financial officials of Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad had urged Jihad movement leaders to ask that their budget be made at their leadership's direct disposal.

A highly placed delegation headed by Dr. Abul-Oyoon paid a visit to France mid last week to hold intensive meetings with the members of the IFWG ahead of the regular meeting of the group and persuade them that there are no money laundering operations in Egypt and that the international standards in this regard are applied.
EGYPT RESENTS NOT BEING STRUCK OFF UNCOOPERATIVE MONEY LAUNDERING COUNTRIES LIST
The sources added that although the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) had held important talks with the institution late last month in Paris to clarify the Egyptian banking and financial department position of that cause, and to confirm that the Egyptian banks are void of the names included in lists sent by that institution to the Egyptian Government, the institution announced its refusal to eliminate Egypt's name of the list of uncooperative countries in the area of combatting money laundering operations, overloading Egypt with more demands to strike off Egypt's name of the list within 3-month period of grace. The demands included the establishment of a special unit with the CBE to monitor money laundering operations, speeding up the issuance of the executive statute of the law passed by the parliament and taking the necessary measures for its implementation in insurance and Egyptian capital market sectors.
In the last years, Al Tegareyoon Bank incurred losses that amounted to LE183,422,570, a rate of 89.07% of its capital, thus bringing that capital of LE205,911,450 down to LE22,488,880 or the rate of 11% of its capital before incurring the losses.

For his part, head of the Industrial Development Bank Abdel-Hamid Basal said the capital of his bank cannot afford to provide the necessary finance for megaprojects, calling for taking the capital up to 500 million pounds at least so that it can play its role perfectly.
He demanded that industries produce industrial components that integrate with the existing industries and be related to advanced industries like those of Southeast Asia.
He explained that an integrated body with the ministry of industry would be established to serve businessmen, tackle their problems and find swift solutions to them in coordination with the concerned ministries.
"Most research centers tend towards mere research rather than technology.

Lawyer, Naguib Gebrail said, "We're worried about the implications of that ruling which the Copts reject especially as their wounds had not healed yet.

There is a belief prevailing among a number of economic, security, and political circles that the current stability in the rate of exchange of the pound against the dollar is brittle. It has come as a result of security and administrative measures and as a result of the restriction of imports particularly of consumer goods and not as a result of increased resources of foreign currency through the development of exports and the improvement of the country's economic competitiveness relying on Egyptian materials and input.
Where did this money go?
Egypt got 59.2% of these funds in the period from 1995 to 30 June, 2000 when the CAA conducted its follow up.
Contrary to the Egyptian economy as a whole, communications and information technology (IT) sector are witnessing a rapid growth, as the new investments in the communications sectors hit over 5 billion pounds (1.2 billion dollars) last year. As for the investments pumped into the IT sector, they hit 250 million pounds, according to a report specialized in the investment atmosphere in Egypt issued by the Consultation Agency for Arab Communications.
The first step taken by the ministry was the deregulation of this sector in 1998 when the mobile phone service branch at Telecom Egypt was privatized and sold to French, Egyptian and American investors.
Liberalization of communications sector The aforementioned step was followed by a major one, i.e, liberalization of the communications sector through the fixed lines and denationalization of Telecom Egypt with the target of enhancing its competitiveness in a liberalized atmosphere, as the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology planned in 2000 to put up the company's stocks for sale at the Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchange so as to procure funds required for filling the technological gap in its network and enhance the poor productivity that ensued from untrained workforce that receive low wages. However, the negative circumstances witnessed by the domestic as well as the international markets especially as far as the retreat of the international communications companies' stocks were concerned together with their high rates of expenditure on developing a third generation of mobile phones put off the Ministry's plans sine die. Telecom Egypt, nevertheless, is currently urging an anchor investor to purchase a big strategic quota in the company.
Tackling the current position, the report highlighted that the Government had become convinced that Egypt had been qualified to be a pivot for the IT field in the Middle East due to its geographical location amid the optic fibers network that links the Middle East with other world countries.

The sum paid to foreign companies in hard currency which is expected to reach about $100 million this year is considered losses incurred by national economy due to the insistence of foreign companies to collect it in dollars in accordance with the contracts concluded by the government with foreign companies, which make it incumbent upon Egypt to buy quotas of electric stations production.

THE VATICAN AS AN OBSERVER MEMBER IN THE ARAB LEAGUE
AN EARLY START OF ELECTION STRUGGLE IN JORDAN
More than one remark can be registered regarding the margin of Al-Magali's activities which have created a sensation in the last couple of years due to an undeclared rupture between him and the Prime Minister, Ali Aboul-Raghib. The man had met the King at a lunch feast and then met the Premier at a dinner feast. Prior to that, a series of meetings was held in the city of Al-Karak to which Al-Magali belonged, where statements were issued calling for Al-Magali contesting the next elections in reply to impractical speculations that the officialdom was not keen on Al-Magali playing further roles in the coming period.
Al-Magali, consequently, opened fire quite early on the Islamists without identifying them while getting ready for public elections with centrist trends elites, linking his call for putting the internal home in order to forcing the minority which he described as noisily dominating the Jordanian street.
What is most important for Islamists is to avoid gaining absolute majority in any public elections especially in the foggy regional stages that require severe capitulations in the peace process. The Islamic trend has often proved that he is averse to any partnership with the government in any stage that involves any capitulations in principle. This is exactly why that trend boycotted the 1997 elections, thus forcing the regime, on the other hand, to ignore the Islamists.
Q: You are entitled to gaining the majority, nevertheless, aren't you?
Q: What tools do you mean?
Al-Baz ruled out the possibility that the American peace plan would be identical to the Arab point of view as America is not immersed into the Arab-Israeli conflict and the American politicians respond to the Jewish lobby, which is part of the political game and is well recognized in the USA.
Al-Baz stressed that in his recent visit to America President Mubarak asked for urgent measures to stop the siege, the sweep, the destruction and the slaughtering exercised by Israel against the Palestinian people. It is only absurd to talk about stopping violence while Israel is the main violence perpetrators.
He added that matters were gradually moving towards full democracy which needs practising. President Mubarak, furthermore is not afraid of having opponents in the elections as he would not impose himself on the people. Meantime, we have a lot of options especially regarding economic, social, political, and cultural development, he added. Egypt would move from internal development stage to external rivalry which requires a state of stability.

These include, for example, the Suez Canal , according to independent deputy, Ayman Nour.
Item 16, in its second paragraph provided that all property owned by the Egyptian Government except for three particular cases may be security for the dollar bonds holders' rights. The three cases are: property used by Egyptian diplomatic mission or consulate , property which has a sensitive sovereign character and property which is definitely devoted to Government use or public utility and which is distinguishable from other properties devoted to commercial use.

The meeting referentialities will be the international resolutions 242, 338 and 1397 (which approved the establishment of two neighbouring states, Palestine and Israel), as well as the Arab peace initiative which had been announced in the recent Arab summit in Beirut.
On the other hand, well-informed Egyptian sources told Al-Hayat that President Mubarak had informed the American President Bush of an extremely important oral message which he would carry, in turn, to Israel's Premier Sharon warning him against launching any aggression on Gaza Strip.
It was obvious in the Hebrew newspapers that Israel too received elementary information about the content of Bush's statement.
Al-Rantissi brought to mind the fact that the Israeli occupation insisted on violating cease-fire declarations through continuing assassinations, murders, siege and kidnapping.
Regarding the statements made by the American Secretary of State, Colin Powell about the American Administration plan to declare a temporary Palestinian State, Al-Rantissi said that the Palestinian people would not accept any alternative to the establishment of the Palestinian State on the whole Palestinian national soil. The Palestinian people will reject any relinquishment of one inch of the Palestinian territories, he affirmed.
They also told the U.S. Washington Post that the U.S. Navy monitored Israeli tests for a new missile aboard an Israeli sub off Sri Lankan coasts a couple of years ago.
Israel has recently acquired the three submarines from Germany, the sources said.
According to the study, women's increasing involvement in the resistance is ascribed to the Palestinians' general feeling that there is nothing they could lose vis-à-vis murders, massacres, assassinations and destruction operations made by the Israeli army in the past months. This created motives among women for taking part in the resistance and uprising.
Its transmission will reach the Middle East region, Arab Magreb and Europe.

FREE TRADE ZONE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND JORDAN
National Democratic Rally and Peace Society Movement decided to freeze their membership in the National Popular Council, First Chamber of the Algerian Parliament, pending a ruling by the Constitutional Council in the appeals against the legislative elections held on May 30th where National Liberation Front won the majority of seats.
Algerian President Abdel-Aziz Bouteflika on Monday evening announced the new cabinet formation headed by Ali bin Falis, including 20 new ministers.
The post of the spokesman of the government, which was cancelled when Bouteflika took over, has been given to Mrs. Khalida Massudi, who bolted from the barbarian Rally for Culture and Democracy Party, in addition to her post as Minister of Communications and Culture.
The government change carries "undeclared" political messages, mainly including the re-amalgamation of the new generation in responsibility posts, an idea which was not previously seconded by the president, who asked his friends who were former officials to run the strategic sectors. The president has also conceded his power as spokesman of the government, a post which has been awarded to Mrs. Massudi of barbarian origins, who is believed to be able to earn the approval of independent press and residents of Kabylia altogether.
Neither did the water crisis confine itself to the capital, but covered all areas without exception.
The children and the women, therefore, have to wait in long queues and extreme anarchy where only the sinewy can have a say.
Head of the Economic and Social National Council (an advisory body), Mohamed Al-Saleh Mentori, said that he had warned the government against the water crisis for several years but no measures were taken to face it except in the last couple of years and when it was only too late.
When the crisis aggravated, some started to think of other things.
Algerians bitterly wonder, "Why could Libya make such achievement, while we failed to benefit by the subterranean water available in several areas of the country even though one political decree would have proven adequate as was the case with oil and gas pipes at the same areas heading from north to Europe?"
This rise has been the lowest since the issuance of the first report on international wealth, says Michael Marks, Head of Merrill Lynch. "If we take into account the harsh conditions of the money market, we will find out that this growth shows the strength of this sector on the market," he points out.
MEDICINE PRICES ARE EXPECTED TO RISE FOURFOLD IN ARAB WORLD
He sounded the alarm about the impacts of this rise on the Arab patient as well as the Arab pharmaceutical industry, stressing that joint integration and investment in this industry is the only and ideal solution to square up to such dangers. He highlighted the importance of the political will to achieve this goal which serves, in the first place, the interests of the Arab countries and peoples.
Under the above heading, Zuhair Qossibati of Al-Hayat writes an article to say: The Israeli campaign against Lebanon under the cover of "war on terrorism" to the extent that rumours have it that Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri extends donations to Al-Qaeda organization after U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld accused Iran of "exporting Al-Qaeda terrorists" to Bekaa Valley via Damascus, and then claims by diplomatic sources through U.S. press on missile shipments from Tehran to Hezbollah as well as information on the build-up of Iran's Revolutionary Guard forces in Bekaa "in preparation to attack the depth of Israel, possibly within days", mean nothing but boosting sensationalism to give Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon free rein to attack Lebanon.
Syria absorbed the message and thereupon the Farms area was calm for time was not suitable for the Israeli premier who was busy with the "Operation Defensive Wall", a thing which was, of course, put in Israeli-U.S. calculations.
After all what took place under the "Defensive Wall", can anyone in the region rule out another, possible fiercer, round of Sharon's war at another theater, which may take the Lebanese and Syrian tracks to a completely different stage just as the first round, which could encircle the Intifada in the interest of a Palestinian state that will remain just a motto for several years to come?
BUSH SHATTERS SILENCE
Reform is a national Palestinian, not American, request and all Bush's demands were reasonable.
They can accept the results or claim that the Palestinians did not fulfil them and, thus, countdown for the provisional state is contingent upon the good intentions of the U.S. and Israel.
Finally, I can say that Bush's speech is war on Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims.
He added that a programme had been prepared for extending aids to support the economic reform process and modernize the industrial sector in Egypt.
ARABIAN GULF GROUP MULLS OVER INJECTING $2 BILLION INTO EGYPTIAN REAL ESTATE MARKET

He added that the project of the East Gas Pipeline runs in its first stage for 250 kilometres from Al-Arish to Al-Aqaba and then will cross through the Egyptian, and not the Israeli, border line.

Issuing global depository receipts to the Egyptian companies is meant to drag the local companies into the international investment community and markets.
High-level bank sources told Al-Alam Al-Youm that the agreement to be officially and finally signed next week includes disposing of unproductive real estate assets worth 86 million pounds at the Arab Contractors, and returning the contributions of the Arab Contractors to investment or joint companies to banks, which are estimated at around 271 million pounds.

Real estate investors renewed their accusations against chairman of the People's Assembly Plan and Budget Committee and board chairman of Dekheila Iron and Steel Company Ahmed Ezz. In a complaint they put forward to the Chamber of Industries, they affirmed that Ezz is behind the crazy rise in reinforcing iron prices. The ton price rose 450 pounds in less than two months.

The euro exchange rate rose by 60 piasters at a time the dollar exchange rate dwindled noticeably.
This rise resulted from the hike in the dollar exchange rate which, in turn, increased the costs of imports, components, raw materials and production requirements making the companies resort to moving prices, overloading the consumer with all the additional burdens and securing the profit margin.
GRADUAL DECREASE IN GLOBAL DEPOSITORY RECEIPTS
Lakah Group's introduction of 150 million shares with the Stock Exchange was canceled in order that those shares would be circulated in the market outside the trading floor of the bourse.

ECRB WARNS BUSINESSMEN OF SWINDLERS IN UGANDA
The ECRB urged Egyptian businessmen and exporters to brief it beforehand on any dealing with the Ugandan market. Dealings should be restricted to payment in cash or through documentary credits.
This is ascribed to the fact that 40% of our imports comes from the EU in addition to the mark-up of the dollar exchange rate.
"If the importer exchanges his dollars for euros, he will incur losses, so demand for euro increased while demand for dollar backtracked," he said, adding that the euro exchange rate has internationally hiked owing to the tendency to import in euro.
Israeli Security bodies uncovered that they had 27 Palestinian young women who had been arrested since they escalated their military operations at the end of last March as they had been suspected of being candidates for the execution of suicidal bombing operations in Israel.

The Egyptian Government did itself well when it distanced itself, and at an early time too, from the American conspiracy that will soon take shape for all to see. Egypt, as represented by its Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ahmad Maher, rejected the idea of the "temporary state" and made fun of it as a "legal joke" that had no precedent in international relations. However, what is really mind-boggling is the inexplicable official silence of Saudi Arabia, which raises doubts, and suspicions as well.
The Saudi Royal Family wants to repair its image in the United States at the expense of the Palestinian people and its cause, as per the advice of the public relations firms it has hired for that purpose, most of which are Jewish, and to which the Saudis have doled out over half a billion dollars. That is why the Royal Family has been waving the normalization flag and has had some of its princes meet in secret and in public with leaders of Jewish organizations and invite them to visit Riyadh to discuss future cooperation.
The project of the temporary Palestinian state is much more dangerous than the Camp David Accords signed by President Sadat. It is also more dangerous than the Oslo Agreements, because it will establish the occupation and end resistance and the Intifada. It will open the doors wide for normalization of Israeli-Saudi relations, too. Meanwhile, the Palestinian people will not get even the minimum of its rights.
Therefore, it was not surprising that preparations for promoting President Bush's proposal started with a campaign spearheaded by Saudi columnists who wrote about "Al Hudaibia Reconciliation" between Prophet Mohammad and the Infidels of Mecca. This was the same line adopted by President Sadat to prepare for signing the Camp David Accords.
General Turkmeni's visit to Ankara is the first of its kind. Al Hayat learned that the two sides are considering the sale of Turkish weapons systems to Syria and the execution of joint military training exercises.
IRAQ'S SHIITES TO ISSUE DECLARATION IN LONDON, IN PREPARATION FOR POST-SADDAM ERA
The declaration, a copy of which was obtained by Asharq Al Awsat, reviews the Shiites' political history and contributions to the establishment of the modern Iraqi state. It points out that the Shiites were excluded from government from the very start, which marked the beginning of a sectarian discrimination policy that was imposed on Iraq and has been handed down as a rule of government during both the royal and republican eras in Baghdad.
1-Abolition of sectarian discrimination and elimination of the wrong policies that were practiced in the past.
5-Establishment of Iraq's unity in terms of territories, people, sovereignty and entity, within the context of sectarian, religious, nationalist and political multiplicity.
9- Preservation of the Islamic cultural identity of the Iraqi society.
Addressing the gathering, Berri said, "We in Lebanon feel frustrated as the daily Israeli aggressions and incursions into the Palestinian territories have become ordinary routine reports, leaving no reflection or reaction."
DEFENSIVE LINE TO SEPARATE SHEBAA FARMS
Israeli Minister of Regional Cooperation Rone Melu said a free trade zone will be established between Israel and Jordan at the area of Wadi Araba within a few days, Israel Radio reported.
The former majority party boycotted the sitting where Algerian parliament speaker's deputies were installed. It voiced rejection of the return to the one-party system rule in the official establishments, adding that the quota granted to it was not proportionate to its real size on the Algerian political arena, which urged it to freeze its political activity in the First Chamber of Parliament until the announcement of the results of over 70 appeals recently filed by the party to the Constitutional Council.
Asharq Al-Awsat learnt from French defence sources that Paris and Abu Dhabi were seeking to conclude an agreement valued at some billions of euros whereby the UAE would get 6 warships that would be set up by the French C.M.N. Company, which is basically owned by the French businessman of Lebanese origin Iskander Safa.
Algerian President Abdel-Aziz Bouteflika on Monday evening announced the new cabinet formation headed by Ali bin Falis, including 20 new ministers.
The post of the spokesman of the government, which was cancelled when Bouteflika took over, has been given to Mrs. Khalida Massudi, who bolted from the barbarian Rally for Culture and Democracy Party, in addition to her post as Minister of Communications and Culture.
The government change carries "undeclared" political messages, mainly including the re-amalgamation of the new generation in responsibility posts, an idea which was not previously seconded by the president, who asked his friends who were former officials to run the strategic sectors. The president has also conceded his power as spokesman of the government, a post which has been awarded to Mrs. Massudi of barbarian origins, who is believed to be able to earn the approval of independent press and residents of Kabylia altogether.
Neither did the water crisis confine itself to the capital, but covered all areas without exception.
The children and the women, therefore, have to wait in long queues and extreme anarchy where only the sinewy can have a say.
Head of the Economic and Social National Council (an advisory body), Mohamed Al-Saleh Mentori, said that he had warned the government against the water crisis for several years but no measures were taken to face it except in the last couple of years and when it was only too late.
When the crisis aggravated, some started to think of other things.
Algerians bitterly wonder, "Why could Libya make such achievement, while we failed to benefit by the subterranean water available in several areas of the country even though one political decree would have proven adequate as was the case with oil and gas pipes at the same areas heading from north to Europe?"
This rise has been the lowest since the issuance of the first report on international wealth, says Michael Marks, Head of Merrill Lynch.

MEDICINE PRICES ARE EXPECTED TO RISE FOURFOLD IN ARAB WORLD
He sounded the alarm about the impacts of this rise on the Arab patient as well as the Arab pharmaceutical industry, stressing that joint integration and investment in this industry is the only and ideal solution to square up to such dangers. He highlighted the importance of the political will to achieve this goal which serves, in the first place, the interests of the Arab countries and peoples.
Dr Ali Mohammad Fakhru, Chairman of the Custodians Council, Bahrain Centre for Studies and Research, and former cabinet minister, wrote: The Arabs are facing challenges that involve great risks by all measures. These risks can be summarized as follows:
Each and every greater Arab state has failed to solve the problems facing it, including ethnic conflicts, an economy that is unable to shake off its archaic and primitive methods, a financial corruption that is spreading like cancerous tissue, a complete inability to cope with the technology and information revolution and an inability to move to democracy in a peaceful and effective manner without faking votes.
-The Arab street, which had been asleep for long but was jolted awake by Zionist crimes and fear of American follies, not to mention the bitterness of living within the limited capabilities of individual Arab States, is now ready to join such an effort one more time.
The proposed current will not seek to destroy the political systems or government apparatuses of individual Arab States, nor will it obviate the local efforts in the numerous battles against injustice, poverty and ruling regimes. It will only create the tool for solving a stupendous number of outstanding and insoluble issues.
Sharon has already achieved major steps in dealing serious blows to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and the Intifada and may be now ready to take his war to south Lebanon and the U.S. cover is ready too in spite of all reported differences at the recent Bush-Sharon summit.
The seriousness of time differential now appears in the nature of fresh warnings of major Israeli retaliation, which may cover Lebanon once more and Syria if Hezbollah put the depth of the Hebrew state under the mercy of its missiles.
As long as the regional and Arab balance of power is known, crisis results can be expected from preparations made by Sharon in the north ... what actions have been taken to confront him?
The U.S. president did not ask much to achieve the Sharonite peace, but he said briefly:
Bush also attacked Iraq, Iran and Syria, calling for a final peace between Israel, and Lebanon and Syria. But, he said that Syria supports peace and fights terrorism. However, he considered Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah as terrorist groups. Supporting these movements, every Muslim Arab says that these movements were established to fight Israeli terrorism and will remain as long as this terrorism exists.
The speech reflects how much the U.S. Administration is compliant with all Arab visitors' requests, or the aggregate influence of Arab friends and allies on the U.S. Administration.
AND WHAT ARE CONCOMITANT RISKS?
Bush's provisional state preconditions are "new leaders", "new establishments" and "new security arrangements".
The other side is connected with Arab agreement as it is natural for Washington to ask Arab countries to reconsider their relations with the Hebrew state.
Therefore, matters appear to be very serious. It is wrong to believe that setting a "timetable" for a Palestinian statehood and the next agreement will reduce the anticipated perils, particularly if we recall the Iraqi issue, which will reverse the game rules to a large extent and make possible a miserable total agreement, which is worse than maintaining the situation for several years.
Belgium government decided to increase its investments in Egypt and to organize trading missions with a view to exploring the Egyptian market and considering ways and means of implementing joint bilateral projects.

Ibrahim highlighted that the marginal purchasing aims, in the first place, at achieving more liquidity on the market. This means that any investor will purchase securities and pay off about 50% of their value provided that he should own other securities equivalent to 30% of the value of the shares he would buy.
The customer should sign a contract with the brokerage company ensuring its right to confiscate the securities guaranteeing the marginal buying process with the one who is entitled to sell such securities in case the client did not deposit the monetary ceiling that should be deposited at certain time.
Sources with the capital market in Cairo estimated to Al-Hayat the value of negative remittances' outflow at not less than 10 million dollars weekly. Although the figure itself does not represent pressure on the reserve assets, the situation threatens with danger especially if the curve that indicates the foreigners getting out of the Egyptian Stock Exchange continued. This will cause losses to those banks that preserve foreigners' activities in the domestic bourse especially as they are suffering from foreign exchange shortage.
As such remittances are limited whether they gain profits or proceeds, they will be remitted from the pound into the dollar once more, as they will be re-pumped into abroad.
He added that the registered industrial installations with the private sector hit 25,200, of which 21,830 installations had started their activities over the last twenty years.

EGYPT ENDORSES A PLAN FOR DEVELOPING MILLS SECTOR
He said the ministerial group concerned with the plan decided in its last meeting to locally manufacture the sieves and rolls used in mills, which create national technology in this field and reduce demand for foreign equipment. The Egyptian market indicators emphasize that it can accommodate local production, thus cutting prices of components on the national market.
Although the quantities exported of cotton products went down, there is an increase in proceeds estimated at LE2.91 billion over 2001,compared to LE2.81 billion in 2000, up by 3.6% due to a rise in prices.

The programme of industry modernisation is aimed to develop the gross domestic product (GDP) and enhance the competitiveness of the medium and small sized private industries within the framework of the continuous economic development process to provide more job opportunities to the youth and boost economic growth. He expected that 300 companies and factories would take advantage of the programme within this year. In addition, 300 medium and small sized companies will enhance their performance. Another export development programme will help 400 institutions increase their exports.
He expected that the programme would increase industry's contribution to the gross national product (GDP) from 20 percent now to 30 percent during the coming few years according to the volume of foreign investments in the industrial sector, and encourage industrial exports.
Egyptian businessmen asserted that the faltering of that programme had been a phenomenon that never parted with it ever since it was announced in 1999. The reason for such delay lies in a lack of a plan that defines its work and takes into consideration the problems of Egyptian industry and how suitable solutions to them should be made available. The plan should not be confined to issues like finance and collection of interest rates, which is considered extremely high exceeding 12% annually, which does not suit the companies financial positions which actually need modernization and can be classified as small projects.
On the other hand, the Egyptian exports of important non-petroleum products like agricultural crops rose to the value of about 46.5 million euros, a rise of 26.8% compared with the corresponding period of last year.

Those major French companies would provide bigger opportunities to transfer technology to the Egyptian companies in the field of production or packaging in accordance with the specifications and the taste of French consumers.

They even claimed they had special relation with God Almighty, received revelations from Him and had special ability to face devils.
Sobhi: On the contrary, I see that there is a group of party (ruling NDP) members who speak frankly. For instance, I, though a NDP member, was not prevented by anyone from saying anything or blasting any official. Every member can express himself as long as he "respects" himself and considers his topic carefully.
So, I do not care about something like that. Q: What is your evaluation of the performance of opposition and independent members? Sobhi: Their performance is mostly objective and excellent.
Q: But, some see that their presence will lead to the dissolution of the People's Assembly, what do you think?
For example, in the first term, I rejected a bill incrimination proposal put in by Economic Committee Chairman Abdullah Tayel, saying that it ran counter to the Islamic Shari'ah, supporting my rejection with some verses from the Holy Qur'an and Prophet Muhammad's hadith (tradition). When I said that we fear that the Islamic Shari'a may be violated, I unprecedentedly received a round of applause from other members. I think that the Muslim Brotherhood members support me as they feel that I speak objectively, prompting Sorour to say that I am the member no 18 in the 17-member group.
Dia' Rashwan, an Egyptian writer who is the Chief Editor of the "Religious Status in Egypt" - Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, writes a lengthy article in Al-Hayat. Excerpts of which run to the following effect: There are expectations about the future of the Jamaat Islamia (Islamic Group) in particular that are raised in Egyptian and non-Egyptian writings and analyses. The most prominent analyses are of the view that the State will give the Group a wider political and social margin to move in order to use it as a rival to the officially banned Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) Group, which the State does not want to give legitimacy and whose political, professional and media activities make the State suspicious.
It is well known that the Islamic Group is centered, from the geographical point of view, in the governorates of Central and Southern Upper Egypt. This is not the same regarding the geographical existence of the Ikhwan, which is concentrated in some Lower Egypt governorates and Cairo. This means that the possibility that the Islamic Group may compete with the Ikhwan will not be effective. Moreover, matters will end with the fact that the geographical existence of the political Islam trend, with its two wings - Ikhwan and Islamic Group - will expand to include most areas in Egypt, something that contradicts the State's view.
Question: Excluding the widespread possibility that the Islamic Group will vie with the Ikhwan and that the State will give it free rein to move freely on the political stage, as it is considered an organized entity that is almost recognized, a question will be raised on the Islamic Group's future.
Security Considerations: All previous points mean that the State, in dealing with the issue of the Islamic Group, is motivated by security, rather than political, considerations. This makes the political expectations about the Islamic Group's future premature, as most probably this subject has not been raised to the State.
Another paper in the security file is represented in the Islamic Group's fugitive members who are at large in Upper Egypt as of mid 1990's. Although they are few, they occupy a security priority for the State, which, thus, cannot disregard them and move to the political file.
Although the majority of those who expressed such reservations were the first to support the halt-violence initiative and although they belong to the conservatives, this made the Egyptian State afraid that this criticism of and reservation about the form and method might turn into a rejection of the halt-violence initiative and a return to violence by some trends inside the Group. This, eventually, supports concentration on dealing with the Islamic Group from the security point of view and delays dealing with it from the political point of view.
He added that the moves on the German official overt level stopped in 1998 after the parliamentary elections which his party lost, but that by no means meant that the current government stopped trying to complete the exchange operation. He has rather relied on by the government for arrangements he could not unfold for the safety of procedures. He, however, does not expect any final quick results. Such an exchange of prisoners, takes a long time due to being extraordinary because of the big number of prisoners supposed to be handed over by Israel in return for her soldiers corpses.
On the other hand, Power frankly said that terrorism has posed a threat to the world even before the Septemeber 11th incidents.

DELAY IN GOVERNMENT PAYMENTS THREATENS BANKING SUPPORT OF CONSTRUCTION SECTOR
An outstanding banker uncovered that public banks basically tasked to execute the operation of supporting the Arab Contractors Company for instance are having extreme difficulty securing resources to raise their capitals in response to government demands in order to face the rise in their risky assets rate, which makes it necessary for them to choose one of two options - either to postpone the rise in capital or to put off support operations for construction companies in general and reduce part of the finance previously pledged to Arab Contractors till those payments are reimbursed by the government.

This option seems the likeliest and most probable option that enjoys the approval of the board of directors of these banks.
The Minister said that those banks had responded to the department's efforts urging them to implement the sales tax law. He emphasized that the banks and their selling and brokerage operations are subject to the Sales Tax Law.

These studies ascribed unemployment in Egypt to many factors; forefront of which are: -The constant rapid increase of population accompanied by a surge of the labour force estimated at half a million per year - The country's relinquishing of its commitments to employ graduates every year -The shrinkage of demand for Egyptian labour on the Arab markets due to Arab petroleum countries adoption of nationalization of labour policy, thus replacing Egyptian labour with national labour -Dispensing with redundancies in the newly privatised companies after pensioning off personnel; a thing that led to great numbers of workers losing their jobs while they are still capable of work -The serious shortcomings in Egyptian education policies and children labour and their rivalry with adult labour force together with the lack of required skills of Egyptian workforce The CAPMS study underlined the challenges that faced the country in finding solutions to the unemployment problem.

LE100 MILLION NEW INDUSTRIAL INVESTMENTS IN SINAI
CEMENT EXPORTS TO SUDAN VALUED AT $7.5 MILLION
PREMIER: 50% OF EGYPTIAN LABOUR WILL WORK ON EXPORT IN TEN YEARS' TIME
The Premier pointed out that the International Monetary Fund annual report which had recently been issued emphasized that Egypt was the only country in the region that had absorbed the side effects of the September 11th incidents as there was real growth in Egyptian economy. He pointed out that the studies conducted by strategic research centres on 250 companies regarding the increase in their sales, profits as well as increasing investment opportunities in Egypt had 60% positive results, which only 7% of world countries could achieve.
This year Egypt's potato total production hit 1.9 million tons cultivated on an area of 190 thousand feddans distributed among 8 areas, namely; Giza, Menya, Al-Nubaria, Monoufia, Dakahlia, Gharbia, Ismailia and Sharkia.
Exports hit 103,965 tons, up 22,502 tons against last season exports, said Amin Abaza, ECEU chairman. The exports, he added, included sales of 43,840 tons of excellent long-staple cotton, or the equivalent of 42% of total sales against 37,464 tons with an increase rate of 17% during last season.
World prices report indicated that Egyptian cotton prices went down by 4.6-11.6% since the start of the season in October till August 26th. American cotton' exports, nevertheless, hiked by 26.3%, Syrian cotton by 34.9%, Greek cotton by 40.6% and Australian cotton by 24.5%.
Feasibility studies are underway to exploit 5 feddans of the Cairo International Airport Authority-owned lands to establish hotels, malls, swimming pools and recreational parks to serve passengers and Cairo dwellers.
He added that that project is extremely important in light of the strict conditions of European quality especially in the field of engineering and electronic industries. The Egyptian Standardization Authority was granted sanction by its European counterpart to grant the CE Mark to Egyptian products exported to Europe after Egyptian laboratories had been approved, in accordance with European specifications.
Specification Authority chairman pointed out that the fact that Egyptian goods were granted the CE Mark from Cairo would save both time and money. There are also other specifications and standards for Britain in addition to those of the European Union. All such procedures support Egyptian exports.
The Egyptian trade balance deficit with the EU countries remarkably improved during the period from 1998 to 2001 as it reached 2.5 billion dollars in 2001 versus 2.9 billion dollars in 2000, down by 14% or 400 million dollars.
A number of Korean government officials highlighted the close economic relations between the two countries, which date back to 1995.

Al-Hayat learnt that the four countries welcomed cooperation in joint projects in the fields of trade after the agreement on the East Gas project, which will convey Egyptian gas to Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon and later to Turkey and Europe. The first stage of the project is about to be completed.
As far as Lebanon is concerned, there are some non-customs obstacles that negatively impact on the development of the relations with Egypt including the lack of accuracy in the completion of the data of certificates of origin, which results in their refusal.
Syrian businessmen will soon visit Egypt to discuss the mutual exportation operations to include other products at a time when Syria has invited the Egyptian banks to work there in within the framework of the law under which non-Syrian banks are allowed to operate in Syria.
Abu-Sherif attacked the Palestinian Islamic resistance movements of Hamas and Islamic Jihad and considered them odd movements due to their extremist ideas. He pointed out that the Palestinian people rejects struggle from an extremist religious ideas angle and rejects jeopardizing its youths.
He added that it is unreasonable that the organisations which monopolise the Palestinian political action remain the same with their programs that have embarked upon national liberation action since 1964 with their ideas and programs that are no longer fit for dealing with the current Palestinian, regional, and international situation.
The breakthrough came after the American mediators and others from Inter-Governmental Authority for Development (IGAD) presented a draft agreement on Friday-Saturday night hours before the end of the negotiations round.
The issue of the relation between state and religion has been solved through Islamic sharia becoming "one of the sources of legislation."
the Sudanese government started to make important concessions in legislation issues as the agreement provided that "Islamic sharia becomes one of the sources of legislation," while the currently enforced Article 65 of the 1998 Constitution stipulates that "the Islamic sharia and the nation's consensus, are the sources of legislation, and no legislation should be made outside the framework of these fundamentals. But the nation's view and scholars and intellectuals' idjtihad (independent opinions and judgements) could be taken as a guidance then the decision of rulers.
Spokesman for the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) Yasser Erman told Khartoum-based Al-Ayam paper that the recent agreement signed between the Sudanese government and the SPLA in the Kenyan city of Machakos included a 6-year transitional period during which there would be there northern, southern and federal entities. The southern entity will be ruled by a secular constitution, he said.
Regarding the army question, he said there is no national army in Sudan at present and the SPLA will keep its army in the transitional period. The SPLA also proposes a constitutional conference for civil society organizations, diverse provinces, tribes and various social formations to participate in related viewpoints and shape Sudan in the future as the Sudanese issue is very complicated, the spokesman said.
An Iranian trustworthy source uncovered that Qusai Saddam Hussein, the second son of the Iraqi President , who is considered the second man in Iraq, visited Tehran last week and held security and military negotiations with the Iranian dignitaries.
He added that Shehab-1, Shehab-2 and Shehab-3 missiles were at the top of the equipment list which the Iraqi delegation head asked to be sold at very high prices.
These facilities have nothing to do directly with the U.S. call for "changing the regime" in Iraq, but it is part of a plan aiming at modernizing and developing American facilities in the Gulf region, the officials said.
Western military sources said the camp will be ready within weeks. In the meantime, about four tent cities close to the Iraqi border in the north have been set up.
Sheikh Jaber said, "The camp is ready now and I think it only lacks electric connections.
On the other hand, Minister of Defence Sheikh Jaber said Kuwait may support an American military action in case Iraq re-threatens Kuwait or there is an international umbrella, adding that Kuwait will never act against international consensus.
The sources added that the idea of prince Hasan assumption of power in Iraq finds support in the milieus of the American Ministry of Defence (The Pentagon) as well as a group of conservative thinkers. They believe that Prince Hasan, as a symbol, can transcend partisan and tribal differences that brand the Iraqi reality today. He can be a transitional symbol or even a monarch in a clear indication to a return of the Hashemite interest to Iraq.
The analyses of that personal participation have focussed on two axes- the first is to build a ready-made strategy for Jordan in case America and its allies invaded Iraq.
YEMENI-U.S. SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS TO BUILD CONTROL CENTERS
Between 1,000 and 1,500 Yemeni special forces are to be deployed in the three provinces. The French Lebon magazine on Friday reported that the U.S. chose Djibouti as a venue for training Yemeni army forces in fighting terror networks.

A number of Islamic figures seek to form a joint committee of the Islamic forces to coordinate between the different parties in order to agree on certain candidates and support others close to the Islamic orientation though the matter may need greater efforts in some election constituencies where more than an Islamic candidate will compete.
Turkish well-informed sources summarized to Al-Ahram Al-Arabi the position expressed by Ankara, especially the military establishment, to Wolfowitz, in the following points:
In this context, relations between Ankara and Al-Barazani are tense especially as he has sought Washington's help to prevent Turkey from setting up a crossing point on the border with Northern Iraq in order to keep controlling the customs imposed by his party on goods moving between the two countries.
This price is represented in two basic demands: firstly, acceptance of Turkey's joining the membership of the EU without complexities or exaggerations.
The first option calls for cooperation with the American scheme to topple President Saddam Hussein's regime modelling on what happened in Afghanistan i.e. through offering a political and logistical support to the Iraqi opposition forces and their armed militias, thus ensuring for the Iranians their share in the current nations game on the Iraqi cake.
They indicate that it is likely that Saddam's surrogate would be even worse in spite of the lack of any confidence in the latter for the time being.
Among them is the Iranian President's advisor for the dialogue between civilizations, Atallah Muhajrani who proposes a political vision of the future of the two neigbours' relations based on common cultural factors. He says that the 8-year war between Iran and Iraq resulted from insufficient knowledge of the other. If we had known each other, the war would not have taken place, he said. No matter what options Iran had towards the Iraqi file in the coming stage, it is certain that it had not made up its mind yet about how it would deal with the American game of death on its western border.
Al-Baz expressed his belief that despite the Israeli brutalities and the heinous crimes against the Palestinian people that can be described as war crimes particularly the Gaza massacre, indicators to a peaceful settlement of the Palestinian case caused contradictory results inside Israel. Despite the enormous backup that Sharon enjoys as he fights the so-called Palestinian violence, according to Israeli concepts, a percentage of Israelis reject Sharon's way of dealing with the affairs and the illusions of annexing the West Bank and "domesticating" the Palestinian people as fallacies, adding that the declaration of a Palestinian state is a must.
A statement issued by the SPLM spokesman, Yasser Erman said that Garang had exchanged with Egyptian officials that week primary estimations of the peaceful process between the SPLA and Khartoum.

This situation comes within the attempt exerted by the Ikhwanite deputies a few months ago to have the emergency law abrogated and not to vote in favour of having it renewed it ahead of its renewable date next year especially as the Group members, during the last few months and weeks, have been exposed to many police blows that resulted in the arrest of over than 200 Ikhwanite cadres at a time when the Group failed to have more than 70 members released who were arrested over a year ago.
An academic team at Electronics Research Institute succeeded in producing the first highly efficient solar energy cell through a 100% domestic production. The cell would be assembled inside a capsule that can be added to a large number of other capsules into one panel.
TURKEY ORDERS EGYPTIAN GAS, CAIRO WORRIED ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION

Head of the Foreign Trade Sector in the Foreign Trade Ministry, Al-Sayyed Abul-Komsan stressed Egypt's commitment to its obligations towards the World Trade Organization (WTO), saying that imposing the customs tariff on imported clothes earlier this year was carried out upon information that there was no contradiction between the customs tariff on pieces of clothing and Egypt's obligations towards the WTO.
Al-Alam Al-Youm learnt that the US was the first to call for putting this issue on the agenda of the committee meeting. The American commercial representative's report considered the customs tariff on clothing items opposed to Egypt's obligations in the WTO.
During the field visit he paid to factories of Burg Al Arab and Al Nahda Al Gadida cities Prime Minister Atef Ebied stated that the Government was reconsidering the applied interest rates on export-oriented industries in consultation with the CBE.
He regarded that advising them as "important and sparing them the responsibility for money market conditions which have been raising questions marks for about 18 months."
He expressed astonishment at reports of a lull on the money market during the last period due to suspension of exchange firms activity. "What happened in the market is the lull before the storm as the existing stability is temporary and there should be solutions to such problems."
Consequently, the serial of exchange firms will come to an end after continuing for about 11 years.
He said, "Unfortunately there is sharp unemployment from which we suffer following our utter commitment to the announced price by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) hitting LE4.63 for purchase and LE4.645 for sale, thus failing to deal with the black market on which the dollar exchange rate exceeds LE5.35."
He had once worked for Citibank and was then engaged into battles not mostly honourable in the Arab African Bank. Afterwards, he stayed at home until he was appointed chairman of Banque Du Caire which had almost been financially ruined thanks to his lax policies. This time Al-Barad'i only stopped his old practices but failed to work the bank up for even an inch. His appointment with Banque Du Caire was a mere coincidence as it was the bank that had been meant for privatization since the early nineties under an agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
Anybody who cannot reach that position is well advised to change his career. As some leaderships that left their positions in foreign banks had the impression that the government favoured the American banking age, they would announce their resignation even though they would have been, in actual fact, deposed from office, as was the case with Ahmed Dabos from American Express Bank as he was nominated for a high ranking position. The same thing applies to Fatma Lutfi, from Chase Manhattan school after she had resigned her post as managing director of the Egyptian National Bank a few days ago and stayed at home. She has been appointed deputy President of Bank of Alexandria.
Banks have included public enterprise sector companies on the blacklist of defaulting clients as those companies officials had failed to repay part of the debts amounting to LE25 billion due on them to banks.

The Arab and foreign contribution in such expansions reached 2 billion pounds, which reflects the confidence of Arab and foreign investors in the Egyptian investment climate, said General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAIFZ) chairman, Dr. Mohamed Al-Ghamrawi. Expansions in the existing investment companies are meant to achieve three goals the Government is seeking to cover, namely increasing the production capacity, absorbing fresh labour and introducing modern technology, he said.

Concluded also was another contract under which oils to the value of 1.2 million dollars would be imported from Argentina. She added that a decision was taken to provide the offshoots of the company in Africa with new promising leaderships, which made it possible to conclude a lot of international deals with Europe and Brazil in the field of agricultural crops. A deal was clinched under which coffee and cocoa would be exported from Togo and Ghana at a value of five million Egyptian pounds and sugar from Brazil to Sudan to the tune of 16.2 million Egyptian pounds in addition to flour from France to Congo at a sum of 1.2 million pounds.
He added that successful marketing was the key to development. He said that the state aims at making 50% of the workforce in Egypt work on exportation by the end of ten years. He went on to say that Burg Al-Arab and Alexandria are at the top of the cities which benefited by the Export Support Fund. The taxes paid by exporters are now being minimized.

Although the EU represents considerable weight in Egypt's foreign trade, Egypt's quota in the EU trade with world countries is meagre as it doesn't exceed 1%, according to the data of the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMS). Trade exchange between Egypt and EU countries last year went down by about 24% standing at 5138 million dollars against 6705 million dollars in 2000.
Egypt is considered a gate for the Korean companies to penetrate the African and European markets, thus providing fresh investment opportunities for Korean companies, emphasized Dr. Sherif Al-Gabali, head of the Egyptian side in the council.
He pointed out vistas of economic cooperation between the two countries including approval of the Korean Import and Export Bank to provide credit lines for Egyptian businessmen with Banque Misr and the Commercial International Bank by a minimum limit of $60 million for each, and the Egyptian American Bank by a minimum limit of $40 million.

"Mackakos Protocol" signed by the two sides and mediators provided that the transitional period continue for six years, provided that a referendum will be held after that, giving the people in the south chance to choose either unity or secession.
The outcome is considered a gain to the government, especially as it did not point out that the self-determination or consultation include another three areas outside the south called - according SPLA - "Marginalized areas."

Western mass media sources said that Jordanian former crown prince, Hasan Bin Tallal had emerged for American milieus and Iraq opposition as a strong candidate for leading Iraq if the USA carried on with its scheme aiming at toppling the Iraqi regime.
Prince Hasan had talked to the conference as a 'friend to the Iraqi people as the Iraqi National conference chairman, Ahmed Al Galbi indicated. He did not touch upon any political or controversial issues but concentrated on the emotional concept in the Hashemites' relations with Iraq. Prince Hasan, known for his moderate attitudes and interest in religious dialogue of questions, pointed out that his participation was personal and carried no political allusions to any prospective Jordanian role in the future.

The road to the post-Saddam period should pass through Turkey, especially that Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and - certainly - Syria stressed that they would not be a springboard for American strikes against Iraq and as their territories would not be used for invading a brotherly country under the pretext of establishing a democratic regime, simply because they all suffer from the same injury.
In this context, the sources uncovered that prominent Iraqi Kurdish leaders, especially Masoud Al-Barazani and Galal Al-Talbani, have recently started to move between Europe and the United States through other countries, other than Turkey.

There are three possible options for the Iranian policy towards the Iraqi crisis:
Advocates of this option think the American scheme would not be confined to Iraq, and will aim at remapping the whole region to promote American presence and ensure the Zionist entity's security.
Due to the differences in visions and analyses, the options faced by Iran in dealing with the Iraqi file implications seems far from easy. It is noteworthy that there are forces in the political Iranian elite milieu that are eager for drawing up a new track in the relation between Tehran and Baghdad transcending the legacy of past hostilities.

"We do not ask our brothers in Egypt to support self-determination (in the south), but we want them to back unity in Sudan."
Abdel-Rahman Al-Rashed, Chief Editor of Asharq Al-Awsat, writes an article under the above heading. Excerpts run to the following effect: War will, for sure, take place; or so it is said. A few months are needed to change the Iraqi leadership. An American military internet site put a digital watch to count in a descending order for the D-day.
Let me remind you of some non-military problems during the previous "mother of battles." War made about one million human beings, Arabs and foreigners alike, stampede towards the borders of Jordan and Saudi Arabia to the extent that world organizations found difficulties in providing one meal per day for that "sea" of people.
Does Saudi Arabia have enough capabilities to take care of its very long borders? Can the Syrians, after their latest open policy on Iraq, endure its humanitarian problems?
We are not afraid of the fall of the regime. Rather, we are afraid of a vacuum that will lead to a civil war; a nightmare about which we talked in horror 17 years ago when the Iraqi stance was divided among itself in its war on Iran. We used to say: "What would happen, if the regime fell?"
Sources, having close contacts with people close to Bin Laden, said yesterday that the Leader of Al-Qaeda would appear soon in a video.
However, these sources believed that August 2002 would be a possible timing for implementation.
In his new tape, Bin Laden will spotlight Al-Qaeda Organization's successes in containing the attacks, launched by the US, and re-building its ranks on the basis of guerrilla war launched inside Afghanistan and attacks carried out in different world countries against American interests.
Al-Arabi learnt that the USAID bureau in Cairo had already received an initial decision to suspend $17.8 million which the Ministry of Justice used to receive to develop and modernize the bodies affiliated to it like the National Centre for Judiciary Studies and courts buildings as well as providing them with computer and microfilm networks.
It is noteworthy that the decision to stop the aid may be officially announced in a few days' time in implementation of the threat which the American President George W. Bush announced last Tuesday where he said twice that they would not give a single dollar to the countries that would not respect what he called the sovereignty of law and their citizens' rights.
The party founder, Sahar Ibrahim is conducting a final revision for the party's platform prior to the convention of the first session to discuss it, as the Party Law stipulates that it should be a distinguished platform other than that of other parties and that there should not be any similarity between it and any other party to avoid any two parties performing the same role in public life.
EGYPT SHOULD SPEEDILY WRIGGLE OUT OF "SAAD EDDIN IBRAHIM QUAGMIRE"
At the time, Iraq thought that the West could not do without its central role in confrontation with Iran, which was a proven illusion as a mere bid to use the political role as a blackmail tool turns the ally into an enemy.
The recent changes in the region also cut Egypt's role down to size as the U.S. found a strong ally in Ethiopia and Eritrea, started a detente with the Sudan and ended hostility with Libya. Thus, it will not be in need of Egypt as a balance factor against yesterday's foes. Egyptian tendency to enter into a confrontation with the U.S. will bring critical consequences upon the regime, with Washington possibly seeking to unseat it.
Although U.S. authorities look at Usama bin Laden as a financing and instigating source for suicide bombers, analysts say that Ayman al-Zawahri, the leader of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, is the architect of confrontation with Washington, while the Egyptian Mohamed Atta was the plotter and executor of operations.
One may agree or differ with this western vision, but an important question poses itself on the alternative proposed by the regimes to develop themselves politically.
But, engagement in confrontation with America in defence of the Egyptian citizen's dignity or in rejection of the Sudanese people's right to achieve reconciliation and end civil war puts the Egyptian regime in the square of double hostility to the Egyptian people and Arab interests. It endangers Egyptian and Arab interests in defence of an unprovoked desire to control innocent citizens' rights.
The crisis between the Egyptian government and the Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) has run deeper as Prosecutor General Maher Abdel-Wahid on Monday sent some 101 members of the group from Alexandria governorate to the State Security Misdemeanour Court on charges of "rioting and sabotaging public and private property in the by-elections in Alexandria last June."
Late last month, a military court sentenced some 16 members of the Muslim Brotherhood, mainly including Ikhwan Secretary-General Mahmoud Ghazlan, to 3-5 years in prison with hard labour. Since the Nasserite era (late president Nasser's era), it has been the first time for five Ikhwan members to be sentenced to five years in jail in a single case.
He noted that the defendants were deprived of appearing before their natural judge and would be tried at an emergency law-applying court, which is not different from court-martials.
The axed deputies warned that they would return to the list of independents on the basis that they won parliamentary seats in the recent vote in this capacity, saying that the NDP made a big blunder when it relieved them from posts in the provincial NDP secretariats in favour of the second rank leaders.
Fresh blood should be injected into the leading NDP positions, they said. The NDP works out future policies not in favour of persons and individuals seeking a monopoly on all political positions.
While Germany threatened to withdraw its tanks and soldiers from Kuwait if a war is launched by the USA against Iraq, the European Union announced yesterday following its foreign minister's meeting in Denmark yesterday that he agreed with Washington that Iraq is a "dangerous country" but he asked her to resort to the Security Council to obtain its approval of any military action.
A Kuwaiti elite of political, economic, historical and legal analysts said that the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states would not be in a strong position in the absence of Yemen and Iraq, as both countries joining the GCC would strengthen the economies of the region and guarantee the stability of its countries.
ISRAELIS ESCAPE FROM INTIFADA INTO SHARM EL-SHEIKH, NUWEIBAA AND TABA
Sinai is always away from violent acts. Those who work in the tourism sector, however, do not regard the Israelis as first-class tourists, as they do not stay in 5-star hotels, but rather prefer cheap ones.
The Israelis who travelled to Israel returned to Cairo later on after the yearly vacation had ended and voiced that they did not think of an eternal return to Israel.
In his interview with the Jordanian newspaper, Shpeilat denied changing his political attitude. He pointed out that his statements to the Qatari Al-Jazeera satellite channel confirm that he had not changed his mind.
The Middle East region seems as if struck with political vertigo due to the continuation of American threats of toppling President Saddam Hussein's regime and the mystery shrouding Iraq's future, either in case the anticipated strike took place or not.
During his meeting with Al-Faysal, President Khatami said, "If the serious phenomena represented in the interference of a strong country in the domestic affairs of other countries becomes a customary thing, no country and people will enjoy security from now on."
Iranian political milieus believe that the political imagination of Bush Administration for changing regimes will not stop at the Iraqi geographical borders and it is possible that it (his imagination) seeks to change the regime of the Islamic Republic.
Regarding Saudi Arabia, there is a group of reasons that make it fear the American role in drawing the future of Iraq. In spite of being a conventional ally of the U.S., 11 September incidents made Washington reconsider its positions in the Gulf region after it transpired that the phenomena of Osama Bin Laden is a product of this region. The continuation of the existing situation in Saudi Arabia may lead to the spread of feelings of hatred against the American policy in the region that might be given vent to in the form of violent phenomena and movements that threaten Washington's interests in away that may be beyond the Saudi control.
Furthermore, their call to Baghdad for applying international resolutions to avert the American strike, even from the view point of Saddam himself, does not add any thing new, rather aggravates the crisis and freezes it and goes on the boring hide-and-seek game between Baghdad on the one hand and Washington and the United Nations on the other, with all its implications including the continuation of the sufferings of the Iraqi people which caught between the devil and the deep blue sea.
Having considered the negotiating positions of each party, the mediators put forward their project which represented the ceiling of their demands.
The project also provides for the participation of the concerned minister in signing the executive decrees with the president.
The project specifies the percentages of endorsement of bills in the two councils in a way that prevents unilateral issuance of decisions.
It added that the signatories of the "National Charter" had expressed denunciation of the deterioration of public freedoms, the domination of security bodies,, violation of the judiciary sanctity, trailing and detentions of intellectual symbols, thinkers and advocates of reform and change.
The statement said, "The signatories also see in the American threats to brotherly Iraq a threat to all the Arab and Islamic nation. The conferees, therefore, think it is necessary to close up Arab and Islamic ranks to prevent such aggression and to face up the unjust campaign launched against our nation under the pretext of the so-called anti-terrorism war.
Under item "Secondly: General Goals", it said that the signatories of the charter seek to achieve the goal of building the modern state, "a contractual state where the contract originates from a free conscious will between the ruler and the ruled."
It emphasizes "The Arabism of the Palestinian land and the Palestinian people's right to resist its enemy and return to its land and homes as well as self determination and building its independent state on Palestine's land with holy Jerusalem as its capital."
Among the signatories of the charter and the supporters of the conference were a group of politicians, intellectuals and brackets of the civil society numbering 29 mostly Islamists and members of the Association of the Levant men of letters.
The participants and signatories of the final statement took a positive approach towards "all forces on the internal arena and regarded political plurality as a form of good counsel, guidance and control that would help detect mistakes and put things right."
Al-Bayanoni criticized the policy of excluding the other opinion and monopolizing power as well as the imposition of trusteeship on the people, thus creating a lack of confidence between the ruler and the ruled.
Salim talked about Syria's crisis which as he said is controlled today by two leaderships political and security and he who lives there feels that there is a conflict between the two leaderships.
JORDAN: THE REGIME IS COURTING MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD SUPPORT
The Iraqi project models, in fact, on the central case which arouses no differences of opinion between the officialdom and the syndicates. Syndicate leaders (Islamists) are zealots of the Iraqi file. Their zeal urged them even to arrange an Arab unity march to leave on Thursday to Baghdad, Damascus and Beirut in an Jordanian, Arab solidarity message, a journey which unionists expected the government to prevent, but, to their surpise, it licensed and even encouraged it.
It is here in particular that we can read the obvious development in the courting language between the government and the trade unionist organizations that have entered into a partnership with the government even though they used to be dubious institutions seeking to impede the government and acting on behalf of a partisan agenda.
On the other hand, what did the Islamists do?
Rashid Khashana of Al-Hayat writes to say: While the drums of war are rising to a crescendo in the US in preparation for launching a military strike on Iraq under the pretext that it refuses the return of the UN weapons inspectors, Washington deals flexibly and moderately with North Korea. Since the tenure of office of Bush the father the US presidents have been reminding North Korea that it must allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect its installations and respect the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
The Arabs were under severe pressure, threats, and bargaining to cancel nuclear programs with peaceful aims. Perhaps the most serious case is the Algerian "Peace" reactor, which the government had to stop and then completely cancel though it expressed readiness to open it before the international inspection teams to examine it any time.
The US fear from the Arabs and Iranians increased after the 11 September events.
To date, Pyongyang has been insistently refusing to allow its nuclear installations to be inspected. However, it receives assistance to build its new reactors, what does this mean?
TALK IN CAIRO ABOUT A RELATION BETWEEN CORRUPTION CASES EXPOSITION & AN INTERNECINE CONFLICT IN THE RULING PARTY
According to a well-informed source, the role of the Administrative Control Authority cannot be underestimated in the pursuing, investigating, seizure and crackdown operations in all those cases. Neither can the independence of that important authority which is supposed to be headed by the premier be undervalued. All that, nevertheless, cannot negate the influence of the political conflict on the emergence of corruption cases at such an accelerated tempo.
The study was prepared by the researcher in Al-Ahram Establishment's Center of Political and Strategic Studies, Dr. Amr Hashim on the two laws of "khul'a" (divorce of woman for consideration payable by her) and the nationality of kids of Egyptian females married to foreigners. It was aimed to identify woman's issues in the People's Assembly (PA) as well as her legislative role as a deputy as far as these two cases are concerned.
As for the other law, namely the nationality of kids of Egyptian females married to foreigners, the study said the discussions in the PA showed that a number of deputies had adopted a draft law giving the Egyptian nationality to the kids of Egyptian females married to foreigners provided that legal regulations we laid down for this marriage including the nature of residence of the wife in case of the husband's death, desertion or divorce and that the husband should not be Israeli.

Last April, at the starting of the Israeli "Operation Defensive Wall", Egypt said that it would cancel all cooperation projects with Israel, apart from diplomatic ties aimed to resolve the Palestinian cause.
According to them, projects mean the joint agricultural projects unilaterally suspended by Egypt.
National and Islamic circles within the Green Line felt resentful of this phenomenon and regarded joining the ranks of Ariel Sharon's party, which is waging a fierce war against the unarmed Palestinians, as high treason.
Knesset member Ayoub Kara, Druze in origin, of Daliat El Karmal village admitted that his party (Likud) would reward the Arabs who joined the party regardless of the hostile feelings the Arabs in Israel harbour for Ariel Sharon.
It is noteworthy that the UN will conduct such tests for candidates from 36 countries including Israel after 14 years of interruption to assimilate new employees from all member states of the organization.
This stance was confirmed to Al-Hayat by Ihsan Abdel-Aziz, son of the movement leader and his representative in London. It is known that there is a large-scale campaign launched by the Iraqi opposition in protest against the statements made last week by Turkish Defense Minister in which he hinted that Kirkuk and Mosul are belonging to his country.
He went on to say that he told British officials that the Islamic movement sees it necessary to get out of the current political situation in the province through a unified technocratic government where the intellectuals and experts should be represented to oversee the new elections in preparation for a new Kurdish parliament.
The diplomat, who was talking to Al-Quds Al-Arabi and asked for anonymity, said that his country was mediating between the two parties on the highest levels but to no avail so far. However, the diplomat continued, the early indicators are "positive".
On its part, a source close to the group declined to comment on this information and said that several political mediation attempts took place between the two parties over the recent years and some of them were made by Arab channels that keep good relations with the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood.

TIN IRON RETURNS SPECULATIONS TO THE EGYPTIAN MARKET
The production of the government-owned company, namely Egyptian Iron and Steel Company, however, covers only 5% of the market volume, leaving the remaining percentage to that private company.

Head of Metal Indusries Department, with the Industries Federation Eng. Moharam Hilal said the Egyptian Government would have to urgently endorse a law to organise competition and prevent monopoly in order to minimize the negative practises exercised by giant companies on the market as well as the constant manipulations of their products prices.

In a press conference yesterday, CBE Governor , Dr Mahmoud Abou El Oyoon said that the CBE had not laid down any plans for the rescheduling and repayment process, as the matter is left to the banks and their clients to reach a compromise that suits the two parties best.
Regarding international bonds, the CBE governor said, "We professionally run them in order to avoid any possible losses due to international low interest rates." There are $500 million of them in the hands of Egyptian institutions inside the country.
Abul-Oyoon told Al-Alam Al-Youm that no CBE circular had been issued to that effect. Banks, he added, would hold negotiations with all defaulters at one go regardless of the size of the debt due on them.
Yesterday, banks intensified moves to finish sending invitations to defaulters to start negotiating over their due debts before the expiring of the period of grace granted to them by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) that will end tomorrow (Tuesday).
Such seriousness has been ensured by the Government and the CBE tendency to take a firm attitude towards prevaricating defaulters through referring them to prosecution if they failed to file a settlement application.
He added that the Fund resources had increased in the period from the end of May till the end of July to LE122 million, adding that the money available to the Fund for financing the projects hit LE2 billion and 880 million.
It is noteworthy that the bank had invited its shareholders to attend an emergency assembly meeting held on August 31st to consider increasing the bank's capital. The meeting was attended by the shareholders of 215,000 stocks constituting 53.8% of the total shares amounting to 400,000.
The African Development Bank (ADB) decided for the first time, to extend two soft loans to the value of $220 million to two banks affiliated to the public sector in order to finance Egyptian export development programmes and small and medium projects.

The Authority chairman, Dr Mohamed Al Ghamrawi said that the approvals included the construction of two projects under the special areas system on an area of 42 thousand square metres for each. He added that the first project would manufacture propylene in the Northwest of the Gulf of Suez under the name of the Egyptian company for Manufacturing propylene with issued capital of $69 million and investment cost of $231. The project will create 295 job opportunities.
Investment Authority chairman has also approved some project applications to get new lands for expanding project activities. He instructed all areas to meet the needs of the new export projects as well as the new expansions of the existing projects.
The reports disclosed that the sales of the Holding Company for Trade stopped at LE1.5 billion. The sales of the Holding Company for Engineering Industries went down from LE1.2 billion to LE1.03 billion, and the sales of the Holding Company for Housing, Tourism, and Cinema retreated from LE1.1 billion to one billion pounds. The reason for that is that the number of tourists flocking to Egypt was impacted after the 11 September events.
He added that the start of modernization would include 50 Public Enterprise Sector companies and 100 private ones among the companies whose administrations are suggested to be modernized. A teamwork has also been formed to start the establishment of the first Egyptian company specialized in administration that will work side by side with the currently existed companies to attract successful managers of different nationalities from abroad, he pointed out.
For its part, the Stock Exchange said that it had received a statement from Al-Ahram Beverages in which it pointed to negotiations with foreign investors to purchase the company's stocks. In case the negotiations succeeded, the deal would be concluded and new details regarding this deal together with the investor with whom negotiations are currently underway would be announced four weeks later.
The price of execution ranged between 40 and 40,95 pounds. The reasons for cancelling such deals are attributed to suspicions about some investors' exploitation of the internal data after rumours on the market had it that negotiations over selling Al-Ahram Beverages to the international investor are underway. The rumours, however, set the price of the deal at 60 pounds per share, something that has not been confirmed by the company up till now.
NON-EGYPTIANS' LAND OWNERSHIP PROCEDURES TO BE STREAMLINED
Furthermore, there will be 50 percent and 25 percent cuts in land registration charges for renewable limited periods of time, the minister of information said. Rules for owning land at tourist areas and new urban communities should be made a lot easier for non-Egyptians, while cyber promotional campaigns have to be stimulated.
Among the prominent proposals that will be discussed in the meeting is the Ministry of Finance relinquishing the tax proceeds that are annually supplied by the public banks out of the net profits achieved in a year.
Egyptian banks are gripped by concern and suspense following a fatwa (religious opinion) from the Fatwa Committee of Al-Azhar, the most august Islamic institution in the world, prohibiting new bank competitions which have attracted a wide sector of money savers, especially the 100-pound investment certificate, according to which a saver may win one million pounds in a monthly draw.
For her part, Dr. Magda Shalaby, a professor of economics at Al-Azhar University, made it certain that the fatwa would affect, even if relatively, Egyptian banks for it is still a budding fatwa and has not yet been circulated among people. To prove this argument, she said that many viewers have been reluctant to join the television call competitions, which were declared as unlawful in line with an Islamic fatwa. The continued display of these competitions on the Egyptian Television does not mean that there is a stampede, she said.
Sahar Al Sallab was nominated managing director. Hisham Izz El Arab is one of the key young banking leaderships as he had worked for major international commercial institutions until he was appointed managing director of German Deutch Bank, classified as the eighth international bank worldwide. He occupied the same position for GB Morgan Bank, one of the biggest international investment banks.
He pointed out that total loans obtained by those defaulters hit about LE11 billion as none of them has sent any applications during the period of grace that expired last Thursday.
The sources pointed out that the negotiations with defaulting businessmen over how to deal with the bad debts would begin immediately after the completion of those committees work which would last for several days.
Abul Oyoon denies reports of the CBE interference in the decisions of any banks. He added that creditor banks were free to deal with their clients and they would have the last say concerning how to deal with defaulters as no written or oral instructions had been received on the relation between the two parties.
Net direct investment went down by 16% although it had already been so meagre in the previous year.
This can mainly be accounted for recession. We should also know the sectors that witnessed a decline in imports.
The above mentioned figures pointed out that total investments of foreigners and Arabs in the form of projects had amounted to $428 million against $509 million in the previous year and against $1.7 billion two years ago.
This points out the falsity of the figures about foreign dealings announced by Capital Market Authority to which it adds Egyptian investment funds abroad as well as Egyptian transactions abroad.
Surprisingly, in spite of the retreat in tourism revenues by about $894 million in one year, we find that Egypt's payments for tourism abroad had increased by about $112 million.
But, why did we use the expression of "bubble".
This left new question marks and queries over the meaning of the word "new funds." Explanations differed. Under the explanation adopted by the Egyptian delegation and the World Bank, the word "new funds" means funds that had not been agreed upon and were not included in the aid protocols by which the donor countries abide. Another explanation by some donor countries including the US, the biggest donor, says that any funds got by Egypt are considered new, which made the bubble vanish gradually.
Third: The commitment to offer 1.85 billion dollars over the coming three years is a mere assessment of the support that Washington can offer by virtue of its resources on the one hand and what Egypt needs on the other taking into account that it is not possible to predict what will happen during the coming two years due to the changes that take place in the world after the 11 September events.
The bigger donor countries may have adopted the same position of the smaller donor countries. Holland, for example, announced through its ambassador in Cairo that it would continue the human aid program to Egypt, which had been agreed upon before without adding new projects to the program. The program ranges between 15 and 20 million euros.
Mohammad Kamil said the bank's mission is not to collect money, but rather to organise the advisory meetings of the donor countries with the concerned country. What was made in Sharm El-Sheikh conference was mere commitments. The bank will only be committed to offering what it promised to provide. The bank has no tools to force the countries to pay what they committed themselves to offering.
