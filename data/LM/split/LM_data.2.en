They pointed out that they toured prisons to explain their initiative. "It was necessary to listen to our brethren in prisons after long years of separation between us. The security leaders fathomed out the significance of this step. So, we had tours in different prisons, which took us a year or so and required efforts and patience."
The statistic pointed out that the youth in Luxor prefer getting married to German women, then Austrian then French women.
Female MPs lauded President Mubarak's decision to amend the Nationality Law because, to quote them, "it puts an end to the sufferings of Egyptian mothers' offspring in terms of employment, renewal of residence and education."
Shukr confirmed that the strategic report contenting itself with handling the position of political parties through the National Democratic Party and Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt is a sound one if we accurately read the situation.
Shukr said that the Muslim Brotherhood as the main and most influential opposition force is responsible for political reform as the ruling regime fears the repetition the Algerian scenario, if there were free elections. So, this responsibility requires more clear positions that assure the ruling regime and the other opposition forces and this can be achieved through:

NDP CONGRESS INITIALLY APPROVES ISSUANCE OF CITIZENSHIP RIGHTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS CHARTER
The committee on the rights of citizenship and democracy endorsed the dialogue paper proposed by the policies secretariat as a prelude to having it ratified in the final meeting today. According to reliable sources in the party, the policies committee would undertake to transform that paper, in the next stage, into practical ideas and proposals after putting it forward to dialogue with the government, the parties and various civil elements.
The congress, nevertheless, witnessed sharp confrontations with Premier Dr. Atef Ebeid during the discussion of the economic paper as the party members raised the questions of the corruption phenomenon running rampant as well as government extravagance and the government's failure to meet the needs of the citizens and to control the prices of basic commodities or the pound devaluation before the dollar.
Official statistics emphasized the decline in population growth rate in Egypt from 3.04% in 1985 to 1.99% in 2002 while the international rate is 1.7%.
The Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation is to resume gas negotiations with the Israeli Electricity Company following a 3-year suspension, according to the Middle East Economic Survey publication.
Meanwhile, Israeli media reported last August that Israel would buy gas from Egypt, rather than Britain's British Gas (BG), which is operating near Gaza shores.
The Social Insurance Fund won't be able to provide pensions longer as its financial reserves are going to be used up, they warned.
The present-day system of independent insurance funds is so safe that it has achieved 200 billion pounds in reserves.
DOLLAR THREATENS THE POOR
Statistics issued by bodies concerned point out that total production of broad beans hits 407,000 tons, meeting 83 percent of consumption. However, overpopulation in the last years led to a sharp shortage, which was consequently compensated for through importation from Turkey, Spain, France and other countries, thus raising the price of a kilogram of broad beans from 190 piasters to 230 piasters, and from 240 piasters to 3 pounds last March.
Overpopulation "The broad beans crisis is associated primarily with the overpopulation, which contributed to the disappearance of many commodities and even the importation of huge quantities although agricultural crops are the best commodities to be exported," chief of Cairo Chamber of Commerce's Grain Traders Division Al-Sayed Abdin said. He pointed out that broad beans price rises in the past were attributed to international, rather than Egyptian, economic circumstances. Prices are expected to witness stability during the coming period like what happened to the maize crop in previous periods, which met 75 percent of total consumption, he said, adding that the expansion in some strategic crops was the solution to procure foreign exchange.
OPENNESS TO ISLAMIC GROUPS DOES NOT ALLOW THEM TO EXERCISE POLITICS UNDER RELIGIOUS UMBRELLA: BAZ
Q: What is the significance of openness to Islamic groups in Egypt? And did it come in the right time?
Q: What is the point which Egyptian efforts reached to bring Palestinian factions closer have?
I cannot deny that the U.S. administration has its own assessment of Hamas and Jihad, but it could be unacceptable for us as a neighbouring country.
Al-Baz: The expulsion decision is a very serious one according to what the international community agreed on in the UN General Assembly resolution. The U.S., in spite of its position in the UN Security Council, expressed firm opposition to any bid to harm President Arafat. I believe that Israel has neither the ability nor the political chance to carry out the expulsion decision.
Al-Baz: We are not in a competition with Iraq or any other country in the region. We hope that the international community attaches attention to Iraq reconstruction for this will improve security climate and stability in the region, an atmosphere which Egypt is seeking to provide since it is necessary for development not only in Egypt but also in the entire Middle East region.
Q: Will this create a flourishing currency black market?
US ASKS FOR SPECIAL TREATMENT WITH ITS COMPANIES IN EGYPT
There is no schedule at present to start such negotiations, she said.
During a seminar on the future of Arab-Israeli conflict after the Iraqi war, held in Bibliotheca Alexandrina two days ago, Al-Baz said there was no evidence in support of Iraq's having been connected with Al-Qaeda organization as the former was ruled by Arab Baath Party which was a secularist party that had nothing to do with that organization.
Chairman of Ibn Khaldoun Centre for Developmental Studies, Saad Eddin Ibrahim emphasized that what was reported about his urging the American Administration to pressurize the Egyptian Administration to implement democracy was utterly groundless.
Ibrahim regarded the goings on in Iraq as "a natural outcome of the war that ended in the toppling of a despotic regime and the occupation of Iraq by foreign forces, thus creating a situation where resistance of occupation is coupled with a desire to reconstruct the country. This would eventually lead to a better position than that which used to exist under Saddam Hussein's tyranny, he added.
Talks with the American administration focused on the importance of bringing the "roadmap" into effect, backing the Quartet efforts and calling upon Israel to necessarily redeem its obligations, he said. Jordan still bolsters the Palestinian economy to alleviate the sufferings of the Palestinian people, release prisoners in the Israeli prisons and stop the separation wall construction as well as assassinations.
A Muslim ought to strike a balance between his needs and the requirements of his society, he said, emphasizing that the society's requirements and necessities should be given top priority.

The group dedicated the first book to "Blood of innocent Muslims who were killed in Riyadh bombings and others" and the second book to "All sincere statesmen, leaders and members of the group who contributed to the success of the anti-violence initiative".
And we say: We did not and will never forget that and every Muslim who care about Islam affairs realizes what is going on around him and how America persecutes and maltreats Muslims.
They pointed out that they toured prisons to explain their initiative. "It was necessary to listen to our brethren in prisons after long years of separation between us. The security leaders fathomed out the significance of this step. So, we had tours in different prisons, which took us a year or so and required efforts and patience."

ACCUSED OF MANIPULATION, EGYPTIAN EXPORTERS CONCERNED
Doubts that exporters manipulate this decision are on the increase because many of them have objected to the decree following its issuance. In addition, some of the exporters expressed reservations about the decision. But Ali Essa, Head of the General Division of Exporters, asserted that the majority of exporters had committed themselves to the decision, despite their reservations about it. However, this does not prevent commitment to the decision in respect of the rule of law that provides equality for all exporters, he said.
For his part, Helal Sheta, Deputy Head of the General Division of Exporters, said manipulation was an individual case and the majority of exporters abide by the law. But matters may get worse due to the current conditions, the rise of the dollar's exchange rate and the dire need for it to provide basic goods.
An exporter said a reference price was set last year to export citrus and some other commodities. Such an agreement was sent to the Export and Import Control Authority, Foreign Trade Sector and the Customs House. Only a few number of exporters did not abide by this agreement. Most exporters are committed to it and the value of their exports is correct. Means of increasing exportation should be sought instead of pressurizing them, he pointed out.
It is difficult to return to the cancelled forms that exporters fought to cancel, she said. Free economy opposes any step that undermines investment. It is better to look for real solutions, not for a scapegoat, she pointed out.

In urgent requests for notification, the deputies asked the government to submit an urgent report to the parliament on its plan to implement the decree of banning importing the American meat, especially the quantities that were contracted or the quantities which are in the way to Egyptian ports, taking into account the approach of Greater Bairam (Eid Al-Adha) and the possibility of infiltrating of big quantities in local market by exporters.

The Egyptian Minister welcomed the Saudi Minister's decision that Saudi Arabia would import potatoes from the areas free of the brown rot disease, and from which potatoes are exported to the European Union. However, another idea is added to the proposal. The Egyptian and Saudi sides will determine, during the next season of exportation, the areas from which potatoes will be exported to the Kingdom because the European Commission determines areas, whose production is enough for meeting the needs of the EU market, and because such a measure is confined to potato exports directed to the EU.
At the beginning of the economic talks, both countries agreed on establishing institutional mechanisms for taking quick decisions to solve the problems facing trade relations between the two countries with the objective of raising these ties to the level of the "indispensable partner."
Dr. Fahd Al-Sultan, Secretary General of the Saudi Council for Chambers of Commerce, asserted that dialogue with officials in Egypt was going on in order to remove all obstacles impeding the flow of commodity exchange between the two countries. He said there were hindrances undermining the implementation of the bilateral commercial agreement and the final signing of the free trade zone agreement. These obstacles also impede the application of the agreement on the Saudi medical products.
The Saudi business sector looks forward to discussing the suspension of the bilateral agreement with Egypt, following the Egyptian side's abrogation of the commercial part of the agreement, Al-Sultan pointed out. Such a move led to a retreat in the Saudi non-oil exports. Besides, harm was done to the commercial contracts signed earlier between the two countries.

The mufti, who has just assumed the duties of the new post, warned on Monday against "mistaking suicide bombings in Palestine for terrorist acts because these bombings are legitimate defence of land, soul, property and religion".

Labi noted that Dayan did not mention the nuclear weapon explicitly because it was a taboo, but his intent was obvious.
The fresh report will also call for establishing a center for dialogue between America and the Islamic world.

The 5 members of Administrative Authority of the Iraqi Contractors Federation are elected through secret ballot voting, which is carried out every three years during the meeting of Iraqi Contractors General Authority.
This increasing role took two aspects: the first is a political one through the emergence of Shiite political forces of Islamic orientations whether connected with the Hauzas (seminaries on Shiite law college) in Najaf, Kerbala and Qum or independent ones. Undoubtedly, the growing role of such forces is so apparent through their representation in the transitional Governing Council, announced stances, and their supporters' continuous demonstrations, which took the forms of organized protests and explicit or implicit threats to the Americans, the British or even the remnants of the Baath Party. The second aspect is represented in successive statements issued by unknown organizations, which claim responsibility for operations against the occupation forces. Most of such organizations carry unequivocally Islamic names, slogans and objectives and proclaim religious struggle or jihad.
The second case took place following the 1967 War when they demonstrated anew that the nationalist socialist semi-secularist Nasserite model in Egypt and the Baathist leftist secularist rule in Syria were fiascoes.
However, this task does not seem to be easy, especially in light of two factors: the first is related to the Arab liberals and to what extent they are deeply rooted in the Arab communities, the legitimacy of their existence, to what degree the regions' people understand their political and cultural discourse, and not linking between them and other foreign parties which Arab peoples suspect.
Regarding woman's rights in Saudi Arabia, he said that Islam is a religion of equality and justice and that Saudi Arabia introduces the required reforms that would enshrine woman's rights. He uncovered that Saudi Foreign Ministry plans to appoint first Saudi female diplomats.

An Egyptian border official said on Friday that recent meetings were held between Egyptian and Israeli officials in an Israeli bid to prevail on the Egyptian side to receive container ships coming to Israeli seaports at Egyptian harbours as a prelude to transporting them to Israel.

"The GAIFZ has asked that investors' requests to exempt capital equipment of sales tax be immediately met and is still awaiting the Finance Ministry's approval.

According to the report, a sum of LE147 million ($24 million) was spent out of those amounts of money to reform spinning and weaving companies. This led to a production rise in this sector at a value of LE2.670 million ($450 million), compared to LE2.38 billion ($340 million) last year. Operation losses plummeted from LE400 million to LE40 million, something that saved a sum of LE340 million.

The Egyptian government signed yesterday (29 December) a contract with the Arab Monetary Fund (AMF) as per which Egypt will get a 250-million-dollar soft loan. The contract was signed by Dr. Farouq Al-Okda, governor of the Central Bank of Egypt, on behalf of the Egyptian side, and Dr. Jassim Al-Manae'i, board chairman of the fund on behalf of the AMF.
Dr. Jassim Al- Manae'i said the loan is the ninth of its kind for Egypt since cooperation between the fund and the Egyptian government has started at the beginning of the economic reform in 1991. Thus, the total loans given by the fund to Egypt rose to 751 million dollars.

Until the end of September 2002, the exchange rate remained fixed at 450 piasters per dollar. After the issuance of the deregulation decision, the pound rate was controlled by a handful of speculators and exchange traders, which led to the dollar's hike to over LE7 on the black market while the government fell short of meeting the growing demand for the dollar and other foreign currencies. Egyptian citizens especially lower social brackets, bore the brunt of the negative impacts of that hasty decision as prices hiked and the majority of people could neither make both ends meet nor afford to get their basic needs.
Professor of Economics in the Faculty of Economics and Political Science, Dr. Gouda Abd El-Khaliq thinks that the floatation decision was the worst economic decision taken by the government this year, especially as it was untimely because the Egyptian economy was facing a then imminent shock as a result of America's provocation of Iraq and its concomitant consequences, regarding Egypt's foreign exchange revenues and costs. It was also a bad decision as it was based on a misunderstanding of the foreign exchange market in Egypt.
Dr. Mahmoud Abd El Fadeil, professor in the Faculty of Economics and Political Science, emphasizes that the rise in prices is the worst Egyptian economy indicator this year. Such a rise was brought about by several factors some of which were internal like economic mismanagement and others were external factors, he added.
The negative indicators recorded by the Egyptian economy this year are due to the fact that the Egyptian economy has not yet recovered from the state of recession since 1998 and most economic indicators are therefore far from good. "Growth rates, for instance, are still low not exceeding 2.5%, according to the CBE latest circular. Domestic debt till June 30th 2003 rose to LE365 billion, representing 90% of GDP, besides an external detb in the vicinity of $30 billion or over LE200 billion. Such indicators are so low because they are linked to the state of stagnation and recession in addition to high inflationary rates due to two reasons; firstly, an increase in the budget deficit and secondly the pound floatation decision, which led to higher inflationary rates," Al-Isawi said.
GOVT CONSIDERS WITH BUSINESSMEN RULES OF PARTICIPATION IN IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION
TIME NOT RIPE FOR PRIVATIZING STATE-OWNED BANKS: EGYPTIAN BANKERS
It is the government that will decide whether it is possible or not to privatize them as the government is the owner of these banks and their capital, he affirmed.
Hashad affirmed that the state of stagnation and economic slowdown may be the reason that stands against the privatization of public banks due to the low value of assets in light of stagnation and hence the low prospects of profits.
On the other hand, chairman of the Al-Watany Bank of Egypt Ahmed Qurah said that the privatization of public banks is unacceptable as these banks must remain under the control of the State so that the tragedy of foreigners controlling and owning Egyptian banks may not recur.

Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) Group General Guide, counsellor Ma'moun al-Hudhaibi, warned against American interference in formulating Arab curricula. He proposed an Ikhwan plan of action to deal with the education issue.
"This disruption in our curricula is apparent in many aspects. We still want our educational institutions to be independent of administrative control and political corruption, which seems to be a far-fetched hope in many Muslim countries. Many restrictions are still imposed on students and professors' freedom of peaceful expression and forming the mechanisms and institutions of such expression.
"Every fruitful knowledge whether religious or secular is needed by our religion. Our nation fell short of acquiring such secular sciences for a long time. This may be attributed to a mistaken understanding of the meaning of 'knowledge', which was ordained to be acquired by Islam.

In consequence of drugs, retaliation, abductions and holdups, the Al-Nekheila Island in Upper Egypt, Assiut Governorate has come under tight security measures involving armoured vehicles and troops.
All indications point that illegal drugs sold in the vicinity of the island under the Al-Nekheila Village in Abu Tig administrative district, 400 km south Cairo, are sold at low prices, according to a security source. This shows the stupendous quantities of drugs produced by the island and the vicinity.
An eyewitness living near the island said a family put up butane cylinders on trees around and at the approaches of the village, which are electrically connected current using a special power generator. Gunmen there warn that if they were attacked by security forces, they would detonate such cylinders, thus expectedly causing heavy casualties in the island where over 3,000 people live.
Once both families are engaged in gunfight, traffic on the Cairo-Aswan highway is closed. They sometimes take unlucky passengers hostage who accidentally appear there for bargaining.

The rate of subscription to the Internet hit 9% in work places and 8% in houses. Subscription rate noticeably increases in the regions of Naples, Ramallah, and Hebron.
AL-ASSAD TO AL-HAYAT: ISRAEL'S TRYING TO DRAG SYRIA AND REGION INTO OTHER WARS
This came in a detailed interview with Al-Hayat newspaper where the Syrian President replied to enquiries about the most important issue in the Middle East heated files.

Paris is convinced that Syria would be mistaken if it believed believing that the US preoccupation with major problems in Iraq and the peace process in the Middle East would alleviate pressure on Damascus.
Those milieus consider that the incumbent US administration gives Israel a large margin to move in, which implies that Syria is in danger.

The agreement term is 25 years, renewable for 10 years.
Nonetheless, it seems that such steps were not enough to stop voting on the draft act in the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Congress, as the number of the act advocates is on the increase in the Congress and the administration's institutions. There is semi-unanimity on passing the act.
Meanwhile, Syrian oil tops the list of Syrian exports to the US hitting $148 million.
Syria was the only country among the seven countries enrolled in the terrorism-sponsoring countries list, according to the American definition, that have diplomatic relations with Washington, thanks to its key role in the peace process since its beginning 12 years ago.

CBE TO STOP PEGGING POUND TO DOLLAR
Solutions will be discussed to select the best of such solutions to be put into effect after they are scrutinized, he said, pointing out that a decision on stop pegging the pound to the dollar should not be simply attributed to the retreat of the dollar rate of exchange worldwide, as it is a temporary situation and can be recovered in the future.
The establishment of a basket of currencies is very important. However, this is not the proper time to take such a decision in view of constant fluctuations on international monetary markets. The euro and sterling rates of exchange may, for instance, collapse and the dollar rises and vice versa, he noted. If a basket of currencies is set up, Egypt will buy the euro at a high rate and if it plummets to its real value against the dollar domestic economy will sustain heavy losses while it is suffering from constant losses due to the depreciation of the pound against other currencies including the dollar, he indicated.
The establishment of a basket of currencies is an ideal solution at present, but it is better to be set up at a time when international markets are stable, which is not so distant as some might think, he pinpointed.

This was stated by an official source with the Ministry pointing out that such a programme comes within the framework of the Ministry of Foreign Trade "efforts" to raise the level of competitive and exportation capabilities of small and medium sized projects in Egypt and to enhance its important role especially for increasing growth rates, raising income and creating job opportunities.
The debts included those owed by the government, economic authorities and the National Investment Bank (NIB).

Foreign investments coming to Egypt retreated from 1.6 million dollars in 2000 to 509 million dollars in 2001, said a recent report issued by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE).
The Egyptian parliament voiced its concern about the initial estimates of the CBE report which asserted the retreat of foreign investment inflows to Egypt. The parliament maintained that achieving growth rates targeted by the development plan requires a strong push for both national and foreign investments, which was achieved by a developing state like Brazil. By so doing, direct foreign investments may hit 5 billion dollars annually.
For his part head of Egyptian Industries Federation Abdel-Mon'em So'udi said that the potential of any strong economy depends on the incentives and exemptions granted by the state to local and foreign investors, like many countries that facilitate measures to have a real and effective contribution to the economy, provide job openings to put an end to the unemployment problem.

ISRAEL PLANS TO ATTACK IRAN!
A high-level Iranian source said on Monday that it would kick off negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) next week on the NPT additional protocol, which envisions a tight control on Iran's nuclear activities, they said.
Spokesman for the Iranian government Abdullah Ramadan Zada said, "We have heard such words for a long time. We will not hesitate to use the country's entire force to defend our interests against any foreign attack."
The Russian spokesman attributed the delay to the lack of components necessary for the operation of the station, while a source told the Russian Itar-Tas news agency that Tehran had not yet received equipment from another country, but he failed to identify it.
In exclusives to Spiegel Online website, he said that if Berlin agreed, the conflict in the Middle East would be aggravated.
The director of the center pointed out that until now Israel did not sign the NPT.
Neither German nor European laws allow exporting submarines to Israel, he pointed out, adding, "The European law on weapon exports forbids selling weapons to conflict areas. Additionally, before concluding any weapon deal it should be certain that the recipient country respects human rights, which could not be alleged in the Israeli case."
"I was pleased to see Israel taking similar steps in response to terrorist acts launched from Lebanon by attacking those who rule Lebanon from Damascus."
Under this heading, Abdel-Wahab Badrakhan, deputy chief editor of Al-Hayat wrote to say: Jacques Chirac complains about the international community's inability to resist what he called Bush-Sharon axis.
Therefore, George W. Bush will remain convinced that his success and stay in the White House are conditional upon his adherence to such goals which are criticized not only by the world but by part of the American public opinion as well.
Israel has also established a new type of aggressiveness under full American auspices.
Thus, Bush's support of the Syrian strike was tantamount to a public inauguration of Israel's in-depth approach to the Iraqi situation.
Washington, nevertheless, regards the commonly known Israeli nuclear capability neither as mass destruction weapons, nor as arousing any concerns nor justifying any wars or even any reactions by an official spokesman.

WHY DID JAPANESE PRODUCTS DISAPPEAR FROM EGYPTIAN MARKET?
Or is it the Egyptian market that cannot absorb the modern Japanese technology?
Head of Middle East and Africa department at the Commercial Policies Bureau with the Japanese Ministry of Economy said that Japan not only concentrates on the local market but also has markets in France and factories in China. As for the Egyptian market, it gives us pleasure to have presence on it and we have a respectable agent there but the problem lies in the fact that the Egyptian market does not accommodate the Japanese product with its high quality and high prices. Moreover, there are no new guarantees or incentives to open branches for the Japanese companies in Egypt, let alone the restrictions, protection measures, customs charges that cost the Japanese exporter much more than the cost on local or other foreign markets.
A number of Egyptian businessmen managed to win the trust of the Japanese market, as three metro stations in Japan were finished with Egyptian ceramics and the Egyptian jam floods the Japanese market. We need the Japanese products to transfer modern technology.

He revealed that the volume of joint projects between the two countries hit 50 million dollars while the volume of works of Egyptian construction companies in Morocco hit 60 million dollars.
Filfila called on the committee to probe on the possibility of adding agricultural commodities as well as processed agricultural commodities to th e agreement. He also underpinned the necessity of allowing businessmen and citizens of the two countries to enter without entry visas and extending visa validity period to 3 years instead of 3 months.
He laid it bare that the operation of this zone was accelerated according to confirmed orders by the Minister of Foreign Trade Youssef Boutros Ghali, as it was considered the main gate for the Egyptian exports oriented to the Iraqi markets, especially as this zone was only 35 kilometers of the Iraqi borders.

PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR CAUTIONS ARABS AGAINST DRIFTING TOWARDS ISRAELI PROVOCATIONS
Al-Baz was addressing a gathering of assistant teaching staff at Egyptian universities on Monday.
SERIOUS ISRAELI ESCALATION AGAINST EGYPT
Mofaz said he did not know for what purpose that armament was directed. He went on to say that he did not think that Egypt's security was threatened by any country.
The sources sarcastically said, "Will Egypt use such power against Yemen or Libya?"
Such statements came out at a time when Israeli Haaretz revealed Tel Aviv's intention to sign a joint contract with the USA to produce the American future tank, which is light, uses wheels and can be air-borne.
The statement underlined the importance of activating the peace process, the right of the Palestinian people to have an independent state and refugees' right to return to their fatherland to enjoy their full rights. Israel, furthermore, should have to implement all UN and Security Council resolutions. It should, therefore, withdraw from Arab and Palestinian occupied territories including Shebaa Farms, south Lebanon, the Golan Heights and Jerusalem.
ISRAELI THREATS!
He added, "We are concerned about the growth of Egypt's power and wonders for what purpose that armament was. I cannot see that Egypt is threatened by any country. He attributed the alleged Israeli concerns to the possibility of Egypt having another leadership that would change its stance towards Israel.
Yediot Aharonot newspaper, then, quoted Israel military sources voicing Israeli fears that these arms deals might prejudice Israel's qualitative superiority in the field of military armament and that Egypt might be on its way to the achievement of a strategic balance with Israel.
This is only natural in light of both Egypt and Israel reliance on one source of armament i.e. the USA and the American Administration's keenness on Israel's share of military assistance outweighing Egypt's.
Egyptian Minister of Information Safwat Al-Sherif, who doubles as Secretary General of the National Democratic Party (NDP), started yesterday (22nd October) to hold meetings with opposition parties' leaders in preparation for an all-out dialogue that would include all political powers.
Al-Sherif confirmed that the NDP set no conditions on the national dialogue with other parties and NGOs, pointing out that the dialogue would consider political, economic and social actions. "The main document that the NDP will submit is a paper on citizenship and democracy rights that was presented in the annual congress in addition to policies and discussion papers approved by the congress," Al-Sherif pursued.
Independent deputies in the People's Assembly, 63 in number, expressed reservations about the dialogue, which the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) in Egypt prepares for conducting with other political parties regarding political and economic reform causes.
The independents consider any return to the list system a political conspiracy against them, especially as such a law, if passed, will minimize independents' chances of taking part in the political life and would be an obvious violation of the Constitution, which stressed the principle of equity among all citizens.
The list of those who visited Egypt includes a number of prominent Iraqi leading figures who played a pivotal role in opposing ousted Iraqi regime.
Egyptian sources declined to explain justifications for that and defused to confirm or negate extending an official invitation to Chalabi to visit Cairo. The sources pointed out that the Egyptian capital had no reservations about any body and that it seeks to make contacts with all parties without exceptions.
Nonetheless, Egyptian sources, on the other hand, said that the Egyptian policy towards Iraq was neither new nor confined to the economic side only, but rather aimed at helping Iraqi people to weather their current crisis and restore their Arab and regional place as soon as possible. They noted that even trade and commercial exchange with the former Iraqi regime was meant to alleviate pressure on Iraqi people due to the international sanctions imposed on them.

He said, "The economic relations between Israel and Jordan is the best model for peaceful cooperation."
It stipulated that Israel should be paid a commission for each deal to the value of 11.7% Jordan requested. The commission was, then, reduced to 8% for five years and now Jordan demands that such a reduction should be retained.
In 2002, the volume of Jordanian exports to Israel hit $47.9 million against $69.1 million worth of imports.
HOW CAN SYRIA FACE AMERICAN ATTEMPTS OF "ISOLATION" AND ISRAELI "THREATS"? Under this headline, Al-Hayat publishes a news analysis by Ibrahim Hemeidi, which runs to the following effect:
There is no doubt that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon undergoes an internal crisis.
Following the Israeli raid on Ain Al-Saheb, near Damascus, in the first violation of the disengagement agreement since 1974, Syria opted to refer the cause to the UN Security Council.
Syria informed President George W. Bush that it would vote for Resolution 1511 on the grounds that he would choose two out of a list of sanctions included in the "Syria Accountability" act once it was endorsed by the Congress with a majority.
"Concerning fighting terrorism, we cooperate with the USA honestly and truly, but nobody can impose a certain concept of terrorism on us," the source said.
Syria's joining the "international unanimity" in New York was an indicator to ruling out the "isolation" option. However, the announcement of the Spanish King's arrival to Damascus on Monday and the timing of holding a round of partnership negotiations in Brussels on the day of putting the Syria Accountability act on the vote are two proofs that the "European option" would contribute to undermining the American "blockade walls" and strengthening the Syrian position with Washington when it is high time for negotiation.
Salem Chalabi, nicknamed in the US, as Sam, is forty years old. He is a graduate of Faculty of Law, Yale University and a member of a famous law firm in New York. He worked in London too.
In spite of the Intifada and although this settlement and others were exposed to Palestinian attacks, Ziel thought it to be the optimal place to bring up his children. Rather, he thought it was better than any other place in the US.
Mark Ziel had established a law firm in Jerusalem under the name of Ziel Goldberg and Co., which is regarded as one of the most famous law firms in Israel whose basic task is to help Israeli enterprises to expand their business abroad.
The law firm also provides consulting services to the Iraqi chambers of commerce and Iraqi Industrialists Union.
IRAQ'S OIL PRODUCTION TO HIT 3.5 MILLION BARRELS NEXT MARCH
The finance of the production plan was allocated out of the revenues of the Ministry of Oil and approved in an investment plan of 2004. The allocation hit some 1.210 billion dollars and 30 billion Iraqi dinars to implement the production plan apart from the reconstruction of Iraq.
The American aircraft were also participating in monitoring the no-fly zone to the south of Iraq for 10 years before the war.
"Despite the withdrawal of American forces from Kuwait, they will be redeployed in the country to take part in joint military exercises next fall," US commander of the Air Force Nine said.
He added that the Pentagon might also close down some camps in the Kuwaiti desert, pointing out that the US would continue using Kuwaiti territories in transporting forces to and from Iraq.
GCC Secretary General Abdel-Rahman Al-Atiya told Al-Hayat that the interior ministers "in a long-awaited step approved referring a recommendation to the leaders of the GCC in their coming summit in Kuwait, slated for the last third of December next, calling for issuing a unified passport for the citizens of the GCC countries".
Observers confirmed that following certain incidents foremost of which was that the two conflicting parties confirmed that the remaining talk issues were very easy to solve, adding that they had left wars behind their backs forever. Moreover, the two sides exchanged words of praise in their speeches and press statements and spoke about the eternal partnership in ruling Sudan. It is worth mentioning that the ruling Congress Party Secretary General alluded that there might be a possible merger between the party and the SPLA to run the coming election.
Is there really a deal that has been clinched and required that talking about these issues should stop for the time being?
He confirmed that the woman has terrific administrative abilities thanks to the virtues of commitment and patience in performing administrative work. Addressing the General Planning Council on Wednesday, which comprises heads of economic and banking institutions, Gaddafi highlighted the necessity of preparing plans for transferring work to houses for there is too much work in offices that can be done in houses.
Syrian chief of staff, Brigadier Hassan Torkmani renewed his call on the armed forces to be prepared to repulse any potential Israeli aggression pointing out that Ariel Sharon's government was keen on expanding the tension circle, which leaves the Middle East on a volcano."
The recent attitude, however, came after the Israeli radio quoted the Israeli Ministry of Defence political circle head, General Amos Gellad as saying, "Should Syria fail to get the message, in reference to the latest airstrike inside the Syrian territories in October 5th, a reevaluation of the situation would take place and required steps would be take". This comes in contrast to what the Minister of Defence Shaol Mofaz said, "I do not think that any war winds are blowing from Damascus.
These laws reportedly allow foreign investors to remit their profits and other interests achieved abroad without any hindrance or tax accounting.
It is common knowledge that Iraqi Kurdistan is subject to local laws and uses the former Iraqi currency that had been cancelled by the former Iraqi regime. The Kurdish forces established commercial and economic relations with the neighbouring countries and some world countries within a bilateral framework that is not subject to Iraqi public laws.
PRESSURE PREVENTS DECLARATION OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT IN THE AL
The shocking report contains elaborate monitoring of reality in many Arab countries including Egypt where illiteracy rates reached about 42% despite adult education programmes.
IN REPLY TO INDIA BUYING ISRAELI RADAR, PAKISTAN BUYS CHINESE MISSILES
Both Pakistan and China could produce a sophisticated plane GF17 which will enter service shortly after it has already been jointly commissioned in Peking with the two countries air forces commanders attending.
Yesterday a senior official with the American State Department warned the Syrian government that the endorsement of the Syrian Accountability Act would not be the ultimate step which the American Administration could take to "punish Damascus if the latter chose to continue its support of terrorism and threats to American interests" in the Middle East.
EGYPT'S RULING NDP MAINTAINS MEETINGS WITH OPPOSITION AMID DOUBTS ABOUT WORKABILITY
Asked about why the ruling NDP was the common denominator of such meetings as if it seemed to run the dialogue, Grouping Party Secretary-General Refaat al-Saaid, who accompanied party leader Khalid Mohie Eddin in his meeting with the NDP's leaders, said although the previous dialogues with the NDP fell well short of their targets, the new dialogue should not be rejected. What others say ought to be dealt with according to its overt import. The dialogue this time appears to be different, and the NDP opens up to an earnest dialogue, he said, noting that a relevant confirmation was made by NDP leaders and that the NDP's 1st annual congress announced willingness to comply with opposition parties' long-standing demands, including an amendment to the law on political parties, the law on exercise of political rights and the election system to guarantee more transparency and avoid lavishness and thuggery. "The NDP responds to us so we have to monitor how much it changed."
GADDAFI: SHAME ACCUMULATES ON ARABS
"The Arabs ask us to have patience and stay with them while shame accumulates everyday and Libya will not partake in such historical shame."
They were followed by laws on services, 13,000; state, over 10,000; International relations, over 4,000; citizens' relations, about 4,000 and the laws on security, 2000, the study noted.
The company had decided to raise consignment duties on Egyptian agricultural and horticultural exports to Europe and collect them in the US dollar whether for cargo or passenger planes as of 18/1/2004, which pushed exporters into a tight corner and reduced competitiveness of Egypt's products in Europe.
Car fines in Egypt hit 1.539 million in 2003 mostly including security and check conditions, brakes, seat belt and means of control, a recent report disclosed.
In the last 20 years, 30,000 kilometers of roads and 950 new flyovers have been constructed, he added.
They called for necessarily removing the uncharted road bumps, which are considered a main reason for accidents because they do not meet technical specifications.
Speculations say that following amalgamation Banque Misr would issue a decision granting Misr Exterior a transitional period from one to three years. During that period Banque Misr would appoint an official to run Misr Exterior. The administration's task would be preparing for official merger. Mohamed Kafafi is expected to occupy that position, as he is deputy chairman of Misr Exterior and a board member in Banque Misr.
These measures may lead to new pressures that would push the Egyptian exchange market into new dollar crises, the experts pointed out.
Al-Qarnshawi did not deny that the rationalization of importation during the past period and the insistence on the application of decree 506 on the payment of 75% of the export proceeds in foreign cash to banks as well as the rise in the Suez Canal and tourism sector revenues and the growth of exports contributed to calming the market down and reduced the dollar hoarding operations by individuals particularly after the decline of its rate over the past few days on the unofficial market by 10 piasters at one go.
Former CBE governor Ismail Hassan said the current state of the market is more of suspense than of stability because the market sees for the first time a great decline in demand for currency. At the same time, the supply is not abundant enough, but the limits of dollar cash exchange in banks very much suits the growth of speculation in other currencies mainly including the euro and the pound Sterling against the backdrop of strong expectations that they would continue to rise along with their demand after the application of the commercial part of the partnership agreement with the European Union.
Treasury bills issues hit LE59.516 billion or $10 billion approximately in October last in comparison to LE56.209 billion ($9.4 billion) in September last.
100-MILLION-DOLLAR KOREAN LOAN SEEKING BORROWERS FOR YEAR
EKBC Chairman Sharif al-Gabali said the Egyptian private sector's exploitation of the Korean loan would pave the way for more credit facilities on the part of Korea to spur further deals between businesses from both countries.
Suez Canal Bank Saving Coffer Manager Mohamed Said was quoted as saying that the bank would seek to boost its saving coffer issues, mainly medium-and-long-term ones which enjoy distinguished interest rates capable of attracting citizens' savings and spurring them to turn their dollar savings to pound ones so that they might benefit by high interest rates especially as the dollar exchange rate is most likely to depreciate or at least remain static against the Egyptian pound.
For his part, Secretary-General of the Egyptian Banks Union Ahmed Qura said bold decisions and actions are required to raise interest rates. Egypt resorted to this mechanism early the 1990s and could rope in huge investments by hiking interest rate, he noted.
Egypt earned 803,3 thousand U.S. dollars' worth of exports last year compared to 501,7 thousand U.S. dollars in 2002, up 60.09 percent.
TAX EVASION IN EGYPT ACCOUNTS FOR $3.2 BILLION IN 2003
Tax official Abdel Aziz Ahmed Numan says that the volume of taxes collected by the Taxation Department this year amounting to LE13 billion is considered quite an achievement. The LE7 billion not yet collected, is not regarded as too much as a number of evaders had handed themselves over. Settlements with them are underway so that part of the sum might be paid while the rest might be paid by installments, a process that has already begun.
Banks funded several major projects last year, mainly including Alexandria for Iron and Steel, said Mohamed Al-Deeb, general manager and board member of the National Societe Generale Bank.
REACTIONS TO CUTTING INTEREST RATE There have been divers reactions to banks' tendency to cut the interest rate on deposits.
Helmi expected the interest rate reduction to continue so long as there were no available investments or confining them to retreat banking for individuals only or treasury bills and CBE deposits if the investment proceeds low.
He denied any repercussions on the market due to that step, noting that raising the interest rate was dependent upon the state's monetary policy set and run by the CBE. He pointed out other means to increase interest rates such as pumping treasury bills and bonds at high prices.
He warned against taking hasty decisions regarding interest rate, which may reflect on investment and lending opportunities. Changing interest rates should be considered first, he demanded.
On the other hand, former CBE governor Ismail Hassan, and incumbent president of Misr-Iran Bank, said, "Comparison with the conditions in 1991 needs reconsideration as what happened at the time came within a package of financial and monetary measures represented in the imposition of sales tax and remission of some of Egypt's external debts." The increase of interest rates led to a decline in growth rates to 2%, he noted.
Bankers and economists warned against the government's tendency to put up dollar saving coffers with an interest rate of 2.5% via the Post Authority with the claim of attracting clients of the unofficial market and eliminating such a market. Experts affirmed that effectuating such a step would activate dollarization once again and increase pressure on the Egyptian pound not to mention doing harm to the relative stability that the exchange market underwent over the last two months.
For his part, former head of the Banks Union Abdel-Salam Omar said it is illogical to put up dollar saving coffers with a 2.5% interest rate while the dollar is suffering deterioration on the international market against European currencies. He affirmed that such a coffer would double the government burdens and repeat the problem of dollar bonds which were put up by the government at an interest rate of 7%. Meanwhile, the dollar interest rate declined to less than 1%, thus costing the government about 500 million dollars annually.
EGYPT-US FREE TRADE AGREEMENT TO BE CONCLUDED Egypt completed its economic file that will be submitted to the American administration during President Mubarak's coming visit to the US in April or May next.
The source denied the presence of any political problems that hurdle free trade negotiations, pointing out that none of the Americans spoke about any political problems and that Washington speaks with one voice in respect with the free trade agreement which Egypt hopes to be clinched.
We want to add new dimensions to the relation through expanding the commercial and financial relations between the two countries and injecting more investments.
In a related development, American sources in Cairo stressed American President George Bush's desire to develop commercial relations and increase economic cooperation with Egypt during the coming period.
Minister of Foreign Trade Youssef Botros Ghali said the row over dumping duties on Turkish rebar imports continued to be unsettled. Furthermore, these duties will be left off some Turkish business that adhere to Egyptian prices, he said.
ESTABLISHMENT OF FREE ZONE BETWEEN EGYPT, SOUTH AFRICAN COUNTRIES PROBED
Dr. Ghali said that the visit aimed at developing bilateral relations between Egypt and South Africa especially at the economic level, adding that a memo of understanding would be signed between the two countries regarding the exchange of delegations in the field of exhibitions and customs to encourage participation in public or specialized exhibitions mounted in Egypt and South Africa with a view to energizing bilateral trade.
For her part, Kawaguchi pointed out that Egyptian-Japanese relations entered a new turning point following Mubarak-Koizumi meeting in Cairo last June.
In its meeting two days ago, the Press Syndicate Council announced turning down a USAID grant to the value of $1 million and 350 thousand. The council emphasized that turning down the grant was based on the Syndicate's principle of rejecting conditional grants or those grants implemented in the syndicate's absence (without consulting the syndicate). The USAID had stipulated using the sum for training 50 journalists in small American universities for eight weeks.
National professional syndicates are getting ready for the political dialogue run by the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) with opposition parties. The Press Syndicate invited chairpersons of other syndicates to convene a meeting next week on how to participate in that dialogue.
Leaders of the NDP have earlier met with representatives of leftist Tagamou' Party at the weekend and will meet chairman of the Arab Nasserite Party, Dia' Eddin Daoud within days.
While the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) was making ready for the third round of the so-called "National Dialogue" with opposition Arab Nasserite Party, after two relatively quiet rounds with the liberal Wafd Party and the leftist Tagamo'h, the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHRO) severely criticized that dialogue, considering it " a cosmetic step and non-binding consultation to falsely convince the international community that national dialogues were being carried in Egypt in an atmosphere of freedom and democracy".
INTELLECTUALS SEEK TO FOUND POLITICAL PARTY CALLING FOR RETURNING TO EGYPTIAN PHARAONIC ROOTS
Loyalty to Arabism came with the era of late president Nasser and the July 23rd, 1952 Revolution, he said. "But, we are Egyptians, rather than Arabs and it is no shame to say so. The attempt to mix Islam and Arabism is deliberately designed. Turkish, Pakistani and Malaysian people are Muslims, but they cannot speak Arabic."
Strongly worded criticisms were launched by unionist leaderships to the government performance which failed to control successive waves of price rises, the bread loaf crisis and the deterioration of conditions of workers and public enterprise sector companies.
He added, "We won't be able to continue like this (domestic public debt burdens) due to possible foreign pressure on us (implying criticisms directed by international donor bodies because of the aggravation of public debt burdens and the rise in the budget deficit.)
However, a Health Ministry official emphasized that Egypt is v oid of the disease and that the efforts exerted by the ministry to prevent the entry of the disease-carrying fly were successful.
Player Ahmed Adli and his trainer Hassan Khaled were also detained in a hospital in Greece.
The number of escorting guard should also be standardized among ministers including the premier, said the proposal and the number of guard for the residential premises of ministers, government members and senior officials should also be reduced.
The deputies headed by Seif Mahmoud, Mohamed Khalil Qutah and Dr. Hamdi Hassan pointed out that checks proved that some officials have guard cars which are worth between LE1 million and LE1.5 million due to the exorbitant price of a Cherokee which is worth more than LE600 thousand.
RAMADAN CHARITY BANQUETS AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
Ramadan charity banquets started at the time of the Islamic conquest and were most evident at the Fatimid age.
After the 1952 Revolution, such banquets completely vanished. In the early 1970's and the start of the economic opening up policy and the emergence of new social categories seeking to establish their presence in the vanguard of society, the banquets returned in a new form ranging from the "super" to five star banquets.
RAMADAN AND FOOTBALL... BANNED POLITICAL ACTIVITY
Head of the University Guard, Mahmoud Abdel-Latif regarded such activities as a kind of banned political practices, upon which he called central security forces.
Statistics point out that the local market consumed 24,904 tons of yameesh in 2001 at the value of 27.716 million pounds.
Surprisingly enough, initial statistics of the current year 2003 point out that yameesh importation value went up to 40 million dollars or some 2,004,520,000 pounds at the official market exchange rate that hits 613 piasters.
According to the Central Bank of Egypt's statistics for the last three months, deals valued at 81.1 million dollars or equivalent of 4,965,003,000 pounds were concluded to import dairy products, yogurt, honey and eggs.
Tension began when Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said he did not rule out that the Israeli military might come under an Egyptian-Syrian attack just as happened in October 1973, justifying his claims by saying, "I cannot rule out this potentiality in a region that has not yet accepted the existence of Israel."
He made it certain that the same thing would take place with the Palestinians.
Although several Egyptian officials said Egypt had nothing to do with such smuggling operations and the opening of such tunnels started at Palestinian territories, the Israeli side escalated tension in this point when Sharon's Office released a statement that the Israeli army picked up a senior Palestinian Navy officer who admitted that he had smuggled arms from Egypt to Gaza and distributed them to diverse Palestinian organizations, identifying them as missiles, bombers and munitions.
The paper quoted the minister as saying, "We are anxiously watching Egypt's rising military force. We wonder: what is the target of this rising force?
It also said that Israeli intelligence services had information on Egypt's growing military human force and several combat means recently bought by Egypt.
We note that Maariv sent two significant indications on the same topic published on October 17th, 2003.
On October 16th, 2003, the Egyptian president raised his eyebrows at Sharon's statements on a potential attack by Egypt and Syria on Israel by saying that there was a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. He added that although Sharon realized this fact, he made such bizarre remarks.
Such a tactical publication represents an Israeli way of sustained escalation, reacting to Egypt's quietening remarks with more escalation by the minister of defence.
Second; Sharon's government sends articulate warnings to Egypt in a bid to prevent it from interfering whether politically or otherwise as part of an imminent large-scale attack on Syria.
Could Sharon get the green light to do so?
He told Al-Wafd that the U.S. would cut its aid to Egypt gradually down to 400 million U.S. dollars annually by 2009.
U.S. allocations for Egypt will not be able to finance power, sanitation, water and communication projects, which were funded in the past, in the years to come, the U.S. official added. The U.S. won't stop financing democracy support programs, and the USAID has no plans to stop such programs, he said.
Following the two meetings held by government officials with leaders of the leftist Tagamo'h (Grouping) party and the liberal Al-Wafd party, it transpires that the government seeks to besiege the group, not only by excluding it from participation in the dialogue, but also through severing its relations with opposition forces. The government gives parties some advantages in return for giving up their attempts to ally with Ikhwan either secretly or publicly to win their votes in syndicates or parliament.
Al-Hayat learnt that Guidance Office, the highest authority in Ikhwan Group, probed plans to prevent the government from severing the good relations linking the group with opposition parties. The next stage will witness a reverse move in the direction of opposition. The group will focus on expecting that the government will not meet political reform obligations, thus achieving no benefit from the NDP dialogue.
The cutoff affecting the hospital and the vicinity came due to replacement and renovation works for the water network. The hospital had to buy water to be used only in surgical operations. Unpleasant odour spread in bathrooms and patients' rooms and cooking stopped.
Concerned government sources uncovered that over 30% of those families are children of Egyptian mothers married to Sudanese spouses would benefit from the new amendment to the act which has been issued due to an initiative by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to deal with inter-marriages between the Egyptian and the Sudanese especially in border governorates.
According to parliamentary sources, the bill amending the nationality act would be referred to the Egyptian parliament in the first week of its new parliamentary session.
MOSSAD WARNS ISRAELIS AGAINST PLAN BY HIZBULLAH IN HORN OF AFRICA
The warnings, however, include tourists and even Israeli airlines.
Nour Eddin affirmed that the construction of new ports is imperative particularly in light of the rivalry in the region. He pointed out that Ain Sokhna Port was constructed under the BOT system with a concession of 25 years and East Port Said in the same system with a concession of 30 years after which they would be turned to the State to run them.
Strangely enough, there are other concessions in the new ports like the inability of the customs to inspect containers, he said. Citing an example, he said several cars are seized in the road while smuggling goods for which no customs were collected. What is astonishing is that the chairman of the customs department said he follows the containers through satellite.
In a few days' time, chief of the port authority Vice-Admiral Ibrahim Youssef will announce the completion of the development of electronic management.
The authority chairman added that the establishment of the electronic management required digging and implanting cables and pipes and installing towers and surveillance cameras in the port starting from the entry gates to the roads, quays, installations, and exit gates. This also required the creation of a fiber-optic network and preparing server computers, a storage network, and a centre for operating and managing the network. Required also were telecommunications devices, information networks, and electronic gates operating through fingerprint that do not allow other than those registered to enter to ensure the disciplinary of work.
Since the electronic management would be closed to its personnel, how can the service be provided to customers?
Sixteen surveillance towers were constructed. They include cameras and are linked to the surveillance system of gas companies to tighten security control of all specialist harbours inside the Damietta Port Authority. The goings-on will even be recorded through the cameras with a memory that would last for 180 days. The recorded image can be enlarged.
"Interest in this port is ascribed to the fact that it is the only port that has a surplus in addition to implementing the state's national strategy to develop Sinai, Suez Canal governorates and Upper Egypt as population attractive districts and constructing industrial zones," said Minister of Transport Hamdi Al-Shayeb.
Al-Shayeb revealed that due to the development operations in the port, 3,000-passenger ships unloaded in the port. Wheat storage areas were increased from 50,000 to 80,000 tons, he added, pointing out that container handling rose to 186,000 cubic metres.
Committee on transport at the People's Assembly under the chairmanship of Hamdi Al-Tahan held two consecutive meetings. The committee first meeting was held on 9th May instant to discuss the urgent statement submitted by Al-Badrili Farghali, MP of Tagamo'h Party, pertaining to concessions granted to container terminals operative in new ports.
For his part, Al-Tahan said that he is confident that Minister of Finance position is similar to position of ministers of transport and enterprise sector.
The minister affirmed that political stability was the most important factor in attracting world investments to Egypt and that there was no fear of any competition from other countries in that respect.
There are several main reasons behind this rise. First, the supply and demand information is inaccurate, which is the result of the inaccuracy of the data supplied by export and import authorities, plus the growth of demand in countries like China and India due to their rapid economic growth.
Fourth, crude prices have been constant for three years, which means that there is stability in crude prices, but not in petroproduct prices.
The figures for Egypt's oil exports differ from one year to another. Is there an explanation to this?
Confirmed figures say that we have exported 17 million tons this month, and the figure will increase to 19 million tons by the end of this year.
What is the reason for this admiration of the Egyptian experiment by international companies?
Moreover, Turkey is now making offers to us, after the Turks have found that the Arab pipeline is becoming a reality and that the line can actually run through their territories into Italy and Greece. We have also begun negotiations with Romania to sell our natural gas to them. In fact, the existence of options for Egypt in the export field gives us a better position in negotiations with other countries, and we get this strength from the fact that we do not talk but act.
So, to answer your question, there will not be a strong effect on investments directed to Egypt.
Now to the petrochemical industry.
The problem does not lie in dumping that threatens the petrochemical industry: it lies in the private sector's failure to produce propylene in addition to polypropylene, for investors have contented themselves with production of polypropylene.
However, the real problem is that there is no integrated plan for the industries related to petrochemicals. I have discussed this problem with the Minister of Industry to find a solution to it.
I want just one investor to come forward and say that he came to invest in the petroleum sector and was turned back.
But what the private sector is interested in at present is only laying down the pipeline network that will carry natural gas to houses, so as to make high profits on investments that may reach 80%.
I imagine that Tharwa will be like British Petroleum, Exxon, Mobil and Shell, although its development will be rapid because it will combine all past experiences. Besides, some Canadian, Korean and American companies want to go into joint ventures with Tharwa.
Yes, there is some risk, but if we look at scientific progress, we will find that the rate of risk goes down with the advancement of modern equipment, which give indications about whether the search will yield oil or gas or neither through three-dimensional seismic survey that is done before drilling.
Will you expand on this experiment?
Our plan is to establish large and strong specialized entities that operate in all the fields related to oil, gas and petrochemicals and have good managements. We also aim at reinforcing managements and liberating them from restrictions through the participation of the private sector in investment.
Frankly speaking, everyone can do the work assigned to him successfully. How many dollars has Egypt saved from the new gas equation?
Why has the Higher Committee for Petroleum Wealth been established?
We are actually considering this idea, and the refinery will be established because of dire need for it, despite the fact that we have the largest number of oil refineries in the region.
Agiba demanded its Insurance claim which hits 230,437 dollars, but the court postponed the cause.
Agiba said in its indictment that it concluded an agreement on February 3rd with Al-Chark Insurance. The agreement stipulated that Al-Chark Insurance should pay two thirds of the value of the policy, whose total value hit 270,000 dollars when, if the platform is exposed to any sea accident.
Enterprise Sector Minister Dr. Mukhtar Khattab said that an agreement had been signed to settle all debts of enterprise sector to creditor banks through a fund to be financed by the surpluses of profit-making companies, the proceeds of selling companies as well as the Finance Ministry's shares of profits.
He said there were 200 thousand employees in the loss-making companies with LE2.4 billion as pay.
He emphasized that not a single company sold had been liquidated. Only the name of the company was liquidated. He pointed out that all economic activities and labour were sold to investors who operate them quite efficiently.
The Palestinian people will continue defending their sanctities to liberate them from ferocious occupation.
This announcement came after the UN General Assembly had approved a resolution asking Israel to stop building the wall on the Western side to depth ranging from 5 to 20 kilometers inside the West Bank.
According to the plan on which the Israeli army and other military corps are bent so as to refer it for endorsement to the government. The eastern wall will continue the wall track which Israel started to build to tighten the ring on the city of Jerusalem from the West (Abou Dis and Al-Izereya) and the East to create a regional link between the biggest settlement to the east of the city (Maalih Adumium) and the settlements built in the Jordan Valley area.
Israel made plans point out that about 600 thousand Palestinians would face the same destiny once the Eastern and Western walls are completed, thus besieging the whole bank.
For the second time running, Israeli mass media and various Zionist bodies have continued their ferocious campaign on Arab drama. This year they have launched their attacks on the Syrian serial "The Diaspora", which reviews the emergence and development of the Zionist movement and is presented on Lebanese Al Manar Television screen and some Arab satellite channels in the holy month of Ramadan. They, as usual, regarded that serial as "anti-Semitic", the same charge launched against Egyptian "Knight without a Horse" serial last year.
FRANCE WARNS SYRIA AGAINST AMERICAN OR ISRAELI STRIKE
Therefore, France reiterated its messages to Damascus warning it against being exposed to a major American or Israeli action.
However, the sources expressed sorrow because Syria always waits for a strike to be aware of the risks and then take the initiative.
SYRIA ADMITS TO IRAQI DEPOSITS WITH ITS BANKS
"The unity of Lebanese sects preserves Lebanon, which is considered a main base for Arab unity," Lebanon's Mufti, Sheikh Mohamed Rasheed Qabbani said.
MEMBER IN IGC CALLS FOR DIVIDING IRAQ INTO FIVE REGIONS
Al Rabie added that the federation system would lend strength to Iraq as, in fact, the economically and spiritually strongest states are federal.
Israel has secretly put large amounts of bad food on the Iraqi market, especially in Mosul and North Iraq on the occasion of the month of Ramadan. According to Iraqi sources, the value of the deal was over $50 million and most of those Israeli products proved to be unfit for human consumption.
MERGER OF TWO MOVEMENTS TO RESTORE MONARCHY TO IRAQ
The American forces command in Iraq asked its troops to respect the sanctity of the holy month of Ramadan which will start in a few days' time.
The council pointed out that it had set up a committee for cooperation with mass media in Iraq in the preparation of programmes that suit the holy month.
The statement pointed out that the police command would intensify the protection of the areas frequented by citizens in Ramadan especially holy religious shrines and mosques.
In his speech on the occasion of the advent of the holy month of Ramadan, Saudi Mufti, Sheikh Abdel-Aziz bin Abdullah Al Al-Sheikh said that the call for staging protests was religiously impermissible, describing those who call for staging demonstrations as "advocates of error and sedition."
Turkey wants such influence in Iraq as to control the North and affect the Central Government in Baghdad. It also hopes to be second to America when it comes to the distribution of Iraqi oil quotas.
In a nutshell, the two main neighbouring countries are agreed on excluding any role by Arab countries in the post-Saddam Iraq. The Iranian leadership justifies that option by citing the doubtful climate that has prevailed with the Arabs for decades and has been enhanced by the Iraqi-Iranian war. To prove such lack of trust with the Arabs, it cites the fact that Western countries especially the European Union had responded to the calls for opening up coming from Tehran and lost no time in building bridges with it, whereas the Arabs remained hesitant or refraining.
It is probably the time now that both public and secret military accords and treaties between Turkey and the Hebrew State were put into effect in light of the growing Israeli role in North Iraq.
IRAQI ASSOCIATION FOR THE EAR-CUT
"All what those have done was that they deserted from the army.
In a precedent, the first of its kind, a delegation of Iraqi forces, parties and civil society organizations participated in a forum organized by the American Democratic Institute in Sana'a last week. The forum was about democracy in the Gulf area and the Arabian Peninsula.
Regarding evaluation of the development of democracy in the Gulf area, Campbell indicated that there was obvious differences in political and democratic orientations. In Bahrain, for instance, there is a larger area of free expression, whereas other countries are still closed to political or partisan action. However, the Democratic Institute does not seek to pass evaluations regarding democracy in those countries, but it helps those willing to achieve a democratic shift.

IKWHAN FAST-BREAKING BANQUET TURNS INTO EVENT DEMONSTRATING GROUP'S SUPPORT
The platform had more than 15 personalities including symbols of parties, political forces and unionists. The hall included all different parts of the political spectrum ranging from radical Islamists like lawyer Montaser Al-Zayyat to leftists like Tagamoh Party representative Abdel-Ghaffar Shukr as well as Nasserists, liberals and representatives of professional syndicates.
Coptic thinker Dr. Milad Hanna's speech pungently criticized the ruling NDP holding a dialogue with each party alone, adding that opposition party representatives were thrown into panic before entering the dialogue room. Hanna lauded Muslim Brotherhood and their group and emphasized that no other organization in Egypt could gather the participants in that party in one place.

NEW MUFTI MEETS AMERICAN AMBASSADOR
However, the mufti did not backtrack on his previous stances.
The focus in this way often leads to linking what is going on in any Arab country with the pressure coming from outside.
Treating developments will, therefore, be an exercise rather than an analysis aiming at putting events in their historical context in an attempt to understand their future.
This congress sowed the seeds of change, which will change the parties' map due to the positive amendment it pledged to introduce to the laws organizing political life, especially as far as the Law on Parties is concerned.
This rational trend includes an elite of youths who have no matches in opposition parties, which were invited by the NDP to the national dialogue that started two weeks ago.
Some parties have already been established but the Committee on Parties Affairs did not license them. Some other parties are being formed.
Besides, there are many a liberal party, foremost of which are Al-Ghad (Future) Party led by MP Ayman Nour and Misr Al-Omm (Mother Egypt), which is being founded by Mohsen Lotfi Al-Sayed, grandson of Ahmed Lotfi Al-Sayed who was a leading liberal figure in Egypt.
The new parties, which were suspended for a long time, are more enthusiastic to prove their presence and ability, especially as most of them depend on generations that did not take their political opportunities including, particularly, those who were students in the seventies, which, together with the forties, is considered the most vital decade in the history of the student movement.
The tactical stand, however, does not produce all such self-criticism that is based on unprecedented in-depth jurisprudential reconsideration.
In this case, change will be comprehensive.
With the meeting expected to be held this week between the National Democratic Party (NDP) represented in its Secretary General Safwat Al-Sherif and his assistant Kamal El-Shazli on one side and Nasserite Party Leader Dia Eddin Dawoud on the other side, the first round of the national dialogue which President Mubarak had called for will have ended. Such a round has witnessed, so far, two meetings, the first on October 22nd with Tagamo'h (Grouping) Party represented in its leader Khalid Mohieddin and its secretary Refaat Al-Said, and the second on October 27th with Al-Wafd Party leader Nomaan Guma. The NDP meeting with Tagamo'h and Al-Wafd Parties ended up by the issuance of extremely short statements about their agreement on giving priority to political reform.
This paper entitled the "Rights of Citizenship and Democracy" had been prepared by the policies Secretariat headed by Gamal Mubarak who also chairs what is called Supreme Council of Policies. Both Safwat Al-Sherif and Gamal Mubarak have already unfolded the paper content on September 27th.
All such items content seems very close to the initiative announced by the American Secretary of State Colin Powell in December 2002, which was called the initiative of partnership with the Middle East.
Opposition parties voiced fears that the "covenant of honour" demanded by President Mubark was meant to set new restrictions for opposition parties under the pretext of the necessity of transporting in funding parties and their organs.
There is, therefore, unanimity that the secret agenda of the national dialogue will try to increase the isolation of Muslim Brotherhood which Washington tried to court as a political force that would compete with the NDP. Furthermore, rescuing Atef Ebeid's government from its current economic cul-de-sac through lending some sort of popularity to the NDP and its government through feigning to seek dialogue and reject monopolizing public action, giving preference to solutions that would lead to the good of the country and finally introducing a set of political reforms that allow wider participation of opposition parties in the parliament seats without threatening to cancel the NDP monopoly.
The door of candidacy will be shut on November 24th instant provided that challenges could be submitted during the period 3-10 December next. This will be prior to the party's general congress on 17-18 December to hold the party's elections. The all-out change process witnessed by the Tagamo'h - one of the oldest parties in Egypt - will include four main positions: the party leader, his two deputies, and Secretary General and four assistant secretaries general for political, organizational, public action, and preparation of leaders affairs.
DEMONSTRATIONS IN AL-AZHAR UNIVERSITY IN PROTEST AGAINST RIGGING ELECTIONS
The students warned the university's administration against endorsing the results of these elections, ignoring their requests to carry out fair elections representing the real will of the students.
Maha Medhat, a veiled announcer, told Al-Majalla weekly that she and her workmates insisted on wearing the Islamic uniform in spite of difficulties and pressure they came under. "We also insist on our jobs as announcers at the Egyptian TV even if some TV officials argued that their contracts stipulate that they cannot appear on the screen while putting on Islamic veil."
Al-Azhar scholars categorically opposed the governmental approval of a belly-dance school in Egypt as un-Islamic and unconstitutional, noting that Islam is the state's official religion and the Islamic Shari'a is the main source of legislation.
Walid Awni, master of the new belly-dance school, said students from the faculties of medicine, engineering, law and dentistry have joined the school.
It is un-Islamic for women to appear naked and excite people's carnal desires. He condemned the belly-dance school as a serious sin. Rapping all those who helped the establishment of the school, he called on parents not to allow their daughters to join it since dancing is against morality, religions and norms.
A school that spreads science and benefits people is welcome, she said, wondering "How can we allow women to appear naked and dance to entertain people?
Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh Mohamed Sayed Tantawi rejected carrying out any human cloning experiments, stressing that such experiments were religiously impermissible absurdities.
For his part, the Vatican's ambassador pointed out that he was tasked by the Vatican Pope John Paul II to invite the Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar to attend the ceremony that would be given by the Vatican to mark the 25th anniversary of Pope John Paul II's ascending to the Apostolic See.
However, other banquets were also organized by Christians especially the banquet which was organized by the Evangelical Sect in Egypt, headed by Dr. Safwat Al-Bayad two days ago (Thursday) and was attended by some Muslim Egyptian political figures headed by Egypt's Mufti (Religious Opinion Authority) Dr. Ali Gomm'a, Minsiter of Wakfs (Religious Endowments) Dr. Mahmoud Zakzouk and Minister of Environment, Dr. Mamdouh Riyadh.
Egyptian Minister of Health Dr. Mohamed Awadh Tageddin has recently entered the Ramadan fatwas (religious opnions) arena. He called on Muslims to regard blood donations as part of Zakat (alms giving).
The prices fixed for the different items may well explain Mabrouk's low proceeds. One kilogram of nuts costs LE60 while it used to be sold for only LE42 last year. Dried fruits like Mishmeshya and Qarasia (dried apricot and plum) are now displayed but almost with a placard which says "not for sale"!
Although the devaluation of the dollar on the black market indicates, by no means, improvements in the living conditions. However, conditions have improved this month on the criminal level. According to a modern study issued by the National Centre for Social and Criminal Researches, murders, vice crimes and shop and house burglaries went down by a rate ranging from 30 to 50% in Ramadan.
It seemed, according to the sources, that Egyptian and Iranian officials were agreed on the importance of the restoration of bilateral relations to its state about a quarter of a century ago. They, nonetheless, admitted to several difficulties obstructing the development of the diplomatic side of the political, economic and cultural relations between Egypt and Iran.
Head of Egyptian Interests Care Bureau in Tehran Ambassador Shawki Ismail carried a written message from Egyptian Foreign Minister, Ahmed Maher to his Iranian counterpart, Kamal Kharazi on bilateral relations and Iraq.
Israel's exports to Egypt plummeted by 3% in comparison to last year, the statistics said.
Deputies closely involved in the process of preparing the new amendments to the Nationality Act, to be mooted in the parliament in its new session, said new stricter rules and controls would be introduced to the new amendments to bar the offspring of those Egyptians from obtaining the Egyptian nationality under any circumstances, taking into consideration the Israeli law provisions that give the son the nationality of his mother.
A Jewish society, established recently in France under the name " Prophet Daniel's Society", has recently submitted a request to Paris-based Egyptian embassy during the first half of this year to dispatch experts to work side by side with their Egyptian counterparts in restoring monuments and property purportedly belonging to the Jewish community, including synagogue and schools in Cairo and Alexandria.
The focus in this way often leads to linking what is going on in any Arab country with the pressure coming from outside.
Treating developments will, therefore, be an exercise rather than an analysis aiming at putting events in their historical context in an attempt to understand their future.
This congress sowed the seeds of change, which will change the parties' map due to the positive amendment it pledged to introduce to the laws organizing political life, especially as far as the Law on Parties is concerned.
This rational trend includes an elite of youths who have no matches in opposition parties, which were invited by the NDP to the national dialogue that started two weeks ago.
Some parties have already been established but the Committee on Parties Affairs did not license them.
These two parties are expected to marginalize Al-Wafd Party, which also seems to be the destiny of the Arab Nasserite Party after Al-Karama had been greenlit.
This also coincides with an essential U-turn in the thought and stands of the Jamaa Islamia, which was the most extremist and fundamentalist group and then became the most moderate one.
Therefore, not only has this "group" become more moderate than Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan), it has surpassed Ikhwan as well because it has had an intellectual and political perspective, as it was lacking political and intellectual theorization for decades during which it depended on independent Islamic theorists.
Although there is no sign of the possibility of such a change, the expected amendment of the Law on Parties will likely redraw this map through the establishment of new stronger opposition parties.
Added to that, the meetings were rather bilateral with NDP singling out each of the three parties, which seems to be a condition set in advance under the pretext that on the heels of the meetings there would be a general meeting including the representatives of the three parties with the NDP in a bid to set the final agenda of the proposed dialogue.
The parties which participated in the October 22nd and 27th meetings think that the paper was inadequate for effecting a genuine political change and reform.
These are also the same demands which the secretary of the American vice president Liz Cheney has been trying to implement in the Middle East. Liz Cheney is expected to visit Egypt this month to follow up how far the American Aid funds are directed towards the achievement of these demands.
The preparatory meetings in the last two weeks have also uncovered there were differences in the agenda of the proposed economic reforms. Almost all the parties think that Atef Ebeid's government is leading the country to a disaster and therefore suspect that the dialogue might be just a ploy on the part of the NDP to absorb the state of public anger at the inept performance of the government which caused the people to face such an unprecedented state of price hikes.
This hoped to lend a sort of democratic climate to the state of affairs, which would, by the end of the day, relieve the external pressure exercised on the NDP, according to international reports. The curt statement which was issued at the end of the meeting between the NDP and Al-Wafd Party leader Numan Gomaa might uncover the National Party aim behind the dialogue and rallying the parties support of it. To quote the statement, "The two parties have emphasized unity of ranks regarding external issues and all that relates to Egypt's internal or external National security and the stability of the home front under President Mubarak."
The change process will also include members of the Political Bureau (nine in number), the Central Secretariat (12 in number) and the Central Committee (40 years).
Al-Azhar dealt a severe blow to the Egyptian Ministry of Culture and its affiliate the General Egyptian Book Organization. A few weeks after the Ministry and the Organization praised the book of poet, Ahmed Al Shahawi "Recommendations on Women's Love," and the issuance of a favourable report prepared by a committee which examined the book to know whether it contained anything that violated Islam or Sharia, the Islamic Research Academy, the highest Azherite authority emphasized that the book should be confiscated and banned from circulation on the markets. This was announced during a meeting held yesterday by the Academy and chaired by Al Azhar Grand Sheikh Dr. Mohamed Sayed Tantawi.
Al-Azhar University was the scene of massive student demonstrations protesting against the university's administration rigging student elections.
EGYPT'S VEILED ANNOUNCERS ASK FOR AL-AZHAR SHEIKH'S HELP
For her part, Nadia Halim, chairwoman of the Egyptian TV Channel Two, told Al-Majalla that veiled announcers cannot appear on the screen pursuant to internal regulations, noting that it did not mean that the Egyptian TV objected to the Islamic uniform. When they signed their contracts, they accepted such regulations, she said. If an announcer puts on Islamic veil, she has to be transferred preparation jobs.
The governmental approval raised the resentment of some members of the People's Assembly who enunciated static against the establishment of the dancing school, especially under the current circumstances in Egypt and the Arab region.
Al-Azhar scholars called on Egyptian officials to stop the project and freeze its activities in order to keep the honour of Muslim girls and avoid spreading depravity and dissoluteness in an official way. The project will barely affect morality, behaviour and virtues by giving profligacy free rein in society.
Dr. Amena Mohamed Nusair, a professor at the Al-Azhar University Faculty of Islamic and Arabic Studies, said unfortunately everything bad is now allowable, noting that dancing is not an art that can upgrade the way of living or entertain people. An art that can meet morality standards is necessary for recreation and entertainment, she said.
It is an un-Islamic act."
He underlined the necessity of laying down laws that incriminate carrying out such experiments in the Arab and Muslim countries.
"The main aim behind my visit is to unite attitudes of and coordinate between Al-Azhar and the Vatican regarding human cloning so as to put this issue forward in the cession that will be organized soon by the UN," the ambassador of the Vatican said, adding," The Apostolic See touches upon the issues that jeopardize human life and family. We tend to make clear visions and attitudes for all religions," he concluded.
On the same day, a banquet which was new both in its idea and site was held in Al-Maharaq Monastery in Assiut governorate, Upper Egypt, 340 kilometers to the south of Cairo. The invitations this time were confined to mass media men and a number of intellectuals. It was organized by Anba Sawiras, bishop of Al-Maharaq Monastry. This banquet is regarded as a development of an idea which was put into effect by the Egyptian Press Syndicate which paid an annual visit to the monastery. The visit was due at the end of October which coincided with the beginning of Ramadan, thus converting the visit into a Ramadan breakfast which is the first to be held in that monastery since its construction in the fourth century A.D.
Dr. Tageddin's call, whether legitimate or not, has added to the feelings of depression that unusually overwhelm the Egyptians in that holy month. Such depression cannot be attributed to the black smog which nobody could either explain or put an end to. Nor could the Minister of Environment Dr. Mamdouh Riyadh do so and, therefore, he just forgot about.
Oriental confectionaries are in no better state. They used to be packed with fasters just before Iftar (fast breaking). However, according to the owner of a shop in Helopolis, Cairo, "Sales rates went down by about 30% compared with last year. I used to employ a guard to organize the customers, as there was no foothold before Iftar.
The study, nevertheless, did not elaborate on whether the reason for the decline in the number of burglaries was the lack of anything worth stealing.
An Egyptian official said that his country was looking forward to a new stage in its regional relations with Iran adding that Tehran was a main player that could not be ignored in several regional cards. There are also economic and political common interests between Cairo and Tehran, he said.
Head of Iranian Interests Care Department in Cairo Khesro Shahi said that the constant consultations between Cairo and Tehran was a normal thing in light of the successive regional developments and the common keenness on exchanging view points between the two parties on various issues of common interest.

EgyptAir chairman uncovered that his company got only 20% of the traffic movement between Cairo and Riyadh, 31% of the movement between Cairo and Abu Dhabi and 40% of the movement between Cairo and Kuwait. He said that operating companies in those countries got a bigger share than that of EgyptAir in spite of the agreements that usually provide for on a par participation of the movement.

In addition to the unlicensed factories' activities problem, the FICC pointed out many other problems that face foodstuff industries including delay of the return of customs duties which are paid under the drawback system for a whole year or more.

Q: After your return to Iraq, do you think that the Iraqi street is willing to accept the monarchy formula once again?
A: I mean the type of monarchy that achieves the goal of building a democratic state based on constitutional bases in a government elected through ballot boxes, where the role and powers of the king are well-defined so that the role of the king, in the particular case of Iraq, would be one of an "arbitrator" rather than that of a "monarch", a constitutional rather than an executive role, so to speak. He should be elected on objective bases rather than any other considerations such as his affiliation to a particular tribe or political party.
The political action of Iraqi forces was rather limited in the periods that preceded the invasion of Kuwait. After the invasion, however, a change took place in the regional and international conditions, which granted ample space to Iraqi politicians who contacted the royal family members in order to act in the circumstances which Iraq faced after that invasion.
We forged ahead vehemently and held another conference in Mosul, which included 300 figures of similar weight and also held other conferences in the South of Iraq and Kurdistan with a view to forming a council to be delegated to the countries concerned with the Iraqi affair.

The American governor Bremer is now comparing present conditions in Iraq with the conditions in Iraq when occupation took place. He said that when he reached Iraq there was no such and such a thing, but now matters are different.
We are for creating a serious programme to fill in the political vacuum in Iraq, which is what is required today as peaceful resistance because military resistance would not put an end to occupation. The Vietnamese model where the Americans used to lose 15 lives daily over a period of a decade is not expected to recur in Iraq.
Q: The situation in Iraq now is witnessing developments that tend to consecrate occupation while you are talking about a peaceful resistance?

Yesterday morning, the meetings of the fourth round of the gas-exporting countries started under the chairmanship of Egyptian Oil Minister Sameh Fahmi.
Abdullah Al-Attiya, Qatari Energy Minister, said this meeting does not aim at increasing natural gas prices but rather asking for fair prices in light of the gas' growing role in different industries and in preserving the environment. He pointed to gas-oil integration in getting rid of environmental accidents, adding that all gas producing countries will find a place on the international gas markets.
OPEC agreement of last month helped decrease production quotas by one million barrels per day as of April, 1, 2004, instead of raising oil prices to their highest levels in one year.
However, OPEC has been refusing to discuss changing the price range up till now.
They discussed during that meeting the means and ways of the return of those companies to their past areas and their contribution to more exploration operations and the development of the petroleum, petrochemical and gas industries.
The return and the speed of naturalization of the US-Libyan relations came on the heels of the Libyan decision on 19th September 2003 to give up mass destruction weapons equipment. This decision was met with wide scale welcome especially from the US and Britain.

Senator Carl Levin (Dem.), who proposed the amendment, said that at the time when oil prices were approaching standard levels and the strategic reserves had reached 93% of their maximum, it would be good to adopt a temporary suspension of purchases for strategic reserves and use those dollars to reinforce the security of US territories.
No similar resolution was adopted by the House," he pointed out.
The instructions to the Department of Energy stipulate the addition of some 100,000 barrels per day to the American strategic oil reserves, or 700,000 barrels per week, according to Kildov, who also affirmed that more than one million barrels were being added to the reserves every week. "However, about a month ago, two million barrels were added in a single week," he affirmed.

"The dialogue aims at reaching a compromise with opposition forces regarding real political reform including the agreement on laws, related to citizens' participation in political action, activation of current parties and allowing the establishment of fresh parties, that will be amended."
He refuted the allegations that the aim behind the dialogue with the opposition was maneuvering and drawing people's attention away from other urgent issues such as exorbitant prices, emphasizing that the NDP is serious to have political reform.
It is to be mentioned that in 1994 Safwat Al-Sherif had been subjected to an attempt on his life at the hands of members of Jama'a Islameya (Islamic Group).
These remarks were made by Mubarak during his meeting with the National Democratic Party (NDP) parliamentary bloc on Tuesday. He said it was important to make the government policies put forth to maintain the prices of commodities for low-incomed brackets a success, noting that the government has provided an extra LE1.6 billion in subsidy to basic commodities.
"We don't want to reach these rates and that's why we should seek to keep increase rates at reasonable levels. We are not working for the current generations only but rather for future generations and we look forward to a long-standing permanent breakthrough rather than a temporary one that could make the future harder," he concluded.
The sources went on to say that the Egyptian Commercial Bureau in Tel Aviv had not sent any reports to the effect that cooperation in that framework was on and even if that was the case, it could not be that big.

"However, we disagree with whoever blows himself up in children, schools or women, i.e. civilians in general unless it is in retaliation for aggression on innocent civilians," he said.
According to key political and diplomatic sources, U.S. Congress is expected to approve the commission resolution as part of the U.S. onslaught on the region, including Egypt which was blasted by Bush in his recent speech. In his address, Bush called on Egypt to lead what he called the democracy march in the region, which is a blatant interference in the internal affairs of Egypt and other countries in the region and threatens the recurrence of the failed scenario of the U.S. occupation of Iraq, the sources said.
Although several congressional commissions had declined to consider such information as Al-Azhar was a major Islamic institution in the Middle East region and any bid to interfere in its affairs would provoke Egypt and several other Muslim countries, Zionists pressure pushed a congressional commission to reflect on Al-Azhar's alleged relationship with religious Middle Eastern organizations, mainly Hamas and Islamic Jihad. According to such Zionist allegations, Al-Azhar is deemed a reference for religious disputes and "major operations", and releases fatwas (religious opinions) that are different from other formal ones.
They rule out everybody except for representatives of the ruling party," member of Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) Guidance Bureau Abdel-Mon'em Abul-Fotouh who is also in charge of students in the Ikhwan Group said.
The Egyptian authorities on Friday tightened control over a village to the north of Upper Egypt after clashes took place between Muslims and Copts, thus leaving 5 people injured.
Sources said the injured were moved to Al-Ayat Hospital to receive treatment, adding that investigations disclosed that the reason behind the event was an old discord renewed recently when some Copts tried to convert a library, owned by one of them and was demolished, into a church. However, Muslim citizens opposed the idea, which led them to hurling each other with stones.
In cooperation with the Middle East Churches Council, the Egyptian Council for Women's Rights (ECWR) organized a course for a number of Coptic women to familiarize them with the khul' (divorce of a wife on consideration payable by her) and inheritance.
It is noteworthy that the personal status law of Muslims is applied to Copts due to the lack of a Christian text organizing inheritance rules for Christians.
The insurance company, which is making ready to issue this insurance policy, adopted this idea after it carried out feasible studies on a random sample which pointed out a growing divorce rate in Egypt.
The company seeks an accurate solution to such a knotty problem so that the company could ensure its rights amid expectations of circumvention and fraud acts.
According to a questionnaire conducted by a research institution for the insurance company, the divorce rate in such milieus may reach 50 percent.
Estimates of the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMS) point out that the number of divorces in Egypt totalled about 63000 cases in 2002, an explicit increase in comparison to 2001 together with a decrease in marriage cases from 759000 in 2000 to 351000 in 2001.
It seems that this matter will, however, take some time to be promoted.
Although the project aims at extending some financial protection to women in case of facing such painful conditions, some fear that such an initiative may aggravate divorce cases.
Therefore, I quite agree with President Bush in his call for commitment to the propagation of democracy in the Middle East region and his confession to the error made by successive American administrations when they backed dictatorial ruling regimes against the interests of their peoples and their aspirations.
Any attempt to intervene, exercise pressure or dictate conditions and give lessons will bring about reverse reactions.
The Bush administration, in particular, has played the worst role in serving peace as never has the region witnessed such a state of confusion, violence and disbelief in American-Israeli peace as it is witnessing now.
Al-Azhar receives more than 20 thousand students from different countries, the Premier said, adding that Al-Azhar is keen on explaining the right understanding of tolerant Islam.

The violent actions that took place in Al-Ayyat, north Upper Egypt, early last week did not affect the climate that prevailed an Iftar (fast breaking) function given by Pope Shenouda III on Tuesday in the Copts Cathedral. Attendants included scores of officials, politicians, intellectuals, businessmen and public figures.
He addressed the attendants after the function saying, "It is a friendly occasion where the sons of the Egyptian people, Muslims and Copts alike, get together.
Shenouda added, "Muslims and Copts took part together in many revolutions in modern history like 1919 and 1952 revolutions. Moreover, they fought side by side against the Israeli enemy in the 1973 War."
He also failed to arrange an Iftar (fast breaking) party to make a breakthrough in the isolation and overcome the difficulties that have been facing him since he came to Egypt.

Noting that among the 13 millions in that age group only 3 millions (25%) got married, the study said the rate of unofficial marriages among university students reached 6%. This is ascribed to the crushing economic conditions young people face when they think of official marriage.
SCHEME FOR DIVIDING SUDAN FOILED BY EGYPT
Sudan is standing alone and no country is so careful about Sudan and the integrity of its territories as Egypt, on which the Sudanese pin great hopes for supporting them and keeping the integrity of their country. Sulaiman warned that the dismemberment of Sudan is the only alternative of the aspired-after unity, pointing out that, according to him, if South Sudan was separated from Sudan, North Sudan will voluntarily opt for unity with Egypt, as that would be the only way to remain united.
The plan, moreover, enables Israel to directly and indirectly take part in Iraq reconstruction.
In the Iranian case, for example, the rule of the Shah was deposed and the Khomeini Islamic state was established, thus changing Iran from an ally to an enemy of the US. The relations with Saudi Arabia, whom the US considered the main strategic Gulf ally in the Arabian Peninsula and the Arab Mahsreq, are no longer be a source of reassurance.
Therefore, what is on the cards now is expanding and deepening the economic relations between the new regional merger area and weakening Arab economic relations or, at best, concluding them via an "Israeli mediator," It must be taken into account that the Israeli economy will be the main economic pumping station in the region at the commercial, financial and technological levels. This plan will be executed through regional projects (across Arab countries in which Israel will join as a main partner) just like highway projects, oil and gas pipelines as well as joint tourist projects and other "regional linkage" projects.

OPEC Ministers would meet late March in Vienna to review the production policy. A senior official at OPEC told Reuters that the cartel would consider postponing the production cut to June instead of April.
He added that the oil producing countries in the Gulf region did not take a unanimous decision to be referred to Vienna meeting.
Crude oil reached last week its highest closing price for 13 years thanks to the growth of the oil consumption in China, dip of the US fuel stock and fears of terrorist attacks that may hinder oil supplies.
The high prices worry us as much as low prices do".
The new report presented a comprehensive analysis of the energy-related developments in the Middle East and North Africa. It also assessed the importance of energy exports from the Middle East as regards the US and world economy. Besides, the report presented a detailed analysis of risks related to the future of energy exports.
This comprehensive research assessed political stability and internal problems, particularly those linked to the demographic increase and economic development.
Although the US launched the "Independence Project" in the 1970's with the objective of decreasing reliance on Arab oil and encouraging the finding of oil sources from outside the Middle East, the majority of these promises had not borne fruit, nor had they changed the balance of the international oil supplies. These promises had not reduced world economy's dependence on the oil of the Middle East and North Africa.
At the end of 2002, international oil stocks plummeted to 1.047.7 billion barrels of crude oil. But the quota of the Middle East and North Africa went up to 70%, i.e. 728.3 billion barrels of oil, according to the figures of British Petroleum.
SAUDI OIL MINISTER: NO OPEC MEMBERS SUGGESTED RAISING TARGETED PRICE AFTER DEVALUATION OF DOLLAR
Regarding the forthcoming meeting of OPEC, Al Naimi said, "It is difficult to talk now of what resolutions that meeting will result in. so much information is usually presented upon which the decision is made. It has observed over the past period that there was a stability of prices, as the large price fluctuations came to an end, thanks to the way that was followed for dealing with information within the context of OPEC meetings.
As regards the privatization of the company Ma'adin, the purpose of structuring the company was to restructure the Saudi mining sector. Once we complete the integration of the company's projects, to which two large projects for producing phosphate and bauxite will be added shortly, the offering of the company to the private sector will be profitable and beneficial, particularly to small investors. The current tendency is to offer Ma'adin to the private sector in parts in successive stages, starting with those sectors that have good returns. There is also a tendency for consolidating the gold production sector, so that it may be the first sector to be privatized, with the other sectors to follow."
Sea transportation sources said yesterday (March 23) that the Spanish refinery of SIPSA had started to load a crude oil tanker at the Iraqi harbor of Khor Al-Amiya. Thus, it is the first Western firm that takes oil shipments from the second oil harbor in Iraq.
Iraq reopened two berths at Khor Al-Amiya late last February, expecting that exports would rise between 300,000 and 400,000 barrels per day from the south.
This harbor is seven kilometers away to the east of Basra harbor, whose exportation capacity ranges between 1.6 million and 1.7 million barrels per day.
CASPIAN SEA OIL IS STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT BUT CANNOT COMPETE WITH THE GULF SUPPLIES
The game in a nutshell is how to find a safe way to get such oil and transport it immediately to international markets.
According to recent US statistics, the US consumes about one fourth of the world's crude oil consumption and this matter will not be changed over the coming two decades.
The cost of this project may exceed 4 billion dollars.
However, the Gulf reserves at present hit two thirds of the international confirmed reserves, whose production cost does not exceed two dollars per barrel while this cost goes up to 11 dollars per barrel in the Caspian Sea. In addition, the Caspian Sea is nearer to the Asian markets including China, Japan and India whose oil needs grow day after day.
Oil experts say that Libyan leader Gaddafi sees that the American dollar is more attractive than the pound sterling.
Officials from Occidental Petroleum, Amerada Hess and Oasis Group (a joint project between Conoco Phillips and Marathon Oil) said there are negotiations with the Libyan State Oil Company to return.

"Oil pumping was started at a late hour on Saturday and its average is 3,000 cubic meters per hour; i.e. about 450,000 barrels per day," a navigational agent in the region told Reuters.
Iraq's oil production is approaching two million barrels, as it manages to operate two loading quays in Khor Al-Amiya, overlooking the Gulf, at a capacity of 250-300 thousand barrels per day.
An oil study expected the share of OPEC members to rise to 48% of the world's output in 2010 and 51% in 2020, as a result of the expected deficit in non-OPEC production, which will couple with rising demand, thus creating a pressing need for a tangible increase in OPEC production.
The study also discussed the rates for demand on oil in developing countries, which it described as the main source of growth in the world consumption of oil in the coming period, as they had registered high consumption growth rates in the past year and were expected to register even high rates within the next few years.
DON'T BLAME OPEC"
He ascribed price rises to the weak capacity of the oil refineries in the US, saying that this is one of the main causes of petrol price rise.
For instance, a refinery in Illinois cannot sell petrol in Chicago because the oil components are different, he said.
"This consortium has presented the best conditions and has been invited to visit Damascus to start negotiations to sign the contract," an official at an oil company told the AFP.
It is noteworthy that Syria produces 5.8 billion cubic meters of gas per year and its gas reserves are estimated at about 240 billion cubic meters.
The Syrian Minister also inaugurated the Syrian international exposition on environment on behalf of the Syrian Prime Minister Mohamed Naji Al-Atry, who sponsored the two expositions. The Syrian Minister said this field is undergoing great and accelerated development through introducing modern technology. This will positively affect local companies' plans and programs, as well as their development as quickly as possible. He said this exposition is rich in different equipment and technologies that meet the needs necessary for oil industry in Syria.
COULD EARLY DECEMBER BE DATE FOR LOOMING MIDEAST WAR?
All reports received by active capitals in the Middle East included indications in the form of warnings that Sharon's government is bracing itself for a potential war in the region, which it will start regardless of excuses.
Golden chance: Israel now has a golden chance to wage war due to the following facts:
-Time is ripe for dealing final blows to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), for a regional war inevitably means launching a painful strike against the PNA and the Palestinian Intifada, entering Gaza by Israeli troops and eradicating Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other factions.
Map of targets: The map of targets in the heart of Damascus, published by Israel, synchronized Sharon's remarks threatening air raids anywhere and at anytime. This means that Tel Aviv may launch abrupt attacks in the heart of Syria, shrugging off major excuses.
Syria's response to the recent Israeli attack on Ein al-Saheb reflected Damascus' real understanding of Israel's intentions so it rushed to use the UN Security Council card and soften the situation on the ground, especially in south Lebanon. But, will Damascus maintain its position based on diplomatic moves, if the situation escalates in a way that actually poses a threat to the Syrian capital.
Israel, which has prepared itself psychologically for this war, sees war a way out of the existing situation as a whole in the region, especially as a win may trigger new equations in the region as long as circumstances will serve Israel if the Americans go too far covering Israel and the Arab countries only condemn Israel or give the green light to demonstrations in the Arab street, taking no deterrent actions against his option.
Secretary general of the Iraqi Industries Federation Mohamed Al-Khayyat told Al-Hayat that the American Chamber of Commerce was bent on establishing a center in Baghdad under the name "The International Center for Private Projects". He pointed out that that center would be designed for developing investments and introducing them into the Iraqi industry sector.
He pointed out that the transitional Governing Council in Iraq promised to take that sum up to one billion dollars so that the sector could be ready to deal with the industrial investments coming from abroad.
However, he stressed that industrial delegations from Sweden, Spain and Poland are intent on visiting Baghdad and concluding agreements with the Iraqi industrial sector.
Under the constitution, the People's Assembly Speaker should occupy the position of President for 60 days during which a candidate for the President would be nominated by a majority of two thirds of the deputies to put up his name for a plebiscite.
When Mubarak was asked during his visit to the USA last year about the deputy President's issue, he replied that he was examining the files of different candidates for the position and would choose one of them. He, however, has not chosen any candidate so far.
His sponsorship of political reform projects in spite of the old guard influence had earned him presence among those who sought a role denied them for long years.
On the other hand, some officials rally around the party's Secretary General, Safwat Al-Sherif including Minister of Education, Hussein Kamel Bahaeddin, Minister of Youth, Alieddin Hilal, Minister of Higher Education, Mufid Shehab, the three of whom had developed their political education and their connection with power in the Socialist Youth Organization, then in Vanguard Organization in the Nasserite era.
US TO PROPOSE EGYPTIAN-ISRAELI JOINT NUKE PROJECT: FM
A big number of Cairo University professors protested against allocating a university building for Future Generation Foundation (FGF).
They wondered about the truth of what was said that the building now allocated for the FGF was originally set for Educational Research Institute (ERI).
In spite of the US pressure to have such a meeting convened to reach a truce, the Palestinian side prefers having Abu Alaa-Sharon meeting convened after reaching a compromise between the Palestinian Authority and internal factions over a mutual cease-fire with Israel.
In spite of all these Egyptian efforts, head of the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee at the Knesset, a Likudist, described Egypt as a "hostile mediator" and, unprecedentedly accused it of practicing "double standard," saying, "We should not allow Egypt, a hostile country to Israel, to have an advanced position in the Palestinian territories near our residential areas."
Netanyahu added that large vessels coming from Asia and heading for Europe and America could pass through that line or through Aqaba, instead of Suez Canal, if Jordan agreed to participate in that project.
The People's Assembly board is due to convene an urgent meeting to seek a way out of the current dilemma the government and the parliament found themselves in at the beginning of the new parliamentary session due to some deputies' insistence on using more tools in questioning and overseeing the performance of the government.
Travel agencies asked the Ministry of Tourism to allow them to raise luxury pilgrimage prices by 40% compared with last year. They attributed such a rise to the rise in the dollar rates of exchange for the third time in 3 years.
Political Advisor to President Mubarak Dr. Osama Al-Baz denied any personal dimension in dealing with Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) Group, emphasizing that President Mubarak does not antagonize Ikhwan or any other political trend so long as they work within the framework of the law and the Constitution.
Senior Egyptian officials, including Premier Atef Ebeid, sent cables of sympathies to the family of the prominent deceased Ikhwan member Hassan Gawdat amid security crackdowns on the group.
In addition to Ebeid's message, sources within the group said, the family received messages of sympathies from People's Assembly Speaker Ahmed Fatehi Sorour, Vice-premier Yusuf Wali, Minister of Environment Dr. Mamdouh Riyadh and Egypt Trade Union Federation Chairman Al-Sayyed Rashid.
IKHWAN STUDENTS STAGE SIT-IN IN EGYPTIAN UNIVERSITIES
Fundamentalist sources criticized the exclusion of Islamists from the national dialogue that is conducted by the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) with opposition parties on the grounds that the Islamists are the main opposition forces in the political street in Egypt.
Dialogue with Islamic groups means closing the door to any violence attempts in the future, Ismail said, pointing out that it also emphasizes the democracy of the regime while excluding them means the continuation of the despotic view towards the Islamists.
I cannot believe that as I thought you converted to Islam years ago."
Since he became a Muslim, he has been abiding by Islamic duties and persistently performing prayers at mosque. Asked about Muslim prayers' reaction to his eye-catching appearance, including his blue eyes and blonde hair, Cole said, "We are all equal inside mosques. But, the matter is different inside cafes."
MUBARAK'S ACTIVITIES REDUCED DUE TO HIS HEALTH CONDITION
After 45 minutes, Mubarak returned to the joint session to resume his speech after it was shortened.
GAMAL MUBARAK: THE PRESIDENT IS WELL AND HIS CONTRIBUTION IS ON!
Gamal Mubarak told the youth that he would repeat the President's words that came in his address to the effect that challenges and responsibilities belong to us all as each one of us has got a role and a duty. The march of action is on and President Mubarak's contribution will continue.
Deputies at the People's Assembly (PA) asked for reviving the file of the Egyptian demand to regain the City of Eilat which used to be called Egyptian Umm Al-Rashrash.
American Senate allocated $2million from the American aid to Egypt for Ibn Khaldoun Center of Development Studies, which was regarded by observers as a generous reward for its chairman Saad Eddin Ibrahim.
Under this heading, Solyman Guda of Al-Wafd writes a back-page article to say: Statements released by papers quoting Prime Minister Atef Ebeid while addressing the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) Parliamentary Body are at least worrying and predict a "black future" for the country if the current situation remains.
Unfortunately, the opposite thing happened.
When an official says what the premier recognized, this shows impotence and thereupon the natural and expected result is resignation, leaving his post to another man who can do something or make a change.
The Jama'a Islamia (Islamic Group) appealed to Al-Qaeda terrorist network to lay down arms and stop carrying out terrorist acts.
We have had a thorny experience clashing with our Muslim governments in the past, he said, and that's why we have a due obligation to advise them so that things might not exacerbate. The Jama'a Islamia (Islamic Group) appealed to Al-Qaeda terrorist network to lay down arms and stop carrying out terrorist acts.
We have had a thorny experience clashing with our Muslim governments in the past, he said, and that's why we have a due obligation to advise them so that things might not exacerbate.
Hosni Mubarak is, therefore, head of each simple and modest Egyptian family, drudging for securing a decent life for his children and sparing no effort to prevent their dignity.
That bad flu got even worse in spite of antibiotics and depressants and lemon and orange juices which the President has had in the last four days, which caused him to leave the room and then the masses' heart beats violently quickened and their nerves became tense.
MOSSAD CHIEF: IRAN MAJOR THREAT TO ISRAEL
The Iranians made untiring efforts to conceal their nuclear program from the world but that program was disclosed only three months ago, he said.
Dagan gave a detailed account of the spread of "Islamic Jihad" (holy war) and recruitment of clergymen and intellectuals well-acquainted with Western culture and civilization to operate in North African States.
Mofaz was pessimistic about the success of the American pressure on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to impose real control on the Iranian nuclear programme. "If Iran reached the point of no return next year, it would be a dramatic and strategic development in the Middle East that can't be accepted by Israel by any means," he said.
"Washington not only agrees with Israel, but also uses it as a 'scourge' to threaten its opponents in the Middle East," a member of the entourage said.
Mofaz told his entourage that Washington sympathized with Israel in its war against terrorism more than ever.
As for the Iranian topic, Mofaz reminded the Americans of the Israeli raid that destroyed the Iraqi atomic pile in 1981 saying, "Imagine how the US would have led a war on Iraq been if we had not carried out that operation." At this point, Mofaz shifted his talk to the topic of the Iranian nuclear file. He commended American efforts to pressurize the Iranian leadership in order to give the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors access to its nuclear facilities. Such efforts have resulted so far in freezing the Iranian project.
According to Mofaz's escorting delegation, the Americans praised the Israeli strike against the Iraqi atomic pile.
He noted that President Bush had included Syria in "the axis of evil" in the Middle East due to its support of terrorism.
He explained the targets of the recent Israeli manoeuvre near Lebanese-Syrian borders, pointing out that it was another message to Syria, Hizbullah and the Lebanese government and that he hoped they would understand the message.
ISRAELI REPORT: QUARTER OF GAZA WOMEN PREGNANT
The survey results showed that one of each five Palestinian families look forward to having their sons martyred, while 80% of the Palestinians confirmed that they have been full of vengeance feelings since the eruption of the Intifada. 3% of the Palestinians are above 65, the survey noted, pointing out that most of the Palestinians live on two dollars per day.
Shalom's visit to Geneva and his meeting with Al Baradi has raised reservations in Israel as nuclear Energy experts would prefer to keep IAEA at a distance as too much proximity might lead to raise the question of Israeli nuclear armament, which is by no means wanted by Israel, which, nevertheless, thinks itself entitled to attack any country that opts for nuclear armament in the East.
The Israeli aircraft industries uncovered a new product in the world of espionage drones called "The Giant" due to its enormous size and unique potentialities.
Hizbullah sources denied statements by Israeli Minister of Defence Shaoul Mofaz in which he alleged that Hizbullah was training foreign fighters in Lebanon to be transferred to Iraq to kill American soldiers. "These are unfounded allegations. The Iraqis need nobody to train them, as they are seasoned fighters," the sources added.
The demands of the Iraqi Chaldeans and Assyrians to have an administrative autonomous entity open the door to considering many other demands made in the last few months by political, ethnic and religious groups, which call for federalism.
Political observers attribute the Kurds' interest in federalism to the continuation of a certain political status quo in the Kurdish area where there are Kurdish government, parliament and autonomy. Besides, the titles of some political Kurdish figures point out that this tendency takes much attention. Leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party Masud Barzani, for instance, is still called president Barzani. Kurdish academician Kamal Mazhar repeated his criticism of the Arabs in and outside Iraq, stressing that federalism is the guarantee of the future of Iraq.
The so-called "self-determination" - as it is promoted - opens the way to the Balkanization of Iraq and other Arab neighbouring countries, thus serving the Israeli schemes against the Arab region, the Iraqi analyst added.
Further attacks would even expedite withdrawal from Iraq.
If matters went on the way they have done since the formation of the Governing Council, they would mean such an attrition of the Americans that a continuation of a war whose goals are far from clearly understood has started to find many objections in the USA.
The American change touches only the agenda but not the programme prepared for Iraq and monopolizing its administration supervision.
Such a simplistic approach towards the problem has omitted to take into account the stage that would succeed that scenario if it came true.
What would he do, then, if he returned to power in the name of vengeance?
Such a "luxury" was understandable when the Americans were in direct control of the government.
Damascus took advantage of the visiting paid by Indian Premier, Ital Bihari Vajpayee to emphasize that the endorsement of Syria's Accountability Act by the American Congress would not lead to its complete political isolation as it still had other economic alternatives to the American oil companies operative in Syrian territories.
Vajpayee is expected to visit the archaeological city of Tadmur before the signature of a number of trade and technological cooperation.
Last May Syrian government signed an agreement with two American companies namely, Ocean Energy and Gulf Sands Petroleum. American companies for prospecting for, developing and producing oil in a zone near the Iraqi borders. The agreement's period is 25 years that can be extended for another 10 years. It was followed by a second agreement with another American company to carry out survey studies in Syrian territorial waters in the Mediterranean Sea.
Dr. Haddad said, "Petro Canada was one of the companies which had bidden for the contract to invest gas in the center of the country, a project which initially would cost about $700 million.
The latest threat was launched by the Army Chief of General Staff Moshe Ya'alon only a few days following a threat launched by Defence Minister Shaol Mofaz during his visit to Washington.
He added, "We can decide whether a reprisal will be useful or not." He emphasized that "Syria's sovereignty was beyond any bargains or discussions."
Ya'alon said, "If we ascertained that we failed to get the message across to President Assad, we would give him other messages."
According to the database of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, the number of Saudi Arabians in the private sector amounts to about 567,000 out of total 4,796,000 apart from house servants so that the number of foreign labour exceeds 4 millions of different nationalities, the statement said.
More than 40 Chinese companies have completed in-depth studies and expressed willingness to invest in Cairo this year, a Chinese official told Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper. Most of those companies work in IT, tourism, insurance, services and prospecting for oil and natural gas sectors, the Chinese official added. He also noted that Sino-Egyptian firms operative in Egypt in foodstuff, IT and oil fields had amounted to 47, adding that Egypt was China's fourth biggest trade partner in the black continent.
NEW ROUND OF INDIAN-EGYPTIAN PTA TALKS
The Indian diplomat added that Indian-Egyptian relations were entering a new stage in which foundations are being laid for a new structure that could boost and help develop long-term bilateral relations in all fields. The PTA is one of these foundations, he maintained.
These remarks came during Dr. Botrous Ghali's meeting on Monday (Feb. 9th) with representatives of Egyptian banks, shipping and inspection companies operative in the African market and a number of Egyptian exporters.
The Egyptian-East African Business Council will hold a meeting in Cairo next Sunday and will be attended by officials and ambassadors of East African countries including Kenya, Tanzania, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Zambia, Burundi and Egypt.
Ghali's talks with his South African counterpart will focus on discussing issues related to the WTO within a multilateral framework with preserving rights of the developing countries and giving their goods an opportunity to penetrate markets in a way that ensures an all-out development for such countries, a source with the ministry told the Middle East News Agency (MENA).
Other south African countries that are connected with South Africa in a customs union (namely South African Customs Union SACU member states) are expected to join the Egyptian-Nigerian free trade zone, the source added.
The industrial structure of the two countries is expected to get integrated, which helps their products penetrate other markets such as Europe and the United States. The agricultural integration between them may also provide mammoth opportunities to transfer advanced technology in agriculture and foodstuff industries.
Kuwaiti Trade and Industry Ministry issued a decision providing for lifting the ban on Egyptian fresh and frozen meat exports after a three month ban.
Aidaros added that the UAE took a decision to the same effect, and Saudi Arabia is due to take a similar decision. He pointed out that all the reports compiled by the WAHO and veterinary quarantine centers in Arab countries emphasized that Egyptian meat is sound and free of any epidemic diseases.
During the Egyptian-Lebanese Higher Committee meeting, a set of decisions were approved in order to streamline trade exchange. Putting such decisions seriously into effect will give room to more trade exchange, Ghali added.
Although all commodities of national origin will be exempted from customs duties as of 1st January 2005, the two parties decided not to wait till this date, as they will facilitate as many commodities as they can so that domestic industries will be ready to be exchanged without any obstacles as of January 2005, Ghali added.

Head of the Egyptian-British Chamber of Commerce, Taher Al-Sherif said that the chamber had prepared for that mission and fully financed its stay in Egypt due to the importance of the Egyptian agricultural crops that currently top British imports from Egypt. The companies are expected to meet representatives of Exporters Division and the Egyptian Society of Agricultural Crops.
This comes on the heels of the start of implementation of the transitional Egyptian-European partnership agreement, which provides for increasing the quotas of Egyptian exports to Europe as of July 2004.
The agreement will be put into force in line with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. Egyptian-French relations are very distinguished, he said. The French side granted Egypt 20,000 tons of wheat in aid as part of a deal signed between both countries.

OCT-Algeria General-Manager Khalid al-Ragwi said the company wants to have a strong presence in the construction market in Algeria. It employs over 800 Egyptian and Algerian engineers and technicians, in addition to 2,700 workers in Algeria.
This was said by Egyptian Trade Minister Plenipotentiary in the Egyptian embassy in Jordan Nasser Khalil.

While the Moroccan Ministry of Wakfs (Islamic endowments) and Islamic Affairs, the Moroccan Scholars League, and the Higher Authority for Scientific Councils kept silent towards an individual attempt to translate the Holy Qur'an into Tamazight, a leading figure in the Moroccan Justice and Development Party (moderate fundamentalist) welcomed the translation of the Holy Qur'an into Tamazight. "Official bodies should sponsor a collective action to translate the Holy Qur'an so that a creditable translation of the Holy Qur'an into Tamazight could be available," he said.
MIDDLE EAST POINT OF NO RETURN!
It, therefore, thought it would be safe from repercussions overtrusting its own privacy and therefore refused to change!
Let alone the absence of institutions that could serve as a means for participation or arbitration, the absence of safety valves amidst inflamed feelings, economic fiascos, the spread of fear of the other and wishing him dead even if that wish led to suicide.
These fears did not come true.
The Palestinians, whether in or out of the Authority do not fail to be realistic, but Sharon has gone too far in his war.
Explosive charges will again start detonating without any long breaks.
The Mossad Chief did not hesitate to declare that the Iranian nuclear threat had been the biggest danger to Israel's existence since it was established in 1948. We may only imagine the scene when we wake up one day to find the Iranian installation turned into rubble, as was the case with the Iraqi nuclear dream!
With the start of a new academic year in Damascus University, fourth year students of the Faculty of Arts, Mass Communication Department were taken aback by the Hebrew language being included in their curricula.
RABBI ARRESTED FOR SELLING "PLOTS IN PARADISE"
It was found that Rabbi Aharon used to devise a detailed program on quotation of every torture in Hell. People used to pay charges to enter a hall to meet the Rabbi beseeching him for forgiveness and mercy. One, for instance, may say, "I told my wife a serious lie," then the Rabbi determines to what extent the lie, is sinful, and thereupon the Rabbi says,"You will be tortured in Hell for three days, unless you pay 200 dollars to be moved to Paradise."
In a statement published by the "Islamic Information Center," which published Osama bin Laden's previous statements, an Al-Qaeda leading figure said, "The foundation of Al-Qaeda started with the establishment of a service office, Al-Ansar House and Al-Farouk Camp to the end of such stages till it reached this current stage, i.e.
Under the above heading, Muhammad Esmat writes a column on page six to say: With the increased Iraqi resistance operations over the last weeks, the Israeli Mossad marks started to appear in the reactions of the occupation forces.
This military intervention by the Mossad comes to pave the way for Israel to achieve its aims in Iraq mainly including the re-operation of Mosul-Haifa pipeline for conveying Iraqi oil to Israel instead of the more expensive oil it imports from Russia.
IRAQI BAATH TARGETS INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES IN "LIBERATION WAR"

MUBARAK DENIES CAIRO BEING EXPOSED TO AMERICAN PRESSURE
Yesterday (1st Dedember) In a press conference with Maltese president Guide de Marco in Cairo, Mubarak pointed out that democracy could not be executed within one or even 15 years, as it needs quite a long time. "Egypt started the experiment years ago even before the July 1952 Revolution.

Dr. Mahmoud Abul-Oyoun failed to discharge his deputy in an independent way as enshrined in the newly enacted law and according to powers that should be given to central bank governors in both developed and developing nations.
He spearheaded a plan to develop inter-bank electronic link networks with the CBE and expand bank personnel training and raise banks' capital in line with Basel commission resolutions.
Ebeid responded by saying that representatives from cabinet ministries like the ministries of Planning, Finance and Foreign Trade, and deputy governors were not selected.
CHANGING CBE GOVERNOR DIDN'T AFFECT POUND RATE OF EXCHANGE, MARKET OR BOURSE
The reason for relieving CBE governor Mahmoud Abul-Oyoon was that he announced the members of the CBE board of directors without notifying Ebeid or taking his advice. To prove this argument, the 14 members of the CBE board of directors, whom he announced appointed on August 14th last, did not meet and three of them were changed on Tuesday, namely president of HSBC, Mahmoud Attallah; economy professor, Heba Handousa; and financial expert, Ayman Laz. However, Abul-Oyoon's policy and personality are acceptable whether on official or public levels.
Al-Okda is considered a banking expert belonging to the American banking school, which adopts liberal policies.
Moussa's remarks came in comment on a draft resolution on anti-Semitism presented by Ireland to the UN General Assembly. Any General Assembly resolution under the vague identification of anti-Semitism will be opposed by the Arab Group in the UN, he said.

Moreover, it is not possible to consider the shrine and the surrounding tombs as remains of human races as the people buried inside were not living at the same the time of the Egyptian civilization.
GRAND IMAM: I'M AGAINST POPE SHENOUDA'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS NORMALIZATION WITH ISRAEL

He stressed that Egypt enjoys many advantages in investment that are not available in other countries, including political and social stability and the existence of a huge market accommodating 70 million people and is characterized by low-cost labour, especially after deregulating the rate of exchange. It also has huge gas and oil reserves, only small part of which is used locally, not to mention the strategic geographical location, which opens the door before investors to enter European, African and Middle Eastern markets.

MOUSSA WELCOMES IRAN AND TURKEY'S REQUESTS TO JOIN AL AS OBSERVERS
IKHWAN AND NESSERITES ALLY AGAINST AMERICAN FINANCE OF EGYPTIAN MEDIA

Public and private construction companies, whose losses on the local market last year were estimated at 500 million dollars, seek to establish their presence on external markets, notably Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states, Africa, Asia and Latin America with a view to winning new bids to balance their financial positions and make up for their local losses. They want to get out of the state of recession that has been prevailing real estate and construction markets for 3 years and ran deeper over the last few months with the random rise in prices of most building materials, especially rebar, cement and timber.
Construction services exportation is not confined to public enterprise sector companies as the Contractors Union had established a new branch to encourage private companies to work abroad, he said, adding that the branch removes all obstacles that face companies in that regard.
The negotiations include the potential for launching joint real estate investment projects between the Housing and Development Bank and investors from the GCC member states, notably Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE as they have huge real estate investments in Egypt.
UNSTABLE CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL PRICES PARALYZE REAL ESTATE MARKET
Meanwhile, many contractors have declined to hammer out any new contracts with cabinet ministries owing to unstable building material prices and the government's reluctance to pay them sufficient compensations for the difference in prices recently seen by markets.
The ministerial admission came amid mounting accusations by MPs against cabinet ministers and senior officials, charging them with conniving with some businessmen who monopolize the rebar market to obtain personal gains at the expense of national economy.
In exclusive statements to Al-Alam Al-Youm he said that laws force Pfizer to take such a step as the company losses exceeded half of its capital which hit 26.3 million pounds.

There is no palpable agreement on a specific definition of small-sized projects, and there are several agencies interested in small-sized industries but apply different criteria, Omar said.
Bank contributions to small-sized enterprises are no more than 6 percent. Islamic methods should be adopted in bankrolling small-sized projects through partnership and profit-sharing and avoiding the extension of loans, which caused several problems to project owners.

The private sector meets needs of cotton by importing some of them and buying quantities of local production.
The study prepared by head of Ready-Made Clothes and Textiles Exporters Society under the title "Egyptian Textiles and Clothes after 2004" stipulated an activation of a package of urgent measures and policies so that Egypt might get its fair share that matches its potentialities and expertise as well as the great volume of its investments in the sector of textiles and ready-made clothes.
The study pointed out that the cancellation of the export quota system in the field of textile and ready-made clothes would redistribute the quotas of different countries on the international market in that sector. Asian countries quotas, for instance, would increase at the expense of other countries like Egypt. It emphasized that the countries which would benefit from the cancellation of the quota system would be those with integrated industry of spinning, textile, dying, processing as well as other feeding industries of ready made clothes. This makes it necessary for Egypt to complete developing its customs tariffs so that they might turn from a repelling negative element in the system of textile and ready-made clothes system into an element that attracts investments and supports exports.

Dr. Wali had referred the outlines of the giant project to President Mubarak who showed enthusiasm for the project which would add about one million feddans to the cultivated area and provide thousands of job opportunities. An Egyptian working team has been formed to study the project.
Dr. Khaled Zeid said that, together with head of the Desert Centre and chairman of High Dam Lake Development Authority, he had paid field visits to various sites in the lake stream where over 90 million cubic tons of silt are annually deposited, which constitute only about 15% of those deposits, the bulk of which is deposited in Sudan where it is expected to form a new delta in a few centuries' time.
A committee chaired by Sheikh Fawzi al-Zafzaf will prepare a comprehensive religious vision of the Bahais thoughts which urged some Azharite scholars in charge of Ifta (religious opinion) in Egypt to pronounce the Bahais as infidels and a theists.

These units are said to be built between Mar Elias Monastery, Sor Bahir, and Mazmoureya Al-Numan village.
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has chosen an extremist element, just like him, to complete the attack he launched in the 1960's when he was the minister of agriculture and set up what he called the "Green Patrol" which went round the Negev and turned homeless Bedouin tribes throughout the vast desert. 750 thousand feddans were, then, extorted from them by Sharon under the pretext of getting them together in one spot and altering their lifestyle.
In defence of the act he is going to pass, he argues that refrainment from granting rises for newborn badies would ensure that the majority of the population would remain Jewish, which is what is primarily meant. He added another restriction forcing thousands who got married to Palestinian women in the West Bank to stay there as their life within the Green Line would pose a threat to Israel's security.
Although Zionist intentions are too obvious and were clearly pointed out by Zionist advocates themselves, Negev Bedouins' lawyer Anwar Al Lagoug said, "The National Fund actions have political motives. Bedouins have difficulty in getting planning permissions from the Israeli authorities or getting building materials, which clearly indicates that the Zionists want the land free of its Arab population.
The recruitment phenomenon is far from new. In 1993, Israel recruited 188 Bedouins who grew in number to 300 soldiers in 1998 in accordance with a policy advocated by Moshe Arnez when he was defence minister.
PALESTINE: FINANCIAL SCANDAL IN OIL AUTHORITY
Despite the data available with the Ministry of Finance on the case, Fayadh admitted to the unavailability of documents that can indict head of Oil Authority Harbi Sarsour or any other officials in it without having to identify anybody. It might be mentioned that Al-Masri also pointed out that those who were responsible for that case were well known without having to identify them, too.
"As a Minister of Finance, my job is to help follow up and provide evidence."
Fayadh pointed out that the WB had given the PNA a grace period of 10 years and a repayment period of 30 years at an interest rate of 0.75 percent. He, nevertheless, admitted that that was a violation of the basic law (temporary constitution), showing his readiness to repair that violation although it had taken place before he was appointed Minister of Finance.
The American President's Advisor for National Security Affairs, Condoleezza Rice put her European counterparts in the picture during a dinner party, which they all attended in London on the margin of President Bush's visit to Britain.
Rice faced many reservations and questions from her European counterparts who pointed out differences between relevant countries. Some even warned that some negative results might ensue from such an initiative.
The source said that one of the European advisors touched on the Palestinian issue while arguing with Rice. He said, "Such a conflict might be a myth, but there is a reality on the ground between both Palestinian and the Israeli peoples that might be exploited by Arab regimes. This, however, does not mean that the Palestinians are not wronged and that justice should be done to them."
ISRAEL CONTROLS IRAQI OIL
The sources added that officials in the Israeli companies speak the Kurdish language as well as the Iraqi dialect in order not to stir the feelings of the Arab tribes in northern Iraq, and carry Iraqi passports issued by the civil administration in Baghdad.
In collaboration with Israeli prefab companies, the American occupiers in Iraq have started to establish several prefabs at north Iraq Kurdish areas.
US FEARS OF NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN SHIITES, SUNNITES
Kurdish political reports pointed out that calls for the restoration of Saddam Hussein to power were spread in the Sunnite areas of Tikrit, Ramadi, Mosul and Samarra, as well as some districts of Baghdad. These calls are reflected in the graffiti written on walls in streets leading to Sunnite areas.
A Sunnite authority in Baghdad unveiled to Al-Hayat that the goings-on are incitement by secular parties against Arab Sunnite areas.
Unprecedentedly, Sunnite statements were issued considering Ayatullah Ali Al-Sistani the supreme Islamic authority in Iraq as a whole not only Najaf. This meaning was conveyed in the messages sent by Muslim Ulema Board in Baghdad to Al-Sistani strongly supporting demands the transitional governing council to lay down a schedule for withdrawal of occupation forces and conducting fair and unbiased elections to choose the coming Iraqi government.
Under this heading, Salama Na'mat of Al-Hayat wrote to say: The US Administration's allocation of some 21 billion dollars for Iraq reconstruction reflects how strategic Iraq is for Washington within the framework of the latter's political agenda in the Middle East.
This means that the Republican Administration in the White House considers, with external aid criterion, that its project in Iraq nowadays is more important than its assistance to Europe to face the Communist threat after the Second World War, or even supporting Israel or guaranteeing the non-breakup of a nuclear country like Russia.
Not necessarily, although Israelis were explicitly surprised by the sum the US Administration got from the Congress for Iraq.
In fact, the volume of American investment in Iraq, regardless of its expected revenues or potential repercussions, reflects a great American bet on making a wide regional change that will start in Iraq to include others.
Board chairman of the bank Mohamed Madbouli said the final account of the bank in 2003 showed that the bank was going on achieving high growth rates against the previous year.

Deputy head of the General Federation of Chambers of Commerce Mohamed Abdel-Fattah Al-Masri said that the investor looks forward to legislative stability, as the investor cannot invest his funds in a country that always changes laws. Al-Masri refused modification of current laws, calling for setting an all-out and unified law that controls investment.
For his part, Secretary of Egyptian Industries Federation Shafiq Baghdadi said that there cannot be any increase in economic growth as well as job openings without investment. He asserted that the ratio of investment to gross domestic product (GDP) does not exceed 16%, and is on the decrease, while it should not be less than 45% per annum.

The ABC will also bankroll other projects including the exportation of Egyptian gas to Syria and Lebanon and the development of Egyptian gas fields. It will also be the financial and technical advisor in funding a giant fertilizer exportation project, he said.
In reply to a question about the ABC's role in financing Egyptian investors desiring to invest in Sudan, Abdel-Jawad said the ABC sustained heavy losses when it was operating in Sudan where banks were indebted to the ABC. Such debts have not been repaid yet. Negotiations are underway to settle such debts amounting to 100 million dollars, he said.
Such debts are due on Sudanese public and private banks, he said.
Minister of Finance Medhat Hassanien has issued a decree in 2000 banning office furniture procurement for three years.
They added that Egypt's foreign debt hitting 29.2 billion dollars, and foreign exchange reserves are estimated in dollars.

TRADE SURPLUS WITH 10 ARAB COUNTRIES
Korea has chosen finished Egyptian marble from among the marble offered by 12 international companies from 6 countries - Italy, Spain, Turkey, India, Iran and Israel.

On the other hand, Hermes owned 17% of the CIBI that raised the latter's capital by 265 million pounds.
It will also lead to restructuring Hermes Group through separating the administration from funds activity, which will result in better outcomes.
Al-Alam Al-Youm learnt that some of the CIBI shareholders have asked the last general assembly to re-exchange shares in return for their direct contribution to Hermes Group, as many of them have contributed to increasing the capital of Hermes (by 200 million pounds). Foremost of those shareholders are the National Bank of Egypt, Mansour, Al-Maghrabi, Hesni, and others. Meanwhile the Commercial International Bank, one of the key shareholders in the CIBI, refrained from contributing to such increase.
Six American Congressmen showed solidarity with Spector in presenting the draft resolution. They include some pro-Zionism or Christian right congressmen in the USA.
Many Iraqi politicians concurred that the Islamic Badr Organization and other Islamic parties in Iraq would take the brunt of transferring the security dossier to the Iraqi Governing Council (IGC). According to information from within the IGC, the core point in the dispute on the security dossier is the stance on America's desire to take the file to the Interior Ministry, while IGC Islamic leaders want the security office of parties represented in the IGC to supervise the ministry.
The Americans are believed to zero in on delivering security to Iraqi reliable leaders willing to cooperate with American agencies in the long run.
On the security relationship with American forces, sources with the IGC were quoted as saying that some IGC members called for giving these forces a secondary role providing logistics to large-scale attacks to be launched by the ministry on "terrorist" groups, while the Americans voiced willingness to supervise the ministry's plans.
MAP OF ISLAMIC TURKISH MOVEMENTS
They include many organizations such as the Islamic Liberation Front of Turkey, Mujahedin of the Islamic Revolution, Liberation Army of Islamic Turkey, Islamic Liberation Union of Turkey, and International Shari'a Liberation Army.
However, the most active organization in the last years, which claimed responsiblility for the last two attacks on the two Jewish synagogues in Istanbul on 15th November, is the Front of Warriors of Great Islamic East, which was founded in 1975. It calls for waging a popular Islamic revolution in Turkey.
They include Naqshabandiyya, Tijaniyya, Rifa'iyya, Qadiriya and Mevleviye tariqas. Apart from the Naqshabandiyya, they are considered small groups.
They started in 1970 with the establishment of the National Order Party, which was banned in 1971, then emerged the National Salvation Party (NSP) in 1972 till it was banned following the 1980 coup d'etat.
In February of the same year, the Fazilat Party, led by Rajai Kutan, was established as an extension of the banned Refah Party. The party's seats in the parliament went down from 21 percent in the 1995 elections to 15 percent in April 1999 elections.

The report some excerpts from which were published by the Hebrew newspaper, pointed out that there was a strong possibility that Hamas would ascend to power when Arafat quits.

Jerusalem Mufti, Sheikh Ekrema Sabri vehemently criticized "Geneva peace document" and those who made it, especially regarding granting the Israelis sovereignty on the southern wall of Haram Al-Sharif. It is worth mentioning that this wall is called Al-Boraq Wall, while the Israelis call it the Wailing Wall.
"About 70 years ago, the League of Nations recognized the Al-Boraq Wall as an Islamic endowment and part of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, how can, then, it be handed over to the Jews to call it the Wailing Wall.
It might be mentioned that Sheikh Sabri broached and criticized Geneva peace document in the last Friday congregational prayers of the holy month of Ramadan.
Quoting the same source Yediot Aharanot said, "If an abduction operation took place, the blue line would not constitute a barrier before Israel."
The matter did not stop at mere writings in newspapers, as Israeli officials talked about scenarios for preemptive futuristic wars to protect Israel against Egypt, Syria and Iran as well.
The Israeli strike against Syria was explicitly greenlit by the United States, which declined to denounce it in the UN or in the Security Council," he added.
It also emphasized that the Arabs would not remain idle if Israel continued its violations of Egypt, Syria and Lebanon.
Egypt's stand will be critical if Syria is struck, as Egypt should take action in such a case. Egypt's strategic interest also lies in Israel not to strike Syria, as this will disrupt Egypt's strategic balance in the region.
"Israeli threats to Egypt does come out of nothing, as the Israeli leaderships always take special interest in Egypt taking into account the 'objective power' of the Egyptian position, which is based on historic, geographic and demographic facts. Therefore, it is not an accident that all Israel's aggressive wars on the Arabs and the Arab defensive wars on Israel involved Egypt as a main party whether directly as are the cases in 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973 wars or indirectly such as the aggression on Lebanon in 1982 and the aggression on the Palestinians in 2000. Egypt was also an indirect party through its support for Syria following the last Israeli aggression on it and its position against the aggressive American "Syria Accountability Act" and its subsequent threats that should seriously be taken into consideration," said Ahmed Baha'eddin Sha'ban, a political specialist writer on Middle East affairs.
On the other hand, the Egyptian officials cannot disregard the public opinion and the Egyptian street's indignation at the United States, the Israeli racial policies towards the Palestinian people and all Arabs, the hegemony of the pro-Likud rightist wing in the United States, giving Sharon free rein to liquidate the Palestinian Intifada and the Palestinian leadership, and Sharon's recent allegation that he does not rule out an Egyptian-Syrian attack on the Israeli army on par with what happened on the 6th of October 1973.
* Sweeping and reoccupying Sinai.
In light of an American terrifying atmosphere including remapping the region and launching preemptive wars, it can be said firmly that the climate of war is on the cards and that Syria tops the list of targets. If Syria is struck once more, Egyptian officials will be in a very critical situation.
Under this headline, chief editor Nabil Zaki wrote his front page editorial which ran to the following effect only in part: If everybody are agreed that the Palestinian truce should be neither for free nor unilateral but should rather require mutual commitments, the Palestinian-Palestinian dialogue in Cairo cannot be considered a fiasco, but may be said to have been a success.
Anybody who might be tempted to imagine the possibility of a truce without a political perspective would be deluded with false hopes!
Does not any Palestinian have the right to know the guarantees before he agrees on the truce especially as Sharon has announced at the beginning of the Palestinian-Palestinian dialogue that Israel was not party to any truce and that such a truce is just an internal Palestinian affair?!
In spite of this, the Palestinian factions' position was very flexible indeed when they proposed stopping martyrdom operations inside Israel (while the immediate Israeli reply to this came in the form of an absolute rejection of any truce unless it included stopping any confrontation of occupation soldiers and settlers in the June 4th, 1967 lands).
Undoubtedly, the Geneva Document signed by former Palestinian minister, Yasser Abd-Rabou and former Israeli minister Yossi Beilin had contributed to the refrainment of the Palestinian factions from granting such a delegation to the Authority.
Head of the Cabinet's Information and Decision Support Center (IDSC) Dr. Ra'fat Radwan uncovered that 16 billion pounds had been wasted in the form of idle stockpiles in state-affiliated warehouses.
In response to financial auditors' complaints, Hassanein vowed to draw up an immediate plan to rehabilitate the State-owned rundown warehouses where wastage is aggravating.
Mohyi Eddin who doubles as chairman of the Economic Committee of ruling National Democratic Party in Egypt, said, "We announced the flotation decision in January, but it has not been implemented yet as what we have now is a controlled flotation no more, no less."
BANKS BACKPEDAL ON FUNDING INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS
Bankers called for necessarily restructuring industries in Egypt and drawing a general chart for every industry so that fierce competition among manufacturers could not take place, which negatively affects national industry.
"Lending fresh loans to the industry sector is very limited for many reasons foremost of which is that most feasibility studies of industrial projects show, when they are put into effect, large disruptions and deviations from the designed plans, thus causing a shortage of finance sustained only by the bank," Egyptian Labour Bank's main office director Ashraf Abd Al-Mon'im said.
"Banks still grant loans to fund the industry sector but at low rates due to a drop in the number of industrial investors," he said.
EXPERTS DUB NEW CENTRAL BANK REGULATION AS REINFORCING STABILITY OF MONETARY POLICY
"The new executive regulation comprises several items that insure more transparency and confidence in the operations of the Central Bank, particularly those issues related to monetary policy, so as to provide more room for monetary stability and bolster the integrity of the banking system. In addition, it makes it possible to lay down and implement credit, monetary and banking policies that serve the country's economic interests," he added.
He added that although the old law had recognized the independence of the Central Bank, it had required the approval of several quarters before the decisions of the bank became effective, which had impeded the effective operations of the Central Bank. "The new law addresses this problem properly."
He said, "The old law gave the Central Bank unclear terms of reference, such as participation in making and approving the state budget, while not stipulating the proper mechanism for discharging such a role, thus rendering its own text a mere work of good composition without real effect. However, the new regulation addresses this point adequately.
Several Egyptian financial institutions especially banks started preparations for investment in South Sudan in light of strong signs of peace being maintained there. A number of key Egyptian businessmen announced their tendency to enter partnerships with Arab and foreign investors to set up projects in South Sudan especially in the field of tourism, agriculture, mining, transport and industry.
The working group consists of the AL General Secretariat, Arab Banks Union, Arab Investors Union, the Sudanese government, the General Federation of the Arab Countries Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture, the Arab Constitution for Investment Guarantees and the Arab Economic Unity Council.
A package of comprehensive policies for the future of Egyptian industry over the next 20 years is being worked out, said Egyptian Minister of Industry and Technological Development Ali Al-Sa'edi during a meeting with members of the Policies Secretariat with the ruling National Democratic Party's Economic Committee on March 2. These policies will have been finalized and issued by June next, he added.
Egyptian industry leads development as it constitutes the biggest contributor to the GDP at 20%, he said, indicating that the target is to raise this percentage to around 30-35% over the coming years.
The last few hours witnessed important developments at the level of interest rate tendencies.
For his part, manager of the United Bank of Egypt Amr Al-Ganaini ascribed the devaluation of the dollar to several reasons topped by: the retreat of imports and importers' reluctance to import some expensive commodities which they find too difficult to sell on the market.
It withdrew 7.027 billion pounds including 1.525 billion pounds through treasury bills which it had put up for subscription 26th last February and then deducted from the accounts of banks on 27th February last. This bid, the period of which hit 182 days at an average interest rate hitting 7.49%, has been accepted. It is to be noted that the highest interest rate hit 7.99% and the lowest one hit 7.20%.
Egyptian Foreign Trade Minister, Youssef Botrous Ghali said that the bourse would look after the organization of limited finance but which have the ability to use simple accountancy rules and provide a clear statement. He pointed out that small groceries and restaurants could be included in such a type of businesses that must have the ability to put up their investments on a mini bourse.
The chamber of Egyptian Tourism companies have finally approved the increase imposed by the Supreme Council of Antiquities on tourism sights duties. The council will increase the current duties by 75% the new rise would be valid as of November.
Dr. Hawwas said that the council was planning for giant projects to renovate archeological sites so that they might impress and attract even more tourists. He pointed out that the renovation and development operations in the archeological sites needed enormous funds which the Antiquities Authority provides, hence the need to increase duties.
According to the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) Chamber of Statistics, the likely average hit LE6.10 for buying and LE6.17 for selling.
The main aim in the coming stage is to reach a uniform formal rate between banks and parallel market and apply the supply and demand mechanism, he said, calling on the government not to interfere in the market so as to resume credibility and stabilize the exchange market.
If the dollar has gone down by 20% against European currencies especially the euro and the pound Sterling, the emerging question now is how does such a decline affect the Egyptian market?
In addition, the USA is the biggest debtor country in the world as it has a budget deficit of $400 billion which is financed through borrowing from international institutions and banks or through converting such a deficit into a budget deficit.
Egypt's dollar revenues whether through exports or tourism is much less than what is required for payments of imported services or the movement of capital quitting Egypt. All such needs are met in dollars even to countries other than the USA which explains the emergence of a black market for the dollar in Egypt. The Egyptian pound, furthermore, is not internationally convertible, which makes the Egyptian market in quite a different position than the international market.
They sell the dollar to obtain their basic needs but quite refrain from speculation operations which is kept at a minimum due to aforementioned state of wait because they cannot predict the CBE reply to any speculation operation on behalf of the dollar at the expense of the Egyptian pound.
Regarding the Egyptian market, Mohamed Ozlib thinks that the Egyptian pound is directly related to the dollar. If the dollar, that is, went down against Asian currencies, for example, the Egyptian pound will also rise or decline against them.
Such a direct relationship between the Egyptian pound and the dollar puts the former in a real jeopardy as it would practically devaluate at the same rate of the latter's devaluation.
Nasr Public Company for construction came first among the companies affiliated to the National Company for Construction in terms of arrears due on the government. Its arrears exceeded one billion pounds. Thus exceeding the Egyptian Company for Construction and Nasr Company for Buildings and Construction.
Egypt seeks to increase trade with European Union countries through opening European markets for Egyptian products as well as increasing European investments in Egypt, Hefni said, adding that the investment of these three countries in Egypt hit one billion euros till late last year.
The governor announced that Egypt's success in having its name lifted off the money laundering blacklist would upgrade dealings between international financial institutions and domestic institutions. This will, in turn, enable Egypt to recover its funds smuggled abroad.
CONTRADICTION IN BANK PERFORMANCE RESULTS LAST YEAR
On the other hand, the financial investments of the bank retreated to 4.5 million pounds in parallel with a markup of 1.806 million pounds in the foreign exchange operations revenues.
This decline in profits came regardless of the growth of the net bank revenues by 0.4% to hit 806 million pounds as well as the increase of concessions and fees of banking services by 11.4% to 855 million pounds. Moreover, the total allocations soared from 620 million pounds to one billion pounds.
The report also uncovered that the losses incurred by Misr Exterior Bank amounted to 198 million pounds in December 2002, not to mention the deficit in allocations of loans and the decline in the value of assets.
The Commercial International Bank (CIB) has started a plan to expand its activities regionally and internationally, CIB-Egypt President Hesham Ezz Al-Arab said. In the CIB general assembly meeting, during which the bank's financial position expiring by the end of 2003 was endorsed, he said that a prominent target of the plan was to register the bank's shares in the form of American deposit certificates. After completing this step, the shares will be registered with an American bourse, he pointed out.
EXCHANGE MARKET DOMINATED BY INSTABILITY
Banker, Ali Negm expected an increasing demand for the euro and the pound sterling during the current week together with a rise in their saving rates.
Hassan suggested that the CBE should provide more cash liquidity with banks in the vicinity of 500 million dollars and sell its surplus, expecting that that would lead, especially with the start of the dollar inter-bank mechanism, to an adequate supply for covering needs and, consequently, reducing demand on the unofficial market.
Owners of exchange firms said that the market did not witness any remarkable changes over the last days, adding that prices were still around their ranges for several months. They added that the demand for the American dollar or the Saudi riyal was within normal rates, adding that supply was still unchanged. They pointed out that the dollar rate of exchange ranged between 6.16 pounds for buying and 6.19 pounds for selling and that its rate of exchange on the unofficial market did not exceed 7 pounds.
According to the two reports discussed last week, the Egyptian economy is just running counter to all international economic norms.
He points out that the private sector had obtained bank funds and opted for speculations and scrambling for setting up tourist housing units and real estate, thus turning the state's resources into concrete blocks haunted by ghosts, which led to a real disruption in the nature of investment. The government thought that the private sector would be able to replace it in running the economy without guarantees and so it turned into a "looter."
The report points out that the gap between the investment rate required and the saving rate is widening rapidly as it widened from LE1 billion in 1994/1995 to LE28 billion in 1997/1998.
The report also emphasizes that $90 billion Egyptian funds has escaped the country and the government could not mange to attract them in spite of all such incentives and concessions it offers to Arabs, foreigners and businessmen.
The sluggishness of Egyptian exports coincides with Arab and Asian countries managing to increase their exports ten times over during the period from 1982 to 1999, such as China from $18 billion to 195 billion; South Korea, from $17 billion to $143.7 billion; Malaysia, from $13 billion to $84.6 billion; Tunisia, from $2.2 billion to $7.3 billion and Morocco from $2.5 billion to $8 billion.
The gravity of the situation, according to the report, stems from the fact that the surplus in services and remittances trade could not cope with such a deficit which meant that, should that situation continue, more borrowing would eventually ensue or our foreign exchange balance would run out.
EGYPTIAN CONCERNS
The questions are: Does the government mean it will support wheat-growing and farmers in Rumania?
We then need him to tell us how much wheat-growing on Egyptian soil will cost.
It is enough to ask aboutthe population of Abu Simpel City on the Egyptian border and Sudanese population of latitude 22 north.
Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom described his meeting with President Hosni Mubarak in Geneva on Wednesday as "very good". He said he felt encouraged after President Mubarak expressed his willingness to play a key role in pushing the peace process forward and narrowing the gulf between the Palestinians and the Israelis.
OPPOSITION ADOPTS ANTI-TORTURE BILL
AL REPORT ON ILLITERACY, EDUCATION IN THE ARAB WORLD
Debt service up 40% of export revenues in Lebanon, 20% in Algeria and Morocco and 15% in Tunisia.
Unprecedentedly, the Bibliotheca Alexandrina has withdrawn the "Protocols of the Elders of Zion" book from a book show for Western and rare books. The Jews considered this book as anti-Semitic.
Although the book has been withdrawn from the show book it is still on the library's website.
A few days ago, instructions were issued to deplete the role of some businessmen who fell into disfavour as a prelude to gradually dispensing with them. They include some figures who could occupy leading positions in the NDP and the parliament in the last two years, in addition to the fact that some of them belong to secretariats in the NDP. A well informed source told Al-Ahali that a container company owner (member of the NDP's Youth Secretariat) was at the top of the list of those proposed to be excluded shortly adding that the initial list included three other names who were members in the NDP secretariats.
According to a well-informed source, some businessmen in the party dared to intervene for preventing the importation of some goods from abroad so that they could sell their products to the citizens at exaggerated prices on the domestic market.
The interpellation focuses on the businessman's monopoly of the iron market in Egypt.
Following his hits 'I hate Israel,' 'Hitting Iraq,' 'Mohamed Al-Durrah' and Sharon went mad,' Abdel Rahim recorded his recent album entitled 'I hate high posts,' which includes a song with a political content, namely the 'road map'.
The song holds the US responsible for the attacks of September 11th, saying, " O people, it was just a tower that had been hit, I swear it was they who attacked the tower."
AL-AZHAR CASTIGATES EGYPTIAN INSTITUTIONS CONDUCING TO DISSOLUTENESS
120 men of letters signed a statement in support of Al-Shahawi, calling upon the state to interfere to stop referring literary works to Al-Azhar for approval.
The report said the book preface was signed by Samir Sarhan himself, adding that the book contained glorification of lechery quoting verses of the Holy Quran as well as Prophet's traditions irrelevantly to serve the call for fornication, dissoluteness and nakedness.
The contents of the book urge everybody who is concerned for the nation's to future call for banning the publication and circulation of that book, the report concluded.
The participants in the dialogue are often at variance both in long term vision and targets and in reading the current stage and the options of dealing with them.
Through contacts and reports, Major General Solaiman knows that some participants also look forward to setting up a Palestinian state on the lands occupied by Israel in 1967 or an area almost equal to that land and, are, in return, willing to grant Israel permanent recognition, relations and normalization.
Its constant outlook at the world through the September 11th incidents makes it extremely difficult for it to reach an understanding with let alone bet on such an administration.
All this is well known to Omar Solaiman. That's why he's trying to act as a catalyst for inspiring hope and producing flexibility through warnings so as to force the Palestinians to adopt a wait and see stance, thus keeping the door open especially as something in Israel seems to be in the offing.
The Palestinians, on the other hand, who are talking in Cairo, are quite helpless and can do actually nothing. The occupation army is still carrying on with its assassination crimes against the resistance leaderships whether they announced a truce, a ceasefire or continued commando operations, and Arafat insists that the Palestinians should see only what he himself sees nor should they take a road without his approval.
The current dialogue has nothing promising in itself and the participants may hardly find what to say from calling for closing up ranks and demanding that occupation forces be withdrawn, thus without any real agenda.
Bankers attributed this to the rate of exchange instability and essential differences in implementing the feasibility studies of such projects.
All the banks, public and private alike, are responsible for lending industrial projects even if some specialized banks, such as the Industrial Development Bank and the Export Development Bank, should assume such a role because they can extend loans and grants at low interest rates, he pointed out.
"Industrial loans are granted at low rates due to economic sluggishness inflicting the country, which resulted in decreasing foreign investments and depending on domestic ones to a great extent," Misr Iran Bank Deputy Director Mohamed Tarek Shahin said.
In the past, there was lack of information about industry, products and marketing, in addition to the private sector's inexperience in manufacturing. Therefore, the number of investors in the industry sector have retreated at present, Abd Al-Maguid said.
The regulation also gave the Central Bank more independence, which would lead to stable monetary policies, they pointed out.
"The new law has abolished the secondary classifications of banks, which are now classified in only two categories: public banks and private banks, instead of the old system that comprised several classifications: public banks, private banks, investment banks and joint banks, which were different in no aspect other than their ownership systems."
"The new regulation has given confidence in and credibility to those concerned with laying down monetary policies, which should result in better stability on the exchange market and protect the market against price fluctuations in the coming stage."
The President of the Bank of Alexandria, Mahmoud Abdel Latif, said that the new executive regulation of the Central Bank law reflected President Hosni Mubarak's keenness on insuring the proper coordination and balance among all concerned parties, including the Government, the Central Bank and other banks, in the interest of stable monetary policies.
For his part, head of Egyptian Businessmen Society, Dr. Gamal Al-Nazer said that investment opportunities in South Sudan were unbounded as there are 5 million feddans in Sudan in need of cultivators.
Two days ago, Arab League hosted the first Arab conference for Investment and Development in South Sudan where participants decided to invite Arab Commerce chambers and investors union, together with Sudanese consultation firms to contribute to the preparation of feasibility studies for investment projects. They also decided to urge the Arab Institution for Investment Guarantees to continue efforts to set up a fund for investment guarantees in South Sudan with financial contributions from the Sudanese government, Arab countries and Arab financing and investment funds. The fund will be set up and run by the Arab Institution for Investment Guarantees.
There are a number of targets the ministry seeks to achieve to increase the contribution of the industrial sector in the gross domestic product (GDP) and boosting industry role in economic and social development through working out an Egyptian integrated industrial policy aiming at raising private sector competitiveness, he added.
Industry Minister indicated that the ministry was preparing a database including available and future production capacity, the volume of imports, target markets, the most important competitors, and expected development in all industries through an integrated industrial and investment chart implemented by the ministry's Information Centre in cooperation with the General Organization for Industrialization's Industrial Chart Information Centre.
It was reported later on that there was disagreement between monetary and financial authorities on the issue of raising interest rates. However, the last developments pointed out that they have almost agreed to gradually raise interest rates in order to restore stability to exchange market and increase saving rates.
Another development witnessed by the market during the past few hours is banks continual ignorance of the CBE's insinuation to raise interest rates as most banks pegged their interest rates while other banks decreased interest rates on short-term deposits.
EGYPTIAN BOURSE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES
Ghali said that a bourse for commodities was also under construction. Contacts with South Africa have been made to that effect and an Egyptian delegation will go there to discuss the appropriate rules.
The council's chairman, Zahi Hawwas said the rise was attributed to the need to finance projects of antiquities development and renovation.
The U.S. dollar rate of exchange saw a notable depreciation at black market in the last days.
The drop is due to eight reasons; banks' coverage of basic commodity import credits, which softened pressure on black market, CBE's leadership shakeup, static monetary policies, officials' reluctance to make statements or to take abrupt decisions, dwindling imports as a result of high prices, U.S. dollar possessors' concerns following the market stability, pushing many to sell their dollars, inflow of tourists, availability of foreign currencies, especially the EU euro, and stoppage of illegal dealing in currencies thanks to CBE's crackdowns on banks.
The devaluation of the dollar on the international level embarrassed the American decision-maker and is taken into account by both the big and the small on the trade map simply because the American economy is the most influential on other economies.
To start with, head of Sadat Academy for Management Sciences, Dr. Hamdi Abdel Azim points out that the decline of the dollar against other international currencies especially the euro and the Japanese yen is attributed to the fact that the USA external expenditure is very high due to its recent military expenditure in some countries under the pretext of combating terrorism so much so that some American economists think that the USA public budget is determined outside the American borders.
If we have a look at the dollar market in Egypt, we'll find out that regardless of the dollar decline against international currencies, the domestic dollar market is hardly affected by that as it is simply a market which is separated from the international market.
For her part, Banque Du Caire deputy, Mona Yasin thinks that the dollar market in Egypt is not quite separated from the international market. The supply of the dollar is, it is true, very low compared with the demand for it. However, there has been a recent decline in the dollar rate in banks as it reached about LE6.15 or LE6.30 Outside banks, the rate was lower than LE7 per dollar.
The military expenditure, it is true, is enormous and the American taxes have suffered a decline, too, thus causing a very big deficit in the American budget. Such a deficit nonetheless, represents a slight rate in the GDP. A more important reaction for the dollar decline against international currencies is the fact that the last few years have been characterized by recession and a high employment rate.
The dollar even began to retreat a bit and the pressure on the Egyptian pound apparently has started to relax. This may be attributed to an increase in the rate of Egyptian exports as well as tourism revenues, not to mention the psychological element, a key factor of market stability.
Reliable information obtained by Al-Alam Al-Youm uncovered that total arrears due on the government for two major construction companies which carry out 85% of the State's projects hit about 6.378 billion pounds till late last year. The 6.378 billion pounds are divided into 3.8 billion pounds for Arab Contractors Company and 2.578 billion dollars for16 companies affiliated to the National Holding Company for Building and Construction. These debts are distributed as follows, 418.6 million pounds due on ministries, 865.8 million pounds due on authorities, 893.7 million pounds due on the country bodies, 269.08 million pounds due on governorates and 131.03 million pounds on public enterprise sector.
Chairman of Egyptian Commercial Representation Al-Sharqawy Hefni said that Egypt's trade relations with Britain, France and Italy witnessed a big development in the last years, pointing out that Egyptian exports to these countries reached 1.7 billion euros in 2003, up 14% in comparison to 2002. Egyptian imports hit 2.6 billion euros, he said.
Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) governor, Dr. Farouq Al Okda expected a rise in current account balance surplus by 4% of the GBP this year.
Head of Anti-Money Laundering at the CBE, Serri Seyam said that Egypt would shortly join the International Union for Anti-Money Laundering units, thus becoming No.65 in the union's membership. Egypt would be a regional centre for anti-money laundering.
The Industrial Development Bank performance results showed a relative decline of 14% in its net profits, as it recorded 3 million pounds versus 3.5 million pounds in the FY2001/2002.
The National Bank of Egypt (NBE) performance results implied a 7.1% retreat in its net profits as it recorded 325 million pounds (54 million dollars) versus 350 million pounds in the previous year. This slide in profits came regardless of the relative growth of the banking net revenues to 975 million pounds (160 million dollars), or 39%. This coincided with a markup in the commissions and fees of the banking services to 1.173 billion pounds, up 1.56%. The bank performance results have been affected by some factors including the increase in the foreign exchange operations losses from 476 million pounds to one billion pounds as well as increasing allocations from 711 million pounds to one billion pounds.
Profits of the Bank of Alexandria dwindled 13.3% to hit 65 million pounds versus 75 million pounds in 2002. This slide comes after net revenues of the bank went down by 23% to hit 142 million pounds, which made up for the rise in the commissions and fees of banking services to 314 million pounds, a growth rate of 14%. Meanwhile, revenues of other operations did not exceed 12 million pounds last year and the bank allocations soared from 237 million pounds to 248 million pounds. Total assets of the bank increased from 26 billion pounds in 2002 to 33 billion pounds in 2003. Results of Misr Exterior Bank performance over the first nine months of 2003 revealed that the bank incurred losses to the tune of 151 million pounds and that the bank achieved 991.6 million pounds from loans and account revenues in addition to 65.52 million pounds from revenues of treasury bills and bonds.
Results of the performance of Credit Agricole and Suisse-Egypt over 2003 pointed out that its net profits continued increasing to hit 47 million pounds versus one million pounds in 2002.
The CIB is also considering measures of registering stocks with Abu Dhabi and Kuwait bourses with a view to boosting the bank's presence in the Gulf region, he pointed out.
Following his appointment, new CBE governor Farouk Al-Okda made a statement emphasizing the new CBE board of directors' adherence to and support of the deregulation of the rate of exchange policy and announced that fresh measures would be taken shortly to back the national currency and curb the uncontrollable rise of foreign currencies, especially the US dollar, the Saudi riyal and the euro. However, experts say that relieving former CBE governor of his post one year ahead of his term of office together with the monetary sector official bodies' different points of view are considered continuation of the state of instability from which the Egyptian foreign exchange market has been suffering, which led to the depreciation of the pound rate of exchange by 81 percent against the dollar over the last three years.
On the other hand, banking sources in several banks uncovered that their banks had received government directives to support putting up more saving coffers in the euro within a backing policy aiming at encouraging dollar depositors to convert their dollar deposits to the euro in order to hike the dollar supply on the market, decontrol the American currency on exchange market dealings, alleviate pressure on the national currency and maintain its current value without any fresh depreciation.
Total foreign exchange inflows to Egyptian banks are expected to hit 6.2 billion dollars by the end of this year, Al-Qarnashawi said, pointing out that this value will not be in parallel with the demand and there will be, thus, a gap.
The People's Assembly (PA) exposed the government when two reports submitted by the PA Economic Committee uncovered a retreat in the ratio of investment to the GDP from 30% in 1989/1990 to 16% in 2001/2002 in spite of all the incentives offered by the state ranging from opening bank doors to a group of businessmen who smuggled bank funds abroad to harming national security by entitling foreigners and Arabs to possess assets without any controls.
According to the investment report, the current decline in the rates of investments to the GDP from 30% in 1989/1990 to only 16% in 2001/2002 including domestic investments whether public or private and whether Arab or foreign to LE61.6 billion out of a GDP estimated at LE385 billion.
According to the report exposing the government, all that the government did during the 1980s and the 1990s was just squandering the state's resources but yielding only further collapse in the end.
The report also uncovers that investment laws offered several advantages and tax and tariff exemptions far exceeding all advantages and exemptions offered anywhere in the world.
The report on exports also uncovers the poor performance of commodity exports during the 1990s as they hardly exceeded $4.7 billion in 2000 against imports to the value of LE12.5 billion, thus taking the trade deficit up to $7.8 billion.
The report describes the aggravation of trade balance deficit as the main disruption in Egyptian economic relations as well as the main source of pressure on the Egyptian pound rate of exchange.
The report highlights that the devaluation of the Egyptian pound even if it had some effects on raising the exports value can not be relied on in the long run for increasing such exports as it is just one among many mechanisms to serve that end in the short run. Besides, the government has not taken into account the current inflation rate in Egypt compared with its counterpart in its main trade partners.
He should have contented himself with complimentary protocol remarks.
And then how much will the transport of wheat from Rumania, where wheat will be grown, to Rumanian seaports on the Black Sea passing through the straits of Bosphorus and Dardanelles and the Mediterranean Sea and finally Egypt's Alexandria or Dami etta harbours cost?!
Is it not better for us to cultivate wheat at border areas between Egypt and Sudan, especially as there was an earlier agreement between them in this respect in a bid to materialize the long-standing dream of an agricultural and economic integration in the interest of both nations.
I think it is better to do so than grow wheat in Rumania, isn't it?
He hinted that return to the negotiating table with the Palestinians would be a suitable occasion for returning the Egyptian ambassador to Tel Aviv. "I will be happy then," he said, adding that Egypt primarily committed itself to that. However, the most important thing here is that Egypt should fulfill its commitment as soon as possible, he noted. Meetings are to be held between Palestinian and Israeli officials, he said, hoping that such meetings would be a prelude to another meeting between President Mubarak and Sharon. He pointed out an improvement in bilateral relations.
The bill will be signed by independent deputies and others belonging to opposition parties, said Muslim Brotherhood parliamentary bloc member Dr. Hamdi Hassan. The bill will be tabled in the People's Assembly sessions that will start on Saturday.
The report pointed out that parliamentary seats occupied by women in Arab legislative authorities did not exceed 5% of total seats.
UN Developmental Programme appealed to rich countries to increase development grants, adopt fairer commercial and political policies and increase debt exemptions.
It seems that the library's abrupt decision was a response to an official request by the UNESCO following a big campaign by Zionist organizations in the USA. An American Jewish center said that it urged its supporters and members to send messages and e-mails to the UNESCO to step in and urge the Bibliotheca Alexandrina to withdraw anti-Semitic books.
BUSINESSMEN EXCLUDED FROM DECISION-MAKING CENTRES "B.O.T".
Al-Ahali has got access to an initial list of businessmen in the NDP made by a security body. Some of them were notably members in various bodies including the party, the American Chamber of Commerce and Egyptian-American Business Council.
T hey also backed some bills and government decisions that had bad results on the public level or proved inapplicable in the current economic circumstances.
NEW HIT BY SINGER SHAABAN ABDEL RAHIM
Neither did the committee take care of my business nor was the road map was made, and this is what I want."
Even though the Censorship of Artistic Works (CAW) did not approve the album, according to CAW head Madkour Thabit, Shaaban Abdel Rahim started to sing some of his songs in wedding parties, particularly the song "Road map" which is widely popular.
It wondered about an official institution, namely the Book Organization affiliated to the Culture Ministry, which published books tampering with verses of the Holy Quran and the Prophet's traditions. Al-Azhar's attitude came in a report issued by the Islamic Research Academy, the highest authority in Al-Azhar. The report included reasons for Al-Azhar's decision to ban publication and distribution of the Egyptian poet Ahmed Al-Shahawi's book "Recommendations in Women's Love".
On the next day, Sarhan lifted the ban on the book, claiming that a committee affiliated to the Organization read the book and approved it.
The book also cited Sufi words twisting their meanings to serve the call for the love between man and woman.
Under this headline, Gassan Sharbel of Al-Hayat writes an article, which runs to the following effect: The Palestinian factions dialogue in Cairo will be unsurprisingly difficult.
Some participants in the dialogue look forward to resuscitating the negotiation process provided requirements of seriousness are ensured.
On the other hand, Omar Solaiman realizes how tough his job really is.
He, meanwhile, realizes that Ariel Sharon is by no means the optimum Israeli premier for encouraging the Palestinians to shake hands, reconciliate and exchange "painful capitulations."
Under this headline, Al-Ahram Al-Arabi publishes its editorial to the following effect: On the eve of the Palestinian factions arrival in Cairo to embark upon a new dialogue between various forces in and out of the occupied lands, the ceremonies of signing the Geneva Peace Initiative document had already started according to Switzerland local time. In the meantime, Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa was listening to reassurance words, which he got used to hearing form American Assistant Secretary of State William Burns whenever every new round began between Middle East capitals.
Reading a conclusion is not an end in itself, but the real end which should be sought by all without exception is this: translation of written texts into flesh and blood truths on the Palestinian street, between the Palestinian Authority and Israel and between Arafat and his men or his opposition!
PA SIDES WITH S. ARABIA AGAINST PRO-ISRAEL CAMPAIGN IN WASHINGTON
Abu-Zeid stressed the importance of laying down immediate and practical mechanisms for Arab countries' communication and boosting Arab economic cooperation.
Turkey warned Israel against continuing exploration activities.
A Turkish intelligence report pointed out that the Israelis bought oil-rich plots from Kurds in Mosul.
The Israeli embassy in Ankara referred a report to Jerusalem, in which it said publicizing the issue in Turkey implies hostility towards Israel and that it intends to contact the Turkish Foreign Ministry in order to verify the truth of the published news.
According to political sources in Jerusalem, the Turks fear that Israel would have a link with the Kurdish autonomous area in Northern Iraq which aspires to independence.
GOLD IN ABUNDANCE IN BAGHDAD
It is really a coffer of value, as since the Gulf War II everything has changed in the city. Jewellery shops in Al-Kadhmiya and Al-Nahr Street and other areas in Baghdad do not sell gold but rather buy it due to the tough living conditions. Baghdadi ladies have to wear false accessories and sell their jewels due to war and the economic blockade.
"False golden objects were in demand in the past, but the matter has completely changed," he added.
Despite the stoppage of control on gold and insecurity, jewellery is in demand in Iraq.
The Arab population is expected to record 470 million in 2025 and 654 million in 2050, the report said. The Arab population is forecast to continue to grow up by 2.7 percent annually in the first half of the 21st century, and youth is anticipated to reach 130 million in the first decade of this century.
The report noted that the Arab Maghreb countries would see a population drop, while the population of the Arabian Gulf countries, Yemen, Nile nations, Middle East and East Africa (Somalia) countries will grow up.
Emigration from North Africa to European Union (EU) countries helped in population growth stability, while Lebanon remained the last Arab country in terms of growth rate due to emigration, and is expected to account for less than one percent of the Arab population within half a century.
It seemed that the statements that bordered on a decision left the door wide open to rearrange the political position in the coming period.
Mubarak's denial comes only weeks before his prescribed visit to Washington. It is likely that he intended to refute rumours about a deal with the Americans to guarantee bequeathing power in return for a specific Egyptian policy on regional and international issues.
On the other hand, Naf'a said, "Mubarak has only two options: Whether to let the parliament decide on the nature of the coming stage or to take new measures before the end of his tenure so that the people can choose the coming president and his deputy from among several candidates."
Opposition Liberal Al-Wafd Party took the lead in the campaign asking the Egyptian government to take measures to deal with that act. The party organ described the advertisement as a "gross insult" to Egypt adding that for the first time in the world a quiz uses one topic, namely Kuwaiti aid to Egypt exclusively while regarding any human being in the world eligible for participation in the quiz.

In an objection to the political action of their official parties and organizations, 118 lawyers will submit a request to the Ministry of Social Affairs to establish a liberal society called "Constitutional Values Protection Society."

It aims at reforming the legal profession and defending human rights as well as the country's dignity and national liberalization issues, he said. The society will not support any political organization and its formation will only be confined to liberals who believe in participation rather than monopoly.
"If a Muslim woman lives in a non-Muslim country whose laws bar her from putting on Islamic hijab or veil, then she should comply with such laws. By doing so, she cannot be regarded as an Islamic Sharia-breaker since she is forced to do so."
Egyptian Mufti Dr Ali Gomaa expressed fear that the French law on "religious insignia" to be applied in state schools might be a prologue to hitting the Islamic presence in France where the biggest Muslim community in Europe live.
"Tantawi's fatwa represents his own opinion rather than that of Al-Azhar scholars," Chairman of the Higher Council for Islamic Affairs Dr. Abd Al-Sabour Marzouk said. Former Mufti Nasr Farid Wasel said that forcing female Muslims to take off their Hijab runs counter to secularism principles.
They have the right and I repeat they have the right which I can not object to."
Such division in opinion regarding the law which the French authorities intend to put forward for discussion in the French parliament to ban religious insignia in public schools also included Arab accredited ambassadors to France.
He went on to say that the real problem will emerge when the law is passed especially as its implementation would raise questions about the "possibility of getting all Muslim girls out of secularist schools and whether that law would lead to the construction of "religious schools."

He added, "There is a high demand for buying cars especially moderate ones, the price of which used to be LE50 thousand but jumped to LE80 thousand. What boosts such demand is the fact that people are reassured that if they wanted to sell their cars at any time they would find buyers at reasonable prices as prices are stable.

IRON PRICE RISE AGGRAVATES REAL ESTATE MARKET CRISIS
Attributing the price hike to the dollar appreciation has become unacceptable, especially in light of the steady retreat of the dollar on the unofficial market to about 6.50 pounds in less than one month, they added.
Recently, a remarkable boom was witnessed in the activity of middlemen belonging to big traders, as they sell iron at factories without transporting it to warehouses.

SAUDI ARABIA: HOLD GROUND, AS AMERICAN STORM WON'T PASS QUICKLY!
They do not hide this. They announce it and are proud of this. They give priority to Israel's interests, security and future.
We don't know, and perhaps they don't know either.
These pessimistic ideas came to my mind after hours I spent with a friend who came from the US.
Moreover, the wave of concern has ranged from the superficial articles, crammed with baseless accusations and published in the Wall Street Journal and US News and World Report, to profound articles in prestigious periodicals written by university researchers and pressmen who spent months in collecting the material of these articles. Such articles contribute to the formation of the American elite's opinion. It is unnecessary to agree or disagree with what is written in those articles, but it is necessary for us to be concerned with them, as they will shape the elite's ways of thinking and will give us a hint of the questions they will raise during their coming visits to the Kingdom. Time to Rethink:
However, the storm did not pass. It became fiercer and fiercer, having more requests and more accusations, especially as we are convinced that some sides, working between Washington and Tel Aviv, found in the current circumstances a chance to deal a deadly blow to the Kingdom's status in the Arab and Muslim worlds and as an ally to the US. We should resist.
Let our target be to compel the American courts to consider some cases, so that they may be compeled to show the so-called "secret evidence," on which the American Secretary of Justice John Ashcroft depended while leveling accusations at this person or that. The American citizens won't believe such pieces of evidence because some of them are mere translation of fabricated news in mean Arab magazines, upon which money of innocent people was frozen and homes were ruined.

"The Ministry had monitored and evaluated all curricula and was reassured that they are void of any call for terrorism. Our true religion calls for tolerance. By amendment we do not mean to omit any Quranic verse or encroach upon religion. But rather we aim to make it as easy and as simple as possible for students.
INCREASING PRESSURE ON SYRIA TO WILLINGLY ABANDON ARMAMENT PROGRAMME
It is to be mentioned that President Mubarak exerts intensive efforts to convince the US to halt the enforcement of Syria Accountability Act and stop pressure exerted to force Syria to abandon its initial stances and legitimate rights. President Mubarak informed his Syrian counterpart during Sharm El-Sheikh summit of the details of the Egyptian stance which supports Syria and refuses the US measures that threaten the Syrian interests gravely.
AL Secretary-General Amr Moussa is expected to hold a meeting on January 8th to consider the necessary steps in this regard.
Syrian Assistant Foreign Minister Essa Darwish said, "Israel is deluded to think it can achieve anything by depending on force and occupation.
Israeli press sources quoted an Israeli official as saying that the recent regional developments, including occupation of Iraq, Iran's agreement on tightening international control over its nuclear facilities, Libya's decision on giving up its untraditional weapons and the American tendency to deal with Syria in the coming stage, are factors that are meant to increase the international political pressure on Israel to push it to follow suit by getting rid of its weapons of mass destruction.

Former Iraqi President Saddam Hussien will be able to put on any attire whatever he wants, whether a suit or an Arabian uniform (a cloak, a koffiyeah and a headband), when he appears at court, said Wa'el Abdel-Latif, a member of the provisional Iraqi Governing Council (IGC) who is expected to be a member of the jury that will try Saddam and his former regime in a special criminal court.
Q: Is it then a special court?
Q: Will the five judges be from Iraq?
Q: Where will the court be based?
Q: Will you be one of those jurist since you are a judge and IGC member?
Q: Will it be a public trial?
Q: What attire will Saddam put on during the trial?
A: Saddam Hussein and his former ruling regime members are innocent until they are proven guilty. Accordingly, they can put on any wear they like for the time being. But, if they are sent to jail after trial, then they will have to wear prison uniforms.
A: I am a judge and former presiding judge of a criminal court, and I tried many defendants and criminals in diverse cases. So, if a judge gives his opinion beforehand, then he will be a failed and unfair justice. If I said Saddam would face death penalty, then it means that I would try him beforehand and, thus, trial would be meaningless.
A: Saddam Hussein and his regime members are innocent until they are proven guilty.
Q: Did you or other judges visit Saddam and his regime members?
SOURCES: GADDAFI INTENDS TO CONDUCT EXTENSIVE POLITICAL REFORMS
Libyan official newspapers have abounded, in the last few days, in unprecedented articles full of censure against those who they called traitors or revolutionary snobs who trade in the Libyan people's food.
He denied the presence of any Libyan opposition abroad, adding that the popu lar conferences governing the Libyan Jamahiriya regime provided the best political climate where each trend could express its own views freely and without being exposed to any security harassments.
Under the headline, "The coming Role of Security Bodies," the official newspaper said in an article published yesterday (2nd January) that the Justice and Public Security Sector (Libyan Ministry of the Interior) came in the forefront of the sectors that needed restructuring.
Gaddafi's International Institution for Charities announced it had recently monitored an escalation of human rights violation in the Libyan society. It called for trying to promote human rights, improve prison conditions and settle the files of Libyans abroad. Arab diplomatic sources in Tripoli also noted a rise in the number of sudden visits paid by specialized teams from that institution to a number of prisons and custody and detention stations to follow up and monitor the conditions of those prisons and prisoners.

REBAR PRICES SEE WEEKLY HIKES
Dekhila Company increased rebar prices even though it has not yet clinched any contracts with dealers for March, as applied on a monthly basis, and prices have not yet been advertised on newspapers either. Only verbal agreements were reached between them on prices according to the new increase.
Under such circumstances, governmental circles are still calling on Minister of Foreign Trade Yussef Boutross Ghali to cancel dumping charges on construction iron imported from Turkey, Rumania, Ukraine and Latvia, saying that such a move can be made without any legal problems. The government has recently received a grievance from one of these countries, calling for rescinding dumping charges.
Distribution is confined to a certain number of gas stations in order to meet needs of some modern cars that require a fuel of higher quality.
An official source with the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) said there was no increase in the price of 80-, 90-, and 95-octane gasoline, which are sold for 90, 100, 175 piasters per liter respectively.

A study, issued recently by the National Bank of Egypt's Research Centre, uncovered that economic free zones in Egypt neither achieved their goals nor affected the balance of payments positively. Rather, they represented a burden on the State budget, as the bulk of their exports was directed to the domestic market. They also failed to attract Arab or foreign capital. Although the sectorial structure of projects in such zones have been improved in comparison to their status in the eighties, the use of advanced technology by the projects is still modest, the study said, adding that such zones assimilated a very limited number of labour.
Regarding capital, the study emphasized low Arab and foreign contributions to the existing projects inside the country. Contributions by foreigners and Arabs hit 14 percent and 12 percent respectively till June 2003 against 24 percent and 39 percent in 1985. Egyptian contributions to the existing projects inside such zones increased from 37 percent in 1985 to 74 percent by the end of June 2003.
Such fields do not need advanced techniques of production. Free zones are considered a reliable solution to reducing unemployment rates, as such projects assimilate annual labour. However, the number of jobs provided by such zones retreated from 102.7 thousands late June 2000 to 93.5 thousands late June 2003. This is attributed to a drop in the projects under this system from 855 projects in 2000 to 747 projects by the end of June 2003, the study highlighted.
In this context, in a few days' time, Zambia will inaugurate the second Egyptian farm in Africa after a contract had been signed to that effect between the two countries recently.
The main crops to be grown there include: wheat, soya beans, maize, sunflower, vegetables, and ornamental plants. There will also be special basins as fisheries.
Head of GAIFZ Dr. Mohamed Al-Ghamrawi said the new zone is the first of five new free zones that would be set up in 10th Ramadan City, Sadat City and Badr City to serve the investors who work under the "drawback" system with a view to facilitating the obtainment of raw materials and encouraging them to increase export-oriented production.
Chairman of the 6th October City Investors Society Mohamed Al-Menoufi said setting up a free zone in the city would bring privileges to plants and make them more productive over the coming period, as establishing the free zone, storing the raw materials necessary for operation near factories and providing the raw materials on time would lead plants to operate at full production capacity and ensure non-stoppage in wait for raw materials.
Khamis called for setting up a high-tech customs outlet in that zone to release raw materials without delay and follow up their manufacture and re-export them to ensure that no product would be put up on the local market.
Starting the implementation of this agreement will lead to establishing enhanced partnership relations between Egypt and the EU. The agreement will work as a factor encouraging internal reform especially in the economic field.

The Egyptian government is considering opening some files which have been temporarily ruled out because of incompatibility with economic conditions and as they coincided with exchange rates deregulation and the ensuing market fluctuations.

The file of Egyptian request submitted by Abul Naga to Washington obviously concentrates on regarding loan guarantees as tantamount to a deed emphasizing the state's creditworthiness.

He said that there is a shortage in foreign exchange and that export output has stood at $6 billion while imports exceeded $14 billion, besides the state of stagnation and recession which the government has failed to cure. this has brought about a retreat in investment growth rates. While Tunisians' share of investments last year amounted to $4 billion, Egypt got only $858 million, according to Investment Authority statistics.
He added that the flexibility of taxes in Egypt is limited or rather it is not easy to increase taxes proceeds. Any rise in interest rates would lead to a big rise in public expenditure with no similar rise in revenues thus leading to further deficit. The reverse might be expected in the case of an interest rate decline. Moreover, there might be a cut in expenditures and an increase in tax revenues as a result of economic recovery.
Former CBE governor, Dr. Ali Negm emphasized that raising interest rates is a must.

Under this heading, Dr. Hassan Naf'a, an Egyptian writer and academician, writes a lengthy article to say: President Hosni Mubarak had to intervene twice in the first week of this month to wipe out a palpable impairment that apparently poses a menace to political life in Egypt.
It can be even said that the circumstances which compelled the president, who is respected by all, to move personally twice in a week to help the NDP wriggle out of its quagmire, showed how deep the logjam of the Egyptian political system is with its present formula. Reports on patrimonial power did not come out of nothing.
However, the matter was different when the son became a member of the NDP general Secretariat as people began to whisper over power bequeath, immediately turning into a hearable clamour shortly after Safwat al-Sharif the minister of information) became secretary-general of the NDP and Gamal Mubarak took over as secretary of the NDP Policy Committee in a large-scale NDP shakeup.
In fact, such changes, according to some analysts, appeared as if they were part of a series of consecutive power replacements that will only dash any hope for a democratic shift in Egypt.
However, this majority has never ruled out that some elements might seek covertly to promote the idea and put it in place for a certain purpose other than for the sake of God, the nation or loyalty to the president.
They tried hard to prevail on me for a week (to give his son access to the party) to help me in development or whatever, and to help young men to appear and move. So, talk about power bequeathal is meaningless.
Nevertheless, I can confirm that this tender-hearted people will not feel reassured as long as "those who tried for a week to persuade the president" to give Gamal Mubarak access to the NDP remain in their posts as this intelligent people are aware that this group only seeks to notch up narrow personal interests.
Instead of rushing to implement this irrevocable court verdict, the NDP and its government resorted to their usual procrastination and evasion.
Tendering resignation is a voluntary action that can only be done by somebody in a particular capacity.
All this notwithstanding, the NDP and its government carried on with their practices undeterred and conducted elections the procedures of which are doubtful, and undeterred by the boycott by the majority of the electorate in several constituencies.
The party's intransigence, nevertheless, always urges it to deal with the opposition according to the same rationale which Sharon uses in dealing with the security issue disregarding any consequences.
Therefore, President Mubarak felt that he should take the initiative and he tasked the Premier to ask the Constitutional Court to give a say on the matter.
Is the time ripe now for Egypt to make up its mind and resolve the matter once and for all?
Denying that Muslim Brotherhood Group has a secret organization, Akef said, "the secret organization of the group ended fifty years ago". The group has good relations with all parties of the society, he added revealing that he is ready to hold dialogue with the different forces and parties.

He denied that Prince Hassan had contacted him, saying, "He did not call us, nor could we contact him because there are redlines" drawn by bodies, which he declined to mention.
Secretary general of the Islamic Constitutional Movement ICM (political cover of the Muslim Brotherhood in Kuwait) Dr. Badr Al-Nashi renewed the ICM's stance rejecting the policy of violence and terror.
Al-Nashi laid it bare that the fresh discourse mainly depended on openness to and cooperation with different political trends and forces and expressed the society's issues such as education, health and development.
In his first statement after he had been elected for that post, Al-Nashi, who doubles as an assistant professor in the Faculty of Health Sciences, said, "The humble results achieved by the ICM in the parliamentary elections last July accelerated change in the ICM's general secretariat." He, moreover, voiced hope that that change might second the current relations between the ICM and other political forces.
As regards his opinion regarding the current calls for amending educational curricula, Al-Nashi said, "It is necessary not to touch on religious constants."
Although Kurdistan Workers' Party has abandoned armed action and changed not only its goals and objectives but also its name, it is still included on the list of terrorist organizations while Washington still winks at the Kurds' sufferings in Turkey.
Some categories which participate in the Governing Council, however, object to the idea of all Iraqis going to polls. They insist that a federal Iraq should be based on nationalist geographic principles between Kurdistan and Iraq under the pretext that their self-determination right authorizes them to either approve or disapprove. The Kurdish parliament elected in 1992, furthermore, had taken a decision that there should be a kind of co-existence according to geographic nationalistic principles.
Geographically, Kurdistan is a region that used to be historically independent but was annexed to Iraq under an understanding between the Kurds, Iraq and the Britons, thus making Kurdistan an inevitably independent area so that stripping it of that independence would only mean the beginning of a new war stage.
This can be confirmed by various developments including the aggravation of differences between some Arab tribes and the Kurds and between the Turkmen and the Kurds, some Arab tribes, disregarding Kurdish authorities, sought support from the Turkish state, insistence of the Kurds evacuated by the former regime to return to their homes and lands and their rejection of any settlement at their expense.
The US called on the Arab countries, including the Gulf ones, of course, to work out political reforms, adopt democracy, respect human rights, impose the rule of law and put the peaceful rotation of power in place. It is already applying all that in its new American country in the Gulf.
Considering that any country directs its vital interests towards its geographical position, it is well known that America as a Gulf-based nation has more vital interests in the Gulf than other countries. Regarding energy, the U.S. imports around 60 percent of Iraq's oil output, 25 percent of Saudi oil and 20% of Kuwait's oil, constituting roughly 35% of America's oil imports. But, this percentage is forecast to go up to 70 percent, according to a report released by the U.S. Department of Energy in 2001.
On its influence as a Gulf country playing a key role in the region, it is well-known that the Gulf-based America has military, economic and technological supremacy in the region and bears the key burden of keeping the Gulf secure and stable, helps support food security there thanks to its fast food shops sprouting throughout the region, disseminates its culture of music, TV serials and fashion, and urges countries in the region to revamp their educational systems, modify religious curricula and fight terrorism and extremism. Thus, it holds direct and indirect great sway in the region whether at the level of elite, decision-makers, experts, researchers or even simple citizens.
However, 228 years later, the U.S. has become the only superpower in the world, so the same thing may take place in the Gulf-based America. The time needed to notch up such an end will be cut down by almost half as a result of technological advancement and development methods and mechanisms.
Under this headline, Saudi assistant professor of sociopolitics Khalid Al-Dakhil writes a lengthy article in Al-Ittihad to the following effect:
Such events augurs an unprecedented political and cultural changes in Saudi Arabia, which means mere probability and prediction, as the reverse may take place in the future, because such indications have not been included in a government explicit reform programme.
Secondly, the government, which currently seems to be the only party that can activate such reforms, has not decided yet on such a matter. It deals with the reform demands in a positive, yet vague, manner.
We may not wait for long to know the answers of all or some of such questions.
However, it should be observed that the government is an indirect participant in this dialogue, as it supervises it and chooses the parties involved in it.
It is actually an advanced step to gather all of them under the umbrella of dialogue and may be an indicator to a start of reconciliation and acceptance of the 'other' from the intellectual and sectarian points of view.
If the answer is in the affirmative, what is its idea about participation?
The government's concept of dialogue is clearer.
This role makes it control the rules of the dialogue game.
The second option means that the reform bids are but an attempt to stop before urgent pressure of reform, and, therefore, circumvent the whole issue of reform.
Such guarantees ensure individual's independence and free will without which there should not be participation but rather some sort of subordination.
Until such a stage is surpassed, the concept of Saudi reform will remain subject to the dilemma of questions that are linked to each other.
Undoubtedly, their rapprochement should be done through a comprehensive reconciliation, as this will benefit both peoples and deprive Israel of controlling the region.
Therefore, it was apparent that Erdogan's party has decided, since it came to power in Turkey, to open up to Damascus and make consultation with it on the Iraqi question. Turkey accepted a solution to the water problem with Syria and showed flexibility regarding the Iskenderun cause after the Turkish side had made a condition in the past to the effect that the principles announcement should explicitly point out Syria's relinquishing this vital strategic area.
Its presence in Lebanon is also pressurized. The American pressure went to extremes to interfere in the Syrian internal affairs and ask it to make changes in the regime structure and political discourse.
If it seems that the American occupation of Iraq is the main reason that pushed Ankara and Damascus towards more rapprochement and seeking international alliances, the question will be: Will Europe be alternative future ally to Turkey? And will Syria be part of this regional-European coalition? And how will the Syrian-Turkish border problem be solved, which may impede such a tripartite alliance?
Recent data compiled by the Population Policies Department at the Arab League (AL) pointed out that some 13,000 women die annually during pregnancy, a figure that is twice as many as that registered in Latin American countries, three times as many as that in less-developed countries, 13 times as many as that in more-developed countries and 35 times as many as that in North America and West European countries.
Iranians were taken aback by the return of Sayed Hussein Khomeini, Ayatollah Khomeini's grandchild, to Iran coming from Iraq, to which he resorted after the fall of Saddam Hussein regime and following his severe criticism to the regime in Teheran.
Sources expected Hussein to appear at clergy court within the coming days.
Addressing a news briefing held in Egyptian Foreign Ministry headquarters, Maher disclosed that a decision had been taken to restore relations with Iran, confirming that there had been "contacts and understandings" between Cairo and Tehran in this regard and that matters had been developing towards turning over a new leaf.
He, however, ruled out the possibility of any changes in the policies adopted by the group after the death of former guide, Ma'moun Al Hudaibi.
The Guide's choice took place according to the group's statues. We've witnessed no dissentions or disputes. The group leaders are careful about every member of the group."
If the government wanted to have discussions with us, it is always welcome.
He said, "We are advocates of a message.
Akif denied any problems between the group and Egypt's Copts.
Where there are freedoms, there will be a conspicuous role for the woman. So long as freedom is absent, there can be no development, economy or education.
I'm amazed at the position of French Interior Minister Nicholas Sarkozy who is on good terms with that organization there. He is even proud of having such fine organizations that organized conferences attended by more than 100 thousand participants without any act jeopardizing the society."
GADDAFI TO ANNOUNCE NEW NAME FOR LIBYA
Two years ago, there was an official attitude to omit the word "Arab" in protest against the official Arab disregard of Libya's initiatives to develop the collective Arab action together with Gaddafi's proposals in the Arab summit held in Jordan in 2001 to find a comprehensive settlement for the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestinian cause, the source added.
The source, who requested to be anonymous, points out that Gaddafi does not intend to give up his official position as leader of the Libyan revolution within the framework of a policy to rearrange Libyan internal affairs when he decided willingly to scrap WMDs.
A plan was uncovered by head of the Egyptian Industries Federation's Chamber of Building Materials Industry, Eng. Samir Allam. It will be carried out by the Chamber and the Egyptian Union for construction companies. The plan aims at qualifying about 15 major Egyptian construction companies for competition for the execution of international tenders related to mega projects and the effective contribution to the projects of the reconstruction of Iraq, the development of South Sudan and the enhancement of Egyptian contracting activities in Africa and the Arab region.
He pointed out that during the following period such qualified companies would focus on the projects put up within the framework of Iraq's reconstruction and Sudan's development plans. He added that geographical proximity, available building materials and the low cost of transport would grant Egyptian and Arab companies a competitive advantage in the face of foreign companies which, however, have high technological techniques which national companies either in Egypt or in other Arab countries do not possess.
He went on to say that Building Materials Industry Chamber could include the sector of building materials industry on the list of priority sectors within the framework of industry modernization programme. He pointed out that such a move would enhance Egyptian building materials exports especially ceramics, sanitary ware, marble, granite and insulators to foreign markets. The programme would qualify Egyptian exports to comply with specifications and conditions required for penetrating foreign markets especially European Union countries.
He pointed out that some developed countries granted their governments monopolistic privileges in some activities.
For his part, head of the General Federation of Chambers of Commerce Khaled Abu-Ismail said the law aims at organizing the market, controlling the relations between all parties, raising efficiency of the market and protecting consumers and producers from groundless allegations, particularly in light of many loopholes in the market, mainly including manipulation of exchange rate.
A fresh dollar book project was considered to be put up early July at an interest rate that is 1.5% over the present dollars interest rate with the aim of attracting small dollar depositors and eliminate the unofficial exchange market. Meanwhile, economists and bankers warned that such a step might lead to a setback that will cost the exchange market a lot.
Interest rates shouldn't be changed unless a real stability is brought to the monetary market, foreign exchange supply is provided and speculations in foreign currencies, especially the dollar, are over as such speculations have exhausted national economy recently.
He went on saying the exchange market is in no need of such measures at present, particularly as the dollar exchange rate is on the wane.
The minister said her ministry contributed to the foundation of two new companies. The first company operates in the field of prospecting for petroleum, 10% of its capital is funded by the ministry. The other company, namely Helwan Company for Fertilizers, will be designed to meet the needs of domestic market and exportation. The ministry contributes 20% to the capital of that company.
Spinning, textile, dyeing and ready-made clothes industrialists called upon the government to reverse its recent decisions on cutting down customs tariff on foreign imports. They stressed that such decisions would lead to the closure of 3 thousand industrial facilities and the dismissal of 4 million workers.
Concerning ready-made clothes, the finance minister's decision stipulated that customs duties should be reduced from 50% to 46% and then to 43% in the early 2004 to hit 40% at the beginning of 2005.
These decisions were untimely as the local industry modernization program presented nothing to the development of yarn and textile industry, which means that the technological competitiveness of that industry is almost nil, said industrialists. Even if that industry were competitive, the continual rise in raw materials prices on overseas markets made most producers unable to produce, otherwise they would sustain heavy losses. The government decisions had better reduce customs duties on industrial raw materials rather than fully-manufactured products.
This is not the first decision that would negatively impact on those companies, as the exchange rate deregulation decision caused exchange rates to skyrocket and, moreover, made companies unable to fulfill their contracts or even to import raw materials.
Mohamed Abdel-Salam, member of the Chamber of Textile Industries at the Industries Federation, said as the government insists on putting the new customs tariff into effect, we call for abiding by the GATT, as the current position of industry cannot bear customs reduction. Trying to find an excuse for that the government claimed that its last decisions included cutting customs duties on imported capital equipment to nil percent, a decision that we oppose for it didn't include reducing the 2%-administrative charges, the 3%-stevedoring cost or the 10%-sales tax, he added.
Undersecretary of the Foreign Trade Ministry for Research Department Dr. Saeed Abdel-Khaliq said the government's decision on cutting customs duties on yarn and ready-made clothes was preceded by in-depth studies on how far the local industry would benefit by that decision.
Those decisions were direct support of textile industry as a prelude to customs tariff cut decisions after years of protection, which led that industry to depend on marketing its products locally even they were bad or of low quality, said Abdel-Khaliq.
The Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMS) emphasized an increase in the value of national exports in the first ten months of 2003. the Authority chairman Ahab Olwi emphasized that the value of exports rose form LE17.8 billion to LE29.7 billion in 2003, an increase of 66.8% compared with the corresponding period in 2002.

Last week, some investors in spinning industry met together in Businessmen Association headquarters to discuss the effects of the decision.

The denial was voiced by the minister while addressing a symposium on the Toshka Project organized by the Press Syndicate's Economic Committee on Sunday.

The CIB has recently resorted to increasing interest rates in pursuit of a better investment of available cash fluidity and match between investing in treasury bonds offered at higher price and granting distinguished interest rates to depositors.

AUTO INDUSTRY: BETWEEN THE DOLLAR'S ROCK AND HARD PLACE OF OPENING TO EUROPE
As for the volume of the number of cars in Egypt, it has grown in the last 7 years to reach 2.716 million cars in December 2002 including 1.9 million passenger cars, 664 thousand trucks, 61.647 thousand buses. Regarding car feeding industries in Egypt represented in fittings, seats, exhaust pipes, spare types, filters, glasses, conditioners, bus glass, radiator components, etc, they achieved 45% local component manufacturing while buses achieved 60% and buses from 50 to 70%.
Away from the language of figures and statistics, auto industry in Egypt relies on more than 20 factories with international agencies which manufacture different types of cars, mainly passenger cars, by importing their components from countries like France, Germany, South Korea, Italy, the USA and Japan.
Assistant Secretary of EMAM Eng. Salah al Hadari thinks that the volume of demand for cars in Egypt exceeds the volume of sales and is not proportionate, in the meantime, with the number of the population. The level of individuals' income, however, affects the sales movement and the real problem of production is linked to the economic volume in Egypt. Such a problem is aggravated by the fact that free Arab trade zone applies negative lists, which means that the car movement between Arab borders is not subjected to customs exemptions, customs duties, therefore, increase the car price. To ward off this problem, those negative lists should be cancelled in the joint Arab unity project to bring about a boom in car market movement.
If the national domestic component increased in the auto industry, this will mean an increase in Egyptian market activity. In my opinion, the solution to the industry and exportation crisis lies in canceling negative lists and activating the domestic market by the implementation of flexible systems to replace old cars by new models that preserve the environment and suit the Egyptian citizens' income. Egypt is the Arab country qualified for taking the lead in auto industry in the Arab region because of its expertise, cadres and broad base. This will be enhanced by the implementation of the European-Egyptian partnership agreement under which Egypt could export cars to Europe without taxes," Al-Hadari added.
The National Car "Although some factories fared well in increasing the rate of domestic components and sometimes exceeded 70%, they still rely in the first place, on imports from abroad. Such a system is considered a success and I wish we could have a 100% national car in Egypt, which would be possible if companies efforts combined to produce a national car instead of each company following its own interests and personal investments," he pointed out. In that case, the domestic cost of the car would be reduced instead of its increase year after year due to its link to the American dollar rate of exchange.
A ministerial committee under Minister of Local Development Mohamed Zaki Abu Amer will be formed to consider all investment laws, which amount to about 30 laws, with a view to considering unifying them.

This complex would include representatives of ministries and authorities concerned with investment. Other developed branches for the GAIFZ will be set up in governorates to cooperate with the main complex in the GAIFZ headquarters so that the main complex and its branches will include experienced cadres to deal with investors.
During that meeting, problems and proposals will be reviewed with a view to preserving the gains made by that sector in the field of exports in 2003.
He pointed out that such a step would reduce production cost, thus enhancing competitive capabilities of products on the domestic markets in Egypt as well as those on international markets to cope with the rivalry to be expected after the cancellation of quotas for exports to America and the full implementation of the free trade zone agreement as of January 2005 which provides for full cancellation of customs duties on exports to the agreement members countries.

The government and economic bodies contribute some 0.6 billion pounds or 12.8%. The public sector companies contribute 0.4 billion pounds or 8.5%.
GAIFZ Chief Mohamed Al Ghamrawi said on Tuesday that the meeting also discussed investment disputes settlement, adding that a dispute settlement committee would be formed under GAIFZ to that effect. A judge will chair this committee, he said. Another ministerial committee would be set up under Minister of Agriculture for settling disputes.

The funds' assets totaled 12.193 billion pounds last year versus 10.938 billion pounds in 2002, up 11.5%.
STRONG TENDENCY TO RAISE BANK INTEREST RATES
This development comes in accordance with a monetary policy led by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) in coordination with the Ministry of Finance to back the raising of the interest rates and encouraging dollar depositors to change to the pound in order to benefit from the high interest rate, thus helping in curbing demand for foreign exchange and, therefore, stabilizing the foreign exchange market.
In reply to a question by Al-Alam Al-Youm about the percentage of the expected rise in the interest rates, Ezz El-Arab emphasized that the percentage is unknown. However, he added that he expected that such a rise would include the deposits whose period is less than one year.
This may push the bank to raise the interest rate on the granted facilities. The banks encourage investment and increase credit growth rates. Therefore, raising the interest rate may curb this tendency, he noted.

The Ugandan decision is considered very "serious" because Uganda together with Ethiopia form the source of the River Nile.
The Nile basin countries have growing development and population needs, Mahdi said, defending his 21-point proposals, including granting Egypt and Sudan 80 percent of the Nile water and dividing this percentage between Khartoum and Cairo under the 1959 Agreement which provided that the Nile source country should obtain 20 percent of water.

The organizations, 12 in number, demanded that the law should regard the issue of any Egyptian father or mother as Egyptian one so as to achieve equality enshrined in the Egyptian Constitution as well as all international charters and conventions.

3 AFRICAN WATER MINISTERS: SELLING WATER TO EGYPT IS NOT GOVERNMENTS' OFFICIAL STANCE
There is almost a plot in the Nile Basin countries where the upper reaches of the Nile have witnessed numerous events the latest of which was some talk about the Nile Water agreement signed in 1929 under which Egypt obtains 55.5 billion cubic meters of water.
Egypt, undoubtedly, knows all these goals and those behind them especially as the water issue is an extremely vital one and can never be taken lightly.

Touching upon the issue of financing the linkage project inside each country, Yunis said, "The studies were financed by the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development through grants. Projects inside each country are financed through loans. Each country would be responsible for the construction of the infrastructure of the linkage line in its territories," he added.
FRESH ISRAELI CONSPIRACY AGAINST EGYPT Under this headline, Al-Wafd daily carries its front-page top story, which runs to the following effect only in part:
Al-Wafd phoned Sherif to know the truth. He categorically denied any connection with this issue. However, he uncovered that he was not an engineer but rather an employer in the sales department, emphasizing that he had nothing to do with any Israeli missile system.

Turkmenian sources in north Iraq revealed that Israel had bought over 200 square kilometers at an area situated between the Syrian border and north Iraq and extending eastward to the Iranian border and passing through Telafar and Mosul in Iraq.
Extending from Telafar to Mosul as far as the Syrian border and East Iraq, the significant pathway, which Israel is now seeking to fully control, will negatively affect Turkish-Iraqi trade once the second border gateway called Ofakwi Gateway between both countries is opened as the road leading to Iraq via that gateway will pass through the area where Israel bought land for 50 kilometers, they said.
There are indications that Israel is seeking to move soon to buy more land as far as East Iraq to be near the Iranian border, turning the area into a rear base for its allied British and American forces expected to be stationed between Cyprus and the future Kurdish statehood in north Iraq and Syria. Thus, the U.S. will have successfully taken the first step towards its project "Greater Middle East".

Arab countries came second where they imported some 65,972 tonnes, followed by East European countries, 9,027 and lastly Asian and African countries with 14 tonnes.
Al-Sharqawi added in exclusive statements that this cotton-cultivated area saves products to the value of 3.8 million kantars only while the locally required volume hits about 4.5 million kantars.

HARBINGERS OF REFRESH ON REAL ESTATE MARKET AFTER 5-YEAR RECESSION
Head of the Housing Committee with the People's Assembly (PA) Mohamed Abul-Enein said that there was a cautious surge in real estate activity in the last few weeks, but this surge, he added. This depends on the success of real estate finance law in activating demand to balance with the supply and to move to the stage of financing the medium-cost housing which represents the biggest part of the Egyptian real estate stock.
Real estate companies should seize the chance to market the stock which has piled up for years, especially after the real estates restored their position as a coffer of value after years of no trust in real estate investment, Hegab added, pointing out that there is a constant demand for medium-costing, over-medium-costing, and distinguished housing units that include small villas. This increase in building materials led to a rise in demand for housing units for fear of new rises in the prices of flats and real estate.

Under this headline, Dr. Asim Khashaba of Al Arabi wrote a column, some excerpts of which ran to the following effect: The Egyptians are a good civilized people and therefore always love and respect their heroes and historic leaderships.
As the people actually does not trust Ebeid's government and its ministers nor do they regard any of them as representative of the President of the republic or the people, we believe that it is time now to have a regular contact between the President and the people through a television or radio talk where the President would talk to the people about their conditions.
If the President said that the prices of those things did not rise at all, we would take his words for granted and immediately believe him. If, however, he said that they had already risen, we would then let ourselves ask him how an honest citizen could possibly live even on the bare necessities of life?
Does stability mean that scores of elderly people should stay in their positions forever even though the country's conditions are getting worse?
The people who fought with the President in October and were promised peace, prosperity and decent life want to know from the President what income is honestly required and where it could be earned so that a human life could be lived.
We, in fact, want many talks from the President about our peculiar relations with America and Egypt's approach to the former's occupation of Iraq and to the American bases in the Gulf and Egypt's attitude towards what is going on in Sudan and the Nile basin countries. Talks and topics are many and open-ended but we should start as the people actually need such talks regularly about the nation's conditions and Egypt's position in the Arab and the Islamic worlds and its missing role in both.
In Saddam Hussein's era, it was not easy to contract him as telephone contacts were not available. Nor had the Internet entered Iraq then, nevertheless his deputies could some how contact him, especially from outside Iraq. This, however, did not happen daily.
Al Sistani is said to have opposed the security arrangement idea regardless of the insistence of political, religious and security bodies on having them implemented.
He, then, lifts a curtain which seems which seems to be older than anything else in the house. A visitor would then enter a square-shaped hall with an entrance to the room where Sistani receives his guests and visitors.
He sits on the carpet and daily receives hundreds of citizens of different affiliations, occupations and political, regional, international and intellectual levels.
Experts and Advisors: Work in Sistani's office is characterized by primitiveness and modesty. The structure of work is not quite obvious.
It is not obvious in the office structure how administrative specialties are distributed. There is no secretaries and therefore Sistani has no office manager or personal secretary.
Sistani, untiringly, receives hundreds of those visitors from all over the world every day.
Sistani runs an extensive network of religious schools and universities. Students in schools affiliated to the Religious Authority exceed 7 thousands and are expected to rise shortly to three times as many as they are, even though their number under Saddam reached its minimum - three thousands.
IRAQ AND LEBANIZATION SIGNS: CIVIL WAR!
It is true that national feelings are reluctant to comply with such a kind of advice and warnings, but it is also true that Librahimi cannot be accused of being away from the region or unfamiliar with the make-up and sensitivities of its countries.
The majority want immediate elections because they feel that the results will bolster their position. Another group, however, consider such immediate elections as an attempt to reverse a golden rule of governing that has never been violated.
We should not also forget that a Sunni and a Shiite mosques have been targeted together with some assassinations that aimed at arousing sectarianism, the last of which was the assassination of the Sunni Scholars Organization leader.
What I mean here is that the loser should deal pragmatically with his loss to curb further losses and the winner should deal responsibly with the sensitivity of the Iraqi make-up to control his gains, as how a victory can be of any value in a lost and worn-out Iraq where the Lebanization signs are looming!

The General Congress of Egyptian Journalists has done well to put up the issue of the freedom of the press as a basis of democratic reform not to encourage journalists and those concerned with the press and free expression, but to spur and encourage all the society to adhere to their demands, defend their democratic rights and public freedoms, not to take advantage of the governments' weakness before American pressure and current blackmail, but to emphasize people's rights to extort their democratic rights through a march of vehement popular struggle led by genuine civil society organizations.

It gives credit to living forces in our country that they categorically reject any foreign interference in our internal affairs or any political dictates from the American President Bush regarding his plans to spread democracy in the Arab World. I might even dare to say that in his dialogue with the Egyptian intellectuals elite in the Presidential headquarters last Tuesday, President seemed quite aware of the dimensions of the danger facing our country including a siege meant to tighten control on all its borders as well as a marginalization of its role in the region.
Quite openly, we are calling on the regime to have confidence in itself and in its people.
The President might say that he is not so much interested in entering history as in maintaining the country's security and stability. However, according to security requirements as well as history entry opportunities, there is no alternative now to changing and unrestricting democratic freedoms to ensure stability. We dare say that the present stability is a fragile one that can stand no harsh tests like those facing the region and the world now, so much so that some public figures never known to be hardliners started warning against an extensive laxity or perhaps bloody anarchy!
The MPs were taken aback to know about these clandestine talks and that's why an official notice closing the dialogue file with Israel was a must.
The government, in turn, cannot sign any deals without referral to the parliament, they added Moreover, the deputies called for canceling the Israeli delegation's imminent visit to Cairo to finalize negotiations on the deal.

GREATER MIDDLE EAST: US EQUILIBRIUM FIRST STEP
I don't know why Arabs always call for change and reform.
The Greater Middle East idea should developed by the region's countries rather than being imported from abroad in a way that is full of superiority on the part of other parties. It had better come from inside the Arab community.

Bush phoned President Hosni Mubarak and reviewed with him means of rectifying the peace process in the Middle East, said Middle East News Agency (MENA), confirming that the call touched upon efforts to stop the deteriorating situation between Israel and the Palestinians in addition to moving the peace process on all tacks.

Speaking to the US Arabic-tongued "Al-Horrah" satellite channel, Powell said, "I agree with the Saudis and the Egyptians that these initiatives should not be imposed from abroad.

Under the above heading, Mahmoud al-Maraghi, a veteran journalist, writes a lengthy article to say: Where does Sinai lie on Israeli agenda?
Let's begin with the broader circle of Israel and its neighbours that fought with it, entered into reconciliation and treaties with it, offered sacrifices in a long-standing conflict and then extended their hands for handshake, but unfortunately found no encouraging gestures.
- The land premonition and whether the Israeli entity needs more land though its population is not large.
The third premonition, which controls the Israeli policy, is Israel's population that stood at six millions. Sharon has failed to attract another million Jews to Israel, and emigration from the Jewish country owing to the Palestinian Intifada has been on a large-scale, while Jews across the world, especially in the U.S., are now reluctant to risk their safe and stable conditions by leaving for an unstable nation.
Sinai was proposed for this purpose in the Zionist projects, but Palestine, where Jewish heritage lies, as the Jewry claimed, then turned out to be the Israeli dream.
I (the writer) don't think that Sinai is a target as it is now better for Israel to bring stability to its internal situation and stop its conflict with the Palestinians, rather than open a new front with the major Arab country.

After September 11th 2001, it became utterly impossible to define political nomenclature governing Washington's diplomacy in the Middle East, so how much more difficult it would be to agree with the USA on a common vision regarding the new Middle East?
In the first stage, the period of which may be determined by the American presidential elections in November, the American administration would be in greater need of Syrian cooperation with it to restore security stability to Iraq. due to the American administration continued preoccupation with Iran, Afghanistan and North Korea, it became difficult to expect that the state of tension in Syrian-American relations would go beyond the framework of active and sometimes warm diplomacy especially if the American administration ascertained the seriousness of Syria's commitment to controlling the joint borders with Iraq and close down the offices of the Palestinian organization classified as "terrorist" and perhaps discussed with it a schedule for Syrian forces pull-out of Lebanon.
Under this headline, Al-Ittihad published a lengthy article which ran to the following effect:
The countries qualified for a pivotal role are facing various difficulties which gave the opportunity to smaller countries to have a status they had widely aspired after.
This visit, however, makes it possible to argue that there is a strong possibility of an increase in Turkish concern for the region not only due to national security consideration as is the case with Iraq, but also due to an eagerness to have a regional role as would be expected if a Turkish mediation between Syria and Israel proved a success.
The strong indidcations of the resumption of relations between Cairo and Tehran and preparations for Israeli involvement in the political and economic partnership proposed for the region as well as factors that have or about to have a central role in regional interactions.
Under current parameters, there is no country in the region that solely combines all such standards.
In addition to current arrangement to intervene in chronic conflicts without giving a major role to any regional forces in the implementation of its agenda, which would inflict further sacrifices and require further creativity to deal with fills that no longer want to involve countries that used to be pivotal to them.
A collective leadership, therefore, might be a proper option to achieve stability and equality as well as the creation of a system with closely linked ideas that would suit the next stage with its different calculations.
If all countries interests converge to attain gains or avoid losses, the idea of a collective leadership would enjoy an even broader promotion as a realistic solution to the current vacuum in the region.
The concept would automatically lead to the extermination of the known regional organizations in favour of a proposed melting pot and new concepts that go with the coming stage requirements.
It means more than one thing for more than one region, government and people. Such unification is the first step taken by the European Union countries, under an unabashed American pressure, to set up the American promoted big project - the Greater Middle East. The free trade zone, as well as the unification of Cyprus is the first step towards a reconstruction of the East Mediterranean region with the European contractor's tools under the American architect's supervision. It is rather the start of the political striptease of the Arab bloc together with the beginning of the fall of sovereignty, entity, identity and privacy cards to be replaced by a "prospective spring" with the blossoms of natural birth-rights, a global protocol for inalienable rights, markets beyond political borders and movement of individuals in search of job opportunities and production and motivated by a sublimation of skills and capacities.
Dr. Hashim added that strangely enough the same factors remained instrumental under the 1923 Lousan treaty, Turkey abandoned its rights in the island of Cyprus, which are the same factors today that make Turkey in a dilemma whether to preserve a historic gain or meet the requirements of a pledge to get access to the club of the European powers.
In spite of Dr. Al-Amir's agreement with Dr. Hashim, the former sees that the Middle East seen by America after the September 11th incidents differs from that known to the Arabs. It rather extends in the East from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh (and perhaps Iran) as well as the countries overlooking the Caspian Sea northward including Turkey and southward to Sudan, Yemen, the Indian Ocean stores and westward to Morocco, Mauritania the Atlantic coasts.
He thinks that the Turkish position in the negotiations would be weaker due to the fact that both Turkey and Greece are NATO members and due to the Turkish hope of completing its European identity.

AGREEMENTS FOR ECONOMIC AND TRADE COOPERATION BETWEEN RUSSIA AND EGYPT TO BE SIGNED

A delegation of the Russian Scientific Research Institute for Irrigation Systems signed on 28th April a protocol on cooperation in the field of irrigatin and new plants with the National Research Center in Cairo.
Professor of Agriculture, Ain Shams University, Ahmed Al-Arabi said that cooperation in this field deals with the problems of Egyptian soil such as dryness. It also aims at developing irrigation systems and crop structure that suits such soils, through applied researches that will be applied in Egypt and Russia.
On the other hand, the Egyptian commercial Representation Office (ECRO) in Sanaa started arrangements for the 6th of October Products Exhibition Association delegation visit to Yemen within the framework of a promotion tour aiming at promoting the city's products as well as signing exportation contracts.
This increase is attributed to the hike of the volume of Egyptian exports to Yemen, which hit 25.2 million dollars in 1999, 36.7 million dollars in 2000, 40.84 million dollars in 2001, 50.78 million dollars in 2002, i.e. up 10.3 million dollars or 25.4%. Exports to Yemen also increased to 78.5 million dollars in 2003, i.e. 27.72 million dollars or 54.6%.
In the beginning we would like to refer to some official statements and figures that confirm the government involvement in public fund plundering in privatization program. In 1993, the World Bank (WB) report said that the value of the public enterprise sector companies hit 550 billion pounds, while Al-Ahram Center for Economic studies and the National Investment Bank appraised them at 500 billion pounds only.
The same scenario was repeated with AL-Nasr Company for Boilers, the sole company of its kind in the Middle East. It was sold for 58 million pounds, which was less than the price of the land on which the factory was built. What is more funny is that when the issue was raised in the People's Assembly it was discovered that the real selling price is 56 million pounds only and not 58 million pounds.
Lawyer, Samir Abdel-Mohsen pointed out that the government had violated the law in selling operations, as the company has to be appraised at first and should not be sold less than the appraisal value, otherwise this will be an explicit public fund plundering. It was expected that the government would sell those companies at prices more than those set by the World Bank or the specialized centers in Egypt. What happened can be called selling on a whim or "selling under the table"

REFORM CONFERENCE IN ALEXANDRIA: SECRET DISCUSSIONS DESPITE ADHERING TO FREEDOMS
Despite the fear of Islamists and the desire to exclude them from participation, the participants included two Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) dissenters, namely Khalid Al-Za'farani who dissented in 1987 and joined, later on, the Labour Party and Dr. Mohamed Abdel-Latif who dissented in 1996 and took part, together with other members who were axed by the Ikhwan due to their step, in founding the Wasat Party.
He vowed that sanctions would be put in place in a "very strict way". Evading talking about any deadline to Syria or a list of demands, he only mentioned a trinity of charges in the Syria Accountability Act, including "terrorism", Lebanon and weapons of mass destruction. An earlier U.S. statement to use the stick was neither sudden nor illogical as long as the U.S. President George W. Bush Administration regards as logical the policy of humiliation and bowing down under the banner: either submission or subjugation.
The first message also envisions that Bush, who is confident about his reelection, neither will nor can try to provoke the Jewish lobby in his administration.
The second message concerns the Egyptian ally who has maintained "partnership" with consecutive American administrations for 25 years, the age of the Camp David peace deal between Egypt and Israel.
Such blackmail has reached the extent that U.S. envoy Marc Grossman, who is promoting the "Greater Middle East" reform project by force, strongly warned Egyptian officials in Cairo not to repeat the case of Saad Eddin Ibrahim, a human rights activist and professor who was jailed for allegedly receiving aid and grants from foreign organizations without taking the government's permit.
PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION TO VISIT KNESSET TO CELEBRATE "CAMP DAVID ACCORD"

SYRIAN FILE KEY ITEM ON MUBARAK'S AGENDA IN THE WHITE HOUSE
The Egyptian President's political advisor Usama Al-Baz has expressed doubts that Washington's measures against Syria would go beyond the threats and pressure. He said, "It is a matter of exercising pressure. I rule out the possibility of any serious American orientations to take any military action against Syria."
SERIOUS CHARGES AGAINST YOUSSEF BOTROS GHALI
The most serious of such accusations, however, according to the interpellation, was Ghali mediation to save his brother from the crime of drug trafficking and his involvement in exporting Egyptian cement to contribute to building the racist wall, which Israel is constructing on Palestinian territories.
Even though President Hosni Mubarak more than once denied intentions to bequeath the rule to his son, some still see Gamal Mubarak as a model for the next president. In the last Eid El Fitr (Ramadan feast) the President described that issue as a lie believed by its own mongers".
The book frankly called for turning to "national liberalism that establishes respect of national culture and the country's tradition as a way out of the accumulating crises of the country and the people." It admitted that "Egypt's crisis cannot be dealt with through ready-made or imported solutions, but rather through solutions based on rationalism, humanitarianism and liberalism in feelings and thought."
The book concluded by saying, "Gamal has proven to have required attributes after he took up a leading position in the partisan or administrative action system." However, the book criticized Gamal's concentration on one particular class of the people in his talks whether partisan or public, thus confining his interest to that class's relevant issues, and omitting to have an overall view especially as the majority of those views concentrate on economic aspects."
Minister of Water Resources Mahmuod Abu Zeid denied any tension in relation among the Nile basin countries, emphasizing that their relations are strong and subject to the Nile Basin Initiative agreement.
"The African Development Bank, the World Bank and donor countries are being contacted to devise a finance mechanism and provide investments required for such projects after donors agreed to provide $140 million to conduct studies for such projects which will take 4 years," he pointed out.
In a press conference held on Saturday on the occasion of an Ethiopian parliamentary delegation's visit to Cairo, Abu Zeid said, "There are constants for negotiation including preserving Egypt's historic rights in the Nile water." Cairo believes that the current negotiations should concentrate on the ways and means of cooperation to make use of the Nile wasted resources rather than redistributing the water quotas of the Nile.
Such agreements were concluded by Britain on behalf of its colonies in East Africa at that time.
The Nile Basin Initiative, launched in 1999, includes 10 African countries - Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Sudan and Tanzania.
According to Planning Minister Dr. Othman Mohamed, the Egyptian economy started to get rid of the state of stagnation it witnessed in the last couple of years.

Dr. Othman said that the new plan had been devised in light of the improvement of the Egyptian economy which got rid of the state of sluggishness brought about by the international economic situation after the September 11th, 2001 incidents.
Over the last few days, bank dealings witnessed a state of perplexity due to measures currently applied by banks which inquire about clients within the framework of money laundering operations, official banking sources said. Clients were taken aback by such questions due to being unaware of such measures, which played a main role in romoving Egypt's name of the blacklist of the countries that do not combat money laundering, the sources said.
In exclusive statements, Al-Okda said instructions were issued to the banks recently not to have large amounts of money deposited without probing into their sources and soundness, pointing out that in case the sources of funds were unknown they would be turned down in line with all world banks that combat money laundering operations.
He ascribed that to "ignoring what was happening there for long years."
However, the Ministry of the Interior rejected deputies' accusations. Assistant minister Major General Ahmed Diyaa denied any kind of remissness, collusion or refrainment on the part of the police regarding confronting Al Nekhaila gang, adding that there was no negotiating or bargaining with the defendants during their siege in the island.

SHIITES IN EGYPT
Al-Nafis had called for a meeting attended by Shiite leaderships to set up a constituent council comprising, besides himself, Dr. Ahmed Galal, psychiatrist with Abou El Azayim Hospital, Mahmoud Rajab, owner of Awlad Rajab chain stores in Cairo, Ahmed Hilal, Sheikh Hasssan Shehata as well as others. Most of such names have been arrested in previous security crackdowns in the last 25 years. The issue of Egyptian Shiites leadership is considered one of the main issues raised in the Shiite arena.
He was once accused by Rasim Al Nafis of once hanging up on the Council's representative when the latter asked him to intervene and use his power to release the Shiites detained in Ras Gharib and blamed him for the chaos suffered by the Shiites in Egypt. The list of those who converted from the Sunnite to the Shiite sect included big names but we are uncertain about the truth of their affiliation. They include eminent writer Fahmi Hewidi, Islamic writer Safinaz Kazim as well as well-known writer Salih Al Wirdani and Said Ayoub, Othman Gasim Mari (author of Shiites in Egypt), late Fatehi Radwan, head of the Arab Organization of Human Rights and Sheikh Mohamed Ismat Bakr, Sheikh Hassan Shehata who has recently been released after being arrested in 1996, and others.
He added: "As far as we know from news reports, the movie handled the last days of Christ and Crucifixion. Therefore, we have asked to watch it first. If it includes something contrary to the Islamic Shari'a, which states that the Christ was not crucified unlike the film events, it won't be given the thumbs up."
Official reactions to the Greater Middle East initiative are so far not convincing or capable of ensuring safety for our country or the rights of the citizenry in a better system or a better government or a better country.
In the context of his explanation of the Egyptian initiative for political reform in the Arab world, President Mubarak admitted for the first time to a gross defect in public rights and freedoms.
I'm afraid such special needs might mean repression, poverty and government corruption rather than defending our human, social and national legitimate rights. The Palestinian cause, in particular, might be in danger of being exchanged for illusions of democracy the American way! Such special needs allegations seem, frankly speaking, out of place as they come from Arab governments that chose to abandon everything and is willing to pay any price so that they might stay in power!
Quite frankly, we say that it is public opinion alone that can serve as the protection shield and as the foundation of legitimacy. It is no use, therefore, seeking protection from terrified, timid and shaking Arab regimes that would offer any concessions or capitulations just to stay in power!
President Hosni Mubarak phoned his Algerian opposite number Abdel-Aziz Bouteflika to contain an imminent crisis between Egypt and Algeria due to statements on reform in the Middle East.
Algeria experienced democracy without any external pressure, the statement said, adding that Algeria benefited by its historical, social and cultural background in creating the style of its political system.

EGYPTIAN PARLIAMENT APPROVES A SPECIAL COURT FOR FAMILY CASES
The bill also aims at the introduction of an integrated system for family court in the Egyptian judiciary system by setting aside a court for the examination of all personal status affairs, as well as the custody of self and property.

Reducing customs tariffs and taxes imposed on gold works and jewels would qualify Egypt to be a center for gold and jewelry, especially the Indian ones, in North Africa, which will bring profits to the Egyptian government in the form of hard currency, he added, pointing out that the value of Indian jewelry and precious stones exceeds one million dollars.
In-camera meetings were held in Entebbe (Uganda) last week on the banks of Lake Victoria where the Nile source lies, without any final conclusions being reached over the question of the Nile water division.
Other African countries, however, want to have that agreement amended. When Julius Niriri was president of Tanzania, he said that as those countries got their independence, all agreements signed under the colonialist era became null and void.
He added, "Some African countries demanded that the 1929 water agreement be reconsidered. The agreement had allocated Egypt a fixed quota of 55.5 billion cubic meters of water due to the heavy rain all the year round in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Ethiopia which, therefore, do not need one drop of the Nile Water."

You know that the enemies of the Arab and Islamic nation are many and may cause us trouble anytime."
Regarding the role of businessmen in Iraq's reconstruction in the coming period, he said, "Iraq's doors are open.

Edelman Irrigation ministers of 10 Nile-Basin African countries will hold an important hot meeting in Nairobi today (18th March) in an attempt to redistribute and re-divide the Nile resources, as most of the countries accuse Egypt of controlling the Nile water and depriving them of their rights.

According to Tanzanian Minister of Water and Livestock Edward Lowassa, this agreement had been signed by colonizers in contradiction to the interests of most countries concerned. "How can we respect a treaty that had been signed in such a way that contradicts our national interests?" he said.
Expectations of Arab League reforms should, therefore, be rather modest unless a surprise takes place in the form of an Arab awakening or crystallizing Arab leadership that would take the lead among the Arabs in the face of the bitter struggle they are undergoing on the international arena for self realization and the defence of their causes and sovereignty.
The problem does not lie in disapproving or approving democratic or modernization changes in each of the Arab countries concerned or in misgivings about having a project imposed from abroad or in insistence that no project should contravene Arab and Islamic countries or arouse sensitivities.
The project exceeds the democratization of Arab and Islamic countries to other goals, which cause Arab differences and make the Arabs refrain from dealing with them, apart from a few pretexts like Washington's ignoring of the Palestinian cause.
In light of this new system, Arab political identity may be dissolved on the international level should the plan to liquidate the Palestinian cause work out.

EGYPTIAN PROPOSALS TO BOOST EXPORTS TO RUSSIA
"The file includes a set of proposals to boost trade and investment exchange between the two countries. A proposal provides for the activation of joint businessmen association agreements (Businessmen Council, chambers of commerce, and Federation of Industries) through holding regular meetings between the two sides provided that the Egyptian party should be provided with a preset and clear plan of action such as export offers for certain commodities and initial studies on joint ventures," said First Undersecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and chief of the Commercial Representation Asharqawi Hefni. The proposals and ideas of such a plan should be reviewed through joint meetings between the two sides, who should not also confine their meetings in Cairo or Moscow, Hefni said.
Through the free trade agreements concluded between Egypt and Arab countries and between it and south and east African countries (COMESA), Egypt is considered the natural gateway for Russia to such markets.
However, most of such agreements were hindered by the lack of required finance to the exclusion of a limited and important number of agreements Fields of cooperation include cooperation between the Egyptian Iron and Steel Company and two Russian companies in the field of modernizing and rehabilitating some engineering equipment and furnaces in the Egyptian company, in addition to a Russian-German consortium to upgrade 12 turbines in the High Dam to general 2100 megawatts and other cooperation between SEDCO pharmaceutical company and the Russian Central Lab for Producing Insulin with a Russian expertise at the Egyptian company's labs.

The German ambassador pointed out the improvement of Egypt's investment atmosphere due to efforts being exerted by the government to amend investment guarantees and incentives law. However, there are still some obstacles negatively affecting investors' decisions to come to Egypt. Such obstacles include the multiplicity of bodies whose approvals should be obtained. Although such bodies have been gathered in one place, investors still need to get other scores of approvals let alone the time spent in customs measures, he said, pointing out that reducing such approvals and streamlining customs measures will encourage investors to make up their minds and invest in Egypt.
He lauded cooperation between the German embassy and the German-Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry in this respect.

Head of the Investment Committee of Businessmen Association Justice of Supreme Constitutional Court and Head of Capital Market Authority told Al-Alam Al-Youm that the new law on investment have five unconstitutional loopholes, the first is that the draft law was not referred to the State Council, in contravention to article 172 of the constitution, the second is that additional incentives are determined under a ministerial decree without any legal grounds.
Fahmi said that he believed that the law would not attract more capital nor would it encourage investments as the Investment Authority should have been more deeply embedded in the structure of the law. Furthermore, the law has imposed services duties on domestic projects whereas they had been confined to free zones only.
Fahmi said that the law has created a legislative vacuum by cancelling article 3 of law 8 pertaining to Capital Authority evaluation committees, thus turning such committees null and void and suspending their own files.
Premier Atef Ebied received a report from the Central Agency of Public Mobilizations and Statistics about private sector exports in 2002-2003.

ARAB CONTRACTORS WINS TENDER FOR BUILDING GIANT BRIDGE IN TUNISIA
The importance of this giant project, whose execution would start early July next is attributed to the fact that it would serve the commercial Radis Port which is the main port in Tunis and receives the different kinds of commercial and tourist ships.
He told Al-Hayat that the coming conference would be held in March in the Jordanian capital Amman.
Such committees included a Bibliotheca Alexandrina forum on reform and a body to follow up activities of the civil society as well as the steps of reform in the Arab League. In addition, it called for holding an annual Arab conference for civil society organizations. It also formed a follow-up committee that would convene every six months to review implementation of recommendations.
Nevertheless, director of Bibliotheca Alexandrian Dr. Ismail Serag Eddin lauded the outcome of the conference and described the final document as "representing dreams of an elite of several trends".
Meanwhile, the Israeli Knesset (parliament) is going to consider on Monday a fresh draft law that calls for shutting down the Dimona reactor in Negev desert near the Egyptian border due to its dilapidation.
Meanwhile, the Israeli Maariv daily reported that the Knesset's ultra right-wing members ripped the three Arab deputies to shreds and called for banishing them from the Knesset for uncovering such information.
They believe that Sharon suggests an impractical plan and that he aims at passing his unilateral separation plan.
Last year, immigrants dwindled to only 24,432, down by 25%.
However, they told him that his aim is unrealistic because a few number of Jews come from the United States.
There are still 7.847 million Jews in the world, most of them live in the United States.
An opinion poll, published by the Israeli Yediot Aharonot newspaper on Friday, uncovered a dim image of women's status in Israel and the Israeli community's idea about them.
Fifty nine percent said equality between the sexes in work had not been achieved although a research conducted by the Central Census Centre uncovered that women were more educated than men and their number is larger but their incomes were less than those of men by 23 percent. The total income of a workingwoman hits 5320 shekels (950 euros) against 8650 shekels (1550 euros) for a man. Women represent 48 percent of the workforce and 56 percent of them are underpaid.
Spokesman for Muqtada Al-Sadr's office in Baghdad Abbas Al-Rabei accused the American administration in Iraq of introducing a paragraph to the interim constitution allowing the Jews to come back to Iraq and giving them all rights including holding both Iraqi and Israeli nationalities at the same time.
Reaching a consensus between the trend of higher Shiite authority Ali Al-Sistani and that of Al-Sadr on the interim constitution would lead to taking joint steps to confront that law, he noted.
Only a few hours after celebrating the birth of the "provisional constitution", it turned out that such a text failed to solve the essential problems among Iraqi factions, but rather established them.
The fact that the matter concerns a "constitution" and the establishment of a "state" makes it improper to back out of supposed understandings which had been reached only the previous day.
Thirdly, the occupation authority has practically prevented the fall of the former regime from turning into a political coup on behalf of just one Iraqi faction.
With regard to the Kurds, in particular, it was necessary to take into consideration their long history of confrontations with the state of Iraq.
The Shiites, all of a sudden, founded themselves in power in Iraq, but without a previous prepared political platform to run the position which devolved to them.
Some of the operations have even created more discord than "accord" between Iraqi factions.
On Tuesday, Kuwaiti government recognized that it is facing a water shortage. Projects will be implemented in three years' time to face the shortage that started to drain the strategic stock of water in Kuwait, which depends on desalinating sea water in 90 percent of its water needs.
Kuwaiti National Assembly (Parliament) held a session on this issue on Tuesday. "The government is responsible for this problem to a large extent," Al-Fahd said, adding, "We should undergo three hard years until a desalination station is set up". The Ministry of Energy took some measures such as calling on state-owned bodies to reduce consumption, raising people's awareness, and hurrying up to collect water bills to encourage people to rationalize the use of water, he said.
He was born in Medina. Asharq Al-Awsat learnt that the consulate would be opened next month and that the consul would start work there in 20 days' time.
Jadallah says that Khurasan alone sends 40 thousand pilgrims and 200 thousand Umra (minor pilgrimage) performers every year. The new consulate would facilitate procedures and relieve pressure on the Saudi embassy in the capital, Tehran.
The project comes within an all-out study presented to the Shura Council by the Ministry of Transport on the ways and means of developing and upgrading motorways, Al-Hayat learnt.
MOROCCO HOPES REJUVENATION OF EUROPEAN TUNNEL PROJECT
A Moroccan source, asked for anonymity, said, "Rabat shows sympathy with the Spanish people in these events, respects their democratic choices, look forward to further cooperation and coordination in all areas within the European Union and the Euro-Med region."
Analysts say the outgoing government's 'hostile attitudes" towards Morocco helped waste Spanish firms business chances and get benefited by the Moroccan privatization program and huge projects contracts. French, German and American firms won those contracts except for a US$1.5-billion one to buy the Moroccan Tobacco Company.
Madrid, under Aznar's government, sought to issue sanctions against what it called " non-cooperative countries in immigration issues".
Sea Tunnel The under-Mediterranean tunnel was one of the most important projects that were discussed under the previous Socialist government in the 1990, but the idea was shelved under Aznar's government, considering that the 3 to 5-billion-dollar project would promote Moroccan exports to European markets, increase Moroccan labour in Europe, boost European tourists and investments inflows to Morocco.
The US did not consult anybody, whether at the level of countries or institutions, nor did it make any official contacts. Basic rules have been ignored in that American initative, whose officials did not meet or coordinate with anybody under the pretext of democracy which has nothing to do with such behavior that aims at swallowing the region and handing the Arabs on a gold plate to Israel.
There is also a chance for Arab civil action organizations to play a role, in addition to raising economic integration and activating the role of the private sector.
The topics discussed during the conference were different from those dealt with in the official Arab initiatives, which were mulled over during the last Arab foreign ministers' meeting, to be submitted to Tunisia Arab summit.
Al-Hayat, for its part, got a copy of these papers that abounded in criticisms for Arab regimes, governments and religious institutions.
The paper said the "Greater Middle East" plan was not a test open for free selection but rather in the form of orders and demands that should be met.
The Arab world is not coping with the "tempo of the modern world", it said.
HIZBULLAH CALLS FOR SQUARING UP GREATER MIDDLE EAST PLAN
We do not accept to be represented by neither those who do not perform their duties towards their religion nor by religious zealots who interpret religion out of their whims and kill people in its name."
The "American reform" seems to replace it, as the former cannot be delayed.
The stage needs must have made competent authorities forget that the Arab League issue had already been postponed for several decades. They might have opted for future deliberations so that reform proposals might be practical and realistic or rather applicable.
It is no exaggeration to say that the "American Reform" paper has turned Tunisia Summit agenda upside down causing its papers to be confused.
The more important issue is of course the American project as it comes in the context of two occupations- an American direct occupation in Iraq and another American indirect occupation in Palestine.
The latest confirmation of that fact came from Kuwaiti Premier, Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmed Subah who said that his government had not received the project nor did it want to receive it. Like all other Arab leaders, he said that reforms were an "internal affair".
On the other hand, there is an Arab attempt to prepare an Arab project. The extensive dialogue which was advocated by Bibliotheca Alexandrina in the last couple of days will be within that approach.
Remarkably enough, the "convention document" to be adopted by Arab leaders is trying to tell the world that Arab countries still insist on working together and announce unified positions emphasizing that they had common things among them.
Head of Water and Drainage National Authority, Al-Shafei Dakruri denied reports about moving the prices of water categories for the citizens' tourism, industrial and service activities especially as there are no standard prices for various governorates or even in the same governorate.
He added that the organizational authority of drinking and sanitary water and consumer protection is entitled to draw the operation licences of those companies should they fail to achieve their objectives and to assign such responsibilities to other companies.
Medicine industry experts called for coordination between Arab countries to square up to international monopolies, particularly after the medicine-related part of the world trade agreement was put in place, which would affect the local industry and lead to an increase in local products' prices.
Hamed added that the medicine industry in Egypt faces huge challenges, foremost of which is the inability to exist on overseas markets. Egypt's medicinal exports hit 124 million pounds in 2001 against 75 million pounds in 1995.
The "Comprehensive Development in Egypt" report shows that the mobile phone market is subject to a bilateral monopoly due to Telecom Egypt's decision to delay the permission of a third mobile phone company.
On the other hand, the latter say the present-day economic conditions are not congenial to the third network whether in view of the number of subscribers and the volume of returns. The project also poses major financial risks. In addition, the governmental decision to liberalize the exchange rate has led to a change in the third provider's feasibility studies as profits will drop within seven or ten years of operation.
RETREAT OF EGYPTIAN IRON SALES ON SAUDI MARKETS EXPECTED
The Egyptian-Korean Business Council will hold its fourth round in Seoul, South Korea, on June 8th next.

Mohsin Yehia, vice-secretary of Contractors Union for Foreign Affairs said that the rebar price jumped to 3650 pounds late last week versus 3600 a week earlier and 3500 three weeks ago. He disclosed that this exposed other rebar related industries to a cul-de-sac. He cited a rise in other building materials due to the rise of rebar prices.
For his part, MP Mohamed Khalil Qwaita pointed out iron monopoly by some Egyptian companies, which produces 65% of the iron on the market, and controls over 68% of the marketing capacity.
It was agreed to sign a cooperation protocol between the 10th of Ramadan Investors' Association and the Ministry. A joint committee of the two parties will be formed to prepare for convening a periodical meeting every 6 months at most to acquaint them with the ministry's services and available grants and loans.
Although Amer did not disclose the details of the proposed policy, the intention to unify foreign currency exchange rates on the supply market attracts attention once again to what has been raised before about a study that would usher what will be known as the "dollar interbank." The study is being made by the Committee for Developing the Exchange Market, which was established more than three months ago to reform the monetary system, whose imbalances are manifested in the distribution of foreign cash currency among outlets, now that exchange companies are systematically snatching a large part of the foreign currencies offered on the market and pouring it into the parallel market. This is being done in an environment of mistrust that helped flourish the speculation market and made the powers that were supposed to balance the Egyptian pound against the US dollar go beyond the supposed gap to fall into a bottomless abyss that equals about 20% of the real value that the dollar should have against the pound, which should be lower than the actual rate by about Â£E0.80 per dollar on average.
He suggested making use of the proposal that he had made earlier for offering dollar bonds. "The Government worked along the lines of my proposal when it made the opening of dollar saving bases available to family business sector within the post-office saving community."

The report pointed out that the aim behind showing quota-used rates is to show the performance of each commodity exports rather than compare between one commodity and another. The quota used rate depends on the period elapsing between each commodity season.

Chief of the commercial department in the French embassy in Cairo admitted to the slip of the competitive performance of French wheat in comparison to American wheat in the last season.

WHERE'S EGYPT'S SHARE?
In reply to that question, a visualization of the visit has been created by us claiming all sorts of advantages through promotion of trade and economic relations between Egypt and Germany.
For what recompense shall we back the European stance? How far are we in a position to exercise our pressures and then get a recompense?
The reply was a categorical denial as the president asked that the initiative would include that point!
They much rejoiced in partnership which has been applauded as a great achievement of the Egyptian people to find a way out of its crisis focused on 13 commodities exempted from customs duties with certain export seasons mostly in the period from October to April when the earth in Europe is covered with ice making it incumbent to import their needs from abroad.

20 FRESH OIL, GAS EXPLORATION AGREEMENTS
MINISTER: NO INTENTION TO INCREASE PETROL PRICES
Under this heading, Jordanian writer Yasser Al-Za'atera writes to say: Since Casablanca, Riyadh, Karbala and Kazyemia blasts and recently Madrid train attacks, it can be said that what is called "Islamic violence", which is not based on persuasive arguments or convincing political motives, has lost one of its "survival components", best represented in popular support and encouragement.
The intifada model was exceptional in its ability to penetrate each and every single house in the Islamic and Arab worlds thanks to satellites and communications revolution. Add to this the centrality of Palestine's case in the hearts of Muslim masses!
By occupying Iraq and the eruption of resistance there, it can be said that the American occupation of Iraq has become identical to the Jewish one in Palestine and that's why the Arab consciousness focused its attention on Iraq's war as was the case with Palestine.
The feelings of anger, defiance and confrontation, however, were more persuasive in the cases of Iraq, Palestine and Afghanistan because they were directed to an open enemy.
In Madrid, Spain, the situation was similar. If the people targeted in the first case were Muslims, they are non-Muslims in the second one. But, they stood by Muslims, refused aggression on Iraq and strongly denounced US policies and interference in the Middle East.
If the ideological cover of these attacks was also cleared, they would surely come to a halt. We first have to ask ourselves about the benefits of these attacks.
Political items had the lion's share as they amounted to 12 in number, foremost of which were the summit presidency report on the activities of the Follow-up Committee, implementation of the Sharm El-Sheikh summit resolutions, the secretary general report on collective Arab action and developing its system through discussing 3 sub-items that have been included as per the summit resolution no. 248 dated 1/3/2003, namely:
The Arab-Israeli conflict item comes fourth after the Arab peace initiative, the Palestinian cause developments, the occupied Golan heights and solidarity with Lebanon (this item was included at the behest of the General Secretariat).
Well-informed sources expected the project to be approved, thus preventing foreign intervention.
Asharq Al-Awsat learnt that all the Al-Haska governorate's schools had been closed down with a view to sparing students any violence acts. The governorate's districts live now under a state similar to an optional curfew. Those areas are dominated by a state of cautious calm in light of security control. This happened after demonstrators burnt some official departments and internal transport buses while lifting American flags, some of which amounted to 20 meters in length according to an eyewitness.
The Administrative Control Authority (ACA) in Egypt arrested one of the advisors of Agriculture Minister Yussef Wali for accepting bribe from businessman in return for allocating more plots of land for his tourist village. Counselor Ahmed Fatehi was caught red-handed Monday evening taking one-million bribe, as a first batch, from the owner of the "European Countryside Village" located on Cairo-Alex Desert Road.
Serious negotiations are currently underway between Egyptian and Saudi businessmen to study a proposal put forward by former head of the Court of Appeal Counselor Hassan Ahmed. The proposal is related to setting up "hovercraft passages" to link Sharm El-Sheikh city to Al-Sheikh Honeid region. For the first time in the region hovercrafts will be used for transporting people, cars, and trains from Egypt to Saudi Arabia and vice versa via Sharm El-Sheikh canal in a journey that will take only fifteen minutes.
PARTISAN LEADERSHIPS LAUD MUBARAK'S DECISION TO BOYCOTT ISRAEL'S PEACE TREATY CELEBRATIONS

Such a savage crime is a setback, he said in a statement on the recent Israeli terrorist act, praying that God may punish the killers and encourage the Arab and Muslim worlds to support the wronged. If the current Arab position continues, the nation's fate will be very weak. "I urged the Arab leaders who are expected to meet together in their Tunis summit to get united and to be on the side of the wronged," he said.
The Islamic Research Academy condemned the Israeli assassination of Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and his bodyguards as a terrorist act.
The Egyptian Ifta' House on Monday declared as martyr Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, founder and leader of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), who was killed in an Israeli missile attack following dawn prayers on Monday.
Addressing the executive committee of the Council of Middle Eastern Churches in session in Cairo, Priest Safwat al-Baiyadi, chairman of the council, prayed that God may grant the Palestinian people patience and wisdom under their current difficult circumstances.
The four no-confidence motions called by six Israeli opposition parties were overwhelmingly turned down in the Knesset, which showed full support for Sharon's criminal policies.
Well-informed sources expected the procedures of Administrative Control Authority Chairman Major General Hitler Tantawi's retirement to be completed in a few days' time. He has completed his first term in office as chairman of the Administrative Control Authority but no extension of service decision has been issued contrary to previous expectations. Tantawi is expected to be succeeded by one of the senior officials in a sovereign ministry.
Well-informed Palestinian sources unveiled to Al-Majalla secret negotiations between Hamas leaders and member of the American officials. The talks held by American Council for Foreign Relations Steve Cohen in Gaza came within that context, they said. Another round of negotiations will start in Cairo, the sources said, adding that Cohen met Hamas key figures Mahmoud Al-Zahhar and Ismail Abu-Shanab and that the two parties discussed the deteriorating situation in the occupied territories and the role that can be played by the United States.
Within the coming 25 years, the Arabian Gulf Area would face the worst water crisis in the world unless actions were taken to avoid that, said Hamid bin Nasser Al-Owais, Electricity and Water Minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
"The population of the GCC countries has doubled in the last five decades from 5 million to 30 million inhabitants, and is expected to hit 56 million inhabitants by 2025, up to more than 3% per annum."
In his speech, Al-Owais confirmed that in order to face such challenges, the GCC countries had to resort to seawater desalination.
The National Progressive Grouping (Tagamo'h) Party condemned the assassination of spiritual leader of Hamas Movement Sheikh Ahmed Yassin describing this action as a criminal one which confirms that the Israeli government turned a long time ago to a gang of killers and assassinators who aim at liquidating the Palestinian leaders and waging a genocidal war against all the Palestinians.

Abdullah Al-Shami; The spokesman for Islamic Jihad Movement in Gaza Abou-Qusai: The spokesman for Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades. He is ranked fourth on the Israeli assassination list.
Nafez Azzam; an eminent leader of Islamic Jihad Movement.
The statement called on all public and official forces and institutions as well as the Arab League to urgently move at the international level to ask for taking legal action against Israeli political and military officials to bring them to book.
Sheikh Yassin appealed to Arab kings and presidents to stop normalization of relations with the Hebrew state. "We appeal to you to shut down the enemy's embassies, commercial bureaus, and consulates. We call upon you to effectuate boycott and stop cooperating with and contacting Israel," Yassin said.
The Palestinian people hope that the summit would help all their expectations come true." Yassin went on to say, "The nation has the potentialities and capabilities that enable it to defend its national causes and end its enemies' audacity. I see that time is ripe for our nation to follow Allah's words: "And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allah (i.e. the Holy Quran), and be not divided among yourselves." "Al-Aqsa Mosque appeals for your help as the Zionists have prepared themselves to destroy it," Yassin added.
He, furthermore, described the operation as cowardly. "At dawn we heard about the death of Sheikh Yassin, who is a disabled man. This is a brutal act. No one thought that matters would reach that limit," Mubarak said.
At the permanent-delegate level, the Arab League Council condemned the terrorist operation committed by the Israeli occupiers, pointing out that the incident represents the worst form of state terrorism.
Al-Hayat held the following interview with head of Hamas Political Bureau, Khaled Mash'al, some excerpts of which run to the following effect:
Leadership in Hamas is collective as it is an institution.
A: There is no need to hold any meeting as such mechanisms are automatically used when the movement is left by any of its dear symbols and leaders whether on the political or military level.
If Sharon wanted to exterminate resistance, we would escalate it. The size of the Palestinian requital would be just as big as that of the crime committed.
A: So were they in the past but they used to be governed by operational points which strugglers used to take into account in accordance with circumstances, potentialities and the situation on the ground.
I think it is only natural that the enemy's act should be returned in kind.
A: Yes, including him, but it's up to the military leaders on the ground and to their potentialities and estimates. I wish them every success.
Should some people call it extremism or terrorism, we call it the peak of moderation, as it is only logical, fair and moderate to stand against crime, defend yourself, claim for your rights and achieve Palestinian national rights.
A: There are four messages: firstly an attempt to redeem respect for the Zionist army especially after Ashdoud operation which the enemy regarded as a strategic strike in the depth indicating utter Zionist security failure. Such an operation is meant to show off and restore that kind of balance in the Zionist street.
Q: Who are those parties?
He, however, wanted to leave Gaza and tempt the Palestinians into internecine fighting. God willing, we're going to work for preserving such unity and the right of the Palestinian people and consequently preserving the achievements of the uprising and the resistance especially as we feel that the Palestinian national achievement is drawing nearer. Sharon is trying to deprive us of it or just throw us into the internecine conflict fighting for power to give the world the impression that the Palestinian people is not fit to have any entity or state of its own, thus justifying his control over occupied Palestine lands.
ASSASSINATION OF SHEIKH YASSIN ABSENCE OF PALESTINIAN SAFETY VALVE
From the security aspect, Sheikh Yassin is not regarded as a difficult strategic target.
In spite of the fact that, through his weight and leading position, he was very close to the circle that could green light a continuation or stoppage of those operations, he was always the mastermind that could control any wild audacity.
In a way, he could maintain a status which was almost free of any personal animosities. This made him eligible for any attempts to reduce or cease those operations carried out inside the Green Line, to reconcile with the authority or to take any really big move.
It is also known to Israel who knows well that the chances of controlling or stopping military action generally rather than literally lay in Sheikh Yassin's hands.
If Hamas, the major movement could protect itself from any dissentions or schisms in such a way as would arouse surprise at least on the Palestinian arena and in spite of the repeated political pressure and tug-of-war, Sheikh Yassin is given credit for preserving the movement's unified and flexible spirit that would accommodate a variety of orientations.
The challenge is the formation of a collective leadership to fill the gap created by the absence of Sheikh Yassin's charisma and his leadership based on "compound" legitimacies.
Then comes a second challenge to Hamas namely the relation with the Authority and preserving the red-line drawn up by Sheikh Yassin, the civil war line.
The worst scenario, however, lies in Hamas' military wing going wild or the movement suffering from schisms as that would actually inflict losses on everybody.
This means that the political leadership has got the eligibility and efficiency to modify and move the track in accordance with a political agenda (whether favourable or not).
Until such a stage is reached, nonetheless, Israel has to go through a stormy seas of retaliatory actions which it has itself courted through committing such a folly!
With the departure of Yassin, considered a representative of the "moderation" trend in Hamas, Sharon's government seems at a first glance to have dealt a serious blow to the PNA which recently complied with stupendous Arab, European and international pressure to regain control in spite of the stay of the Israeli occupation in Palestinian-controlled areas, which goes in a "latent" harmony with Israeli demands despite killings, destruction and dismantling.
Concerning the role of Cairo, which exerted more diplomatic activities thanks to its position, weight and interests closely related with happenings in the Palestinian territories, received a painful blow too, especially as the Egyptian government did its utmost to bring closer views between the Islamic movement and the PNA, after it was proven that the killing of Yassin has exceeded his position as a Palestinian national leader, giving him "Islamic" position. Here, Sharon sent the Egyptians into trouble: between Washington's fire and domestic opposition even though the Egyptian President said earlier that he could not shrug off the public.
Some observers see that Sharon notched up his goal of finally eradicating the PNA through the banner "there is no Palestinian partner to negotiate with."
ARABS CONSIDER ASSASSINATION OF SHEIKH YASSIN "TURNING POINT" IN ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT
Syria Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said the assassination of Sheikh Yassin is a dangerous escalation of the situation.
Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri denounced the operation and considered it the climax of genocide perpetrated by Israel against the Palestinian people.
Morocco Moroccan Monarch Mohamed VI sent a cable to President Arafat denouncing the aggression. The Rabat-based Islamic Education, Science and Culture Organization (ISESCO) condemned the assassination, saying, "It will lead to more violence."
Bahrain considered the assassination operation a "crazy act". Islah (reform) Society Chairman (Muslim Brotherhood) Sheikh Eissa bin Mohamed Al Khalifa said the assassination of Sheikh Yassin is more heinous than any other crimes.
Iraq The Iraqi Governing Council condemned the assassination of Sheikh Yassin.
Jordan "It is a crime leading to more escalation, violence and instability in the region," Jordanian Monarch Abdullah II said.
"The assassination of Sheikh Yassin will open the gates of hell on Israel," said the Islamic Labour Front.
Sudan Thousands of Sudanese demonstrated in front of a Hamas office in Khartoum.
"Israel lives in a morality crisis by assassinating an unarmed disabled old man," a statement by the Libyan Foreign Ministry said. It held Sharon responsible for the "genocide and daily crimes against the Palestinian people."
Al-Rantissi, who was chosen by Hamas Movement two days ago to be its leader in Gaza Strip following the assassination of Hamas founder, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, used also to do this as part of his activities in the Muslim Brotherhood Group which he joined in Egypt when he was studying in the Faculty of Medicine in 1956.
The conditions of the family when the elder brother traveled show that the family was living in abject poverty, as Al-Rantissi says that at that time he was wearing a used pair of shoes, but when his elder brother was about to travel he gave his brother that pair of shoes and returned home barefooted.
While preparing his master's degree, Al-Rantissi was affected by two Sheikhs of Muslim Brotherhood Group, namely Mohamed Eid and Al-Mahallawi, who were giving sermons "Al-Salam" and "Ibrahim Pasha" mosques and were in conflict with the late Egyptian president Anwar Al-Sadat.
Al-Rantissi wrote the first statement carrying the name of Hamas.
In prison Al-Rantissi memorized the Holy Qu'ran in 27 months he spent in solitary confinement.
Now, Al-Rantissi is living under threats from the Israeli government and he tops the list of those wanted by Israel.
Hamas is an Arabic acronym for "Islamic Resistance Movement". It defines itself as a national public resistance movement striving to provide proper circumstances for liberating the Palestinian people from occupation and oppression and to confront the Zionist project backed by the neo-colonialist forces.
Like any other movement or organization, Hamas' organizational structure includes a Shura (advisory) council that is designed to set the general policy of the movement.
Khalid Mash'al has been the incumbent head of the politburo since 1996. He holds a Jordanian nationality and has lived in Damascus since he was deported from Amman. He survived an assassination attempt on 25 December 1997.
"To highlight the vitality of the movement, brother Dr. Abdel-Aziz Al-Rantissi was elected head of the movement in Gaza Strip as per the constitution of the movement," said Mash'al in a written explanation on the concomitants that coincided with proclaiming allegiance to Al-Rantissi, of which Asharq Al-Awsat got a copy.
Hamas enjoys the support of 30% of Palestinians, according to polls. This rate may increase following the assassination of Sheikh Yassin.
His successor's name was kept secret. However, there is talk about Mohamed Daif, the wanted number one for Israel, who is still at large since he has escaped from the prison of the Palestinian Authority in October 2000 and survived an assassination attempt but he was lightly injured.
However, sources of the Egyptian Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources said the project was not inconsistent with the historic 1929 Nile Treaty to ensure a fair Nile water division among the ten countries along the Nile, saying that Egypt did not intend to oppose the project, which comes in the framework of trilateral cooperation among Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan for a better use of Nile water.
Analysts say that Ethiopia hopes that it will overcome its worst waves of drought in several years by using Blue Nile water to help boost food production in the 67-million-people country, which is one of the poorest countries in the world.
GAMAL MUBARAK LINKS PROGRESS TOWARDS PEACE TO PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN REGION COUNTRIES & INT'L COMMUNITY
Gamal Mubarak, who has been leading a reform trend in the ruling party for years and in charge of the position of the party's Policies Secretary, replied to a question on the date of the emergency law abrogation, by saying, "Such a law will be implemented only in the field of terrorism combating."
Gamal Mubarak added that any initiative for reform in the Middle East should not disregard finding a solution to the Palestinian-Israeli dispute. He attributed the lukewarm response to foreign reform initiatives to the "double-standard policies and the absence of equity, which reflects a contradiction in the concepts of human rights and freedom.
He talked about policies in the developed world linking terrorism to the less developed regions. He criticized ignoring the radical and genuine causes of instability in the Middle East.
Nor do I believe that anybody could call on the Palestinian resistance elements to restrain themselves, choose their targets, or differentiate between the Zionist categories when they deal their strikes.
All Arab peoples look forward to their Arab summit to be held on Monday in Tunisia.

Producers and employers in Egypt say that Egypt's failure to make enough benefit of the COMESA agreement is attributed to member states' non-commitment to the agreement controls. Moreover, some of them manipulate the certificates of origin to unrightfully benefit by the customs deductions. Egyptian importers also exploit the agreement by turning to importing from COMESA countries as an alternative to other markets to make use of the customs exemptions stipulated in the agreements. In addition,, there are numerous negative lists between member states, thus lowering the chance of trade influx between countries as is the case in Sudan, where there is a negative list that includes more than 85 commodities, representing 90% of its total imports. Accordingly, it is difficult for Egypt to penetrate the Sudanese market that is considered the main gateway to the COMESA countries.

Some people are of the view that businessmen's boycott of any meeting to be attended by the US ambassador to Egypt would be the most eloquent proof of opposition to the US policy in the region as well as the ambassador's personal policy of interfering in the position of press and his second bid to impose his dictates on the Egyptian press.
A key source that accompanied President Hosni Mubarak in his recent visit to the US last month, told Al-Hayat that the US told Egypt of the necessity to take certain steps showing Egypt's interest in several commercial agreements to be discussed soon forefront of which are the free trade zone agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The European Union On the other hand, relations with Europe are witnessing the fruit of half a century of cooperation, as EU Ambassador to Egypt Ian Burg highlighted the importance of relations with Egypt, which is a highly respected country.
He pointed out the dire need for establishing a strong non-governmental organization at the Egyptian-European level, especially as there are several strong bilateral business organizations and chambers of commerce that lack coordination among them and the EU institutions.

The council will include members from most Egyptian business councils and will not be confined to the Egyptian Federation of Chambers of Commerce (EFCC) or the Federation of Industries, he said. This will create some sort of diversity that will, consequently, push Egypt-Iran commercial relations from the stage of goodwill to actual cooperation in many promising fields and industries.

A new fad called the "killer snake" has recently come to the surface.
The "death dance" is a 3-stage violent race in which a young rival tries to "turn off" the meter of his car, reach maximum speed and then make a sudden turning around with his car.
Meanwhile, a security source says only a few young men practise this dangerous game, which has not yet become an alarming phenomenon. However, the source calls for decisively standing against those frivolous young men.

For his part, Manager of Cairo Center for Human Rights Studies Bahei Eddin Hassan who doubles as head of the Culture and Information Committee with the NCHR, called on the government to take political decisions that might enable the NCHR to do its job. On the other hand, Secretary General of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights Hafez Abu Se'da who doubles as head of the Complaints Committee with the NCHR called for freeing the press and mass media of government restrictions so that the press might play a criticizing role towards the NCHR to activate its role.
"Unfortunately, we have no real partner on the other side; but rather we have a government that obviously seems determined to impair and destroy all good offices by the UN, in spite of the efforts exerted by Egypt to bring all parties concerned to the negotiating table and persuade them to abide by the roadmap and work together to achieve the compromise that definitely represents the desire of both Palestinian and Israeli peoples who suffer from violence," he added.
Maher was talking at the eve of the 25th anniversary of Camp David Accords between Cairo and Tel Aviv.
While Egypt resorted to reducing tension with the Sharon government recently, it did not backtrack on two main issues - the return of the Egyptian ambassador and releasing Israeli spy Azzam Azzam who is serving a 15-year imprisonment sentence in connection with an espionage case.

The sources connected with bodies taking part in the current contacts said that the efforts which are being made concentrate on the question of Egypt's acceptance of an important role at the security and administrative levels to ensure control after Israeli forces withdrawal from Gaza Strip.
While inter-Palestinian talks ended in a three-point agreement and Egypt is making ready to host fresh rounds of talks in Cairo and send a delegation to supervise the rehabilitation of the security bodies in Gaza, Britain also got involved in this process and set up a "room of operations" in the West Bank with a view to unifying security bodies.
The British team assigned with this task did not succeed in setting up a similar room of operations in the West Bank due to an internal conflict among security bodies and the current complicated situation in Gaza where armed resistance is concentrated, they added.
SIX MOSSAD AGENTS KILLED IN IRAQ
Under this headline, Al-Hayat deputy chief editor Abdel Wahab Badrakhan writes an article which runs to the following effect: After Iraq invaded Kuwait in the summer of 1990, the Arab world slided into an abyss whose ultimate bottom may not be the occupation of Iraq. The gap between the two events was just wasted time which nobody could make use of either by reviewing the nation's conditions or by dealing with the historic crisis which was obviously fraught with potential dangers to Arab interests both in toto and individually.
All the difference is obvious now in Baghdad: the Israelis are present while the Arabs are undesirable.
Iraq's occupation constituted a chance seized by the Americans to review the region's map.
So long as self-initiated efforts fail, prove difficult or non-existent, external intervention seems possible or even inevitable especially as the Americans are eager to avenge the September 11 attacks and think that the day has come for settling up accounts with the Arab world without delay.
There was an Arab summit prior to the war, but it, too, could produce no more than another type of "inaction".
Looking forward to developing the Arab League may well be one of the lessons derived from the trial, but it is much less than what is required.
Developing the league, however, has been unfortunately delayed and has, therefore, to enter for a race with the Greater Middle East" system.
In a telephone conversation with Asharq Al-Awsat, Gamaleddin said that no body can talk on behalf of the Shiites as a faction, even the supreme religious authority cannot do that. This is because there are Shiites from all parties. They also include secularists and they are scattered all over the country so much so that no body can claim that he represents them all."

Lately Hamas addressed a written message to Moussa asking him to allow a delegation representing it to take part in the Arab Summit activities. Hamas' request meant to allow let Arab leaders be acquainted with the deteriorating conditions in the occupied Palestinian territories and try to convince them to take a unified stance in solidarity with Hamas, following Israel's assassination of Hamas founder and spiritual leader Ahmed Yassin.

EGYPTIAN CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES TO IMPLEMENT PROJECTS IN IRAQ EARLY NEXT MONTH
Egyptian companies have previous experience in working in Iraq, not only at the construction and building level but also in other commercial fields.

The number of gold traders in Egypt currently hits 18,000, while the number of gold workshops is about 5,000, Abbas added, pointing out that jewellers and owners of gold workshops are suffering from such bad conditions. Some of them seriously think of changing their activities, he said.

The fresh amendment aims at giving the department the right to dispose of idle and leftover goods as per certain controls to the benefit of public utilities.
Dr. Abdel Munim Saudi, head of Auto Manufacturers Association (AMA) and one of auto producers, believes that the "new charges would affect auto sales for a short period," noting that the greater effect would appear once again in the long-run and particularly over the coming four months before sales come back to track. The market would gradually maintain this increase.
It also imposes new charges on cars with an engine capacity of 1,000cc, he said, but, unfortunately, Egypt does not produce such kinds of cars and its imports do not exceed 1500 cars annually.
AFTER INCREASE IN DUTIES PARALYSIS STRIKES AUTO MARKETS

Q: What is the goal of your visit to Cairo and how do you assess German-Egyptian relations?
I see that Egypt also seeks to carry out important economic reforms. On the other hand, there are German companies pumping increasing investments in the oil and car sectors including BMW, Chrysler and Opel.
A: German exports to Egypt and the Arab world are good or even excellent. The year 2003 may have witnessed a remarkable drop in the German exports to Egypt due to many reasons foremost of which are the liberalization of the pound rate of exchange in Egypt. The crisis of the German economy is attributed to constant increase of oil prices. I have talked with the Egyptian government about oil exports. I think that if oil prices remained high they would cause many problems not only to the German economy but also to the European and international economies at a time when countries started to restore their strength following the state of recession that afflicted world economy.
A: The accession of ten countries to the European Union will result in widening the European market, especially as Germany's exports to East and South European countries (which recently joined the EU)are bigger than those to the USA. Germany also pays attention to the Arab region.
I believe that the agreement will open fields and create many opportunities for the Egyptian industrialists, who should not be averse to it. Q: The USA is launching trade agreements with region countries instead of aid, what can Germany launch?

While Mubarak's visit last year was held amid tense climates over Al-Kosheh case between Egyptian authorities and Christian American institutions as well as Copt expatriates and American anger due to the case of Dr. Saad Eddin Ibrahim, Mubarak's coming visit will have different climates.
This session, in which officials of both parties will participate, will be within the framework of a visit to be paid by Maher to Washington prior to President Mubarak's talks with President Bush in Crawford, Texas on April 12th.
The sources pointed out that the Tagamo'h Party was the first to spark this crisis. A paper tabled by its Secretary General Hussein Abdel-Razik called for considering political reform the base of every dialogue issues. This should include giving full opportunity to parties to hold meetings outside their headquarters and that public opinion should be part of such dialogue through publicizing the partisan ideas via means of mass media and cancelling the emergency law.

Contrary to the belief of many people, economic advisor to the Prime Minister Dr. Hatem Al-Qarnashawi said that monopoly, that is a producer or an importer's complete control over a certain commodity or service, is not bad by necessity, but rather might have advantages. The more the production the less the cost, thus saving resources for the country, he added.
The monopolistic agreement between a number of producers with the objective of controlling the market by dividing it among them is more dangerous than overt monopoly, he noted.
A decision was taken to launch the first Egyptian satellite named EgyptSat 1, dedicated for scientific research and experiments, late this year.

As the bells of churches in Jerusalem rang in grief over the death of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin as a national symbol for jihad against Israeli occupation, the bells of churches in Cairo rang in rejection of such Israeli barbarism, warning against grave consequences.
"Generally speaking, I can say that the stance of the church in Egypt is flat rejection of Sharon and his supporters in such a horrible terrorist act. Pope Shenouda had earlier organized a big conference in the great cathedral in Abbasiya district in support of the Palestinian cause. The conference was attended by a lot of officials. Pope Shenouda phoned Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, whose voice was amplified to be heard by all attendants in that popular Christian-Islamic conference."
Critic and plastic artist Ibrahim Abdel-Malak says there are three main axes in our conflict with Israel, the first is the fact that the Israeli line doesn't stop implanting hatred towards Arab and humanity, the second is that force can only be deterred by force, and the third is this question: what's now?
Big political mistake Eminent writer Edward Al-Kharat says it was a crime by all means. The man (Sheikh Yassin) was a symbol in spite of Israel.
This is attributed to the fact that poor wives need to have strong family relations and fear being forsaken by their husbands or losing them and turning into widows.
The study, finally, warned against some chief reasons for marital violence such as drug taking and forcing the wife to bring money, besides men's cruelty and repression against their wives. The study also showed that the woman's menopause was one of the main though latent causes of women's commitment of crimes as it makes women rather aggressive. 75% female killers committed their crimes during the menopause.
Female parliamentarians dropped a bombshell when they declared their keenness to call for allocating seats in the parliament for women in the first coming amendment of the political rights practice law, which was in force during the late president Sadat's era, although a ruling was issued by the Supreme Constitutional Court rendering the allocation of a certain number of parliamentarian seats for women unconstitutional.

The sources ruled out the possibility that a crisis between the NCHR and the government might erupt as a result of unveiling such a discussion by the council only a few weeks after that council was formed under the chairmanship of former UN Secretary General Dr. Botros Ghali regardless of serious statements by government officials ruling out the possibility of taking such a measure for security reasons.
They asked for revealing the reality of the Egyptian official stance towards the offered initiatives for canceling the 1929 agreement, which organizes distribution of the Nile water and gives Egypt the right to veto any water project that might directly affect its share of the Nile water that hits 55.5 billion cubic meters.
The MPs referred to the hazards that face Egypt in light of the United Nations report that warned against the Tanzanian project for supplying some Tanzanian residential areas with water, which threatens Egypt's share of the Nile water.
The US sources laid it bare that this is the year of the US elections, when no new commercial agreements would be announced as they may make the Americans lose more jobs in addition to the Egyptian economy unreadiness to enter into such an alliance with the US economy.

On the other hand, the agreement included a number of commercial reforms, some of which Egypt has already applied such as imposing relative customs duties on Egyptian imports of garments and cloth. The US sources criticized the long time of the negotiations of the aids agreement by saying, "If the negotiations on aids took a whole year, how long negotiating on the free trade agreement would take?"

The report also uncovered one peculiarity which is that although Africa came last in terms of exports value it topped the regions which achieved the highest increase rate against the corresponding period last year with a rate of 111%, followed by European Union markets with 54%. This is because Egyptian exports to Italy increased. Italy is the biggest foreign market for Egyptian exports with about 12% of total export value, and also France with an increase rate of 56% to reach $158 million.

RANTISSI: BUSH ENEMY OF GOD AND MUSLIMS
We'll continue our jihad until the ordeal we undergo comes to an end."
Israeli "F-16" warplanes roared over the University's courtyard during Al-Rantissi's address, but he seemed unaffected and kept speaking.
He urged Arafat to release orphans' funds and charities' balances, which the Palestinian Authority froze six months ago.
Directing his word to those who regard him a hardliner, Rantissi said, "I say to those who have misgivings about Al-Rantissi, don't worry, as we conduct our affairs by mutual consultation."
It needs a reconsideration of the concept of power and its elements or factors especially as far as our war against Israel and America's ferocious attack on the region is concerned.
It is faith in tomorrow and right despite America's thuggery or Israel's hooliganism.
His eyes were bright with confidence in steadfastness. He was surrounded with an aura which lent his words holiness and almost infinity.

ISRAEL LOOKS FORWARD TO BENEFITING FROM IRAQI AIRSPACE
ISRAEL ACCUSES "HIZBULLAH" OF FUNDING ASHDOD ATTACK
ARAB UNITY SPURS EXTREMISTS: ISRAELI OFFICIAL
For his part, Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat expressed fears that Israel might step up its aggressions on Palestinians and their leaders following the postponement of the Arab League summit in Tunis.
New Hamas leader Abdel-Aziz Ranteesi expressed his movement's dismay at the delay of the AL summit sine die, calling on Arab leaders to rise to the level of challenges and provide cohesion with their peoples so that the Muslim nation may get rejuvenated.
The document, which includes two Palestinian and Jordanian plans, has almost the same content of the Arab initiative adopted during the Arab League summit in Beirut in 2002, and the "roadmap" Middle East peace plan, drafted by the Quartet composed of the U.S., the European Union (EU), the United Nations and Russia, on resolving the conflict in the Middle East, the official said.
I have noticed frequent visits in the last few weeks by Palestinian senior officials to the British capital. When Palestine was under British mandate, the Palestinians used to chant. "O commissioner, inform your State (London) that our cavalry are ready here." The commissioner is American and there are no cavalry or horses.
Maj. Gen. Omar Sulayman had once listened to positive talk from Ariel Sharon earlier this month. The Israeli Premier had promised full withdrawal from Gaza Strip, the evacuation of settlements without destroying them and leaving the borders responsibility to Egypt together with a promise not to transfer settlers to the bank.
The Egyptians would, then, undertake training and qualifying security bodies men while the Egyptian-Palestinian borders should be the responsibility of forces of Egyptian border guard due to President Mubarak's insistence on Egyptian forces not entering Gaza Strip as he does not want the Egyptian forces to act as policemen on behalf of Israel.
The Palestinian leaders to whom I talked in London knew Sharon's goals quite well. Hamas negotiates to run the Strip after Israeli withdrawal. It does not vie for presidency with President Arafat nor does it want to monopolize Gaza government. It only wants that its representation be proportionate to the Palestinian support for it.
The only safeguard in the new meal is Hosni Mubarak and his man for difficult tasks Omar Sulayman.
What is more important is to stop that series of mistakes so that Arabs might not find themselves facing a conflict between the Arab Mashreq and the Arab Maghreb that might create discord between the Arabian Gulf and the Arab Mashreq later on.
The problem has now become evident - the Arabs have got ready for a summit in which they would declare the guidelines for developing the Arab League, i.e. reforming it in order to reform the situation of collective Arab action. This was supposed to mean a new stage, or rather a new life of the Arab League, the 50-year-old wide regional bloc.
Unfortunately, the summit would be held only if they clearly agreed on commitment to reform, at the level that suits the American demands. George Bush wants to exploit the Arab decision in his electioneering, to say to the Americans, "Look, we have turned the September 11th incidents into a reform project in the Arab world."
Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) voiced its disappointment as Arab League (AL) Secretary General Amr Moussa refused to allow a delegation from Hamas to attend the Arab Summit that had been cancelled by Tunis two days ahead of its inauguration, pointing out that the main goal of this participation was to acquaint the Arab leaders with the developments of the dangerous security situation.
According to a senior official with the Pentagon, the USA is seeking to set up a series of small military bases in North Africa from Morocco to Mali and to promote the level of air and sea surveillance in the region. This move is based on signs of the northern region of the black continent turning into a shelter harbouring Al Qaeda and other organizations.
He added, "Given that such a change is serious and permanent, Libya will certainly play an important role due to its strategic position and will eventually have relations with us just like other countries.
He added that the Pentagon did not have any plans for setting up military bases in Africa.
He added that the vast areas of government control in Africa are quite tempting.
He added, "Those fighters were centered in Chad where they suffered a defeat at the hands of the Chadian army two weeks ago killing 43 of them.
The plan includes Operation Spring, Blue Sky Diary and Linon Plan which arrange for further secret operations, findings evidence against those who are involved in terrorist operations and makes further efforts to secure and perform reconnaissance and monitoring operations, said the magazine.

According to American military sources, the American Engineering Corps has already started supervision work for the construction of new systems in some military bases of the Iraqi army which was disbanded by American civil administrator in Iraq, Paul Bremer to be used as military bases for the American forces which will remain in Iraq for several years that may extend till the end of this decade after the handover of power to the Iraqis at the beginning of July this year.
Within the framework of enhancing American political options in the region, the Pentagon intends to operate from Iraqi bases affiliated to the former Iraqi army in Baghdad, Mosul, Tagi, Balad, Kirkuk, and in areas in the vicinity of Al-Nasseriya, Tikrit and Falluja and between Erbil and Kirkuk.

Head of the banking operations at the bank Hassan Serag Eddin said the Egyptian market is huge and has great abilities to work in the field of banking retail. Credite Agricole Bank's clients base around the world, which reaches 16 million clients, gave it remarkable distinction on overseas markets.

Meanwhile, the debts of the National Investment Bank NIB (the government financier) hit 18.1% of the GDP.
This step would be within the framework of setting a group of other central real estate financial institutions with big potentialities that would make them better able to achieve the goal than several bodies and would enable them to carry out securitization operations in the way adopted by some other countries like the USA.
Interest rates should also be subject to reconsideration to endure reduction of finance burdens. The Parliamentary Housing Committee emphasized the urgency of amending capital market law to merge securitization activity and work for creating an active and organized security market, especially a special market for bonds to attract investors to real estate financing bonds.

Deputy Sabir Abdel Sadik pointed out the expenditure of LE3.3 billion on the new cities whose occupancy rate did not exceed 1% as a result of the Authority policy.
Therefore, it is untrue that the successive decisions and measures taken by the government to redress the public budget deficit can undo what impotence and failure had done. A few days ago, decrees were issued to impose more taxes, which have become tantamount to direct "levying" of citizens' money. Measures are insidiously creeping in the form of service bills, which represent the other side of the "levying" activity.
Three months ago, Shura Council deputies called on the government, which imposed such rises, to necessarily give civil servants an urgent social allowance of not less than 15% of the basic salary in order to face price hikes!
"The question now is: How can the mobile phone tax be raised while only a short while ago boycotted the two mobile phone companies?

RISE IN AIR FARES
Head of EgyptAir Trade Sector Mohamed Munir said that the new rise in airfare would not affect tourism coming to Egypt.
INCREASING DEMAND FOR FOUR-WHEELERS IN EGYPT
Though these cars are tall and heavy, let alone their high prices and electronic and mechanical sophistication, many believe that the four-wheel drive system is much safer than any other systems.
Toyota-Egypt sells two kinds of four-wheelers: sports model for tourist purposes and individual usage and trucks for transporting equipment and goods across deserts, Masrouga said.
Increasing demand for that kind of cars is attributed to its multi-purpose usage in off-road and desert journeys, particularly after the spread of safari vacations in Mersa Alam, Hurghada and Sharm El-Sheikh," he added, noting that the quota of those cars 5 years ago did not exceed 1.5% of total auto sales in Egypt.
"The new rates endorsed by the parliament would negatively impact car sales in general and four-wheelers in particular because this kind of cars attract certain kind of users, "director general of M.MM Group, agent of Land Rover in Egypt, Ahmed Al-Gharib said.
"We have embarked on a maintenance plan for Land Rover cars two years ago. The plan would cover 1000 cars of this make and would help us promote our sales.
In addition, the local industry depends on imported production input. They said the sector's exports did not make use of the deregulation of the rate of exchange.
Plastic materials became necessary in infrastructure technology such as operations of water transportation, drainage, engineering industries and packaging, which is considered an important part in food industries and depends largely on quality of packaging. PIDC is the consultative body for Egyptian governmental authorities.
We face some problems such as the lack of an accurate database on the volume of the industry, the number of operative facilities and the nature of their production in addition to the high prices of imported raw materials as the local production of polyethylene and polypropylene, which is necessary for industry, is not enough. Local materials used in plastics industry hit 30%, while the remaining 70% are imported in order to meet the needs of production and local consumption. Eng.
This comes at a time when Chinese products try to dump the markets. On the other hand, Mahmoud Bayoumi, manager of a factory specialized in manufacturing plastic parts and components of fridges, washing machines and air conditioners, says development of plastics industries leads to development of engineering industries.
Dr. Mohamed Abdel-Aziz, manager of a plastic manufacturer, says the "customs deformations" impede development of plastics industries in Egypt.
Such customs deformations threaten some plants with closure as the cost of importing the whole machine is cheaper than the cost of manufacturing it and operating equipment, machines, engineers and workers. These deformations, moreover, increase the price of the machines the company exports, he noted. CUSTOMS DUTIES AND DEPENDENCE ON IMPORTED RAW MATERIALS STUMBLING OBSTACLE TO PLASTICS AND RUBBER SECTOR
Since the pound was floated, the government has not interfered at all in the market turnover; therefore, within a record time range of less than a year, stability has been achieved on the exchange market and dealers trusted the market movement, as deregulation was done according to principles and logic, he pursued.

We discovered that the most effective means to ensure that subsidy is given to those who deserve it is the ration cards. This means that we have to allocate a quota of basic commodities to low-income categories.
CANCELLATION OF CUSTOMS DUTIES ON ARAB PRODUCTS TO THREATEN LOCAL INDUSTRY
On the other hand, the Industries Federation would consider in a symposium to be held mid this month the negative impacts on industry due to the start of applying full liberalization of inter-Arab trade as of January 2005.
When Arab countries find that Egypt has a relative advantage in some industries, they hasten to list such industries among the negative industries banned from importation. Thus, these agreements work for the interest of the other party at the expense of Egyptian industry.
Saudi Arabia tops now world countries in terms of population growth rate, a recent Saudi study disclosed, pointing out that a new babe is born in the Kingdom every 19 seconds.
Egypt came second following the Saudi Arabia as it receives a new babe every 27 seconds, the study noted.
The 4-day 2nd International Conference for Development and Environment in the Arab World, held in Assuit, Upper Egypt, on 23 March, warned against an uncontrollable environmental damage threatening life and humankind due to the failure of most world countries, especially major industrialized ones, to abide by international treaties and environmental conventions.
For his part, Director General of the ALO Dr. Ibrahim Qweidar sounded the alarm about the negative economic, social and political effects of unemployment, saying that unemployment rate in the Arab world in general hit 18% and 25% in some other Arab countries and 70% in Palestine and Iraq. Moreover, this problem began to cast a shadow over the Arab World causing all forms of violence as well as social and political instabilities.
THE NEW TERRORISTS!
As Egypt received Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom and thought of sending a parliamentary delegation to take part in Camp David festivities and as the Jordanian Monarch Abdullah II scrambled to his secret meeting with Sharon, they had to pay the price of over-naivity.
The Bush administration employs the policy of reverse terrorism in a variety of ways not only to intimidate the American people itself by the imposition of extraordinary undemocratic laws but to intimidate Europe in the name of anti-terrorism and to blackmail Arab countries under the pretext that it was they who harboured terrorism, thus forcing them to submit to all Israeli demands.
When Europe had to include Palestinian factions on the terrorism lists, it only helped Israel to promote the culture of terrorism and helped the American administration which was addicted to lying and fraud to achieve its goals.
The next shortcoming lies in the fact that all colonialist projects have invariably stemmed from the advocacy of a divine message that drive invaders to the conquest of other peoples to help them out of their difficulties.
The basic problem in the Arab world, in fact, is how to reform the government and the political system which turned out to be incapable of managing societies or leading them towards the achievement of their goals in freedom, respect of human rights, dignity, high status of the state as well as the region with all its natural and human wealth. Political folly has, nonetheless, taken such wealth down to the bottom of backwardness, misguidance, despair and terrorism. Such painful results of corrupt political systems exacerbated, thus depriving those systems of justifying their long retainment of power or utter lack of legitimacy. This, in turn, subjected our countries to humiliation, invasion and contempt. Though such systems know very well that it is they who are meant for reform, they prevaricate and try to escape even in the thick of battle to get away out of the momentum initiated by American initiatives which were based on a diagnosis made by intellectuals of the crisis that attacked the authority bones and then insidiously turned to the backbone of society.
Among the forms of prevarication or escape attempts is watering down and generalizing the case to gain time as they know that talking about the Arab world in general is much safer than targeting any particular country.
Or would Arab leaders, in that way, relieve their conscience by suggesting initiatives to abort the enemy's initiatives or to protect our countries from the scourge of aggression?
In fact, the road to reform is quite obvious starting with a definition of the problems that weigh on the citizen and the nation in the forefront of which is the fact that societies are being led by their weakest elements.
Under this headline, Huda Al-Husseini of Asarq Al-Awsat wrote an article to say: They are getting closer to facing the reality. The Arab League (AL) summit postponement is nothing but a step before the declaration that we are Arab "peoples", each of which has its own nature, and is looking forward to realizing its own objectives, hindered only by too much elastic talk about Arab unity, unified expectations and other demands that have swallowed advancement, freedom, equality, rights and justice.
The Palestinian cause was the gate, not to liberating occupied Palestine, but to suppressing peoples.
The Arabs committed a mistake when they rejected the "draft" of a plan that might have been leaked consciously or unconsciously. Such rejection and discord, are attributed not only to the US pressure, but also to the European and international pressure.
The declaration of the summit postponement and failure to insist on convening it on schedule, were considered a blow to the Arab world, which had an even worse impact than the assassination of Palestinian key personalities, such as that of Sheikh Ahmed Yassi. The Arab peoples hoped that the summit would take strong decisions in connection with the dangers that had threatened the Arab World, according to Arab officials since the war on Iraq.
Definitely, Washington's reluctance to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict helped Arab leaders in their criticism of the US reform scheme, as they considered it an intervention in their own affairs. The problem is that without the US intervention in the region, the Palestinian problem would not be solved.
If the climates in the Arab countries were healthy a homemade reform, rather than an imported one would have been encouraged.
Washington - for the time being at least - shows its readiness to listen to European advice, and less tendency to take a unilateral action in spite of the Iranian hard-line policy and threats to completely stop cooperation with the IAEA, though Teheran has admitted to its violation of this agreement and its foreign minister Kamal Kharazi described it as an issue of the past.
These reports disclosed that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) sees that the map of the whole situation does not augur well whether at the level of the growth of the Islamic trends in Iran or at the level of armament race in the region, with expectations of endeavors by regional countries to obtain nuclear arms if they were possessed by Iran.
Cairo, Riyadh coordination CIA added that Egypt and Saudi Arabia would start exerting efforts to produce nuclear weaponry and may coordinate with each other in this field. They would depend on several international expertise such as Pakistani expertise in this field.
The report added that if Riyadh decided to use Pakistani heads instead of manufacturing its own nuclear weapons with a view to avoiding international uproar, Egypt would start producing nuclear weapons alone, as Egypt will never agree to remain away from nuclear weapon race that would not be controlled if Iran succeeded in producing its nuclear weapon.
The sources added that the emergency law, its applications and the security status in Egypt were intensively studied by experts and specialists to consider returning to ordinary laws so that citizens could stand before civil judges.
The rate of the poor increased in Upper Egyptian urban areas, followed by the Delta rural areas, the Delta urban areas, major governorates and then Upper Egyptian rural areas, the report said.
He added that the opportunities of water resources development and enhancement is a constant process so long as countries should work within that framework. He pointed out that there was cooperation to make use just of one side of water wastage.

It also called for re-putting into effect the Central Bank of Egypt's decision, which cancelled the system of importing through money collection documents. This decision curbs demand for the dollar. It also called for compelling exporters to deposit 75% of their exports' revenues of foreign exchange with the banks.
It might be mentioned that Egyptian diplomatic sources criticized Ugandan President's call to reconsider the 1929 agreement regarding the distribution of the Nile water among the Nile basin countries, pointing out that Cairo neither imposes its control on the Nile water nor prevents any country from benefiting from its water.
A high-placed Ugandan official suggested that Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania unify their efforts in the current negotiations with Egypt with the framework of the Nile basin Initiative.
SHURA COUNCIL WARNS AGAINST HAVING INSURANCE FUNDS PLUNDERED
In the meantime, Dr. Ahmed Rashad Moussa, chairman of the Economic and Financial Affairs Committee with the council, called for investing that money cautiously so as to direct it to safe investments and deal with it in the same way the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) deals with its foreign currency assets. During the council's discussions of the public budget and plan drafts, Moussa warned against having those funds employed in high-risk projects whatever the returns could be!
CAA DEMANDS ANTI-TRUST LEGISLATION AND CONTROLS
This is meant to increase the production of steel squares, especially as the unexploited capacity rate in the company reaches 5.28% The report urged treating the defects in financing structures, especially in public enterprise sector companies with a view to reducing production cost and stimulating private capital to invest in integrating the production stages in the companies that require that for the development of industry, thus leading to lower cost of production.
In addition to that, the cost of production requirements is very high due primarily to the external market. On the other hand, Egyptian deputies protested against not having the CAA report on rebar shortage given out to People's Assembly deputies.
Deputy Mohamed Oda launched several criticisms to the CAA. He said that the report overlooked many points or omitted to touch them.

Hamza added that there were promising opportunities for leather industries on the Italian market, especially as most Italian factories had closed down and rely primarily on imports provided that good quality and reasonable price are taken into account.
General Secretary of the Egyptian Businessmen Association Mohamed Yossef said that the meetings agenda includes many points including considering cooperation between Egyptian businessmen and their Korean counterparts in reconstructing Iraq especially as entering the Iraqi market with the Korean companies would give the Egyptian companies access to distinguished contracts, as the Korean companies have distinguished relations with their American counterparts. There are US promises to give South Korean companies a quota in the projects of rebuilding Iraq.
An Egyptian businessmen delegation would visit Brazil in the first week of December next with a view to probing increasing the volume of Egyptian exports to Brazil. This step is meant to reduce trade balance deficit between both countries.
The Egyptian exports mainly include foodstuff, furniture, textile, yarns, cotton and fertilities. Egypt imports from Brazil include sugar, meat, chemicals and iron ore.
On the other hand, the start of the actual activity of the real estate financing company helped expectations to recover and the private sector to issue long and medium-term loans as it has become possible to make an indicator for interest rates on bonds that can be used as a reference.
This makes it certain that Egyptian expatriates, Arabs and foreigners will benefit by such a system and by the exchange rate developments. Hijab pointed out that the return to dealing in long-term bands with various maturity periods would help to activate securities market and to promote the related banking culture which disappeared over 60 years ago.

In case the ownership is transferred, the Ministry of Insurance would have to select a group of the best cadres and specialists in various fields of administration in order to obtain the best economic performance and achieve the best possible revenues. Discussions are still underway to reach final decisions.
Head of the chamber of travel agencies Mohamed Othman estimated the cost of bearing those charges at 50 million dollars. He told Asharq Al-Awsat that travel agencies decided to bear those charges out of their respect to the contracts concluded with international travel agencies and for preserving credibility of the tourist sector and also for not wasting tourist gains achieved in international markets.

MINISTER: EGYPT'S REFUSAL OF LIBYAN REQUEST BEHIND RECENT WATER CRISIS
"Yes, there are foreign malicious ambitions in the Nile water, but we should take into consideration the real reasons that pushed Nile Basin countries to review water agreements."
A press release by Ismailia Council said, "This step is meant to commemorate great martyr Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the founder of Hamas movement, who was assassinated by Israeli occupation forces on 22nd March last."
A Zionist scheme to control Iraq has begun.
Meanwhile, former Israeli minister of defense Benjamin Ben Eliezer, who is Iraqi-born, alleged that the Jewry left behind stupendous wealth in Iraq, which no Jews had ever spoken about.

These plants multiplying on the water surface and extending roots into the water course entered Iraq through private nurseries in 1997.
He called on donor countries to extend facilities required for removing those plants which no traditional methods could remove.
Specialists in Water Resources Ministry admit that they are facing several difficulties in removing the deposited mud because that bend is in the center of the city and due to the lack of modern mechanisms to remedy the problem. This will make the problem so difficult in a way that any control over it in the future may be out of the question.

The priorities of the Iraqis do not allow such violence to develop in such a way, he said, calling for adopting political approaches in solving the problem.
RESISTANCE BETWEEN PALESTINE AND IRAQ!
President Bush has ignored that Hizbullah was defending Lebanese soil and that Hamas was defending the Arabs' first case, Palestine's land.
We may even expect that the coming days will witness a fierce resistance on all fronts in Gaza, Baghdad and South Lebanon and if the Shiites in Iraq entered the resistance arena in Iraq against the American forces as, then, many balances would be upset and really smarting hits might be launched at America and the Zionist entity.
Winking at the limitless atrocities and woes of war gives no advantage to anybody, as everybody is a partner in the crime one way or another.
In the beginning, US mass media and TV channels refrained from airing the inhumane scenes. Then, they broadcast them on a limited scale, exploding a sense of wrath with the American people who see their sons being savagely treated.
The barbaric acts in Falluja were nothing but an outburst of pent-up wrath, in the form of most heinous revenge and mutilation of the US troops' corpses.
U.S. PLAN OF NEW IRAQI ARMY: SMALL-SIZED, UNABLE TO GUARD FRONTIERS, OPERATIONS ORDERED BY COALITION
The former Iraqi army was composed of 360,000 troops and over 400,000 reservists, and was armed with tens of warplanes and helicopters.
Such statistics do not include the armed groups responsible for attacks on alliance troops and new Iraqi security forces.
Most experts echo this estimation, but they cast doubts about the new Iraqi armed forces' ability to ensure internal security without any continued direct help from U.S. forces.
Some analysts predict that the U.S. plan for building a new Iraqi army will be faced with several problems that may delay it for a long period.
However, he suspected that the future Iraqi leadership, especially once American forces leave the country, might be satisfied with such a modest-sized army, especially as the region's ruling regimes in general are building their armies mainly to boost their images and positions before their peoples there. Therefore, he expects the future Iraqi government to establish later on an army that can match Iraq's prestige and position in the region.
- Growth of factional and national fragmentation phenomenon. Today Iraq suffers from an extensive sectarian fragmentation, which seriously and remarkably increases and escalates. Iraq now is soaked in such fragmentation, which might have grave consequences shortly although such a phenomenon that threatens the country's stability is deliberately ignored by all whether politicians or non politicians.
1- The collapse of the military establishment and the absence of a central army: From the early days of the war, there was an entire collapse in the military establishment and the Iraqi army simply evaporated and became no more even before the issuance of any decision to disband it.
5 - Minorities refuse to return once more to factional central rule.
1-The State of Kurdstan: it will include the following governorates: Arbil, Sulaymaneya, Dahak and Kirkuk which should have a special status within the framework of the federal system law in effect.
Therefore, Baghdad had better be kept as a federal state on its own especially as it has a big population which is distributed in an almost balanced sectarian and national way including Sunnites, Shiites, Kurds and other ethnic and religious affiliations.

In 1996, he joined a consulting firm under Dr. Ali Al-Shaibani, where he played a considerable role in affecting the economic policies.

WASHINGTON PRESSED FOR PUTTING OFF ARAB SUMMIT IN TUNIS
He also recognized that his country made a serious blunder by adopting the 'Syria Accountability Act", noting that Damascus' proposal to resume negotiations with Israel should have been dealt with in a favourable way. He also rapped Israel for opposing the Syrian initiative.
The 3-points agenda, including reform, AL restructure plan and the Arab peace initiative, would remain as it was, Moussa indicated.
Under this headline, Munior Shafeek, a Palestinian writer residing in Amman wrote an article which ran to the following effect, only in part: It has been proven by experience that both Arab League assets and debits increase or decrease in proportion to how tense foreign domination was or how sharp the conflicts were.
The problem, therefore, lies not in the Arab League or its resolutions or recommendations including Arab summit resolutions but in country-oriented tendencies to act independently of other brotherly countries.
Some of them (journalists and analysts alike) have even made light of the Arab League and its summits to the extent that they held their value as questionable and even claimed that they had better be cancelled. After the Tunisian summit had been cancelled by the Tunisian presidency who had sent convocations to Arab presidents and kings, one of them said that among all Arab summits this one is the only success.
The reason for that lies in the fact that the meeting of Arab leaders, though of diverse orientations, might create a sort of compromise or minimum accord that would go against any alignment with the Soviet Union or America and run counter to the desire of both "progressive" and "reactionary" trends.
They, therefore, applauded the summit cancellation decree even though it was to be held only 48 hours after that anomalous and serious decree which had its secrets and was quite lacking in both propriety and high diplomacy. In consequence, the anti-Arab League or summit approach does not stem from any real protest against their failure to implement resolutions.
Procedural steps have already been started in Washington to refer the bill to the Congress.
Sources in the Congress expected that procedures to put up the bill for the vote would start at the end of this month.
The bill defines the names of 12 big officials to be investigated for charges of supporting international terrorism and the involvement in the abovementioned cases.
External initiatives, especially the American one, winked at a link between the Palestinian issue and a democratic about-face in the Middle East region and Israel's position, which constitutes a stumbling block to the equation.
For their parts, the "evasive" Arab counter-initiatives are based on the logic of defending the status quo by adopting some cosmetic procedures.
The Arab regimes, which stammer while speaking about reforms from within just to fend off threats to be posed by reform imposed from abroad, have widely open eyes on Islamic groups which move forward and occupy fresh political and social spaces that might emerge from any modest reform steps.
In spite of the resounding Islamic failure in view of an Islamic statehood and the Islamic alternative from Iran and Afghanistan as far as the Sudan, the Islamists' right to democracy should be kept intact just like others.
There is a wide gap between democratic Islamists and blind violence Islamists. Turning a blind eye to such a gap shows a clear-cut and politicized ill-intention.
However, in the 1990s, democratization involved in by a significant number of major moderate Islamic movements (in Jordan, Yemen, Kuwait, Algeria and Morocco) exposed the position that wanted to eliminate the wide gap between Islamic movements.
The initiatives in question do not want to begin from bottom to summit to evade the difficult questions about the role and strength of popular forces that are growing under the surface far from the ruling elite and their hegemony mechanisms.
In one of the stages of a serious and fair shift towards democracy in the Arab world, the Islamists, the governments' main opponents, can have the upper hand at least temporarily.
The Islamists need a complete change that may boost their political eligibility and reduce their popular ideology that exhausted the public, who readily respond to every slogan.
If such presidential palaces fail to show intention to cover the distance between them and those who will be elected by people, all such initiatives will be mere ink on paper.
Diagnosis is urgent, but treatment needs to be gradual.
It was reported that what happened in Tunis may lead to a division between the Arab Mashrek and Arab Maghreb, which, if so, will bring awfully serious fallouts.
Although the balances of power now favour Israel, advocates of the regional Arab order see this as a temporary matter and believe that for the sake of the Arab future, the Arab countries should cling to the regional Arab role and seek to eliminate the balances of power or stand steadfast awaiting a change in the balances as it is a big mistake to allow Israel to capitalize on the current situation in the Arab world to penetrate and then control the regional order.
This formula was formed by the end of the World War II when the Middle East was under Britain's control and the Jews were seeking to seize part of Palestine to set up their state there. At the same time, the occupied Arab countries concentrated their efforts on winning independence.
Now, everything is almost different. Therefore, what is required by the U.S., the leader of the region and the world, is a new regional order "Greater Middle East", which is supposed to replace the regional Arab order, with the AL to be replaced with or dissolved in favour of a larger order like the European Security and Cooperation Council.

REFORMISTS IN THE NEW CABINET, RADICAL CHANGE IN ECONOMY SECTOR
A number of veteran ministers, including the ruling National Democratic Party Secretary General and Minister of Information Safwat Al-Sherif, are expected to leave the government. Al-Sherif will be nominated by President Mubarak for Shura Council speakership. He received a telephone call from President Mubarak from Germany yesterday (22nd June).
The dominant impression is that the new government would not include the current Minister of Youth Dr. Ali Eddin Hilal who has recently faced a campaign because of the notorious "Mondial Zero" incident for which the opposition circles held him responsible as Egypt failed to win even one vote in the contest for hosting the 2010 world cup. The sources, however, emphasized that Hilal would not be excluded.

WRANGLE OVER PUBLIC DEBT
It is noteworthy that controversy over estimating the volume of local debt started after Minister of Finance Medhat Hassanein had took over, as the Ministry of Finance used to estimate all the government's commitments including debts of the economic authorities and the National Investment Bank (NIB) when it estimates the local debt. However, Hassanein sees that the local debt was estimated incorrectly and this debt should be confined to governmental debts only to the exclusion of the debts of the economic authorities and the NIB. This caused a big difference in estimates of the local debt by the Ministry of Finance on the one hand and some official and non-governmental bodies on the other hand.
For his part, Prof. of economics at Banha University Dr. Mohamed Al-Naggar made reservations about the Ministry of Finance's policy regarding the exclusion of the debts of the NIB and economic authorities from total public debt under the pretext of the independence of such bodies and their commitment to repaying their debts. The Ministry of Finance resorting to such an approach is attributed to a government's desire to soften the panic felt by some people over the enormous local debt, Al-Naggar said, pointing out that dividing the burdens of the local debt and excluding the debts of the economic authorities and the NIB is a theoretical solution to the problem. Local debt includes the government and all its affiliated bodies, he emphasized, pointing out that the public debt amounted to 370 billion pounds on June 30th, which accounts for more than 94% of the GDP. This is also the same opinion raised by some MPs, and Wafdite, Nasserite and leftist economists.
Moreover, these reports did not rule out the possibility of treating Bahgat at home.
U.S. ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF COMMERCE CONSIDERS IN CAIRO INVESTMENT IN SMALL-SIZED PROJECTS
U.S. Assistant Secretary of Commerce is due to visit Egypt on Saturday to hold talks with officials on current commercial problems and solutions, in addition to the technical bases related to the negotiating phases of setting up a free trade zone between Egypt and the United States.
American statistics said that Egypt's exports to the United States rose to 1.44 billion dollars in 2003, up 21 percent, as non-petroleum exports hit 960 million dollars, up 30 percent. However, petroleum exports nosedived to 184 million dollars, down 10 percent.
In cooperation with the Administration of Plant Quarantine, the Agriculture Crops Commodity Council is expected to determine such ports and refer a list of their names to Ghali to issue a relevant decision and endorse them. Therefore, such ports will be the only ports that will receive Egypt's potato exports, Saleh said.
The issue is currently under discussion, he said.
Gaz De France proposed such an offer because the Egyptian government opened such fields before any foreign company that is ready to transfer technology, pump investments and establish real partnership with the Egyptian natural gas sector, he pointed out.
The two guidebooks will include integrated information about investment opportunities in Egypt and the major projects that create many investment opportunities for the Russians, Sheha said.

LE5 BILLION SPENT BY EGYPTIAN USING CREDIT CARDS

General Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Mohamed Al-Barad'ei revealed that there was a serious attempt for rebuilding the Egyptian nuclear program for development purposes.
He revealed that nuclear technology has become one of the main sources of generating electricity as 16% of electric energy worldwide depends mainly on nuclear energy, which has become one of the most efficient resources at the economic and the environmental levels.
An article which he distributed to the Congress commissions and departments of the American administration, he said that while President Bush welcomed his Egyptian guest and discussed with him war on terrorism, there was an important case that should have been included on the agenda of the Egyptian-American summit, that is the Egyptian government support of Al-Azhar whose leaderships announced Jihad against the US following the incidents of September 11th.
Head of International for Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Mohamed Al-Barad'ei defended the policy of the IAEA, rejecting an accusation that the IAEA adopts a double-standard policy.
As for the Iranian program, Al-Barad'ei said that progress has been achieved in this respect but no final results have been reached yet.
He called on Arab countries to implement a civilized Arab project for striking a balance between their interests, and to adopt a new approach for international cooperation. Al-Barad'ei referred to the gravity of the fact that 40% of the Arab peoples are illiterate.
The investors will table their proposal to the company's annual conference, which will be held this week coinciding with the ninth meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and American President George W. Bush in Washington on Wednesday.
NEW RESISTANCE WEAPON
Before answering these questions, observers pointed out some of the successes achieved by this weapon as follows:
The 400 Palestinians were from different Palestinian factions, however, they were not jailed in criminal cases but in administrative ones. Observers believe that the Shiites, through using that weapon, know well the negative impact of this weapon on the psychology of their enemies. When the Muslims fight their enemies, they never exclude the possibility of being captured by their enemies but, at the same time, they never think of these days as if they were in vain contrary to non-Muslims who never think of living in capture, observers say.
They, however, emphasized that their action was "peaceful" as they do not want Kuwaiti youth to get involved in engagements in Iraq.
He added that official and accredited charity bodies in Kuwait will undertake to deliver such aid to the needy. The Kuwait Red Crescent, he said, had promised him to assume that responsibility. He also said that a message had been addressed to the American ambassador to Kuwait regarding Iraq's events.
According to eyewitnesses, Iraqi families have recently moved to Kuwait to escape the explosive situation in South Iraq after murder and theft crimes had gone rampant.
The Kuwaiti government had prepared a comprehensive plan to receive Iraqi batches after the fall of the former regime and station them in safe places without having to enter Kuwaiti cities.
A Syrian official source described as baseless and divorced from reality reports by "Western intelligence sources" to the effect that Damascus hid weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and missiles in the Sudan. According to the reports, the banned weapons were secretly sent to Sudan aboard civil planes without informing Sudan but according to an agreement with companies.
CALLING ON SAUDI REFORMISTS TO MODERATE
They held reformists responsible to a great extent as they did not abide by the path determined by the State for gradual and organized reform, especially as changing many systems at one go might prove harmful or have undesired consequences.
Under this headline, Raghda Dergham, Al-Hayat Office in New York manager writes an article which runs to the following effect only in part: This week, Iraq has turned into a slipping point for the USA from the uni-super power status because of the Pentagon and its hawks' adventures and errors.
He also fell victim to a group of extremists who used all types of resourcefulness to convince him of the preemptive principle and blind him to the risks of identification with Israel in the terrorism war and of modeling on Israeli occupation of Palestinian for American occupation of Iraq.
According to American senior military in Iraq, George W. Bush won't back out.
Meeting that demand, on the other hand, would uncover the failure and falsity of American Administration pledges.
Those estates had once supported Saddam Hussein in his war against Iran to fend off Shiite influence using Iraq as a buffer zone to prevent the exportation of a Shiite revolution from Iran to them.
Such scenarios are banned from American circulation at least as far as the American administration is concerned as they would strike terror in the American hearts and terror is undesirable because the Administration promotes the idea of reassurances and stability to be achieved at the hands of the anti-terror war leader.
He wants the cancellation of the Palestinians' right to return.
He wants all this ? America is facing one of its crucial challenges in the Middle East and the Gulf.
I'm afraid there are no long term strategies on the Arab, American, Palestinian, Israeli, Iraqi, or Coalition Authority levels.
IRAQ AND BUSH
Nobody can, of course, make light of the dimension of the bloody confrontations between the American forces and Mahdi army, the militias affiliated to Muqtada Sadr.
- It was the Americans rather than the Sadrites who sparked such a confrontation with Mahid army, a decision taken about one month ago within the framework of a comprehensive plan to re-organize Shiite and Kurdish militias within the framework of a new central security system.
- Sadr group, as we said, represent a minority among the Shiites.
Inquiries and Scenarios The question of Sadr, then, won't probably be the turning point in the relation of the Shiite majority with occupation authorities.
Among these questions is: how did children who are under ten years of age dare to mutilate burnt corpses and then hang their remains on a bridge overlooking the Euphrates?
If matters in Falluja and the triangle has reached such a degree, what then does this mean for the destiny of the Iraqi entity?
The third, which is the most probable, is the partitioning of Iraq either on the old Swiss model or according to the new Afghan pattern.
President Bush said that the Falluja operations was meant to undermine the project of handing power over to a new Iraqi government before next June 30th.
- Iran which knows better than anybody that American stability in Iraq would mean instability of its own current regime in Tehran which is targeted by the American neo-conservatives just in the same way as Suddan's statues in Baghdad had once been.
How can it feel otherwise while every trap in which America is enmeshed in Iraq is a reminiscent of the deadly ambushes which used to be set for it by America in Afghanistan?
ESCALATION IN IRAQ: THE TIMING GAME! Under this headline, Al-Majalla's correspondent in Iraq Walid Al-Zobaidi writes the following analysis:
Those observers emphasize that the escalation may also cover up Iraqi political demands that constituted a bone of contention with the Americans, which may aggravate the complicated Iraqi political scene unless such incidents are decisively and immediately halted. This, in turn, explains reported information about intensive presence of American troops around Kofa Mosque where Sadr sheltered.
However, they committed two mistakes. Firstly, the timing of closing Al-Hauza newspaper was inappropriate, as it synchronized with the assassination of great Palestinian resistance symbol Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.
Therefore, the occupation forces will aggravate the woes of the Iraqi citizens and suffer material and human losses, thus aggravating the situation on the Iraqi internal level and on the occupation forces as well, a situation that might have been weathered had they dealt advisedly with the issue of closing Al-Hauza newspaper and the consequent arbitrary measures they took in dealing with demonstrators.
Egyptian General Organization for International Exhibitions and Fairs (EGOIEF) chairman, Mohamed Al-Sayyed Saleh said that the Egyptian Exhibition was mounted with a view to publicizing Egyptian production which has witnessed considerable development, recently and working for attracting Korean companies to investment in Egypt, cooperation in various economic fields and in a bid to draw upon its expertise in many spheres. He voiced confidence that the coming years would witness further cooperation in certain production fields to cure the chronic disruption in bilateral trade balance.
He said that having an Egyptian Trade Week in Seoul, confirms the Egyptian party's interest in the S. Korean market which is considered promising.
He added that the Exhibition Authority would participate in all exhibitions mounted on S. Korea's land with a view to setting up joint projects and boosting trade exchange.
Dr. Sherif Al-Gabali said that the allocation of $100 million by the S. Korean Export Bank to finance private sector export and import activities would help businessmen on both sides to enter new projects like petroleum, petrochemicals and fertilizers.
The companies seek to make use of the different climates of the two countries, as Egypt's winter coincides with South Africa's summer and vice versa. Accordingly, the crops that are cultivated in one country are not cultivated in the other at the same time, hence the lack of competition. This also provides at the same time a chance of integration and joint cooperation in the fields of promotion of those crops on the global market.
The report urged a 3-month respite to file the lawsuit before the Supreme Constitutional Court in order to judge constitutionality of the third paragraph of Article Three of the CBE Law No. 88 of 2003.
The Administrative Judiciary Court had referred the action filed by exchange firms to the State Commissioners Authority to compile a report in this regard. The Supreme Constitutional Court defined 10th July next for hearing the case.
On the other hand, payments of commodity imports hit 4.831 billion dollars against 3.505 billion dollars, up 38%. Surplus of the balance of invisible dealings during the third quarter rose by 619 million dollars to hit 2.472 billion dollars. Thus, the surplus of the first nine months hits about 8.101 billion dollars against 6.106 billion dollars during the corresponding period last year, data prepared by Minister of Planning Othman Mohamed Othman revealed. As for the balance of services, surplus rose during the third quarter by 491 million dollars due to an increase in the Suez Canal tolls by 32.1%; tourism proceeds, 59%; and transport revenues, 31%.
In this regard, the producing companies (13 in number) entered a clear competition for granting facilities to traders to make them withdraw huge amounts with a view to disposing of the stock lest a new price reduction should lead to extra losses.
Beshai said the sudden retreat of international demand for rebar due to different plans of China which controls 30% of the volume of international markets caused a state of confusion to iron producers in Egypt for fear of failing to dispose of their stocks before possible further price reductions. Some Egyptian companies bet on an increase of rebar prices over the last period and bought steel sheets at high prices, which may make their positions on the market more critical during the coming period, he pointed out.
What is reported about traders getting distinguished profit margins from some producing plants is not true, he said, pointing out that the profit margin given to a trader does not exceed 3% over the ex-factory price.
The quantity of potatoes targeted to be exported this year amounts to about 350,000 tons till late next October, said Ismail Gamal Eddin, head of the Agricultural Economics Central Department at the Ministry of Agriculture. "All exporters abide by the conditions and standards of quality, agreed on with the European Union," he said.
Egypt is ranked 43rd worldwide in terms of importing different Canadian products.
EGYPTIAN COMPANIES MAY CULTIVATE CORN IN RUMANIA!
Egypt's non-petroleum exports to Japan hit some 13.3 million dollars in the first quarter of 2004, a 105% rise compared to the corresponding period a year earlier, said an economic report recently issued by the Japanese embassy in Cairo.
This statement was made by Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Fayza Abul-Naga following her meeting with head of JETRO. She said that the JETRO had done several analytical studies over a period of 3 years to choose promising and well established sectors for increasing their exports to Japan and implementing technical programmes to upgrade the quality of such products in particular and to activate Egyptian exporters dealings with international markets.
The Ministry of Industry on Monday signed a new agreement with an Australian company to explore gold and copper at Al-Alaki Mountain in southeast Aswan.
Following the signing, the minister of industry said each site is only 16 square kilometers according to the existing law on mines and quarantines, thus offering better advantages and attracting more investments in this vital sector.
Minister of Foreign Trade Youssef Botros Ghali highlighted Egypt's keenness on boosting its trade and economic relations with the Latin American important economic bloc, which includes Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.
Signing a free trade agreement with such a bloc will open many new fields for many commodities needed by the bloc's countries foremost of which are cotton, chemicals, medicines, carpet and petroleum products. This will, therefore, increase Egypt's exports and reduce the balance of trade deficit between the two sides, as Egypt's exports to Latin American countries hit about 28 million dollars in 2003 while its imports from them amounted to 719 million dollars, Ghali added.
Head of the Businessmen Association Gamal Al-Nazer told Al-Alam Al-Youm that the Chinese delegation that comprises 65 businessmen will consider investment opportunities available in Egypt in various vital development sectors in more than 20 fields that enjoy several concessions and facilities that are attractive to investment.
Having succeeded in invading the Egyptian baby toy market, China has strongly invaded the computer market, controlling over 50 percent of the computer component market in Egypt, according to informal estimates.
Ahmed Samy, the regional manager of a Chinese company in Egypt said, "All companies seek the best markets to promote their markets in view of advantages, incentives, high quality and cheap labour." However, this does not mean that the prices of Chinese factories' products are cheaper than those of French or other factories' products. But, he said, the company's products enjoy high quality at all markets.
Minister of Planning Dr. Othman Mohmed Othman said that his ministry, in cooperation with different bodies would prepare feasibility studies for some of those projects. The public sector may contribute a limited quota to the investment costs.
Reinforcing iron production rose from 612,000 tons in the third quarter of 2002/2003 to 715,000 tons in the third quarter of 2003/2004, up 10% said a report compiled by the Ministry of Planning.
Reinforcing iron prices returned their rise yesterday (22nd June) following their last limited decline.
They pointed out that rebar producing companies increased prices after they made sure that no measures would be taken against their monopolistic practices not to mention the end of People's Assembly (PA) parliamentary session, which confirms that no law would be issued to stop monopoly.
The Egyptian Federation of Construction and Building Contractors said the rate of growth in the sector fell to 3.2 percent, a differential of one percent compared to last year.
Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Dr. Mamoud Abou-Zeid said that Egypt managed to put West Delta projects along Cairo-Alexandria Desert Road on the list of common-vision project that will be discussed today (23rd june) during the meeting of the Blue Nile countries that will be held in Sharm El-Sheikh.

During the meeting of General Assembly of Engineering Industries Chamber of the Industries Union, Hassanein said that Ezz Group did not agree to reduce its prices until several meetings were held by the Industry Committee in cooperation with the People's Assembly Housing Committee. Iron and iron sheets rates were reduced by an average of LE500 per ton.
60 EGYPTIAN COMPANIES GET CONTRACTS FOR IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION
WORK IN TOSHKA PROJECT SUSPENDED
The report asked for quickly moving in that respect after the contracted companies laid off a big number of workers and technicians due to failure to pay their salaries.
He termed as ungrounded reports on the suspension of work at Toshka Project. He said he received a daily report on the size of executed works in all sectors.
For the first time, the Kurdish problem rises to the surface concurrently with its different regional dimensions.
Al-Qamshali incidents in Syria opened the door for a Kurdish question there that can be escalated to be a pressure card on the Syrian leadership.
Tranquility boosts the Iranian practical approach in dealing with the thorny issues and is an important tool to overcome concerns.
Up till now, some American bodies are not contented with the Turkish role in the war on Iraq and its repercussions and even see, instead, the necessity of punishing Ankara.
The council can veto any draft law issued by the National Assembly or any appointments it endorses.
It is entitled to maintain their current military forces (militias).
Between Iran and Syria If the Iranian Republic has succeed in settling the Kurds' problems through pressure or conciliation, what happened in Syria last month sounded the alarm of necessarily paying attention to new regional positions that can arouse the Kurdish tranquility.
Therefore, the period of nationalism negatively impacted on the Kurds' position.
Kurdish leaderships in Iraq seemed to be desirous of extending their influence, emphasizing their regional role, and insisting on penetrating the Syrian ranks. This took place when the Kurdish-transmitted radio station in Iraq, which is directed at the Kurds in Syria, started to foment a sectarian rift through inciting the Syrian Kurds to setting state-owned institutions ablaze and hoisting Kurdish and American flags instead of the Syrian flag. This raised a number of question marks regarding the potential impacts of the current incidents in Iraq on Syria, especially as Damascus was opposed to the American occupation and considered it a turning point in the region's events on the grounds that it will influence its balances.
* Firstly, the quandary currently faced by the American administration in Iraq.
* Thirdly, the Kurds are the only nationality after the Arabs in the region who have population and political weight and can play an important role in breaking up any potential Arab unity under the pretext of compensating them for their historic usurped rights, especially as there are some Kurds understanding and responding to such arguments for their own reasons.
Al-Hayat learnt that Iran received the American request through the Swiss embassy, the caretaker of the American interests in Teheran, and that mediation outlines concentrate on axes aiming at reaching a logical solution. These axes include three main points:
Information was reported about a suggestion by some parties from the Iraqi Governing Council that Sadr should appoint a deputy to follow up the case in which Sadr is accused of killing the Shiite clergyman Abdel-Majid Khuei.
Kharazi warned against the consequences of attacking the religious leaderships in Karbalaa and Najaf, reminding them of Al-Sistani's warning to the Americans. Kharazi added, "We hope that these attacks would not take place, as, if they took place, the American forces will find themselves in confrontation with the Islamic world, and there will be catastrophic consequences."
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi's confirmation that Washington had asked Tehran to calm down the situation, after it had sought the assistance of Ayatollah Ali Sistani, is a logical result of the absence of any other political force that the US administration can recourse to and depend on.
While the current Arab paralysis regarding Iraq could be understood as a natural result of the Arab's opposition to the war without providing practical alternatives in addition to some Arab countries' undeclared alliance with the former regime, it is not understood that Arab diplomacy do not move to intervene directly and constructively to explore a new role in Iraq that transcends the current paralysis.
Waiting until an Iraqi elected government is formed means waiting until a new Iraq is formed, which would be so late.
On 14th April a plan began to advance the issuance of the unified Gulf currency to 2007 rather than 2010 through incorporating the two stages of the currency unity and Gulf common market.
The memo focused on the role of the unified Gulf currency in forming the cornerstone in economic unity which started by pegging the GCC currencies to the US dollar late in 2002.
The Islamists say that such a merger is political and has nothing to do with the academic reality and was meant to "liquidate" the Faculty of Sharia and having it dwarfed by turning it into just a department in the Faculty of Law as was the case in the 1970s. Meanwhile, the liberals supported the government's stance.
Some Islamists said they would stage a big student demonstration in the faculty to ask for having the decision cancelled.
On 13th April MP Dr. Walid Al-Tabtabai wrote an article to say, "The faculty has been targeted through inciting decision makers."
There are precedents for amalgamating faculties and scientific departments in the university, which did not cause such uproar, he said, calling for neither interfering in nor politicizing academic issues.
The Sudanese government rejected any European military intervention in Darfur, accusing the European Union (EU) of "seeking to poke its nose into Darfur issue" and downplaying US Department of State's latest accusations against the Sudanese Army and allied militias of violating the truce in the area.
Later, the EU toned down the general's comments, stressing that there was no definite action to be taken. There are no talks or preparations for a possible military intervention in Darfur, EU's Foreign and Security Policy Chief Javier Solana's spokeswoman said.
Such robots made a major success in military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, pushing the Pentagon to update them and increase their production, unidentified sources said.
During their meetings in the Lebanese capital of Beirut, they called on the international community with its different organizations and agencies to practise pressure on Israel to end its occupation of Jerusalem and return it to Palestinian sovereignty as the capital of an independent Palestine.
WESTERN PLOT TO ESTABLISH INDEPENDENT STATE IN DARFUR FAILED
The U.S. sought to internationalize the Darfur issue in a bid to compel the Sudanese government to accept SPLA's preconditions in final status negotiations in Kenya. Sudanese Minister of Information Zahawi Malek told Al-Wafd that foreign forces lay behind tension in Darfur to disturb stability in Sudan, especially as the problem of south Sudan was about to be resolved through the current negotiations.
Several officers were also caught for getting involved in a failed coup at Turabi's instigation.
Such amendments, if adopted, will be the first since the law was enacted 23 years ago. Parliamentary sources were quoted as saying that reports on the rescission coincided with Egypt's determination to create a major internal political reform especially as talk on the CPP was often related to the imposition of strict restrictions that led to the turndown of over 35 parties. Meanwhile, court rulings were issued in favour of the cofounders of such parties, the last of which was the Al-Ghad (Tomorrow) Party, founded by Ayman Nour, who is now an independent member of parliament.
Under a fresh formula, the Shura Council will keep supervising political parties. There will also be rules for parties to obtain annual governmental aid, contest parliamentary elections and issue organs, the sources said.
The committee set a respite to receive rejections. However, no rejection has been sent to it so far.
In an interview with the French Le Monde paper, Mubarak said, "After his meeting with the US President Bush, Ariel Sharon considered that he was given the green light to do whatever he wanted."
MUBARAK: ARABS CAN ONLY DEAL WITH WASHINGTON
Chirac emphasized more than once that the Egyptian-French stands were "identical" over all issues under discussion.
Chirac called on the Arab world to announce its stances and expectations, saying, "We've been waiting for the outcome of the Arab summit, expected to be held next May, which may reveal the Arab world's expectations within a framework of cooperation, dialogue and consultation in order to modernize the Arab world."
Al Azhar Grand Sheikh Dr. Mohamed Sayed Tantawi emphasized that any act done in defence of the land, the self, property and dignity against the aggressor but not against peaceful civilians is regarded as a martyrdom operation.
He emphasized that the conquests of prophet Mohamed PBUH were not terrorism but jihad.
Tantawi called on the Palestinians who follow in the steps of Rantissi to keep steadfast in order to achieve victory. He hoped that the Palestinian people could be able to establish their state very soon. He also hoped to be granted martyrdom as just like Rantissi.
It also called for taking decisive action against State terrorism practiced by Israel, particularly by European and world parliaments.
Abdel-Wahed issued a decision to refer to the Criminal Court in connection with corruption charges Abdel-Fattah, who doubles as a consultant in the State Litigation Body, and chairman of the Tourism Development Company Medhat Hasanein.
It is expected that president Hosni Mubarak will carry out a limited cabinet reshuffle that will include a few number of ministerial portfolios shortly after his return from his tour that includes the US, Germany and France. Mubarak will meet French president Jacques Chirac tomorrow.
In spite of the fact that the Egyptians hoped to obtain Bush's support to a free trade agreement between the two countries, which was obstructed due to the strict American demands, Egypt's announcement of its support of the American stance in respect with the urgency of political and economic reform in the Middle East region can be viewed as an attempt to satisfy the Americans to back track on their strict condition in view of this agreement without giving them explicit license to continue pressure on Egypt and the other Arab countries regarding the reform issue.
The Legislative Committee of the National Council for Human Rights (NCHR) will hold a meeting on Wednesday under Sameh Ashour chairman of the Bar Association to devise more practical visualization to end the state of emergency which has been in force for 23 years and create a formula to be approved by the government.
MINISTER: LUXURY EXPENDITURE WASTES LE15 MILLION DAILY
An excruciating crisis threatens the Eastern Company for Tobacco with full stoppage of production because it is almost running out of raw materials stocks, said Eng.
He uncovered that he had warned different bodies that the company's production would come to a halt in two months' time and the state might have to secure dollars and import finished cigarettes as soon as possible, a stage the company never wishes to reach, he said.
During the training course held by the Economic Committee at the Press Syndicate in Hurghada last week, he said that it was impossible to reduce Egyptian imports as more than 85% of them are raw materials, industrial inputs, intermediary goods and consumer goods that cannot be dispensed with.

EGYPTIAN TAGAMO'H PARTY PROPOSES NATIONAL CHANGE PLAN
According to former leader of the Tahamo'h Party Khalid Mohieddin, the party's position on the religious trend is an articulate one, calling that religion should be separated from politics to keep it away from political conflict, rather than life. "We are against a claim by a certain group that it is the only body that represents Islam and pursues correct religious teachings." On the Muslim Brotherhood Group, the former party leader said a political reform would weaken the group's role as a political force that exercises illegal activities.
Under the party reform plan, backwardness and reactionism should be eliminated, the freedom of culture, literary and art creativity and scientific research be guaranteed, state-owned mass media redlines be wiped out, and the religious discourse and thought be revamped.

These housing units, he added, were not promoted in Egypt only, but also to real estate exhibitions that were mounted abroad in European and Arab countries.

Moreover, an executive authority will be formed to govern the country for 7 months till the end of June next. There is another committee on elections that will be conducted ahead of January," he pointed out.
LEADER OF ARAB VOLUNTEERS IN IRAQ: WE'RE GOING TO EXCHANGE AMERICAN MILITARY FOR SADDAM AND THOUSANDS OF IRAQIS
He said, "The reservations expressed by top Shiite cleric Ayotollah Ali Sistani about the current events would not affect forming a unified Sunnite popular command of Iraqi resistance."
It is noteworthy that Iraq had seven million gunmen before the American invasion.
Heavy losses have, therefore, been inflicted on alliance forces, especially the American forces. In addition, several alliance troops have been captured. Investigations with those troops uncovered that there was a state of collapse in the American army. According to POWs, confessions, American soldiers are forced to leave their barracks and enter the city of Falluja."
The USA had gone to war thinking that there would be a schism between the Sunnites to whom the former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein belonged and the Shiites who resisted the British in the 1920 revolution but lived deprived of power in Iraq for eighty years.
He did the same thing with Muqtada Sadr who sent him one of the aides of Mohamed Bahr Al Oloum and Mohsin Al-Hakim, son of Mohamed Bakir Al-Hakim to negotiate a ceasefire between Al Mahdi Army and the American occupation forces. So far nothing indicates that the Sunnites or the Shiites would accept Paul Bremer's demands because he had not yet realized what is happening in the Iraqi collective consciousness which expected freedom and democracy only to discover that it is facing the trial of a permanent occupation!
Finding no place for him in the Governing Council structure, however, he tried to find himself one using military power even at the expense of the Iraqi people and its independence. At the end of the day, he represents a setback fighting the American setback with neither setback caring for the interests of the Iraqis as a whole.
The man's martyrdom, however, did not lead to the disappearance of his trend which even grew and embarrassed the silent authority mainly based in Qum.
Therefore, Iran was suspected of involvement in the assassination of Sadr the father especially as a campaign was launched by Iranian mass media against Sadr prior to his death accusing him of being a stooge of Saddam Hussein's regime and of leading the so-called the Iraqi creed campaign following the Desert Operation, which Al Sadr denied in a Friday sermon so much so that he even refused to pray for Saddam Hussein who, then, asked him to stop getting involved in political affairs and to confine himself to religious matters away from any other political interests, an appeal which was not only turned down by Sadr but was followed by a demand to release his detained agents.
If the Americans have described demonstrators and resistance men as bandits or highwaymen, Muqtada Sadr who received his education in Hawza had got a university degree from Baghdad University, to be the first Shiite to head for authority while holding a non-religious academic certificate.
The interview runs to the following effect: Q: First, how do you see the Iraqi current scene and for what direction it is heading?
Q: Do you think that the recent rebellion indicates that the Shiites have lost hope in making such political gains as some of their circles hoped to do at the beginning of occupation?
On the other hand, America started to fear the growing "Sadrite" trend in Iraq at the expense of other Shiite trends, which seem to occupation authorities more amendable to understanding and to reconciliation. Sadr, therefore, young as he is and although he does not represent a religion authority, could steal the Shiite intifada scene, which caused concern to other Shiite parties and forces represented in the Transitional Governing Council like the Supreme Assembly for the Islamic Revolution, and Al-Daawa Party. Such concern, I think, has extended to Ayatullah Sistani's supporters who were dismayed by their grassroots' tendency to side with the "Sadrite" trend which started to play on the cord of citizenship, nationalism and renunciation of sectarianism. The Shiite street, therefore, has lost much of its interest in the traditional referentiality which has been usually described as the silent Hawza, in favour of the vocal Hawza represented by Sadr.
A: In fact, Sadr, obviously seeks power. I think it was wrong to exclude him from the political process. We may remember that wanted to appoint one of his advocates as a minister of defence.
BUSH UNDERMINES THE PEACEFUL MARCH BETWEEN THE ARABS, ISRAEL
What was implicit in 1996 between Netanyahu and the neo-conservatives has become explicit in 2004 between Bush and Sharon pushing the Middle East to a new crisis besides the other crises blowing up in a variety of forms in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Lebanon due to American policies towards those countries.
This approval ignored the UN General Assembly resolution 144 in 1948 which was confirmed more than one hundred times by the USA herself 3-An American violation of Geneva's fourth agreement on organizing occupation affairs, which banned the introduction of any demographic changes to the regions which are occupied. This happened when the American President admitted that the demographic change would have to be taken into account. The demographic change, here, pertains to the Israeli settlements.
What Bush has done constitutes defiance of political settlement logic and defiance of the Arab settlement project whether that declared by Fez summit in 1982 or Beirut summit in 2002 known as Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah's project.
There are, of course, specific differences between the situation in 1948 and the situation now.
Such calculations, nonetheless, ignore the boiling state in the Arab street which tends to produce uncalculated or unexpected changes.
Such popular factors could act and interact to form a popular resistance phenomenon against Israeli and American occupations as an alternative to the state of military weakness suffered by the Arab region. The American policy of exercising pressure on the region and its peoples must generate some reactions which can be either official or may come through angry popular movements.
The American position submitted to Sharon in the White House under the name of "The Road Map", leading to peace is only a war recipe where the word peace is used only as a cover.

Advisors to Minister of Finance Abdel Fattah Al-Gibally denied the reports about allocating the first stage of the system for putting up treasury bills only. The putting up operation is done according to the needs of the public budget, he said. "Starting with putting up treasury bills does not mean postponing the putting up of bonds to a later stage," he said, adding that delaying the activation of the main dealers system last year was justifiable, as the market was being prepared to receive such a system in order to achieve the aim behind that step.

On the other hand, how will the Iraqis prove that their presence in the Arab League and attendance in the Arab Summit are justifiable? If the Arabs have such a narrow margin that does not accommodate any Arab stances serving the interests of Iraq and the Iraqis, the summit support of the US plan and other cliches currently circulated (transfer of power, the UN role, etc) would be of no importance.
If discussing the Iraqi file was not allowed, why would Arab leaders meet and hold a summit and what would be the value of decisions on paper to be issued by the summit.

It disregarded the UN resolutions, international borders, rules of just and comprehensive peace, and previous promises by American administrations.
Talking about calculations related to the American presidential elections that made Bush give his gifts to Ariel Sharon does not belittle the dangers of such gifts.

We thank God for our success in bringing these antiquities from Iraq to our state as the existence of these antiquities here will bring us several benefits in terms of culture or economy, which has been suffering since the outbreak of the Palestinian Intifada, Israeli Economy Minister Benjamin Netanyahu inaugurated the Public Exhibition for Selling Iraqi Antiquities on 11 April 2004 in Tel Aviv!
The study stressed the importance of the Iraqi antiquities considering them one of the key tools that can be used in rescuing the Israeli economic situation. The antiquities are now acquired by rich men and antiquities traders who sell them at very low prices whether inside or outside Israel in return for high profits for them, which make such antiquities very cheap compared with the real price of such priceless pieces.
Salem Abdrabo agrees with Khalil on the importance of selling Iraqi antiquities to Israel, which urged it to organize trips for people from a number of world countries in stark audacity to come and watch the exhibitions that are organized in return for financial sums of around 3000 and 4000 dollars per individual, in opportunist behaviour. He explained that the value of profits obtained from selling these antiquities to Israel amounted to around 12 million dollars, a very high figure if we take into consideration that Iraq fell only around one year ago.
Under this headline, Mohamed Khaled Al-Azar, a Palestinian writer, writes an article which runs to the following effect: Throughout last year all the reasons cited by Washington to justify the invasion and occupation of Iraq were subjected to refutation, doubt or at least painstaking arguments regarding their credibility.
What happened was not different from such a scenario.
Some even started to almost laud the Libyan regime which, according to their view learnt the Iraqi lesson and lost no time in offering its cards about unconventional armament lest it should be undertaken by America, the wrathful ally in its preemptive wars.
The hatred borne by some to the Palestinians for one reason or another cannot automatically mean siding with Israel, sympathizing with its discourse and making friends with it.
On 28/9/2003, occupied Iraq Minister of Petroleum, Ibrahim Bahrul-Oloum said, "I do not expect that exporting our oil to Haifa will be approved.
The council has unceasingly declared commitment to the Arab positions and that a different approach to that state (Israel) will not be on the cards before the Palestinian settlement.
Added to that, the Iraqi people's sector are too clever to let such an "exotic" scheme pass while rejecting the settlement of their next of kin, the Palestinians. In any case, Israel can not claim to have reached all its goals in Iraq after its occupation as such goals are obstructed by structural impediments. Iraqi hostility to it and caution against it is by no means an option of one regime which may be followed by another.

He added that returning Baath to power came in response to a regional desire to rein in democratic forces in Iraq.
He emphasized that there were growing concern in regional countries of assigning power in Iraq to Kurdish and Shiite forces. The return of Baathist plan is meant to undermine such concern.

GULF COUNTRIES TO DISPATCH 20,000 TROOPS TO IRAQ
Under this headline, Syrian political writer, who resides in Egypt, wrote an article that runs to the following effect only in part: British orientalist Dr. Bernard Lewis, a Zionist Jew and professor at the American University of Princeton, has compiled a project on dismantling the constitutional entities of many Arab and Islamic countries in the Middle East region, Asian, North Africa, in addition to Turkey and the Sudan. A secret file containing proposed partitioning and dismantling maps was annexed to the project which was approved by the US Congress in 1983.
If the Iraqi society as a whole was thoroughly examined, a similar semi-invisible truth would be found out; the northern territories of Iraq are not solely possessed by Shiites, but rather, the number of Sunnite and Kurdish residents is equal to the number of the Shiite residents.
As a result of all these facts, it transpires that an alliance between Iraqi national resistance factions against the foreign occupiers is of paramount importance. All Iraqi territories unexceptionally constitute a heritage of all religious, doctrinal and ethnic factions, which are eligible to coexist on the soil of the united Iraq. the Iraqi Kurds together with other Iraqi religious, doctrinal and ethnical factions, might in the near future realize that, they share the same Iraqi concerns and destiny.
But which Iraq, this is the question?
The study, which was conducted by Dr. Abdessalam Gomaa, supervisor of the Wheat Research Department with the Agricultural Research Center, pointed out Egypt's successful experiment in boosting local production of wheat from 4 million tons in the early 1970s to 6.8 million tons last year thanks to the use of the latest technical methods. Therefore, wheat and flour imports retreated.
Thirdly: rationalizing consumption. Fourthly: enhancing the loaf industry through purifying flour, expanding in mixing wheat with corn at a ratio of 80:20, tightening measures so that wheat would not be used as animal or poultry feed. Therefore, consumption rates may be reduced to 120-150 kilograms per capita annually instead of the current rate, which hits 180-200 kilograms.
Egypt will get 50% of the company's production and the Tantalum International, owned by the Australian Gyps Land, will get 50%.

A report released by the Central Auditing Agency (CAA) showed that the General Organization for International Exhibitions and Fairs (GOIEF) incurred two million pounds in losses owing to unconsidered participation in foreign exhibitions, including Senegal Exhibition, International Furniture Exhibition in Paris and Italy Exhibition.
The report took as an example the Senegal Exhibition in which losses reached 150,000 ponds due to unsafe revenues of participation in the exhibition in spite of reports and studies that emphasized that involvement in the event was useless as only half the rented pavilion was exploited.

Washington exerts pressure on the Egyptian side to activate the QIZ projects that consecrate the Israeli access into the Egyptian and Arab economy, Al-Ezabi said, adding that there are many factors that lessen the reliability of the Egyptian situation that rejects the establishment of such zones. For instance, the textile industry would face a crisis as a result of cancelling the quota system as of next January. Moreover, many countries such as China, Turkey and Thailand are waiting for getting access to the American market in the fields of textile and ready-made clothes. On the other hand, the Egyptian products' competitive edge is humble, so long as the customs charges hitting 30% are still imposed on them, as a condition for giving them access to the US market, not to mention the profits promoted by the advocates of such zones, estimated at 500 million dollars.
The Jordanian textile exports to the US market topped 500 million dollars last year, compared to 12 million dollars in 1997. This rise would have a direct effect on Egyptian decision taking regarding the QIZ, especially as Israel has contributions, albeit limited, in some textile and ready-made projects in Egypt, Al-Darsh said.
EGYPTIAN-EUROPEAN NEGOTIATIONS ON CUSTOMS REFORM PROGRAM
The European Commission official said that the total budget allocated by the European Union to trade enhancement program with Egypt amounts to 66 million euros.

It is a completion of TEP A stage which is concerned with providing technical aid. Foreign Trade ministry benefit by this technical aid will reach 20 million euros as September next.
They added that the paper is particularly important as British investments top the list of foreign investments in Egypt. If the council, due to the nature of its constitution, includes major companies from both countries, the discussions and issues raised represent a concept of future cooperation in various fields. The British party head occupies the position of deputy chairman of British Petroleum (BP), one of the biggest foreign companies operative in Egypt as well as British Gas (BG) and other big names in the world of investment. The meeting was, therefore, a chance to present Egypt's potential in joint investment and to put forward solutions to the obstacles to trade and investment inflows between the two parties, especially following the signature of the agreement of Egyptian-European partnership.
As for the third issue to be discussed by the committee, the follow-up issue, which will be faced by Egypt shortly as implementation will start as of the beginning of next year with the majority of Egyptian vegetable and fruit exports still unprepared, to quote Eng. Ali Sisa. The possibility of offering technical assistance will be concluded, in the form of training by the British party especially as the Egyptian-European partnership led to a tangible increase in the export quotas of agricultural products. Although the ministerial decree no. 178 if 2002 trespassed to apply the follow-up system on products exported to the European countries, like application process still needs training.
He adds that the American strategy to face resistance in the so-called Sunnite triangle is regarded, according to all scientific criteria and concepts, a fiasco.
In Falluja the Americans have many goals in the forefront of which is to destroy a center for combat and intelligence concentration and ending that concentration's ability to control one of the main roads to Jordan, which represents a vital artery for alliance forces military effort.
Brigadier, Farouq Mohamed, professor of mobilization in the cancelled Iraqi Faculty of Staff says that the American army generals tried to apply lessons learnt from the Israeli army when they attacked Falluja city.
Falluja Fighters Success Major, Magid Tawfik Al-Mufti, an expert in the cancelled Iraqi armed forces general command, says that the alliance forces have lost the Falluja battle for the following reasons:
Fourthly, they failed to impose full siege on Falluja banning both entry and exit.
Thirdly: No transitional government can take any duties without taking Falluja's positions into consideration. Fourthly: Disregarding quantitive and qualitative superiority.

SAUD EL-FAISAL: OUR CONSERVATIVES REJECT AL-QAEDA IDEOLOGY
The Saudi minister discriminated between Al Qaeda and the hardline conservatives in the Kingdom who want Saudi Arabia to remain at a distance from modernity which, to them, threatens the ethical purity of the Islamic society.
He said the last version of such a plan calls for destroying the Saudi state and then establishing an Islamic world country under the leadership of Bin Laden and Al Qaeda as a nucleus of his power.
He said that the religious establishment in Saudi Arabia was actually proving that it was the most eligible for stripping Al Qaeda allegations of legitimacy.
He called for qualifying Iraqi armed forces to fill the gaps in the coalition forces regarding the recent American approaches in that concern as "good talk". He emphasized the necessity that the Iraqi government should have genuine competence and also stressed the importance of a UN role.
Bin Laden and his groups may now feel beholden to President Bush and his ally Sharon for every bomb car blown up and for the unexpected moral and political support they extended to international terrorism forces.
This leaves no doubt that such attacks were not fomented away from American hands, the "remote control" way.
The only beneficiary of shaking and destabilizing the region is America and Israel.

The step is thought to be supported by a trend in the ruling regime which aims at enhancing its stance in the negotiations with the SPLA led by Garang.
In its constituent statement which the group announced in a news briefing, the group called for involving all the Sudanese participating in the process of self-determination of their country and for polling the Southerners about the self-determination of the South after one instead of six years stipulated in the agreement between the government and the SPLA.

The agreement will include "principles of a political solution and then sitting for negotiations and studying the details".

After they had been demobilized and dismissed, the situation was aggravated. It was expected or rather certain that someone would take advantage of, organize or exploit them.
Of course, many Arab youths could be arrested and Al-Zarqawi personality was in the spotlight as a peg to hang all grief and catastrophes on.
After that, they could focus on the other Shiite mutiny in the South, and may deal with it in another way after the Falluja lesson is leant by heart.
The politicians are trying, but they are moving within the margin granted them by the military and according to the latter's conditions, which means that the former's efforts would be unsuccessful.
The Americans are searching for revenge, not a ceasefire, in Falluja.
His opinion is just like that of the military. Moreover, he is preoccupied with his election battle. Some advise him to preferably decide upon Falluja matter so that it would not emerge again in the peak of his presidential electioneering.

Commenting on some water pricing experiments in some parts of the world, Al-Gamasi said that they were only in the experimental stage in the state of California, USA. Pricing in that stage is confined to the additional amounts of water. He wondered how water could be offered free in developed countries, but priced in developing ones.

AMERICA'S "PERSUASION" CAMPAIGN

Have not they yet realized, through real practice, that their map has been confiscated and its objective changed, so long as it is binding only to the Palestinian side and not to the Israelis as well?
However, there was an opening that the "Bush promise" had created, and these three members of the Quartet could have exploited it for either raising the alarm about the mistakes made by the United States or at least proposing practical solutions that could give the commitment to the Roadmap some sort of credibility.
And, more importantly, what could a clarification serve if what Bush or Rice or Powell are going to say will only be a rehash of what is already known and rejected because it is elusive and biased?
And here goes the Quartet to join the American extremism, believing that it can butter up the Arabs with a few words about the propriety of negotiations and international legitimacy.
These are trends that Israel has set forth according to its own interests; trends that were then adopted by the Bush Administration against every principle that it claims to follow; trends that the Quartet has kept silent about in the hopes that it will still have a role to play.
Mesh'al hailed the Egyptian stance towards the Palestinian cause saying, "Egypt, the biggest Arab country that went through wars for the sake of Palestine, is the main supporter of the Palestinians. We are realistic and know that the balance of power does not allow being at war with Israel, but we want the Arabs to take a stronger official stance and to build their argument on the fact that settlement was proved to be a failure and that the international parties do not oblige Israel to abide by its commitments." Regarding the detailed formula to be offered by Hamas for running Gaza Strip, Mesh'al said, "It is too early to offer our formula now, as Israel did not decide on withdrawal from Gaza and that all the dimensions of the Israeli stance are not clear yet." He confirmed that Hamas is ready to internally adapt itself with any variables.
We are aware of all the other issues, and we will deal positively with any developments in our conflict with Israel without forgetting the current battle on the ground."

Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia will be among the Arab countries that are most likely to suffer from the European Union expansion in the center and the east to include 10 countries, thus comprising 25 states with a 450 million population.
Predominant Fear In contrast to most complimentary statements made by some Arab Mediterranean countries ministers, the latest of which was an optimistic one made by Moroccan Foreign Minister Al-Tayeb Al-Fasi, during the inauguration of the fourth session of international studies, Jonny Mony held in Rabat and was entitled "Cooperation Between Expanded European Union and its New Neighbourhood - Bets and Horizons", there is still predominant fear of prospective implications on the eve of that event.
By the same token, head of Tunisian Employers Union. Al-Hadi Glani, did not conceal the prospective implications on Hungry and Czech joining the heavy competition with his country's organizations in the field of above medium industries like electronic components and auto electronic appliances exported by Tunisia to European markets through its mixed companies.
Well-informed sources unanimously said that the North African region especially Morocco and Tunisia would be greatly affected by Europe's expansion to include 25 states whereas Algeria, 90% of whose exports to the European Union are hydrocarbons, would not be affected at all by such a step, thus tempted to gain more time by asking for delay in the implementation of its new agreement, according to Minister of Finance, Abdel-Latif Bin Ishnehura who also said that Algerian companies should be prepared in a better way before the removal of customs barriers, which would require further time and effort.
Among the implications carefully considered by Mediterranean Arab countries is the European Commissions, adoption of the so-called formula, political conditions," which would govern relations with Arab countries discretely and quite differently. This is considered normal by Brussels which links it to progress made on the levels of democracy, plurality, transparency, and complete deregulation of economy as a criterion according to which their markets would be opened.
Under this headline, head of Dubai-based Gulf Research Center Abdel-Aziz bin Othman bin Sakr writes an article, which runs to the following effect: In the last few days, a conference under the rubric of "NATO Transformations and Gulf Security" wound up in Doha, Qatar. The conference was fruit of cooperation between the Qatari Foreign Ministry and the US Rand institution. Many as the issues discussed in the conference are, I (the writer) think it is more appropriate to mull over the basic axes through answering the most vital questions in this critical case.
NATO experiment mainly focuses on establishing a multi-polar alliance whose members would share liabilities and tasks. A large part of NATO experiment also focuses on encouraging transformation into a more active alliance.
As a result of European countries' unwillingness to play a direct military role in the Gulf region, playing such a role under the NATO umbrella would be more acceptable.
What kind of beneficial cooperation is required?
By examining the current bilateral agreements, it would be discovered that the direct reason for concluding then is that there is a consensus that a danger is looming over and there is some acceptance of the US presence in the region.
There is a large-scale popular opposition to rendering such cooperation into an official form. This would agitate hatred in the local communities.
There is semi-consensus in the Gulf milieus that Washington seeks to realize its own interests through executing security policies in the region, notwithstanding bilateral relations of the US and its allies in the Gulf region.
Opposing stances mostly emerge from the milieus of Arab communities resident in GCC countries, in addition to common discontent among the milieus of unemployed Gulf youth.
It seems that the GCC countries have not formulated a joint security vision until now.
I should be realized that if the NATO had a joint defence charter before the US-led war on Iraq, the discord among its member states would have led to insolvable problems.

Israel will thus have official access to such states and will be able to excavate there under international auspices as well as the slogans of dazzling agreements at Israeli hands as the project initiator!

PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE ASK FOR PRIVATIZING HEALTH SECTOR
Egyptian authorities accused Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) of sending some of its members abroad to receive military training within its in a bid to overthrow the regime by force.
The Ikhwan adopted an educational programme to train its cadres in its goals foremost of which is changing the regime by force to establish an Islamic caliphate, the memo of investigation said.
They set up some economic entities to finance their activity, 20 of which have been monitored, in addition to three flats in Manial, west Cairo, where they used to meet. Two of those flats belong to the Egyptian Services Company, whose board chairman is defendant Gamal Nassar.
On the other hand, Al-Wasat Al-Gadid party founders' agent Abul-Ela Madi denied any link between the latest campaign on Ikhwan and his party, as he submitted an application to the parliamentary committee on parties to license it.
It might be mentioned that 17 Ikhwanite candidates won the last parliamentary elections as independents, but the number declined to 15 after the membership of two of them were canceled for technical reasons pertinent to the election process.
Abu al-Ela Madhi, a former member of the Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan), on Monday launched his third bid to have a political party called Wasat (centre) Party licensed by the Committee on Political Parties (CPP).
In a leaflet carrying the party platform distributed during the news briefing, the party vowed to ensure full citizenship to and equity between Christians and Muslims in Egypt.

The party includes six aspects; the political aspect, which focuses on public freedoms and political reforms; the economic aspect, which provides for a congenial investment atmosphere and modernizing the private sector's role and the state's role and spurring socio economy, regional and international economic participation and Arab economic cooperation; the social aspect involving educational reform and developing health care; the cultural and art aspect; the ethical aspect; and the aspect of foreign policy and international relations.

In an exclusive to Asharq Al-Awsat he emphasized that a breakthrough took place in the stalemate witnessed by the peace process.

The bill provided that the office would monitor and punish the countries that pay homage to the names of those involved in killing Americans through naming streets, schools, museums, etc. after their names especially in the Palestinian Authority. It will call on governments and foreign countries where Americans are killed to pay enormous compensations especially where those terrorist groups form part of the government as is the case with the Palestinian Authority.
NEWS REPORTS ON ISRAELI MILITARY OPERATION AGAINST HIZBULLAH
American sources think that the Israeli leaked news about this operation is meant to deter Hizbullah leaders from repeating the offensives they had launched early this month on Israeli military sites in Sheba Farms. According to the Israeli news leaked to the US side, Hizbullah fighters seemingly intended to kidnap a number of Israeli soldiers.
According to security sources, more than 12 members of that spy ring were detained after careful monitoring and pursuing operations of suspicious elements which used to observe at a distance the premises of Hizbullah in Beirut southern suburb, following up the movement of the party's leaders especially its secretary general, Hassan Nassrullah whom Israel threatened to assassinate.
An Egyptian worker for the cafe, named Hamada was arrested.
This is the first ring that has been dismantled this year though scores of similar rings had been dismantled in the previous years. The ring is believed to have been trying to penetrate the resistance security body, but fell in the ambush it had already prepared.
When the referee whistled to end the match, the crowd of Arabs took to the streets to mark the event till the early hours of 19th May. Hebrew newspapers considered this winning a "credit for the Israeli society to the effect that it is willing to accept the other and let him succeed". The news item was splashed, together with a big photo, on the front pages of Hebrew papers. Analysts considered this an attempt by such newspapers to continue the blackout over the war crimes being committed in Rafah.
Head of Sakhnin municipality Mohamed Basheer said that he received a phone call from President Yasser Arafat who congratulated him on such an achievement and said, "We are a people who deserve to live peacefully and independently."
Hebrew Haaretz newspaper reported Israeli political milieus' concern over the return of the Indian Congress party to power and fear of dramatic developments in New Delhi. It confessed that the election results surprised Tel Aviv too.
Haaretz political commentator is of the view that Israeli-Indian relations surpassed the stage testing when Israel was the only state that agreed to accelerate dispatching weapons and equipment to India during the tense relations with Pakistan in 1999 and 2002, while all other supplier countries served its contacts with India.
Israel, meanwhile, would bite the bullet to maintain its weaponry exports to India," he concluded.
I was told that the only option was to continue resistance.
The reply was that if politics had succeeded they would not have reached such a state. Anybody who wanted a political solution may proceed to do so as they would not be prevented. The situation in Gaza, nonetheless, reveals the absurdity or rather vanity of any political attempts. Ariel Sharon wants to punish people because, when he stormed their city, they resisted aggression.
Can we content ourselves with Gaza and some of the West Bank settlements? Does this mean that we should lay down arms after Israel's withdrawal from Gaza?
-After the referendum on withdrawal from Gaza Strip, the Likud changed from a strong Israeli Party into an extremist party. Sharon is a moderate, compared with his grassroots.
If Hamas and Jihad's positions were identical to that of the PNA would there be a solution?
I talked to Islamic resistance leaders who told me that political action did not yield anything and resistance, therefore, remains the only option.
Under this headline, Deputy Chief Editor of Al-Hayat Abdel-Wahhab Badrakhan writes an article, which runs to the following effect: The World Economic Forum, Davos, Al-Shouna, the Dead Sea, whatever its name, involves contemporary "ethics" stemming from the glorification of business and detaching it from all sorts of disputes, whether political, ideological or even cultural under the current dialectics.
The spirit of Davos, to quote the expression, presumed that such premises have been achieved so that the next phase should only be embarked upon, namely spreading businesslike "ethics" and ways stripped of any genuine human values. That is why the participants in any "economic forum" seem to be in hypothetical encounter that can normally take place only in a few years' time. Today, however, they are meeting and discussing matters under the slogan "Forget everything; forget Palestine and Iraq, forget Israel and the USA policies, but let's get down to business!"
For example, on the same day at the same hour as the Davos people were meeting and exchanging greetings and compliments and giving the most brilliant speeches about reform and peace, Israeli-American planes were bombing buildings and houses in Rafah as a start for further devastation.

It is certain, however, that they fully believe that the world is made in such fora, while the demolition of homes and turning hundreds or thousands of families homeless is only a casual detail, which means that Davos is, after all, ignoring and despising the other.

On the other hand, Israel felt worried about leakages published by a Lebanese newspaper about Turkey's tendency to cancel the Israeli-Turkish strategic partnership, as Turkish government officials were quoted as saying that Turkey would backpedal on supplying Israel with water and abrogate an agreement signed between them in this respect. Israel's worry lies in the fact that Turkey declined to deny such leakages officially. Ardogan aroused Israel's resentment by describing it as a terrorist state after it had assassinated Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin last March.
In press statements made yesterday Turkish Foreign Minister, Abdullah Gul said that Cairo admitted to the ownership of the shipment, but he declined to give any further details.
US ADMINISTRATION UNDERSTANDS MUBARAK'S APOLOGY FOR NOT ATTENDING G-8 SUMMIT
President Bush understands that Mubarak, who paid a recent visit to the US and explained his vision of reform and development in the region, found out that there was no need to cover such a long distance just to attend the summit for a few hours, he said.

A third in-between trend sees that reform should be carried out gradually in order to preserve stability.
In a related development, public figures launched endeavours to form a forum entitled "Brethren of Purity" for setting proposals meant to help achieve political reform.

Asked about reports that Egypt calls for taking away security competence from Arafat, the source said, "We asked Arafat to abandon control over security affairs and be content with being a historic, honest and patriotic struggler like African leader Nelson Mandela.
Progress in security affairs is not carried out away from other issues. The source, however, did not deny reports about an amendment of Camp David Accords, saying this issue is referred to security and defence competence. He pointed out that the talks with Shalom would be concentrated on political issues.
Muslim Brotherhood lawyer Abdel Monein Abdel Maksoud said that the State Security Prosecution would investigate reports received from the public prosecutor's office regarding the circumstances of Al-Zuheiri's death as a result of injuries due to hits against the bus sides while being transported from the investigation quarters to prison.

NEW ELECTION BILL IN EGYPT COMBINES INDIVIDUAL AND SLATE SYSTEMS
The new bill provides that candidates should not be allowed to contest the elections in individual constituencies and party slates.
The bill will also take care not to disrupt the Independents' representation percent to avoid contravening Egyptian Constitution provisions and forestall attempts to lie in waiting for the law and to challenge its constitutionality and to avoid wasting the new election system.
To justify this point of view, the source said that 24.2 million voters are registered in the electorate's tables out of which only 5 million and 656 thousand participating in the 2000 parliamentary elections that the turnout rate reached only 24.5%.
Tourism Minister Mamdouh Al-Beltagui said, in a press statement yesterday (11th June), that Egypt would not receive any Iranian tourist groups till full resumption of political relations between Egypt and Iran.
Cairo and Tehran concluded early last year an agreement that stipulated forming a committee of members from both the Egyptian and Iranian chambers of commerce to consider cooperation between them.
He described the spate of names recently circulated by Egyptian newspapers as "mere speculations which are groundless". He warned against who pretended to be close to decision-making circles.
Party and independent newspapers mentioned names as candidates for high ranking positions as well as other names of ministers expected to be deposed.
He added that the dialogue which was started by the NDP with legitimate parties and opposition forces would continue with a view to exchanging ideas and visions and defining political reform needs and priorities.
There are also a large number of Egyptian irrigation experts in the World Bank," he added.
Hassan said that the family was surprised when it received his corpse in a black bag holding number 1909 with a certificate identifying the cause of death as " a hit on the head".
The medical examiner entrusted by the family to examine the corpse said that his skull was broken and he had injuries above his left eye. The reason for death, he added, is a sudden hit on the back of his head.
OPPOSITION PARTIES FAIL TO AGREE ON A "UNIFIED" REFORM PAPER
Parties lost hope of any progress in dialogue with the government despite several attempts exerted by party leaders to resume dialogue with the ruling party, which started in November last and then stopped unjustifiably without any indicators of a near resumption, they pointed out.
There have been much talk about "reshuffle" these days. Many Egyptians who wait for this reshuffle hope that government key figures and opposition leaders should retire at a younger age.
Shura Council Speaker Dr. Mustafa Kamal Helmi, who runs the mid-term elections, is over 80 years old. Muslim Brotherhood guide Mohamed Mahdi Akef also approaches the age of 80.
The second request was made by Abul-Ela Madi (46) who dissented from the Muslim Brotherhood to establish Al-Wasat Al-Gadid (New Center) Party. The third request was made by MP Ayman Nour to found Al-Ghad (Tomorrow) Party after a long battle with Al-Wafd Party and his leader No'man Gomaa (70).
Ebeid is not the oldest among his government members, as Minister of Justice Counselor Farouk Seif Al-Nasr was born in 1922 and Minister of Agriculture Dr. Youssef Wali was born in 1930.
Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Kamal Al-Shazli was born in 1934. The year 1935 witnessed the birth of three ministers; Defence Minister Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher and Minister of Public Works and Water Resources Dr. Mahmoud Abu-Zeid.
Minister of Civil Aviation Ahmed Shafiq was born in 1941.
3 MPs PREPARE FIRST LAW TO HIKE TAXES ON THE AFFLUENT
The proposed draft law imposes 10-15% charges on private airplanes when they are bought for the first time, according to their occupancy and engines, in addition to 20% as sales tax. The MPs point out that their draft law includes special articles for private airplanes when they are overhauled or when their licences are renewed. That should be, at least, on annual basis, in addition to charges paid in the Egyptian pound and hard currency for every domestic and outer flight respectively.
The three MPs were keen on clarify that this draft law is not against investors or the affluent or out of grudge against them, but rather aims to achieve equality.
The two leading figures announced the formation of a new party called Al-Wafd Democratic Party.
Ashennawi emphasized that the idea of forming the Egyptian Democratic Party had struck them a year before due to absence of democracy in the current Wafd Party.
The new party's platform stresses the principles of democracy, dialogue, enforcing the constitution that was compiled in 1955 but was turned down by late president Nasser, Ashennawi said, adding that the new party pays attention to freedom and social responsibility in a way that copes with the new developments.
The deputy added that the book described social customs in Egypt as strict in bringing up and dealing with girls and granting them a lower status than boys.
The Egyptian, then, approvingly says, "You are right! However, we got used to this and do not mind those matters any more!
However, in Egypt I'm sometimes haunted by a sense of inferiority to my three brothers who have more rights than I do. Permitted space are much wider to them and their rights by far exceed ours. I also mean that parents prefer males to females, which makes me feel dissatisfied."
In an urgent quest for notification to Prime Minister Atef Ebeid under the title "12 million Egyptians live in the open air," MP Mohamed Al-Morsi stressed that about 60 percent of the Egyptians were under the poverty line, bearing the brunt of unemployment and price hikes.

Meanwhile Cairo Paribas Bank announced putting up a new saving certificates at an interest rate of 12% with a 3-year term and a steady interest cashed every month.
Lending prices between banks (Interbank) went down yesterday to their lowest rate recording ever 0.25%. This decline was ascribed by the Egyptian Watani Bank international transactions director Mohamed Rustom to the end of the reserve rates and controlling bank liquidity, when Interbank rates usually reach their lowest. Such a decline, however, was due to the remarkable increase in domestic currency liquidity on the banking market at higher rates than the normal recent rates.
BANKS' SHARE OF TREASURY BONDS HITS 58.6 BILLION POUNDS
Egypt's share of international capital flows retreated by $171 million, or 48%, while net flows reached $353 million last year to retreat to $182 million this year.

Yesterday, Delta International Bank joined the list of banks, which decided to raise their interest rates on saving certificates.
BANKS VIE FOR INVESTING IN GAS SECTOR A growing interest has been recently taken in the gas sector by banks in particular and by investors in general.
He also pointed out that 20% of the world's imports of Egyptian gas are carried out through Gas De France company, which justifies, the French banks interest in financing petroleum and gas investment projects. In the forefront of such banks comes the National Societe Generale Bank. He added that the biggest banks in the world compete for winning opportunities of participation in investment in Egyptian gas sector.
Misr International Bank director Hala Fayiq says that Egypt had recently witnessed the biggest two projects for the liquefaction of Egyptian gas, the first one by British Gas, the biggest contributor to it, besides the project of Malaysian Petronas company and the second is C-Gas project in cooperation with Union Fenosa company.
One bank takes the lead in financing those projects in coordination with other banks. Negm pointed out Delta International Bank contribution to similar projects like that of fertilizers at Abu Qir the contract of which had been recently signed with Misr International Bank (MIBank). Negm emphasized Delta International Bank readiness to contribute to financing gas projects in the future if it was invited to do so and after a feasibility study is done for the project and after making sure that there was a financial surplus allowing contribution to such enormous projects.
Deputy Director of the National Societe Generale Bank, Abdel-Mohsen Al-Simari says that investment in the gas sector is one of the most rewarding of investment fields whether that investment was direct or through the bank entering into syndicated loans. He emphasized the feasibility of investments in the gas sector as a promising sector that represents no risk at all, which explains his call for Egyptian banks to take interest in investment in gas sector.
The group included United Bank of Egypt, Commercial International Bank (CIB)-Egypt, Arab Banking Corporation (ABC) and American G.BB Morgan Chase.
Egyptian banks hold meetings with their Libyan counterparts to discuss aspects of cooperation, available opportunities, financing potential, nature of projects as well as means of presence there.
In reply to a question on the political dimension behind the Egyptian banks' orientation, especially as the ban was lifted on the Libyan market, Hussein said it was a banking option which had nothing to do with politics especially regarding laying down Egyptian investments there and cooperation with Libyan investment companies.
Executive head of Arab Banking Corporation (ABC-Egypt) Tarik Helmi uncovered the bank's desire to enhance its presence or representation by spreading new branches on the Libyan market especially as the Libyan government contributes to the corporation's capital.
Deputy board chairman of CIB (Egypt) Sahar Al Sallab, who doubles as managing director said that some Egyptian banks were studying the Libyan market and its investment opportunities as well as the suitable means of getting access especially regarding petroleum and construction pointing out the CIB study of the Libyan market.
The competing banks have to sell such certificates to individuals and natural persons, rather than funds or corporations.
Some other banks, however, raised interest rates in a bid to attract further funds. He added that he preferred deliberation in taking the decision of raising interest rates to ascertain whether the CBE would carry on with its policy of expansion in drawing liquidity or that was a temporary state. He expected the state of wait to continue for sometime to avoid enormous burdens that might negatively affect the bank annual revenues and consequently net profits.
She thinks that the launch of new saving coffers would encourage many hesitant banks especially private ones to increase interest rates to avoid withdrawal operations in favour of the new coffers, and in a bid to expand their quota of liquidity available on the market.
The first Arab economic bloc, including Egypt, Syria, Morocco and Kuwait, will be announced soon and will include Arab economic cooperative organizations later on. The bloc will be sponsored by the Arab Council for Economic Unity under Dr. Ahmed Geweili. Such a bloc is meant to rejuvenate President Mubarak's call to set up an Arab common market, which was approved more than once by Arab leaders in their summits. These remarks were made by head of the General Federations of Cooperatives Dr. Ahmed Abdel-Dhaher who is also secretary general of the Arab Cooperatives Union.

TEXTILE EXPORTERS CONCERN OVER CANCELLING QUOTA SYSTEM
However, the WTO said that China and India would control global textile trade following the cancellation of the quota system. China will only control half of that market worldwide because its products are 25% lower than that of Egypt, thus obstructing Egyptian exports way to such markets in light of such a fierce competition.
Meanwhile, lending market between banks (Interbank) almost witnessed a collapse as its prices retreated to about 0.25%, its lowest price ever.
Director and supervisor over the bank's international transactions department, Shahinaz Fouda said that the certificate would be put up as of tomorrow (1st September) for natural and artificial persons who hoard foreign exchange so that they would transfer their foreign exchange to the bank in return for buying the certificate.
Rustom added that another reason of such a decline in interest rates was the fact that no deposits were put up by the CBE recently as it contented itself with putting up treasury bills only, a move which most banks refrained from joining, thus raising their liquidity.
State-owned and private banks' share of treasury bonds recorded 58.6 billion pounds, down 1.3 billion pounds over one month.
During a seminar held at Saleh Kamel Center for Islamic Economy, Al-Azhar University, it was revealed that Egypt and Islamic countries need to exert tireless efforts to attract foreign direct investments (FDI) and raise its share of total international capital flows.

This has been confirmed by the signature of several agreements, the latest of which was the conclusion of a financing agreement to the value of $950 million in favour of exporting Egyptian liquefied natural gas to France. B-Gas Company and its partners, Malaysian Petronas and Gas De France, have finally approved of financing the first unit project to liquefy natural gas of the Egyptian Company for Liquefied Natural Gas in order to be exported to France. The first notification to withdraw the first payment has been issued as a prelude to lending banks delivering the first payment of the funds estimated at about $600 million of the project and the shareholders. This clearly shows the international financial community's confidence in the company project as international enterprise, which will contribute to the placement of Egypt on the list of the seven major gas exporting countries in the world by the end of 2006.
For his part, British Gas Company director pointed out that 29% of the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project is divided between E-Gas (12%) and the Egyptian General Organization for Petroleum with the same percentage (12 %). Gas de France Company, on the other hand, contributes 5% the finance and the remaining percentage constituting 71% is divided on between British Gas and the Malaysian company of Petronas.
Hala Fayiq pointed out that the two projects bear witness to the international capability of Egypt in gas reserves, which hit about 65 trillion cubic meters.
Deputy Director of National Societe Generale Bank Tarik Fayed points out that the role played by the National Societe Generale Bank in the gas deal won by Malaysian Petronas in cooperation with British Gas and Gas de France is the role of financial advisor, which procures the required funds.
For his part, Director General of Gas de France pointed out that Gas de France's contribution to the deal which had recently been concluded with Malaysian Petronas and British Gas amounts to 5% of the contract value, which hit $950 million, which is concluded on behalf of a project to export Egyptian liquefied gas to France in coordination with the Egyptian Liquefied Gas Company (B-Gas).
The political tendency and the conditions currently undergone by Libya, together with lifting the American ban on Libya supports the Egyptian banks tendency to head for Libya which is regarded as a promising market for investments especially infrastructure, airports and communications.
Hussein added that the bank was currently holding consultations with its key clients who want to invest in Libya, especially as the United Bank of Egypt had been chosen as an investment advisor to the Egyptian party. Agreement is underway with the Libyan government on the nature of projects, especially as the Libyan companies contribute about 20% to the bank capital. The bank is currently considering some projects to probe the possibility of financing them. He declined to uncover the volume of the funds allocated by the bank to investment in Libya.
Cairo-American G.BB Morgan Chase's regional director Mostafa Al Sahn added that the Libyans were supposedly receiving their funds kept in American banks, which amounted to millions of dollars especially as the date of lifting the American embargo on Libya is approaching. Al Sahn is visiting the Libyan capital in a few days' time to inform the Libyans of the situation of their funds with the bank and to open new fields of investment.
He expected the Egyptian-Libyan banking cooperation to take the form of documentary credits and cadre training. He pointed out that the banks had no political orientations but rather financial and economic ones.
BANKS VIE FOR ISSUING HIGH-INTEREST INVESTMENT CERTIFICATES
LAUNCHING SAVING COFFERS AT DISTINGUISHED INTEREST RATES RAISES MISGIVINGS
For his part, National Bank of Egypt's board chairman Hussein Abdel Aziz ruled out the possibility that the new saving coffers would affect loans while monitoring a remarkable shift in favour of the Egyptian pound in the three days following the launch of that saving coffer. He declined, however, to define the rate of the shift. Abdel Aziz understated misgivings about accumulation of liquidity due to the remarkable demand for the new coffer of the distinguish 12% interest rate. He pointed out that such a step came within the framework of developing monetary policy to secure economic policies and development plans in the forefront of which came curbing inflation rates, raising saving rates from 17.5% to 25%, restoring confidence in the national currency and putting a final end to dollarization.
International Delta Bank President Ali Negm pointed out that the fact that one or more banks resorted to raising depositors' interest rates was subject to the degree of its need to a further financial liquidity and the available potential to employ such funds. He added that there was an orientation to increase credit rates in the coming stage and get out of the doubt circle that caused the faltering problem. This would require more liquidity. He added that the new saving coffer grants the Egyptian family better interest rates periodically, and curbs spending on goods and services and consequently helps to reduce inflation rates, giving banks credit flexibility especially as they are exempted from the rate to be deducted in favour of the CBE monetary reserve.
The main objective of this bloc is to boost inter-Arab trade exchange, he said.
The banks' issuance of new saving certificates at high interest rates has pushed most US dollar depositors to convert their deposits into Egyptian pound ones.
Egypt's exports to Syria edged up by 160 percent to 26 million US dollars in January and February this year compared to the same period last year. Its imports from Syria recorded 11 million US dollars.
A report on such zones' dealings received by Minister of Planning uncovered that they had negative results with a 94.3 million dollars deficit due to the rise in imports over exports in the corresponding period.
The government delegate with Cotton Exporters Union Mohamed Al-Shewi ascribed the retreat of cotton exports to numerous problems including the American subsidy of the American cotton, which competes against the Egyptian cotton on international markets.
Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) figures pointed out a 25% growth in the value of exports in the last 9 months of the fiscal year 2003/2004 against 14% increase in imports value.
There has also been a rise in the value of manufactured exports such as iron and steel, fertilizers, carpets, medicine, citrus fruit, raw cotton, dried onions, crude oil, petroleum products, aluminum products, peanuts and ready-made clothes.
Turkey has officially announced that Egypt confirmed its ownership of the arms shipment coming from Ukraine confiscated by Turkey Customs Department two days ago. Turkish officials added that the shipment included missile, missiles launchers and highly sophisticated weaponry.
It is noteworthy that the ship skipper had informed Turkish customs authorities that the shipment which was stevedored at Istanbul contained only spare parts, but it turned out to contain weapons.
The administration is in touch with Mubarak and other Egyptian officials on the political statement to be released by the summit, the official said. The statement will be based on Mubarak's speech at Bibliotheca Alexandrina and the resolutions made by the recent conference at the library.
The US also proposed the formation of a working group for coordination between non-governmental organizations in the US and Europe, and a multilateral organization to focus on the Middle East.
Those opponents work for maintaining the current status as it is for they fear they would be victims of that change.
In this context, chief editor of Al-Ahram newspaper Ibrahim Nafei wrote yesterday about reform, for the second time in a week.
Sources in the forum said it aims at declaring certain steps to reform that would lead to setting matters in order, starting with adhering to the law and restoring confidence between the society and the ruling regime through reaching a national consensus on reform steps. Such steps include amendment of the constitution, selection of efficient people to bear responsibility and suggesting solutions to the political, economic and social problems.
"We do not give guarantees to Israel at the expense of Palestinians," the source said to Asharq Al-Awsat, adding, "We're helping to promote security capabilities of the Palestinian Authority as a prelude to the coming stage whether in case of Israel's withdrawal from Gaza Strip or for preparing for an independent Palestinian state."
Egypt's role is meant to streamline the handover of power to Palestinians in Gaza.
The call for a new Palestinian government headed by Finance Minister Salam Fayad is an American demand, said the source. The Americans believe that Fayad is able to form a government that is up to the responsibility.
The Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) Group in Egypt is trying to exploit the death of its leading member Akram Al-Zuheiri during his detention to put an end to what it regarded as violations against its members detained pending investigations by the prosecution.
The death incident raised inquiries about the role of the government National Council for Human Rights which had been formed a few months before.
The deputy emphasized that it was necessary to investigate the detained complaint to which they listened especially regarding their abduction from prison ( to screw up confessions from them) even though their custody was under the public prosecution umbrella.
Well-informed sources uncovered to Asharq Al-Awsat that the new bill combines individual and slate election systems and contains a provision that requires of any political party to obtain at least 5% of the electorate's votes on slates in order to be represented in the parliament or at least 3 seats in individual constituencies, on the ground that the parliamentary statute provides that the parliamentary body of any party should consist at least of 3 deputies.
The bill also provides that the current election constituencies, 222 in number, should be redistributed on the basis of the ratio between each governorate population and the number of its representatives in the parliament.
The sources pointed out that there were many justifications to be offered by the government to devise a new slate election system in the forefront of which is cutting down on the voters' waste especially as the individual system wastes 49% of the votes in the event of another candidate's winning 51% of the vote.
EGYPT STIPULATES NORMALIZED RELATIONS BEFORE RECEIVING IRANIAN PILGRIMS
Egyptian-Iranian sources have told Asharq Al-Awsat that the resumption of diplomatic relations between Egypt and Iran is inconceivable at least in the instant year.
INFORMATION MINISTER: CABINET RESHUFFLE TIMING AND SIZE DETERMINED ONLY BY MUBARAK
It is he who can take proper and timely decisions.
Al-Sherif, however, emphasized that the party neither gave opinions and recommendations nor did it hold a mysterious meetings regarding change or reshuffle.

The People's Assembly (PA) called upon Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher to urgently deliver a statement about the death of an Egyptian scientist, whose family says he was assassinated in the US prison in Iraq.
The MP urged that the reason for his assassination be uncovered through the Egyptian Foreign Ministry's investigations, particularly as Al-Azmirli is a polymer scientist of a highly remarkable scientific position.
He also complained that no body moved to support or defend them.
Some partisan sources attributed the failure of the Wafd, Tagamo'h and Nasserite parties to hold a meeting, scheduled to be held last week, to a state of growing frustration of making any progress with the government towards reform. Other sources said that the failure was attributed to much talk about an expected cabinet reshfulle.
Re-coordination among parties is likely in the coming period, they added.
All the ministers, who have been in their positions for about two decades or so and their pictures are always published in national newspapers, as well as opposition leaders, who always call for change and giving the opportunity to youths, are over 60 years old.
It seems that some young partisans, who despaired of having their old seniors passing down responsibility to them, dissented from their parties and sought to found independent parties. There are three requests for founding new parties.
No one competes with him except for Labour Party leader Eng. Ibrahim Shokri who was born in 1916.
Ebeid's cabinet list is good evidence to that, as Education Minister Dr. Hussein Kamel Baha'eddin and Manpower Minister Ahmed Al-Amawi were born in 1932.
Tourism Minister Mamdouh Al-Beltagui and Finance Minister Medhat Hassanein were born in 1939.
Minister of Public Enterprise Sector Mukhtar Khattab, Electricity Minister Dr. Hassan Younis and Minister of Environmental Affairs Dr. Mamdouh Riyadh were born 1943.
The MPs asked that parliament not lose time in approving and ratifying the draft law, which had not been submitted to the government yet, to be enforced by the government as of the beginning of the new fiscal year on July 1st.
Moreover, the draft law calls for the imposition of other charges on electricity bills in those tourist and distinguished areas, and to apply a category system to electricity and water consumption in order to achieve balance inside the society in a way that does not lead to the escape of investors.
WAFD KEY FIGURES SPLIT IN PROTEST AGAINST ABSENCE OF DEMOCRACY IN THE PARTY
In their resignations, a copy of which was obtained by Asharq Al-Awsat, the two dissidents explained the reasons for their action, which mostly included the absence of democracy inside the party, the domination of Gomaa over it, as well as the party's weak popularity, deteriorating situation and confusion of policies.
"A large number of the Al-Wafd's co-founders in different governorates support the proposed party."
In what was described as the start of a crisis between the Minister of Education and the people's assembly independent deputy Hussein Ibrahim submitted an interpellation to Minister of Education Dr. Hussein Kamil Bahauddin calling for conducting investigation in his ministry and imposing proper penalties on the officials responsible for the preparation of the German language set book of the second year in secondary schools.
The deputy pinpointed page 117 of the book where a dialogue between a German and an Egyptian took place: The German says, "I find means of transport in your country as disastrous and extremely chaotic.
You can take your decisions on your own without the interference of anybody.
IKWHAN PARLIAMENTARY BLOC SEVERELY CRITICIZE GOVERNMENT
He also criticized the government for allowing expansions in building tourist villages and posh houses and disregarding the needs of the poor and the low-income category.
Kirlus told the family that Pope Shenuda III, pope of Alexandria and patriarch of Mark Episcopate, attached much attention to the issue of Victor and exerted efforts to help release him.
Although Egyptian textile exports had increased over the last three years from 899 million dollars in 2001, 945 million dollars in 2002 and 1.037 billion dollars in 2003, producers and exporters of this sector are concerned due to the cancellation of the quota system by the WTO as of next year.
Exporters of such products to the USA voiced their hope to conclude preferential agreements such as QIZ (qualified industrial zone), which they seek, as a private sector, to achieve. Minister of Foreign Trade and Industry Rashid Mohamed Rashid emphasized that the conclusion of such agreements fell within the private sector rather than the Ministry of Foreign Trade's competence.
Yesterday, the market witnessed a new rise in interest rates on saving certificates led by Egyptian Arab Land Bank and Cairo Paribas Bank. The Egyptian Arab Land Bank raised its interest rates on its saving certificate "Development of capital" to about 12.8%. It is a five-year term certificate with a cash cumulative interest cashed every month at LE8 per each LE1000 certificate and LE163.5 at the end of the certificate term.
Fouda added that, the bank in return, could pay its clients the interest on the certificate in foreign exchange.
Rustom pointed out that the CBE intervention by putting up even one deposit could raise the Interbank rates, but its refrainment from issuing deposits will keep prices at their low rates.
A recent report by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) said the private and foreign banks' share rose up to 18 billion pounds, up 443 million pounds in April.
Chairman of the center Dr. Mohamed Abdel Halim Omar said total international capital flows in 1997-2003 hit $6 trillions, noting that Egypt and developing countries got 30% only of international capital flows.
Inter-Arab trade represents only 8.9% of total Arab trade volume, Dr. Saed Abdel Khaliq, director of Economic Research Department under Foreign Trade and Industry Ministry, said. He also noted that Arab investments abroad hit $1.2 trillion, while inter-Arab investment hit $16.9 billion, or 1.5%.
Delta International Bank Chairman and Managing Director Ali Negm said the bank decided to raise its interest rates in response to market conditions, pointing out that subscription to such a certificate had no restrictions, as it would be offered to individuals and institutions alike.
Head of the French economic mission in Cairo emphasized that the agreement was one of the most important agreements on the level of Egyptian-French relations because it pertains to the natural gas sector, a strategic sector whose importance is not only economic but also political.
British Gas Company director pointed out that the future plan of the company aimed at the continuation of constructing production lines relying on the availability of gas on one hand and the availability of buyers.
She highlighted the big demand for such projects by foreign banks in addition to the International Finance corporation (IFC) and Egyptian banks contributing to that deal like Misr International Bank, Commercial International Bank (CIB), and National Societe Generale Bank. She added that the volume of contributions offered by this category was in the range of $200 million out of a total finance hitting about $1.3 billion representing the first stage of financing Train-1, which had been completed.
Regarding the feasibility of the banks contribution to gas projects, Al-Fayed says that after the discovery of gas and as the world's reserves reached economic rates, banks became certain of the economic feasibility of prospecting for and marketing gas as well as exploiting such reserves due to remunerative economic results. This explains why banks are so interested in financing gas projects in general as well as the projects related to gas like those of fertilizers relying on gas.
EGYPTIAN BANKS HEAD WESTWARD FOR LIBYAN MARKET
Libya has a big reserve of oil, which makes it a fertile field for foreign investment.
He pointed out the Libyan market prosperity and the disappearance of the problems concerning donations which used to be caused by international agencies.
He highlighted the Egyptian banks desire to invest in the Libyan market due to the availability of investment opportunities especially in the field of petroleum, communications, airports and infrastructure that require further finance. He, however, declined to uncover the volume of investments to be pumped in to the Libyan market. He added that during his expected visit he would discuss with Libyan companies the possibility and mechanisms of finance as well as the quality of the projects to be implemented. He expected the Libyan government to extend facilities to Egyptian banks and offer them exemptions to help in one way or another with the finance operation.
He pointed out that Libya was promising and rich in oil and had an infrastructure, which is eligible for investment due to security and political stability.
More private and investment banks have started to issue distinguished investment certificates at higher interest rates (12 percent) than the current market rates.
Despite an outstanding liquidity surplus estimated by the latest Central Bank of Egypt CBE report at about LE46.9 billion or the equivalent of $7.55 billion at the beginning of last June and although such funds were employed in new projects the credit facilities of which amounted to about LE296 billion or the equivalent of $47.67 billion, some public and joint Egyptian banks launched a new service of saving coffers in the domestic currency at a distinguished interest rate of 12% and a 3-year term. Bankers described such a move as ambiguous, especially as banks did need to attract any further savings and as raising interest rates would aggravate economic sluggishness and the burden of debt service, thus negatively impacting on public budget deficit. Bankers also doubted that such a step might be able to curb inflation as, according to them, such inflation in Egypt is not so much caused by over consumption expenditure or an increase in demand for goods and services that could be dealt with through withdrawal of liquidity from the market as it is due to a rise in the cost of production which led to a rise in prices.
The Nile Bank board chairman, Kamal Al Sabbagh emphasized that the orientation of bolstering the bank liquidity is a positive matter and does not run counter to the CBE or government policy in the coming period. He added that putting up saving coffers at distinguished interest rates was one of the well-known tools that could contain inflation in the short run and restore confidence in the national currency. He pointed out that raising interest rates would positively affect an increase of foreign investments but they increase domestic debt in the short run if such a rise took place within an integrated system of measures in the forefront of which is reduction of taxes on markets.
For his part, former Minister of Planning, Dr. Ahmed Al Darsh warned against rushing into raising interest rates, as the cost would be too heavy for the state public budget. He pointed out that a 1% rise in interest rates could cost the budget an additional burden of LE2.1 billion.
Within this framework, Abdel-Dhaher held a meeting with a delegation from the Kuwaiti Agricultural Cooperatives Union. The two parties voiced their desire to boost cooperation among Arab cooperatives to serve national economy and take further steps towards more economic cooperation.
Sources said all foreign and Arab currencies are available at the banking market.
In 2003, Egyptian exports to Syria shot up to 74 million US dollars in 2003 against 60 million US dollars in 2002. Imports from Syria rose to 74 million US dollars in 2003, creating a balance with exports, against 38 million US dollars in 2002.
61% RETREAT IN COTTON EXPORTS
This subsidy forced foreign companies to cancel their contracts of importing Egyptian cotton due to its high price, Al-Shewi said, adding that foreign companies preferred paying a fine of 10% of the value of the contract to implementing the importation deal.
However, due to the relatively big weight of imports compared to exports, the imports value hit $1.566 billion while the export increase value stood at $1.499 billion.
On the other hand, there has been a decline in the value of the exports of medical herbs, carbon, coal, raw linen, aromatic oils, aluminum, rice and cotton yarn.
Their concerns are particularly attributed to the fact that the USA's imports of Egyptian products of this sector (yarn, textile, ready-made clothes and household linen) reached, according to the quota system, about 535 million dollars in 2003 out of 1.37 billion dollars worth of Egypt's total exports, i.e. more than half the value of exports.
NEW BANKS RAISE INTEREST RATES!
The bank also raised interest rates on three, four and five year-term saving certificates with cumulative interest to 12% cashed at the end of each certificate term. A few days ago, the bank obtained the approval of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) of the issuance of that certificate. It was then approved by CBE board of directors in its last meeting and notified its branches of putting it into effect as of tomorrow (September 1st).
She pointed out that the bank currently owns another 5-year term certificate with a monthly interest rate of 10.25%. On the other hand, Al-Alam Al-Youm, learnt that there are other several other banks which are about to raise their interest rates on some of their savings coffers especially saving certificates after getting the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) approval.
For her part, Shahinaz pointed out that there should be no link between the low Interbank rates and the rise in internet rates on saving certificates emphasizing that the market was "not merely saving certificates", but an integrated system controlled by the cost of funds with each bank.
EGYPT'S SHARE OF INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL FLOWS DOWN 48%
Some Islamic countries have cash surplus estimated at $1 trillion invested in Western countries while inter-Arab investments reached only 10%, Omar noted. Egypt has a chance to increase its quota of international capital flows through offering guarantees to investors via a third international party, carrying out items of contracts concluded with domestic companies, reforming the monetary system regarding exchange rates, putting an end to corruption to reduce illegal expenses and bringing to an end all harmful practices of competition such as monopoly.
DELTA INTERNATIONAL BANK RAISES INTEREST RATE TO 12.25%
Detla International Bank certificates term hit three years at annual revenue cashed every three months. Under the guarantee of the certificates a loan amounting to 90% of their value is allowable.
He pointed out that the contribution of Gas De France to the gas sector was not confined to the 5% represented by that deal. He emphasized the company's intention to develop its contribution to the Egyptian gas sector so that it would cover not only getting Egyptian gas and exporting it abroad but also achieving other goals like the transfer of technology employed in that sector as well as training labour and other investment aspects which can be activated in that sector.
Regarding the countries which show the highest demand for buying Egyptian gas, besides France, he places America, Italy and Spain in the forefront of the countries expected to conclude future deals in the field of Egyptian gas exports.
She pointed out that preparations were underway for the second stage Train-2 and regarding the possibility of Egyptian banks contributing to the gas projects, Delta International Bank Board Chairman Ali Negm says that gas projects are giant ones that need syndicated loans contributed to by more than one bank.
Fayed pointed out that banks' demand for contributing to financing gas projects was also attributed to the fact that the rate of credit risks were reasonable in financing that industry.
In cooperation with a group of Egyptian investors, Egyptian and foreign banks are considering heading for the Libyan market to invest in it in a few days' time.
United Bank of Egypt board chairman, Hassan Hussein who doubles as Managing Director uncovered that a delegation of Egyptian businessmen and investors would visit the Libyan capital Tripoli next October. The delegation comprises a group of investors in cement, real estate development, contracting and petroleum. He pointed out that the Libyan party took interest in Egyptian contribution to development and investment.
He emphasized that the Egyptian banks opting for the Libyan market had its effects on investors' milieus concerned with investment in Arab countries. Some companies had expressed willingness to contribute to projects, which are economically feasible.
He highlighted the importance of the Egyptian banks in the Libyan market for the evaluation, study and marketing of projects.
He announced intentions to expand in the Libyan market through opening a new branch for the bank where the Libyan government would contribute about 24% of the capital.
Among these banks are Suez Canal Bank, a private bank, other investment banks, in addition to two state-owned banks, the National Bank of Egypt (NBE) and Banque Misr.
While the banks that launched new saving coffers monitored a remarkable demand for them, confirming intentions to expand investment in the sectors of natural gas, fertilizers, energy, information technology and communications, most other banks showed reservations concerning such a step ruling out the possibility of following suit, but admitting, in the meantime, to its state of bewilderment and wait in light of the ambiguity regarding interest rate orientations. This meaning has been emphasized by board chairman of Misr-Iran Bank and former CBE governor Ismail Hassan when he said that due to ambiguity of the interest rate situation, a sound credit and investment decision is rather difficult to take. While the CBE is giving indices of price stability, the Ministry of Finance is raising the interest rate on treasury bonds and sometimes the reverse takes place. He pointed out that the state of fluctuation and contradiction extended to all the banking sector's units as some banks have recently tended to reduce interest rates in an attempt to reduce the cost of its funds and avoid bearing the burdens ensuing from the high liquidity rate.
For her part, CIB managing director Sahar Al Sallab expected such a step. She expected that interest rates whether in public or private banks would witness more or less general rises in accordance with the prices of treasury bonds put forward by the Ministry of Finance. She pointed out that the CIB resorted to moving its interest rates by .05% in a bid to better employment of its available liquidity and to create a balance between investment in treasury bonds and granting distinguished interest rates to clients. She supposed that such a step would help borrowers cope with a similar increase in lending rates.

$488.9 MILLION FREE ZONES EXPORTS
A government official revealed a sharp retreat in the Egyptian cotton exports during the season that ended on August 29.
Cotton exports were high in the last season due to the availability of huge quantities of cotton with companies over the previous years as well as the low cotton supply on international markets, especially after the weakness of the Indian cotton crop.
This indicates a rise in the steady trade balance deficit to reach LE5.403 billion as a differential between imports worth $12.807 billion and exports to the value of $7.404 billion.
Despite the rise in the exports of some commodities, the value of many of them after the rise remained limited. The value of peanuts exports reached $1.2 million in the 9 months; dried onion, $1.4 million; preserved and dried vegetables, $1.7 million; potatoes, $3.8 million; medical herbs, $4 million; aromatic oils $5.1 million and
In press statements made yesterday Turkish Foreign Minister, Abdullah Gul said that Cairo admitted to the ownership of the shipment, but he declined to give any further details.
US ADMINISTRATION UNDERSTANDS MUBARAK'S APOLOGY FOR NOT ATTENDING G-8 SUMMIT
President Bush understands that Mubarak, who paid a recent visit to the US and explained his vision of reform and development in the region, found out that there was no need to cover such a long distance just to attend the summit for a few hours, he said.
Political circles in Egypt speak of three trends in the ruling circle with regard to the issue of reform.
A third in-between trend sees that reform should be carried out gradually in order to preserve stability.
In a related development, public figures launched endeavours to form a forum entitled "Brethren of Purity" for setting proposals meant to help achieve political reform.
EGYPTIAN SOURCE DENIES GIVING ISRAEL GUARANTEES AT EXPENSE OF PALESTINIANS
"We seek to enable the PA to turn into a government that is active in all fields," he noted.
Asked about reports that Egypt calls for taking away security competence from Arafat, the source said, "We asked Arafat to abandon control over security affairs and be content with being a historic, honest and patriotic struggler like African leader Nelson Mandela.
Progress in security affairs is not carried out away from other issues. The source, however, did not deny reports about an amendment of Camp David Accords, saying this issue is referred to security and defence competence. He pointed out that the talks with Shalom would be concentrated on political issues.
Muslim Brotherhood lawyer Abdel Monein Abdel Maksoud said that the State Security Prosecution would investigate reports received from the public prosecutor's office regarding the circumstances of Al-Zuheiri's death as a result of injuries due to hits against the bus sides while being transported from the investigation quarters to prison. He was not sent to any hospital for treatment and therefore met his end.
Kram Zuheiri. The bloc member Hamdi Hassan asked that the People's Assembly committee on Defence and Security which started to investigate the case should turn into a fact-finding committee in a bid to be granted extensive powers for revealing the secrets of the case after one of the defendants died.
NEW ELECTION BILL IN EGYPT COMBINES INDIVIDUAL AND SLATE SYSTEMS
The new bill provides that candidates should not be allowed to contest the elections in individual constituencies and party slates.
The bill will also take care not to disrupt the Independents' representation percent to avoid contravening Egyptian Constitution provisions and forestall attempts to lie in waiting for the law and to challenge its constitutionality and to avoid wasting the new election system.
To justify this point of view, the source said that 24.2 million voters are registered in the electorate's tables out of which only 5 million and 656 thousand participating in the 2000 parliamentary elections that the turnout rate reached only 24.5%.
Tourism Minister Mamdouh Al-Beltagui said, in a press statement yesterday (11th June), that Egypt would not receive any Iranian tourist groups till full resumption of political relations between Egypt and Iran.
Cairo and Tehran concluded early last year an agreement that stipulated forming a committee of members from both the Egyptian and Iranian chambers of commerce to consider cooperation between them.
He described the spate of names recently circulated by Egyptian newspapers as "mere speculations which are groundless". He warned against who pretended to be close to decision-making circles.
Party and independent newspapers mentioned names as candidates for high ranking positions as well as other names of ministers expected to be deposed.
He added that the dialogue which was started by the NDP with legitimate parties and opposition forces would continue with a view to exchanging ideas and visions and defining political reform needs and priorities.
There are also a large number of Egyptian irrigation experts in the World Bank," he added.
Hassan said that the family was surprised when it received his corpse in a black bag holding number 1909 with a certificate identifying the cause of death as " a hit on the head".
The medical examiner entrusted by the family to examine the corpse said that his skull was broken and he had injuries above his left eye. The reason for death, he added, is a sudden hit on the back of his head.
OPPOSITION PARTIES FAIL TO AGREE ON A "UNIFIED" REFORM PAPER
Parties lost hope of any progress in dialogue with the government despite several attempts exerted by party leaders to resume dialogue with the ruling party, which started in November last and then stopped unjustifiably without any indicators of a near resumption, they pointed out.
There have been much talk about "reshuffle" these days. Many Egyptians who wait for this reshuffle hope that government key figures and opposition leaders should retire at a younger age.
Shura Council Speaker Dr. Mustafa Kamal Helmi, who runs the mid-term elections, is over 80 years old. Muslim Brotherhood guide Mohamed Mahdi Akef also approaches the age of 80.
The second request was made by Abul-Ela Madi (46) who dissented from the Muslim Brotherhood to establish Al-Wasat Al-Gadid (New Center) Party. The third request was made by MP Ayman Nour to found Al-Ghad (Tomorrow) Party after a long battle with Al-Wafd Party and his leader No'man Gomaa (70).
Ebeid is not the oldest among his government members, as Minister of Justice Counselor Farouk Seif Al-Nasr was born in 1922 and Minister of Agriculture Dr. Youssef Wali was born in 1930.
Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Kamal Al-Shazli was born in 1934. The year 1935 witnessed the birth of three ministers; Defence Minister Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher and Minister of Public Works and Water Resources Dr. Mahmoud Abu-Zeid.
Minister of Civil Aviation Ahmed Shafiq was born in 1941.
3 MPs PREPARE FIRST LAW TO HIKE TAXES ON THE AFFLUENT
The proposed draft law imposes 10-15% charges on private airplanes when they are bought for the first time, according to their occupancy and engines, in addition to 20% as sales tax. The MPs point out that their draft law includes special articles for private airplanes when they are overhauled or when their licences are renewed. That should be, at least, on annual basis, in addition to charges paid in the Egyptian pound and hard currency for every domestic and outer flight respectively.
The three MPs were keen on clarify that this draft law is not against investors or the affluent or out of grudge against them, but rather aims to achieve equality.
The two leading figures announced the formation of a new party called Al-Wafd Democratic Party.
Ashennawi emphasized that the idea of forming the Egyptian Democratic Party had struck them a year before due to absence of democracy in the current Wafd Party.
The new party's platform stresses the principles of democracy, dialogue, enforcing the constitution that was compiled in 1955 but was turned down by late president Nasser, Ashennawi said, adding that the new party pays attention to freedom and social responsibility in a way that copes with the new developments.
The deputy added that the book described social customs in Egypt as strict in bringing up and dealing with girls and granting them a lower status than boys.
The Egyptian, then, approvingly says, "You are right! However, we got used to this and do not mind those matters any more!
However, in Egypt I'm sometimes haunted by a sense of inferiority to my three brothers who have more rights than I do. Permitted space are much wider to them and their rights by far exceed ours. I also mean that parents prefer males to females, which makes me feel dissatisfied."
In an urgent quest for notification to Prime Minister Atef Ebeid under the title "12 million Egyptians live in the open air," MP Mohamed Al-Morsi stressed that about 60 percent of the Egyptians were under the poverty line, bearing the brunt of unemployment and price hikes.
CHURCH DELEGATION VISITS FAMILY OF EGYPTIAN HOSTAGE IN IRAQ
Higoumen Makari Ibrahim, pastor of the Church of Anba Antonios in the Village of Abu Shush also prayed that Victor would get back home safely.
"Such a number of corruption incidents in the Ministry of Agriculture are big enough for not only the Minister of Agriculture but also the government to resign or be sacked," Hassan said.
Wali alleged that the technical office manager was not his advisor when was arrested.
MINISTER: 38 MONUMENTS MAY HAVE DISAPPEARED NOT STOLEN
"Such monuments include 36 gold bracelets, two gold rings dating back to the Roman age, which were discovered in 1905 in Kom Ombo, said chairman of the Supreme Council of Antiquities Dr. Zahi Hawas.
More than 20 million pounds are spent by Egyptians on the mobile phone service, the study emphasized, pointing out that 2 out of even 5 youths have mobiles.
48 MILLION POOR PEOPLE IN EGYPT: OFFICIAL STUDIES AND REPORTS
The report, compiled by Dr. Ibrahim Solyman, an economic advisor to the Ministry of Supply and Domestic Trade, indicated a sharp rise in food commodity prices. Spending on food and drinks hit 61 percent of people's income. Spending in border provinces on food and drink reached 62.5 percent of annual expenditure against 61 percent in Upper Egypt and 59 percent in Lower Egypt. A study carried by a British paper said the number of the poor in Egypt is rising and the problem of poverty is structural, rather than temporary.
Some 1.5 million poor people live at the graveyards of Basatin, Tunsi, al-Imam al-Shafaie, Bab al-Wazir, al-Ghafir, al-Megawrin, al-Imam al-Lithy, Ein Shams, Nasr City and Misr al-Gadida, the report said. They mostly suffer from anaemia and chest and skin diseases. Lawbreakers use graveyards to carry out their crimes.
He wondered "Where do low-cost housing units go?
"I LOVE THE CINEMA" FILM NOT TO BE SHOWN TILL REVIEWED BY COPTIC CHURCH
The film producer Isaad Younis had set next Wednesday to premiere the film whose propaganda started but Censorship director Dr. Madkour Thabet asked her to wait till having the approval of censorship.
He noted that the cost of Sharm El Sheikh's station capacity stood at 8,000 cmd at a cost of LE80.5 million while Dahab's station stood at 5,000 cmd at a total cost of LE64 million, Nuweiba's station; 5,000 cmd and a cost of LE45 million, Taba's station; 7,000 cmd and a cost of LE88 million.
Thanks to such permits signed by the minister of economy for a company owned by brother of Urban Affairs Minister and others, the Israeli government could overcome the problem of in bulk cement shortage required for building the wall. Israel could thus get round the ban imposed by Egypt on exporting cement to Israel.
Blenski, then, founded a company of his own to transport in bulk cement from the factory to Al Oga pathway "Natsiona" to be transported afterwards by another company of his from Al Oga pathway to Israel. To achieve that, he opened an office for him in Al Muhandessein district in Cairo. Following Al Arabi reports, Egyptian security bodies had to interfere and urged Beni Suif factory to wriggle out of the agreement and stop supplying Israeli companies with Egyptian cement. This forced Blenski to resort to Palestinian companies to complete the Egyptian cement imports.
According to a message submitted to president Yassir Arafat by Garad Al Qudwa, head of the Public Central Authority, some of the permits granted to Al Terifi Company had been signed by the Ministry of Economy at the name of Urban Affairs Minister, Gamil Al Terifi.
NCHR would make recommendations providing for compensating the families of the persons who died in Egyptian prisons due to torture.
He said that he would be the only one who would be responsible for delivering statements to avoid any press misconceptions that distort the council work.
The abrogation of emergency law is one of the council main requests in addition to some other causes related to prisoners of conscience.
POLITICAL REFORM ISSUE TO BE DISCUSSED IN PA
Egypt flatly refuses any reform that is not homegrown, Al-Shazli declared.
An Israeli radioactive fertilizer consignment was released in Damietta Port and an employee of the port discovered the crisis incidentally.
Al-Da'da' warned that those fertilizers were strongly reported to have been produced in Israel.
For his part Ministry of Agriculture representative Dr. Khalil Al-Maleky denied having any Israeli fertilizers registered in Egyptian ports.
Many control reports have revealed attempts by some suspicious companies to bring to Egypt Israeli radioactively contaminated commodities and Latin American medical appliances that do not meet specifications.
The report uncovers that the port authority deals with Israeli ships for transporting Egyptian imports. Thus, the role of the Egyptian commercial fleet in transporting these imports has retreated. Meanwhile foreign ships transported 96.7% or 3.2 million tons of these imports April last.
IRRIGATION MINISTER: NO FEAR REGARDING OUR QUOTA IN NILE WATER
Israel has presence in Nile Basin countries but it is not the sole one, he said, pointing out that there are other countries such as South Africa. Israeli experts working at Nile Basin countries do not work on any projects pertaining to Egypt's quota in the Nile water rather they are working in sewage and drinking water field, he said.
Negotiations are currently underway with Nile Basin countries under the umbrella of the Nile Basin countries initiative, which aims at setting a general scheme with a view to benefiting from water resources in favour of all countries without doing harm to any country's interests, he said.
In order that we may believe Israel and trust it, it should sincerely advocate the principles of justice, human rights, freedom and international legitimacy.
Nobody would certainly believe that the killer's conscience has suddenly awoken after his hands were stained with the blood of Palestinians and Israelis alike so that his imperialistic policy in the Palestinian lands could be consecrated. Nobody would believe in such an awakening of conscience that would make him decide all of a sudden to support Palestinians' right to restore their control and sovereignty over part of their natural lands.
On the other hand, I hope that genuine peace will be the goal of the visit of Sharon's envoy Israeli foreign minister Silvan Shalom to Cairo.
"We've asked him to abandon control over security bodies and become, like the South African leader Nelson Mandela, an honourable patriotic leader of high weight and remarkable position. We've tried to persuade him of this, the source added, noting that this is not an easy matter for Arafat.
ARAFAT MAY BE DEPOSED POLITICALLY
Palestinian Presdient Yasser Arafat promised Egyptian intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Omar Solayman to announce the name of the official to be in charge of Palestinian security bodies on June 15th, a date set by Egypt to receive Arafat's reply regarding security reforms, an Egyptian source told Asharq Al-Awsat.
ISRAEL COMMITTED NOT TO BOMBARD GAZA ONCE EGYPTIANS ARRIVE
Agreement was reached on a series of measures to rejuvenate bilateral relations between Cairo and Tel Aviv after two months of talks, which culminated in Israeli FM Silvan Shalom's recent visit to Cairo on Monday.
Moreover, it would also send 120 to 130 soldiers to boost the military force stationed on the Egyptian side of the borders to put pressure on smugglers.
In the context of efforts exerted by Egypt to provide a congenial atmosphere for a genuine Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, President Hosni Mubarak met with Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom here Monday morning. In the meeting, the Israeli minister briefed Mubarak on the revised disengagement plan and the Israeli government's initial approval of it on Sunday. They also discussed an Egyptian initiative that envisions an Israeli pullout from Gaza as well as stopping the Israeli incursions into Palestinian territories.
Al-Baz responded immediately and irrefutably by saying that Egypt has not made any decision to play a key role in the region as it has already been playing this role for over 6,000 years. It is important to meet all parties' needs to maintain peace, stability and security in the region, he said.
EGYPT'S GAZA AND PALESTINE'S GAZA
The reason is that Egypt--like Israel-- wants to know to whom Gaza would be handed over.
Therefore, the issue of power handover in Gaza was assigned to Egypt's security man Omar Solayman on the grounds that the whole issue is security.
Yediot Aharonot newspaper said that Solayman was cruel with a prisoner held in a 158-square-meter dock.
The idea is not new nor has it emerged in Egypt.
Rule in South Africa also turned into a real democracy without racial discrimination.
ISRAEL DEVELOPS CRUISE MISSILE TO BE LAUNCHED FROM LAND
According to a report by Jane's Defence Weekly quoting a military source the new missile is developed form of the Israeli made Dalila cruise missile launched from fighters.
The cruise missile is small with high destructive ability. It is also able to fly at such low heights that it almost touches the ground, thus rendering radars unable to detect it.
Now that Israel is able to produce cruise missiles to be launched from land launchers, the development of submarine cruise missiles would be a matter of time. Thus, it would have the ability to turn around its enemies or hit remote targets such as Iran or Pakistan without the need to use planes.
It is noteworthy that the announcement of this Israeli missile was made a few days after Iran had announced the development of Phantom anti-warship cruise missile which could not be detected by radars.
HAMAS: EGYPT'S INITIATIVE DIMINISHED ITS REGIONAL AND NATIONAL ROLE
Al-Zahar added that the current picture about the Egyptian security role in Gaza is not rosy.
It would be better for the Egyptian security forces to train a national army, and it would be one thousand times better for the Egyptian forces to come to Palestine after ending occupation, Al-Zahar added.
As for the relations between Hamas and the Palestinian security bodies, Al-Zahar said that it is severed. "Our relations with the current Palestinian Authority is like those of the Palestinian Authority with all factions. We are looking forward to elections that would form the shape of the government rather than the Palestinian Authority."
Well- informed source with a big American company in Iraq told Al-Hayat that Iraqi Ministry of Agriculture study strategic projects with huge American companies for setting up dams.
The size of each dam would be similar to the size of Ataturk Dam in Turkey which is considered one of the biggest dams in the Middle East region.
He pointed out that the construction of dams in Baghdad would play a role in landscaping the city and developing tourism in the Iraqi capital.
-Badr legion: the military wing of the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution, founded by Ayatollah Mohamed Baker al-Hakim, who was assassinated in Nagaf in a bomb car blast last year.
-Da'wa (Call) Party: it is one of the oldest Shiite political movements which fought the former ruling regime. It had no regular military force or militias, but its organizations used to launch armed operations against Baath Party buildings or barracks, and assassinated Baath officials.
The movement became active in the 1980s and was officially headquartered in the Jordanian capital of Amman in mid-1980.
-Iraq's Hezbollah: a Shiite movement that emerged following the Iraq Liberation War. It had not known before that. It is reportedly connected with Lebanon's Hezbollah and supported by Iranian groups, things which are dismissed by the Iraqi group.
In an official report handed over yesterday be Syrian Foreign Ministry to the UN fact-finding committee under former Sri Lankan ambassador, the Syrian government said that the Israeli practices are not only harmful but also dangerous. Experts warned that the "danger" of such waste lies in its lifespan which ranges from 30 to 50 years when glass or cement containers start to crack thus leaking the depleted uranium substance which have disastrous effects.
The report also indicated "provocative steps" earlier this year through announcing "the expansion of settlement in Syrian Golan and doubling the number of settlers there to hit 15 thousands in 3 years' time, as well as confiscating all the "endowment" lands at Misida village on February 28th to build 9 new settlement units.
Sheikh Habash voiced hope that President Assad would shortly pass an amnesty allowing those oppositionist Islamists to return home and exercise their role in the country's construction. He pointed out that some trends in the country introduce themselves as oppositionists, which makes the Syrian scene need re-reading so that all parties would see themselves as invited to contributing to the country's construction. He pointed out that a famous statement was recently issued by the Arab Socialist Baath party leadership, which opens the door to efficient cadres regardless of their party affiliations.
He added that the existent challenges force the advocates of the national project to converge and close up ranks in a bid to preserve religious and nationalist constants appreciating what democratic reforms and procedural developments had been achieved in Syria like the cancellation of courts martial, redeeming respect to civil judiciary and lifting all restrictions on citizens' leaving the country even though such a step used to require complicated procedures. In parallel to this, six Islamic trend detainees were released out of 27 who were arrested last April in Al-Uteiba town to the East of Damascus.
"The new constitution will be published in the official gazette after one year of issuance, within which constitutional institutions would be finalized and necessary legal measures taken," he added. The step marks a new stage, which would witness the introduction of new laws to implement the 150-article constitution.
Qatar amended its 1970 transitional constitution in 1972 before it endorses its 2004 permanent one.
The countries concerned would abide by using optimal administrative practices to boost the efficiency of their water systems and create a real culture to run water institutions and users' demand for water.
Jordan is optimistic that the execution of the project will provide it with some 850 million cubic metres of drinking water on an annual basis, in addition to 550 megawatts of electricity due to the difference in the two seas levels.
The Saudi Cabinet under King Fahd bin Abdel-Aziz agreed on Monday on a draft project for merging Saudi exchange firms into one company and taking the measures required for such amalgamation, including licensing the establishment of a joint stock company for such a purpose provided that the company's capital be 3 billion Saudi riyals (800 million dollars). The company's capital will be put up in 60 million nominal shares at a value of 50 riyals (13.3 dollars) each. Half such shares will be put up for public subscription over 30 days starting from the date of publishing the royal decree licencing the establishment of the company. Half the new company's shares will be allocated to company owners and exchange firm shareholders.
In an unprecedented step to test to what extent such decisions would be implemented, a Saudi female company signed a contract with two Chinese and Malaysian companies to have the first industrial city for women in the Saudi city of Jeddah established including 83 plants. The contract is worth 375 million Saudi riyals. The project will start with Asian female labour. It will also provide 10,000 job opportunities for Saudi females in such factories, which will include weaving, sewing and different professions practised by women.
The document stressed the necessity of going on in development of educational curricula.
Modernization should be "homegrown", along with getting prepared for adopting successful human tests, said the declaration.
In a press conference, Arab ministers were criticized for inviting the US ambassador.
If we look deeper into this issue, we will not find any real contradiction between American-European projects as they appeared in their latest form and those which claim to be Arab-oriented where reform is concerned.
Do foreign governments actually suggest detailed reform programs that are so strict as to deny Arab governments any margin within which they could protect the interests of the countries and communities they rule?
Washington is not asking anybody to step down from their positions of power and leave the arena to others who are more deserving of public office and will serve their countries and be more protective of public interest; it is asking the same governments - governments that the United States itself had given a free hand to deal with their peoples at their whim and had ignored their violations for six decades, to quote the American President - to reconsider their policies and correct the course of their ruling regimes that have been based on complete enslavement of their people where political practice is concerned and complete domination and suffocation of citizens with martial law to the extent where the concepts of freedom, equality and law, with which no community can survive, are almost nonexistent.
Even where political reform is concerned, the United States is asking for no more than minor political adjustments that can by no means rise to the level of establishing real democratic systems. If the situation had been otherwise, the United States and European countries would not have talked about reform, for reform is not part of their jurisdiction, nor are they required to enforce it.
They believe that such minor political reforms, which, according to the American initiative, aim at broadening the popular base of closed ruling regimes and giving access to political participation to some members of the middle class, do not threaten Arab ruling regimes but will rather give them more strength in the face of the fierce anger of their peoples, which have expressed themselves in the upheaval that took the form of extremist Islamic movements a couple of decades ago and are now showing their anger with sporadic popular uprisings that could develop into a general explosion in the future.
Their concerns are particularly attributed to the fact that the USA's imports of Egyptian products of this sector (yarn, textile, ready-made clothes and household linen) reached, according to the quota system, about 535 million dollars in 2003 out of 1.37 billion dollars worth of Egypt's total exports, i.e. more than half the value of exports.

It is Sharon who asked for an Egyptian security role in Gaza through several messages he sent to Egypt. Although he can not deny this, it seems that he wants such a role be subject to his conditions, the source said.
The source, however, stressed that Egypt would not send security experts unless there were sufficient Israeli and Palestinian guarantees. Egypt's interference and sending experts to train cadres will be for the advantage of the Palestinians, he said. Egypt can amend the Peace Accord with the Israelis and deploy forces on the Egyptian-Palestinian border to avoid problems and allegations aiming to belittle Egypt's historical role that supports the Palestinian cause, he pointed out.

But, I will not allow Egypt to play the role of mediator between us and the Palestinians or to hold direct or indirect negotiations with the Palestinian Authority (PA), as this is connected to the fact that the disengagement plan is unilateral rather than bilateral, and undermines the bases of the roadmap which stipulates halting negotiations with the Palestinians unless they fight terrorism."
Meanwhile, Mofaz said that it is premature to determine the Egyptian role and the extent of the Palestinian cooperation to execute the disengagement plan. "I think that Egypt has good intentions that would eventually be tested through results," Mofaz added.
Egypt is against Israeli presence on its borders with Gaza, he told reporters in reference to Israel's alleged plan to dig a trench on the borders between Egypt and Gaza.
EREKAT: EGYPT WON'T ALLOW ISRAEL TO DIG CANAL ALONG BORDERS
Not only did Sharon's government build the colonialist racist wall which did both material and moral harm to the Palestinians under occupation, subjecting them as a group to living conditions meant to inflict total or partial material ruin on them, thus constructing two forms of genocide referred to in a certain article of the agreement of combating genocide for the year 1948, but it also recently started to invite bids from construction companies for the construction of a water ditch along the Palestinian-Egyptian borders, beginning with 4 kilometers in length and 15-25 meters in depth under the pretext of preventing the passage of weapons through tunnels to Palestinian activists.

The Ministry continued issuing new import permits to the same companies. The PLC report brought the file of PNA corruption to the surface once again especially as the committee report cast suspicion on some officials in the authority.
Egypt demanded the Palestinian National Authority's (PNA) approval to this role.
Even the PNA that gave an overt agreement also has its own considerations not against Egypt but because in every stage it wants to be aware of the next one, as its experiment with the Israelis, since Oslo, only raised doubts in addition to the fact that Sharon and his gang do not recognize the Palestinian party.
Even those who want to hold posts and those who are encouraged by the American-Israeli backing have become aware that they have fallen into a trap and that they can not take any action without being legitimized by their people.
Cairo, which does not trust Sharon, was not, however, enthusiastic about the idea even after the Americans had request and after the Europeans had shown their support of Egypt involvement.
Actually, everybody is currently moving, regionally and internationally, in a margin drawn up by Sharon via his withdrawal plan from Gaza Strip.
To have a successful Egyptian role, Sharon's gang should give up most of their current policies, so that withdrawal from Gaza Strip would be a real advance towards negotiation over the final status.
Unless there is an explicit intention of negotiation, the Egyptian role would, then, be an involvement and may be used to cover up for what the Egyptians do not want to be covered.
Some US officials lately alleged that Syria did not respond seriously to the US demand to close its borders with Iraq in order to prevent foreign fighters from passing into Iraq, the daily said. The US President George W. Bush's decision to impose sanctions on Damascus did not achieve the aim behind it. In addition to Hizbullah elements whom it allows access to Iraq, Syria provides a crossing to pro-Iran and Al-Qaeda foreign fighters, Haaretz concluded.
It was clear that Arabs preparedness to co-exist with Saddam Hussein's regime, to the extent of collusion with him in some cases, has not left a big room for them to maneuver after its fall.
The Arabs themselves, to the contrary, tried over the recent years to rehabilitate the US-besieged Iraqi regime. For example, they aborted the US-proposed "smart sanctions" draft resolution at the UN before 11/9 terrorist attacks.
In Kurdistan, Israel has found its natural place. It is now plotting against the Arab-Sunni coalition that is trying to abort the American project. However, the Arab-Sunni alliance has no political tools except for beseeching Washington and supporting the "Iraqi resistance" seen by many as acts of terrorism!
What is so surprising is that no Arab official has visited sisterly Iraq, which is attributed to two main reasons: first, the Arabs are not enthusiastic about dealing with Saddam's successors.
"The Kurds want a complete sovereign role in the security process that will be carried out by Allawi's government," the source added.
Saleh was absent from a press conference held by Allawi on Sunday, an indicator to differences between them over the security strategy of Iraq.
At the beginning of a press conference held yesterday (20th June) Iraqi Premier Dr Iyad Allawi avoided replying to a question by Al-Hayat on the banks where the deposed Iraqi president Saddam Hussein had deposited 40 billion dollars.
FIRST US STATISTIC OF US INVASION: 11,000 IRAQI PEOPLE KILLED, 40,000 OTHERS INJURED
Most of them were killed after Bush announced that major military operations were over early May 2003, hitting 693 out of a total of 952.
MUSLIM CLERGYMEN CONDEMN KILLING FOREIGNERS IN S. ARABIA, IRAQ
Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar Dr. Mohamed Sayed Tantawi said, "Al-Azhar was the first religious institution worldwide to condemn the September 11th incidents, as they caused the death of a big number of people while they were doing their jobs." Upon receiving an American delegation of the Middle East Studies Centre, Tantawi voiced his refusal of all forms of extremism, which constitute aggression against the other, whether the perpetrator were a Muslim or non-Muslim. Clarifying Al-Azhar's stance towards the Palestinian cause, he said, "He who defends his land, dignity and rights is not an extremist or aggressor." Meanwhile, he confirmed that he rejected the acts of "those who blow up themselves among civilian men, women and children who have nothing to do with war".
A report by the Arab Labour Organization warned against the rise in the unemployment rate in Gulf States to 18% and the rise in imported labour to 8.1 million workers constituting almost third of the population. The working force rate among citizens, therefore, does not exceed 38%. The report urged all Gulf States to expand in the policies of nationalizing jobs, replacing imported labour by national labour, setting firm restrictions on the recruitment of foreigners and the imposition of high duties on work and stay permits and granting further facilities for the implementation of rationalization policies and the foundation of special funds for supporting the employment of youth and increasing employment bureaus activities and upgrading information available about the work market.
Such a step certainly came in response to American pressures for over a year that culminated in two visits to the region's capitals made by Colin Powell in the autumn and William Burns in the spring. It is part of Washington's attempts to integrate the two countries with other Arab countries into the NATO without giving them membership. They, therefore, can be assigned flexible missions unlike the NATO's missions during the cold war.
The two capitals see the track to be launched at the beginning of next month as a step on the road to ending occupation and the emergence of an elected government at the beginning of 2006. They, therefore, think that absence from the Iraqi arena in these difficult circumstances constitutes both a political error and ethical remissness at one and the same time, thus ignoring the possible internal and regional implications that such an approach might create and betting on a track which might not lead to the emergence of an independent rule acceptable to the Iraqis.
Moroccan public opinion, on the other hand, which cherishes such special emotions towards Iraq that the current developments might move it even more than the internal position does, would not understand the motives of such a step and would express strong opposition to it.
Political milieus in Abu Dhabi said that Israel had reiterated such unfounded allegations two years before.
Following the war on Iraq, Israel feels that Arab enmity against it is rising and there is a change in the strategic milieu in the Middle East, which the Foreign Minister is exerting great efforts to exploit through dispatching envoys and messages to some Arab countries to explain the Israeli stance.
An apparent improvement in relations has also occurred recently with Sudan. Contacts between the two parties were carried out through Jewish businessmen.
In a Congress session last week, he said, "Cairo continues increasing its military capabilities although there are no real threats against it." Past experiences pointed out that boosting these capabilities was usually connected with waging war on Israel, he alleged.
Such aid is American official commitments according to Egyptian-Israeli peace accordS, the sources said, adding that this aid is beneficial for the American as well as the Egyptian party's interests.
Discussions of the US Senate Foreign Relations Commission showed a US plan to put more political restrictions on economic aid to Egypt, linking it to political and democratic reforms and power-sharing in Egypt.
He also called for exerting more pressure on the Egyptian administration.
The US administration should focus in its talks with Egyptian officials on problems set by the Egyptians themselves, including abolishing the emergency law, reviewing the law on the formation of political parties, regulating NGOs' activities, forming election supervision agencies and amending the constitution in a way that may lead to directly electing the president of the republic, setting the number of years of his terms in office and re-sharing and redistributing power.
Director of the Cultural Planning Centre in Libya Abdennabi Abu-Ghaniya denied any differences between his country and the United States over curricula. Cooperation between Washington and Tripoli will be completed by opening a Libyan embassy in Washington in a few months' time, Abu-Ghaniya said.
The project aims, according to the Deputy Manager of the U.S. Department of State's Cultural Center, to restore communication with Libyan universities.
During the last period banks refused point blank to finance software companies operative in designing websites. The banks ascribed their refusal to increase in the risk level of funding those companies' projects due to the unavailability of feasibility studies and uncertainty regarding their profitability.
For his part, Credit Manager with Bank of Alexandria, Ihab Al-Beltagui stressed that the banks refused to fund those companies because of the high cost of protecting the Internet from penetration of hackers. The banks' contribution to or participation in the companies' projects is better than funding them.
Saweris told Al-Alam Al-Youm daily that his share in the bank became zero after the amalgamation decision.
Many Egyptian, Arab and international banks vied with each others to purchase an Egyptian bank that was put up for sale within the framework of the state's plan to sell the four public banks' shares in a number of banks and companies. As for Misr America International Bank, there is increasing interest from International Arab African Bank in purchasing its shares whose nominal value estimated at 100 million pounds. Lebanese Auda and Emirian National Union banks are vying for Cairo Far East Bank. Meanwhile, PNB Paribas Bank offered to purchase Banque du Caire's share in Cairo PNB Paribas Bank.
The major French Bank BNP Paribas offered to purchase the Banque du Caire's share in the Cairo BNP Paribas Bank which hit 12% of the banks paid in capital, which hit 26 million dollars or 161.2 million pounds.
In the last year, the Cairo BNP Paribas Bank had increased it's paid in capital while the French bank subscribed to all the shares so the Banque du Caire's share in the bank declined from 24% to 12% only.
At the forefront of those banks is "Awda" famous bank in Lebanon and the Emirian National Union Bank (ENUB).
A number of banks were put up for sale in the framework of the privatization program at the forefront of which is the Cairo Far East Bank and Misr America International Bank.
He also criticized the automobile industry in Egypt.
73% OF EGYPTIANS UNAWARE OF QIZ
The World Investment Report of 2004 uncovered that foreign investment inflows into Egypt slipped from 600 million dollars in 2003 to 400 million dollars 2004.
MINISTER OF PLANNING: FOREIGN FINANCE IN STATE PLAN HITS 9%
Investments of state-owned projects, economic authorities and public companies amount to 29.4 billion pounds, Othman told Al-Wafd.
He added that the value of those exports were estimated at 225,000 dollars (LE1.4 million). Imports included France, America and Australia. He attributed that to the approach of Christmas and the New Year festivals.
He pointed out that kept up export opportunities of the Egyptian rice this year are lower than those in the last season due to the decline of the price of the American rice of medium and small seeds, the same kind as that of the Egyptian exported rice, by 60% in comparison to the last year. Moreover, the American rice output had gone up by 40%. The price of the American was always higher than that of the Egyptian rice during the last 10 years, he added.
Chairman of the CCAC, Dr. Usama Khaireddin stressed the importance of determining the quantities to be exported every season in order to avoid underselling. He also called for the adoption of a comprehensive vision, as the decrease of the supply of rice would push rice prices up, so the producer, the farmer and the public sector should take part in working out such a vision.
GAMAL MUBARAK: FRESH POLICIES TO ENCOURAGE INVESTMENTS
The new economic system, which is meant to alleviate burdens shouldered by dealers in different economic activities, is based on an explicit philosophy where the government no longer collects a large amount of the society's income, he pointed out. The resources that are left by the government to the banks, companies and individuals will not be wasted, as this reflects the NDP confidence in their capability of running economy efficiently, which would boost such resources many times as much as they are.
GOVERNMENT TO SELL A PUBLIC BANK
Banking sources uncovered that the announcement that 6 smaller banks were merged came after such banks failed to increase their capital to LE500 million according to the new Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) law. The CBE refused to extend the period of grace granted to such banks due to lack of seriousness to increase their capital.
The sources said that the government refused to liquidate such banks to avoid any reverse reaction in the banking market. It, therefore, preferred the idea of merging them especially after foreigners and investors had been hesitant recently in bank purchasing operations as a result of the state of recession and the Egyptian economy circumstances.
The committee ruled out the idea of merging smaller banks together in a bid to form bigger entities pointing out that such small banks suffer from financial problems and are therefore "black sheep", according to some sources, hence the committees' decision to merge them with bigger banks.
He pointed that there is no time for exerting useless efforts, according to him, to attract back money outflows about which there has been so much talk, quoting the International Settlements Bank's report on the Arab money.
He denied any connection between one's age and retaining in the leading posts in the public enterprise sector companies, noting there is a 70-year chief of a holding company although he had had exceeded the retirement age. He pointed out that efficiency is the criterion in this regard.
He indicated that he would deal with each of the privatized companies separately and that investors could change the kind of activity of the company so long as they would produce products to be sold on the local markets.
He pointed out that a package of facilities aiming at activating the real estate market would be announced and markets would witness a change before the end of the current year.
The program aims at expanding ownership base and increasing private sector's participation, a statement issued by the Investment Ministry said. Proceeds of sale would be used to repay debts of these companies and pump new investments in other companies that are in need of funds.
However, some observers showed reservations about that sale, as some of these companies are already suffering from some problems in their performance and financial structures.
EXPERTS EXPECT BUDGET DEFICIT TO GO UP TO $9.6 BN AFTER CUSTOMS CUT Officials and experts expected the state public budget deficit to increase in the short and medium runs due to the application of the new customs tariff and reduction of taxes by 20%.
Official spokesman for the Finance Minister, Abdel-Fatah Al-Gebali said customs tariff is one of financial policy tools which are used for achieving the economic aims. It is OK to sacrifice part of the proceeds for the sake of activating economy, ending the state of recession and attracting further investments, he added.
He added that the financial policy in Egypt has been dependent on high tax and customs tariffs over 40 years. This resulted in failure to achieve tangible positive results in general. Pending the success of the financial policy in achieving its aims in the long run, the government has to look for new resources to make up for the expected budget deficit over the coming period.
Professor of economics and finance at the Faculty of Commerce, Banha University Dr. Mohamed Al-Naggar expected the budget deficit to soar during the first period of applying the new customs tariff and tax cut. Those measures will result in positive effects on the GNP, market conditions and investment climate, which, in turn, will lead to an increase in the proceeds ensuing from expanding the tax community and increasing company profits after the growth of their investments. However, this depends on the government's ability to control different economic variables. In case of failure, the result will be the increase of budget deficit unprecedentedly and the Finance Ministry will increase services prices, as was the case with diesel price, with a view to making up for the deficit resulting from customs tariffs.
The new investment map includes constructing 7 new investment roads namely Burg Al-Arab-Fayoum road, Sukhna-Zaafarana road, Helwan-Al-Kurimat road, Sohag-Hurghada road, Bani Mazar-Al-Bwati road, Siwa-Matrouh road and Cairo-Alexandra road.
On the margin of the annual congress of the ruling National Democratic Party, which concluded its activities on 23 September, Moheiddin told Asharq Al-Awsat that the coming period would witness amendments to the customs law after the republican decree on cutting customs rates and items with a view to streamlining procedures in the Customs Department. He pointed out that the insurance law will also be amended as there is a tendency to cancel the stamp, in addition to amending the capital market law in a way that matches the requirements and priorities of this stage.
The government no longer concentrates on a certain sector of investment whether industry, agriculture or services. Rather, attention is paid to small and medium-sized projects which are on a par with megaprojects. Egyptian, Arab and foreign investors have the right to choose the kind of project, as the basic rule is: allowing investment in all fields, the minister noted. He added that the level of investment in Egypt now is much less than its potentialities which are characterized by huge diversification.
President Mubarak will announce during the National Democratic Party (NDP) congress next September a set of political and economic reform steps, said NDP secretary general and speaker of Shura (advisory) Council Safwat El-Sherif.
Besides political reforms, El-Sherif added, there is political reform that mainly includes provision of jobs, making a breakthrough in market movement and increasing the current production institutions. Small and micro-sized projects will be reactivated and more attention will be paid to public services, such as establishing an authority for measuring the education quality and discussing policies of decentralization in management of educational process.
"Expenditure and propaganda expenses should be organized and defined," they asked.
Afterwards, he practices some exercises and walks in the hospital's gymnasium.
Then he had his lunch and took rest until 6 pm.
Asharq Al-Awsat learnt that Egyptian human rights activist Saad Eddin Ibrahim received an invitation from officials in charge of the electoral campaign of the Democratic candidate for presidential elections John Kerry to attend a special meeting in the US.
MASSIVE DEMOS AGAINST TORTURE
Appalling torture crimes are done against not only defendants in violence and terrorism cases but also against defendants from political forces and parties, trade union leaders, farmers, human rights activists and ordinary citizens.
They told Al-Masry Al-Youm daily that political forces would make public the name of the presidential candidate at a mass gathering soon.
Assistant Secretary-General of the leftist Tagamo'h (grouping) Party Abdel-Ghaffar Shokr called for forming a national front for democratic reform involving political forces, civil society institutions and intellectuals to snatch reform steps. Shokr hinted that the society could not stand the current situation anymore.
A reform should begin with the election of a president, the period of his term and constitutional power that needs to be reduced, he said.
THE RETURN OF POWER PATRIMONY SCENARIO
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FROM EGYPT
Question 3: What sign and name signifying a kick-off of that reform and to what extent?
A medium reform, however, hopes for laying a constitution and creating political mobility allowing for a renewal of the elite.
Answer to question 3: To nominate security official Omar Solyman as deputy president is the sign signifying the start of reform regardless of the possible volume of such reform.
The matter seems to be more complicated. Those who talk about his assumption of power "one day" entirely rule out the Syrian scenario. They point out what they call the "American scenario" by which they mean George Bush becoming President, like his own father who had once been president.
FM: WE REJECT ISRAELI FORCES IN PHILADELPHIA ROUTE
Maher reiterated Egypt's condemnation of continued Israeli operations and assassinations against the Palestinians. "These acts of aggression," he said, "should not stop Egypt's efforts." He added that Egypt always sought to stop all such practices. "However, there are definite attempts to abort such efforts, including the Israeli provocations, strictly condemned by Egypt."
A senior official with Alexandria Port uncovered that Israeli ships movement in Egyptian ports is still normal. Alexandria and Dekheila Ports Authority issued a statement pointing out that the two ports received Israeli ships transporting a considerable part of Egyptian imports from abroad.
Meanwhile, a number of People's Assembly deputies submitted several interpellations about what was revealed by a report issued by Alexandria and Dekheila Ports Authority to the effect that the two ports received Israeli ships transporting a considerable part of Egyptian imports from abroad.
THIEVES STEAL JEWISH MONEY IN EGYPT
The minister had ordered the incident be kept secret lest it should negatively affect her future in light of a looming cabinet shakeup, it said.
The report compiled by the Egyptian National Competitiveness Council indicated that Egypt's performance decreased at several levels, including the general economic performance, economic indicators and infrastructure.
It also indicated a remarkable drop in the financial policy performance indicators.
North Sinai Non-Governmental Environmental Protection Society raised the alarm about environmental risks and perils of a water trench being dug by Israel on the international border between Egypt and Palestine in Rafah.
If Sharon insists on going ahead with digging the trench, then the society will resort to court to demand 50 million US dollars in initial compensation from the Israeli government, he said.
He cited the World Bank as an example of the sources of foreign aid that stipulate that it should be acquainted with the economic condition of the country that wants to borrow and its per capita income, population growth rate, foreign debts, as well as some aspects related to the educational system in the country. This, he added, is a kind of penetration of developing countries' national security.
U.S. ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF COMMERCE CONSIDERS IN CAIRO INVESTMENT IN SMALL-SIZED PROJECTS
U.S. Assistant Secretary of Commerce is due to visit Egypt on Saturday to hold talks with officials on current commercial problems and solutions, in addition to the technical bases related to the negotiating phases of setting up a free trade zone between Egypt and the United States.
American statistics said that Egypt's exports to the United States rose to 1.44 billion dollars in 2003, up 21 percent, as non-petroleum exports hit 960 million dollars, up 30 percent. However, petroleum exports nosedived to 184 million dollars, down 10 percent.
He said that compared with English and French, Arabic is considered very complicated as it contains one million and 900 thousand words while English has no more than 250 thousand words and French has up to 300 thousand words only. SIBAWI DEFENDS HIMSELF IN PARLIAMENT!
Difference in faith does not forbid true cooperation.
The 5th belly dancing festival opened in Cairo on Monday (28th June) under the title "Welcome" with the participation of 700 belly dancers from all over the world.
Hassan, a retired belly dancer who is working now in training show belly dancers, said that the purpose of the festival is to " transfer the experience of Egyptian belly dancers to foreign dancers, particularly as this kind of dancing is welcomed by US and European audience".
Out of those 315 belonged to the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP), 6 to Al-Tagamo'h, 4 to Al-Wafd, one to the Nasserite Party, one to Al-Ahrar Party and 34 were independents.
He pointed out that during that session. The parliament also discussed several mass issues especially the loaf of bread and the rise in basic commodity prices.
He enumerated the achievements that had been made recently especially in cooperation with the parliament.
He pointed out components of power stations and railway trains are being domestically made.
Thus, the trade balance deficit reached 7.5 billion dollars, i.e. up 14% over that of the last fiscal year.
It is clear that the amendments of the customs tariff have not been studied enough in terms of some significant and vital points which negatively affect industry and industrial investment in vital sectors of private activity.
The memo included an explanation of the problem that is related to the reduction of customs tariff on cars up to 1600 cc to 40% instead of 100%, while cars of over 1600 cc are still subjected to customs tariff over 163%.
It should be taken into consideration that the differential between the average customs duties on components and those on the finished product in car producing developing countries is not less than 35% and exceeds 80% in other countries like India. The customs duties on components in Morocco, the Arab competitor to us, are nil, particularly as the agreement of Arab facilitation will be applied as of 1/1/2005.
Total government debts, therefore, rose to LE292.7 million. The debts of National Investment Bank affiliated to the government also rose to LE102 billion, an increase of LE22.8 billion in the previous year alone.
The budget deficit also rose to about LE27 billion, 5.9% of the GDP.
IMPORTING WHEAT FROM KAZAKHSTAN AFTER CULTIVATION ON EGYPT'S BEHALF
The visit aims at mulling over the possibility of getting wheat from Kazakhstan through direct importation or through hiring lands where wheat is cultivated and then exported to Egypt.
It is to be mentioned that the commercial exchange between Egypt and Czech hit 27.6 million dollars during the first half of last year.
In a memo distributed to all the members of commodity council for construction, Ministry of Foreign Trade and Industry uncovered that there were many investment opportunities available in the construction field in Ethiopia.
It pointed out that Ethiopian government issued its directives to Ethiopian competent bodies to rent huge areas of lands to local and foreign investors at token prices with a view to setting up housing buildings on them.
LE1.8 BILLION WORTH OF EGYPT'S TRADE WITH ARAB COMMON MARKET
FIRST BATCH OF SUDANESE MEAT
Following the signing of the contract Minister of Supply Hassan Khidr said that the Sudanese meat would be imported in return for Egyptian goods and commodities, pointing out that the distribution of this meat would be through consumer co-operatives.
The increase in the number of tourists synchronized with a huge increase in the number of tourist nights spent by tourists during the reported period. The number of tourist nights hit during the first eight months of this year 53,934,066 nights, i.e. up 84.8% in comparison with 29,179,383 tourist nights during the corresponding period of 2003.
Minister of Foreign Trade and Industry, Rashid Mohamed Rashid said that 80 percent of the new customs amendments would serve industry as there was a cut in duties imposed on production inputs and requirements and capital commodities including machines, devices and spare parts. Moreover, 20 percent of those amendments only serve the end product.
The axes include laying down a clear industrial policy for different industrial sectors so that the government's intervention in any industry whether through support, investment may become clear the investor.
BIGGEST POWER STATION TO BE OPENED
The new station will be set on an area of 217 feddans. The station is currently linked to the unified grid with linkage lines of 500 kilovolt from Cairo to Sidi Krir to be linked after that to the Arab Maghreb grid.
Egyptian imports also jumped up to 28.917 billion pounds during the period January-May 2004 against 25.230 billion pounds during the same period last year while Egyptian trade balance deficit declined to 9.907 billion pounds compared with 10.361 billion pounds, said the report.
Head of General Organization for Developing Piscine Wealth Dr. Talaat Nasreddin called on businessmen to invest in fish farms.
Egypt exports only 3500 tons of different kinds of fish and shrimps, he noted. 51% of Egypt's total fish production comes from fish farms, while 49% comes from natural resources such as lakes etc, even though growth rates in natural resources are very poor.
He confirmed that there are cooperation protocols with Somalia, Sudan, and Eritrea through which Egyptian vessels would be allowed to fish in the territorial waters of those countries in certain times. Meanwhile, some countries like Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Spain refused to allow Egyptian fishing vessels to fish in their territorial waters. The organization needs 195 million pounds to remove weeds that spread in lakes, causing a shortage of piscine production.
Cotton export firms set export prices lower than those of the last season after the government entitled them, for the first time, to define the cotton price according to their agreement with purchasers.
TWO MINISTERS TOUR EUROPE TO PROMOTE RECENT ECONOMIC REFORMS
"Since it took over mid last July, the government in Egypt has spread a state of optimism among business circles and the media," said the British Oxford Business Group (OBG), which is concerned with monitoring economic developments in the Middle East.
In cooperation with local and international research institutions, the Ministry of Investment started an all-out survey of Egypt's investment climate, said Minister of Investment Mahmoud Moheiddin.
PLANNING MINISTER: 21% RISE IN FOODSTUFF COMMODITIES' PRICES
The recently adopted policies curbed such rises, led to exchange rate stability, and added another 7 goods to ration cards, thus stopping monthly price rises, which hit 3% during the period July-December 2003, 1.8% during January-April 2004 and 0.07% during May-August 2004, he added.
However, the source denied in a statement to the Middle East News Agency (MENA) that banks suffer from shortage of foreign exchange. "Saudi riyal, needed by Egyptians who are going to perform umrah (minor pilgrimage), has been made available in the four public banks: The National Bank of Egypt, Bank of Alexandria, Banque Misr and Banque du Caire.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE REVENUES UP 27.4 BILLION DOLLARS
According to follow-up reports, economy performance indices point out a gradual increase in the economic growth rate to 4.1% from 3% in the last two years, the minister said.
MUBARAK TO ANNOUNCE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC REFORMS NEXT SEPTEMBER
El-Sherif said that they would also discuss giving more freedom of creativeness and expression by cancelling imprisonment sentences on opinion expression, in addition to other reforms that achieve more political participation.
As regards the law on Political Rights Practice, opposition parties urged for the necessity of judiciary supervision on all election stages starting from preparing slates till the declaration of results.
The President starts his day at 6 am by performing Al-Fajr (dawn) prayers, then he has his breakfast and read Egyptian newspapers and magazines, Azmi said.
Azmi added that Mubarak had performed Friday congregational prayers on 2nd July in one of the hospital halls in the same floor he is staying in.
KERRY SEEKS HELP OF IBRAHIM TO DRAW HIS POLICY IN MIDDLE EAST
Kerry decided to meet Ibrahim in order to be acquainted with political reform projects in the Arab world and the American role that can be played by Ibrahim in support of democracy in the Middle East in case Kerry made his way to the White House.
The note said Egypt was party to international treaties and agreements. However, it said, torture crimes at police stations are still committed systemaically.
A number of political forces' leading figures uncovered their intention to choose one person or more for the posts of the president of the republic and his vice-president once incumbent President Hosni Mubarak's fourth term comes to a close in October 2005.
A springboard for about-face is to introduce constitutional changes that may slim the president's power and set only two presidential terms, as well as carry out an all-out democratic reform through pressure groups, he said.
Assistant Secretary-General of the suspended Labour Party Magdy Korkor linked the election of a president from among several candidates to the realization of other reform steps.
The current stalemate, he maintained, may lead to or bar consequences. The intellectuals' reform calls represent the Egyptian street's demands, he said.
We hope this would continue to be Egypt's destiny otherwise the power patrimony nightmare would take place thus putting an end to the republican sense in favour of an unequivocal monarchical one! We don't think that deception is palatable to anyone. Gamal Mubarak's rise to power can not be due to any special competence or genius of his as the only asset he has is the fact that he is Mubarak's son, which, according to the constitution, cannot be an ordinary citizen due to his father's enjoyment of absolute or rather divine rights. We won't be taken in by any body's argument that it is Gamal's legitimate right to be candidate for such high ranking position because if Gamal Mubarak were an ordinary citizen, he would not even think of nominating himself for chairing a village council not to mention being the president of a country of Egypt's size?
Question 2: Will it be aborted and who may abort it?
Answer to question 1: A minimum reform is confined to a cabinet reshuffle, a nomination of the deputy president.
It, nonetheless, largely depends on his health conditions. If he pulled through and became well enough to supervise the kick off operation, it would be the best option compared to two other options: to suffer a setback even before the kick off thus depriving it of legitimacy and granting the old guard the chance to try to fill in the vacuum or to pull through only too much to give up his hatred of the idea of nominating a deputy president despite of the fact that he is not getting any younger.
Answer to question 4: Gamal Mubarak is not automatically nominated for patrimony, but he is not excluded from it for good.
Some stretch these remarks to Gamal Mubarak who is described as not very knowledgeable of society, its structures and even language, which recalls what was once said about king Abdullah II before his ascension to the throne, a snag that can be cured by teachers who should be well selected for somebody who should be willing to learn.
As regards the results of the visit recently paid by President Mubarak's envoy to Ramallah and Tel Aviv, Maher said, "Matters are moving in a positive direction and some issues are still under consideration."
ISRAELI SHIPS CONTINUE MOVING IN EGYPTIAN PORTS RAISING EUROPEAN FLAGS
The statement added that the abovementioned trip between Alexandria and Haifa ports is one of nine trips due to take place from Haifa to Alexandria, five of which have arrived so far carrying the numbers of 99, 100, 101, 103 and 105, which reached Alexandria Port on June 19th. The next trip is due to arrive on June 29th by an Israeli streamer under the number 107, which will resume activity on the same route Haifa-Alexandria in August.
With regard to the movement of navigation between Israeli ports and Damietta Port, the statement confirmed that a number of tours would reach the port on June 25th from the port of Eilat on the Red Sea.
The thieves sneaked into Maher's office and stole all items therein, Al-Misri Al-Youm, a newly established Egyptian daily, reported on Sunday.
A first Egyptian report on the competitive edge of world economies showed that Egypt came 58th out of a total of 102 countries in the growth competitiveness indicator.
Efforts should be exerted to raise exports and attract more direct foreign investments.
EGYPTIAN COURT SERVES WRIT ON SHARON AGAINST WATER TRENCH
Eid Mohamed Abdel-Wahab, the society's lawyer, served a writ on Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon through the Israeli embassy in Cairo against the water trench.
The US aid is a chain in a series that aims at occupying the Arab mind and consolidating dependence, said Dr. Hassan Ibrahim Abdel Aal, professor of Fundamentals of Education, Tanta University. The US Defence Department's total expenditure on different scientific researches in 1981 only hit 17 billion dollars, out of a total of 160 billion dollars. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) established many universities the Third World countries such as Macomb International University and some other universities in Ecuador, Uruguay and Mexico, in addition to the American universities in Ankara, Beirut and Cairo. There are other agencies that serve the plans of forming the Egyptian mentality, such as Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, Ra'ed Foundation, Middle East Research Group and University of George Town, Dr. Abdel Aal added.
On the other hand, professor of Comparative Education and Education Management in the Faculty of Education, Ain Shams University Dr. Abdel Ghani Abboud said, "Assistance is nothing but loans to be paid back by draining the resources of the downtrodden people." Education projects achieve only American control and render people slaves, while chanting liberty slogans, he added. "The US, the major patron of hegemony and might extend those grants to helpless peoples." The purported educational assistance is only long-term soft loans to the Ministry of Education to be deposited with the safes of certain bodies affiliated to the ministry. These grants are paid back to what the donor countries call educational "experts" who teach national cadres, on the one hand, and spy on those cadres, on the other hand, Abboud said.
The project offers financing resources in the form of "risk capital", in addition to extending other technical assistance to beneficiaries. The finance is meant to rehabilitate small-sized projects to enhance their production, thus increasing their export opportunities.
The U.S. international trade committee emphasized what was recorded in an important report on the expected impacts of relieving 35 countries, including Egypt, from the impacts of cancelling the aforementioned quota system. The report reached a number of important results foremost of which are expected negative effects on Egypt's weaving exports to the United States in light of the current situation unless a free trade agreement was signed by the two countries to give Egypt's exports "preferential treatment" on the American market.
Hassan said, "Not only did the author demand that but he also asked that "rhetoric" be cancelled as it was no longer fit for the spirit of the age".
While receiving the US ambassador in Cairo David Welch on 27th June evening, Tantawi said, "Those who commit terrorist acts in the name of Islam against civilians are not Muslims as a true Muslim is he who abides by God's orders."

Following the end of its session yesterday, the final statement of account of the Egyptian People's Assembly (Parliament) uncovered that 93 deputies maintained silence during that parliamentary session which lasted for over 7 months and that such deputies deserve to be called Sphinx (mute) deputies. Those who had the floor throughout that session were 361 out of 454.

AUTO MANUFACTURERS WARN OF NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF CUSTOMS TARIFF
Car Manufacturers Association submitted a memo to Prime Minister Dr. Ahmed Nazif, Finance Minister Dr. Youssef Botros Ghali and Minister of Foreign Trade and Industry Rashid Mohamed Rashid. The memo included proposals for introducing a supplement to the customs tariff amendments so that 18 factories can continue work. These factories have investments to the tune of 8 billion pounds. Some 17 thousand personnel in different engineering and technical specialties work for those factories, which include joint companies established in cooperation with international ones.
So that production of passenger cars and trucks may not stop, the Association suggested solving local feeding industries in terms of the customs tariff so that it can reduce their prices. The Association also suggested exempting the locally produced passenger cars up to 1600 cc from the resources development charges which hit 3% and was applied last May. The customs release on imported components of local car plants (CKD) is carried out without the approval of the General Organization for Industrialization in order to make sure that the rate of local industrialization was met and that it does not contain imported components that can be produced locally. The customs tariff, as mentioned before, was reduced to 40% for imported cars up to 1600 cc and it was reduced from 32% to 50% for imported trucks according to their relevant loads. Therefore, it is suggested to introduce a customs item for components and parts of dismantled cars which are sold to car assemblage plants as is the case in many countries like India and Morocco in order to achieve the minimum limit of difference between customs duties on imported components and the finished product so that local plants and feeding industries can continue production and compete with imported products regardless of the slight difference between prices.

It was decided that the Ethiopian government would build 150 thousand housing units, during three years as of the current year, for low-income categories. 10 thousand units would be built this year to be followed by 33 thousand ones next year.
There is a package of rules governing foreign companies' participation in bids, that would be announced to implement big projects, the memo noted. Egyptian companies interested in taking part in carrying out those projects, should register their names in jurisdictional governmental bodies and have authorized agents representing them before such bodies.
Egypt's exports to Jordan hit 406.4 million pounds, up 269.2 million pounds; Syria, 679 million pounds, up 520.9 million pounds; Yemen, 101.6 million pounds, up 39.9 million pounds; and Mauritania, 12.1 million pounds, up 11.9 million pounds, the CAPMS said.

He added that exporters and importers have to determine in their orders which are submitted to the CEA the breed of the exported cotton and its exported sample. All contracted consignments shall be shipped on schedule.

LEFTIST TAGAMOH'S CRITICIZES IKHWAN
"Such political maneuvers cannot deceive everybody. The Ikhwan want to pressurize the government through getting closer to Al-Wafd, and Al-Wafd in turn may also want to provoke the government through establishing relations with the Ikhwan," he said, pointing out that the Ikhwan General Guide had had a phone conversation with him and asked him to arrange a meeting, but he informed him that such a contact could be made through the assistants of the two parties to consider the issue.
Al-Sa'eed statements reflect a more strict change in his party's stance towards Ikhwan, with whose leadership Al-Tagamo'h had had a meeting in its headquarters.
The group's delegation under deputy general guide Dr. Mohamed Habib met leaders of the Wafd's Supreme Body under Dr. Noaman Gomaa at the party's premises, well-informed sources told Al-Hayat. The meeting discussed forms of coordination and cooperation in the file of political and constitutional reforms and agreement on a certain mechanism to put in place proposed initiatives in that regard.
Earlier, the Muslim Brotherhood Group and leftist Tagamo'h Party declared a reform plan two months ago.
"The meetings confirmed good relationships between the party and the group. We discussed different topics and agreed to postpone announcement of those topics to next week," he added.
The conference would come out with certain recommendations including mechanisms to pressurize the ruling regime into meeting reform demands such as demonstrations, strikes, sit-ins and civil disobedience, Ibrahim said, pointing out that it would also discuss a paper submitted by Egyptian activists who took part in the recently-held Doha reform conference on the Egyptian case. It is worth mentioning that Doha Conference called for constitutional plurality in republican systems and laying down a schedule for achieving reform in 1 to 3 years.
The Sudan was subjected to an unjust American siege that lasted for many years. One day, the US administration sought to change the ruling regime and accused it of groundless and fabricated charges of supporting terrorism and sponsoring extremism.
Akef warned that the danger of partitioning and the feeding of internal conflicts might happen in any country or government. Leaving the Sudanese government in the lurch to face all that would not be useful. The Sudan might be compelled to accept unsatisfactory conditions, while facing all such huge pressure, he added.
A number of Wafd leading and Coptic figures including Munir Fakhry, head of Wafd Party parliamentary block, Talat Gad, member of the Supreme Body, Abdel Fatah Nussir and Munir Shanab, turned down alliances with the group at that time. The alliance, engineered by Wafd Party Secretary General Dr. Al-Saed Badawi, was rejected in form by the prominent leaders.
Sources close to the course of events told Asharq Al-Awsat that the two parties could jointly announce a political reform initiative in Egypt soon.
Egyptian presidential sources said to Asharq Al-Awsat that after returning from his medical treatment trip, President Husni Mubarak would likely issue a decision to cancel the emergency state that has been enforced in Egypt for 23. He is also expected to issue a presidential pardon for a number of prisoners who are not involved in terrorist or ethical cases.
Al-Baz described Gamal Mubarak's actions as a result of his position as a secretary of the NDP Policy Secretary and his willingness to activate political life in Egypt. "This could be done through increasing the activities of the majority party and other opposition parties so as to achieve the aspirations of the Egyptian street and new generations that want to take part in this."
Mubarak believes in the necessity of change and reform in the coming stage, he said, adding that they would be achieved soon.
Moreover, the report laid it bare that there are more than 6400 Mercedes and Cherokee cars used by officials in government and ministerial bodies starting from the director general rank to the minister post. The total sums spent on petrol, drivers and maintenance operations of those posh cars exceed 600 million pounds annually. The report, which was recently sent to Dr Atef Ebeid, highlighted the necessity of putting an end to such serious phenomena, which result in squandering those billions annually in spite of the difficult condition the country has undergone in the last few years.
INCREASING THREAT OF DIMONA
ISRAEL BOYCOTT OFFICE ASKS US TO HALT SALES TO IDF
The message mentioned what Caterpillar Company always reiterated: "We are an international company. We use our power and resources to improve the life of our neighbours in the world, and that Caterpillar's reputation in integrity is a main part of it ethical heritage and standards, the source noted.
Sharon resorted to this plan - the other side of which is the building of the separating wall in the West Bank - to abort any talk or negotiation with any Palestinian.
The Egyptian move takes two directions although Israel stressed that it is neither mediation nor indirect negotiation with the Palestinians and that its sole goal is to forestall any Palestinian military action in Gaza.
Regardless of intentions attributed to Egypt by Israel, particularly for fear that Gaza may turn into a hotbed of Palestinian hardliners as well as Egyptian fundamentalists who may use it to resume launch attacks on the Egyptian regime, responding to such demands implicitly involves a great amendment to the way in which Arafat may run his authority.
Therefore, it can be expected that the schedules may be unrealistic.
PRIMAKOV: SADDAM AGREED WITH AMERICA AHEAD OF WAR
Iraq has turned into an attractive arena for international terrorists, especially Al-Qaeda, he said, stressing the necessity of seriously dealing with the Iraqi weapons that have not been developed yet.
EXPERTS CAST DOUBTS ON GOVERNMENT LEGITIMACY
Al-Ashal, nonetheless, added that the council based its recognition of the transitional government on the fact that it is a step towards building the Iraqi constitution. He said that the council had denounced neither occupation nor invasion as handing power over from occupation to the Iraqi government legally meant that such a transitional government alone had become the representative of Iraq both internally and abroad regardless of the military presence of the coalition forces and because such forces should supposedly convert into forces allied to the new Iraqi government.
He added that, "If the deposed President's daughter took such a step without delay, this might bring American projects in the region to a halt and uncover the suspicious resistance that daily kill Iraqi people's sons with bomb cars, etc."
Iraq will be present in the memory of US former top administrator in Iraq Paul Bremer even after his quick departure on Monday from the country without farewell ceremonies or cheers, sources close to Bremer said.
The sources said the woman told some of her closest friends that her relationship with Bremer "could lead to marriage".
Such power is governed by the presence of 160 thousand foreign soldiers, including 140 Americans.
Agreements will be signed regarding setting up military bases near oilfields and Syrian and Iranian borders.
However, security seems to claim first priority. When the citizen life is threatened, security becomes a paramount importance.
If the Americans were trying to involve the NATO in the security crisis which they are undergoing in Iraq, I'd like to very tentatively tell Dr. Allawi that the NATO, too is suffering from senility diseases so much so that it may turn out to be quite impotent as far as Iraq's security crisis is concerned.
Dr. Allawi again in his search for a cure just forgets that turning the NATO mission from a security into a military one would impose the incursion of Turkish forces into the depth of Iraq, which would cause extreme sensitivity in Iraq and to the Arabs and run counter to Dr. Allawi's previous objection to seeking help from any neighbouring country's forces.
Nor did the man stop his generous demands even when the American campaign to exempt Iraq from debts was in full swing!
Why, then, is that insistence on drawing upon "experts" and forces of a military alliance not specialized in police and security training unless it is just to relieve pressure on American forces?
Allawi, above all, was the only oppositionist who had the nerve to try to topple Saddam from within.
Is it with such dubious American-backed forces that Allawi wants to sweep rebellious Sunnite districts?
Sunnite military coups have borne, since 1958, the responsibility for destroying Iraq's fragile democracy.
Such elements do move quite freely in the Sunnite district taking advantage of that sect's concern and rejection and in some sort of cooperation with Baathist backward tribal and sectarian leaderships which failed to get rid of Saddam's legacy in favour of a review of experiments or self-criticism in a bid to offer such positive grassroots struggling for a democratic Arab Iraq that respects its sects, minorities and neighbours.
Those companies accused the banks of not recognizing such industry and refraining from financing it. Banks prefer projects that achieve quick revenues in a short time which is unavailable in software projects as banks alleged, the companies said.
In his first comment on Misr Exterior Bank's amalgamation with Banque Misr, renowned Eng. Naguib Saweris estimated his loss in Misr Exterior Bank at 60 million pounds.
According to CBE directors, Misr Exterior Bank would be used as branches of Banque Misr as of September 19th provided that the new bank would a bide by any commitments due on Misr Exterior's clients whether deposits or other creditors.
Banque Misr considers selling its share in Misr International Bank and Misr Romania Bank, while Bank of Alexandria is considering selling its share in the Egyptian American Bank. This will be after purchasing the branches of American Express Bank in Egypt.
A banking source close to the deal said that Banque du Caire proposed that the French bank purchase shares according to the prices in 1997 by which the previous deal was concluded, while BNP Paribas Bank refused this offer saying that the conditions have changed and the value of the circulated securities in Egyptian Stock Exchange had retreated.
EMIRIAN, LEBANESE BANKS CONSIDER BUYING CAIRO FAR EAST BANK
It also learnt that the officials of the two banks had already met with officials of Cairo Far East Bank. They had also considered the ways to conclude the deal. However, Awda Bank had informed the Egyptian officials that it needs a bank with a more broader network of branches, a condition that does not apply to Cairo Far East Bank.
Minister of Foreign Trade and Industry Rashid Mohamed Rashid described the conditions of the Egyptian economy as miserable.
The government does not interfere in the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) affairs. It is the CBE that determines monetary policies, he said, pointing out that exchange rates wanted by banks reflects inflation and price rises on the market.
It is to be noted that chairman of Industries Federation Galal Al-Zorba said it is important to hurry to conclude such an agreement in order to establish an industrial zone in cooperation with Israel. Through this agreement the Egyptian exports will have access to the US without customs duties provided that at least 8% of the exported products' components are Israeli.
Egyptian laws and regulations are in dire need of an all-out change after it was ranked 123 on the word level in terms of the volume of foreign investment while Israel came 60th with investments estimated at 2 billion dollars, the report added.
The plan's local finance hits 91% or 77 billion pounds out of total 85-billion-pound investments. The National Investment Bank contributes 70% of such finance including 2.2 billion pounds in foreign currency, he said.
810,000 PALM LEAVES EXPORTED
450,000 TONS OF RICE TO BE EXPORTED NEXT SEASON
An exporter asked that prices not to be decreased for exported quantities of rice and that the rice future prices and production be considered with a view to laying down an exportation policy starting with production and ending with exportation. He refused to reduce the rice prices even if he was forced to mill it and sell it as fodder!
First Undersecretary of the Supply Ministry, Saed Zeidan, said that exporting 450,000 tons next season is a moderate target that achieves a balance among producers, exporters and consumers. Regarding the holding company's contribution to the ministry's ration cards rice, he pointed out that that aimed at meeting the market needs.
The government has taken tangible measures to reform the banking system and taxes system. It also introduced structural reforms to foreign exchange market, which led to exchange market stability and improved the balance of payments so that its surplus had doubled five times over in the last three years, he said.
Some measures were applied to the customs sector as a first stage that would be followed by other stages. The Egyptian tax system, including the sales tax, is also being restructured in a way that copes with the integrated policy of the modern Egyptian state, Gamal Mubarak added. Policies were devised for running the state's assets, protecting consumers, banning monopoly, unleashing freedom of competition, supporting the control role of the state, and ensuring transparency for market stability, he noted.
One of the insurance companies will be put up for sale, too.
According to the banking sources, the six banks which will be merged suffer from several financial problems especially borrowers defaulting on the repayment of their debts and the big financial losses incurred by those banks, let alone the difficulty of collecting the loans which have almost become bad debts.
The sources said that in the first stage, 6 banks would be merged to be followed by the second stage that would include 26 banks. The two stages, that is, would include 32 out of 62 banks operative in Egypt. The sources added that certain regulations had been laid down for the merging operations which would mostly be compulsory to avoid the South East Asia experiment.
ATTRACTING FOREIGN INVESTMENTS BETTER THAN MONEY OUTFLOWS
Regarding the abundance of investment laws and decisions in Egypt, he said that it is clear that there are laws that did not provide any thing.
He added that currently he is keen on having delegates with particular tasks in addition strong control from the state bodies on companies.
He pointed out that they seek to attract the big and serious investors. This type of investors do not pay much heed to exemptions but are rather interested in the transparency and the clarity of laws and their application.
PRIVATIZATION OF TEN STATE-OWNED COMPANIES
The state, moreover, intends to sell its shares in a number of companies as follows: Nasr City for Housing and Construction (25%), Egyptian Contracting Company Mukhtar Ibrahim (87%), Medical Union Pharmaceuticals Co. (15.4%), Egyptian Rwad (Pioneers) for Tourist Investment (48.3%), Pachin Chemicals (44%), Misr for Mechanical and Electrical Projects (39%), Delta for Sugar (87.9%) and Nasr for Clothes and Textile (17.2%).
By the end of the current month, some serious decisions and steps will be taken to develop the business climate in Egypt, activate the privatization programme, and enhance competitiveness of main industrial and export sectors, Minister of Foreign Trade and Industry Rashid Mohamed Rashid uncovered.
Dr. Youssef Botros Ghali affirmed that the application of the new customs tariff will lead to reductions of customs proceeds by around 3 billion pounds in return for improving investment climate, this help activate the national economy.
We cannot talk about the effects of the new tax bill on the budget deficit now. This bill provides for cutting tax to 20% as a maximum limit and 10% as a minimum limit instead of 40% and 20%. The bill will be referred to the People's Assembly in its next session. In case it is endorsed, the bill will be applied early in the fiscal year 2005/2006, said Al-Gebali.
He expected the decline in proceeds to reach more than 6 billion pounds if the tax was cut to 20%, a matter which would cause the budget deficit to exceed 60 billion pounds at least should other economic factors be stable.
The Investment Roads Authority (IRA) prepared investment map for constructing and developing 16 new investment roads with an investment cost hitting 9 billion pounds, said Chairman of the IRA Eng.
AMENDMENTS TO INSURANCE, CUSTOMS AND TRADE LAWS EXPECTED
Concerning insolvents, Moheiddin said that this problem went beyond the problem of banks to trade laws and bankruptcy rulings. Insolvents cause many problems to many sectors including the public sector and its suppliers and insurance too. This requires setting specific rules regarding facilitation of dealing with them, especially those who are expected to get out of their crises, so as to preserve the rights of those who deal with them as well as creditors.
On the other hand, he noted that the process of economy liberalization cannot be completed without activating the private sector's role in the financial sector and reviewing the state's role in possessing financial institutions which seize 75% of financial assets.
Trade Balance Along with the increase of value of exports by 14% to 10.5 billion dollars, imports also soared 21% to 18 billion dollars. Thus, the trade balance deficit reached 7.5 billion dollars, i.e. up 14% over that of the last fiscal year.
EGYPT'S FOREIGN DEBT UP 7% TO $29 BN IN JUNE
The surplus of service balance went up 47.9% due to the increase of service proceeds by 24.3% to 13 billion dollars. Those proceeds were concentrated in the proceeds of the item of travel which includes tourist returns. Meanwhile, service payments increased 3.1% only. The net remittances soared 9% to 3.9 billion dollars as a result of the increase of formal and private remittances by 33.8% and 3.4% respectively.
It is clear that the amendments of the customs tariff have not been studied enough in terms of some significant and vital points which negatively affect industry and industrial investment in vital sectors of private activity.
The memo included an explanation of the problem that is related to the reduction of customs tariff on cars up to 1600 cc to 40% instead of 100%, while cars of over 1600 cc are still subjected to customs tariff over 163%.
It should be taken into consideration that the differential between the average customs duties on components and those on the finished product in car producing developing countries is not less than 35% and exceeds 80% in other countries like India. The customs duties on components in Morocco, the Arab competitor to us, are nil, particularly as the agreement of Arab facilitation will be applied as of 1/1/2005.
Total government debts, therefore, rose to LE292.7 million. The debts of National Investment Bank affiliated to the government also rose to LE102 billion, an increase of LE22.8 billion in the previous year alone.
The budget deficit also rose to about LE27 billion, 5.9% of the GDP.
TWO MINISTERS TOUR EUROPE TO PROMOTE RECENT ECONOMIC REFORMS
"Since it took over mid last July, the government in Egypt has spread a state of optimism among business circles and the media," said the British Oxford Business Group (OBG), which is concerned with monitoring economic developments in the Middle East.
In cooperation with local and international research institutions, the Ministry of Investment started an all-out survey of Egypt's investment climate, said Minister of Investment Mahmoud Moheiddin.
PLANNING MINISTER: 21% RISE IN FOODSTUFF COMMODITIES' PRICES
The recently adopted policies curbed such rises, led to exchange rate stability, and added another 7 goods to ration cards, thus stopping monthly price rises, which hit 3% during the period July-December 2003, 1.8% during January-April 2004 and 0.07% during May-August 2004, he added.
However, the source denied in a statement to the Middle East News Agency (MENA) that banks suffer from shortage of foreign exchange.

The government works for solving defaulting companies' problems, Rashid concluded.
It is to be mentioned that president's political advisor Dr. Osama Al Baz visited Ebeid two days ago to tell him that president Mubarak will assign him an economic post that is directly affiliated to the president, but he did not name the post.
Mahmoud Mohieddin who is expected to head the Ministry of Economy. The sources, meanwhile, expected that the Youth Ministry will be chaired either by NDP youth secretary general Maged El-Sherbini or policy committee member Dr. Ahmed Kamal.
This issue will not be put forward in the coming NDP general congress slated for September next.
Mubarak's occupation of the two posts of president of the republic and president of the NDP does not affect any of them, especially as Mubarak does not mix cards.
According to Al-Ahram web site, Ebied was followed by Minister of Foreign Trade Youssef Butos Ghali, Agriculture Minister Youssef Wali and ministers of planning, industry and information technology in terms of the number of statements. While Environment Minister comes at the end of the list as far as the number of statements was concerned. This means that the ministers concerned with economic issues were the most talkative most of their speeches were nonsense.
Critics described Ebied's statement of account as negative.
In the same respect, sources told Asharq Al-Awsat that high Egyptian officials told the political advisor of the Israeli Defence Army during a secret visit he paid to Cairo that the continuity of bombing, incursions and crackdowns carried out in villages and cities of Gaza Strip and West Bank would prevent Egypt from playing a pivotal role in reaching a new cease fire.
Amin Iskandar, a movement participant and a leading figure of Al-Karama (Dignity) Party under construction, told Asharq Al-Awsat that they have agreed to hold periodical meetings to support the nomination of two persons for the posts of the president and vice president through a popular signature-collecting campaign in Cairo and governorates to be notarized with the Notary Public. The movement, he added, seeks to have amended some clauses of the Constitution including the way of electing president and vice president of the republic and confining presidency to two unrenewable terms of office.
CONSTITUTION MAY BE AMENDED NEXT YEAR
The amendments may include the freedom of forming parties, determining explicit election systems, giving full freedoms to trade unions, and boosting NGOs, they pointed out.
They described El-Sherif's announcement as an act of turning over a new leaf of compromise within the framework of national dialogue currently led by the NDP with different parties.
Cairo and other Egyptian cities are making ready to receive President Mubarak after he returns from his treatment trip in Germany in a few days' time.
Celebratory manifestations also coincided with increasing talk about the changes he is expected to carry out following his return, as some old guards that have been playing important roles during Mubarak's rule are expected to be excluded. This gives an impression that Mubarak will take important reform measures before his new tenure in office.
It was impossible to conceal such a state of perplexity that dominated Egyptian milieus since the cabinet reshuffle has been announced.
Some PA deputies attributed the government decision, which came after four years of controversy and opposition's rejections, as a result of three-year studies that confirmed that proportionate list elections contravene constitution's provisions that provide for the individual system of elections and the direct secret ballot.
Asharq Al-Awsat learnt that the legislative modifications of the law on practising political rights will concentrate on laying down the controls and legal rules related to updating election rolls, preparing election committees and studying all political trends requests of having a judicial supervision over all the stages of elections starting with preparing electoral rolls till announcing the elections final results.
This board was bought 18 years ago at a cost of two million pounds, but a show of hands was still adopted.
Under this headline, Al-Ahram Al-Arabi publishes a report, excerpts from which come to the following effect:
A new young foreign minister may take over the toughest file of Egypt's foreign relations - Arab and Egypt-America relations, peace issues, Iraq and Western countries. The Foreign Ministry may also be divided into two ministries. A post for a minister of state for foreign affairs may also be devised to assume the African relations, which deteriorated since Botros Ghali took over the UN Secretary General post. He will also undertake the file of Egypt's relations with Latin America, North America, the ASEAN member states and other world capitals that are not included in Egypt's diplomacy map, in addition to Egyptian expatriates file.
Well-informed sources said that the "new generation" in the NDP did not feel quite at ease as Al-Sherif occupied the position of Information Minister for several reasons mainly including this generation's need to a mass media discourse that would meet its requirements as well as the requirements of the "youthful" masses in the field of businessmen and the social field on which the generation bets. This generation in the NDP, furthermore, is looking forward to being served by Al-Sherif through his new position by restructuring press and party life in Egypt to enhance this generation's chances of ruling the country.
It also disregards any talk about the citizens' rights to developed services at reasonable prices in favour of a policy that relies on offering services through economic feasibility.
There is now an integrated new generation network occupying basic sites in Egypt with only a few final touches to be made in the forthcoming change.
The paper published a feature dealing with the press coverage of the topic of Gamal Mubarak's power patrimony. Some excerpts from the feature written by Mohamed Teima of Al-Arabi ran to the following effect:
Samri Ragab, who will be sixty five on 25th August this year has categorically denied any intention on the part of the "new way of thinking" advocates to get rid of "May" or that Al-Mustakbal Al-Gadid (The New Future) would be a rival or a substitute for it.
Another sarcastic remark came from Hassanein karoum in Al-Quds Al-Arabi paper website about the youth who are just like "paratroopers" (referring perhaps to Gamal's sudden rise). We were even attacked by Abdullah Kamal for having invented the power patrimony case in a bid to blackmail the reform program and accused us of failing to recognize the constitutional rights of a citizen, namely Mr. Gamal Mubarak due to his family background.
Kamal also denied a tendency among mass media to support the reformist team as he sees that reformist generation as in need of publicity.
When we tried to find a comment, the exasperated reply came, "Anyway, I quite understand and we'll contact you later on."
"We are for an editing policy that favours only the interests and the future of the people because the country has gone senile, which, in turn, reflected on sterility of imagination and failure to find solutions to Egypt's problems.
A couple of days earlier, he denied being related, in anyway, to the committee and emphasized that neither he nor any of his colleagues had anything to do with the party.
What matters is to open the way to youth if anybody has got another option, let them come up with it!"
In the same tower, there are an office for Gamal Mubarak or Alaa Mubarak.
Young people are unemployed and lost, which would affect their loyalty to the fatherland. When I asked him about the name and the premises, he said, "The name is normal and having the same the premises came by chance.
He answered, "It's better to have somebody whom you know than to have someone whom you don't.
However, Rashdan then exploded a bomb if it turned true, it would be evidence to the credibility of reform orientations, "When the President returns, he will support all trends and form a coalition government. Some oppositionists would be appointed as governors.
Everything is probable in Britain except for Libyan leader Geddafi becoming an item for an opera currently prepared by British National Opera House to be shown on its theatre in London at the beginning of 2006 if everything was OK.
Saval thinks that the National Opera House decision to achieve that work indicates the development of the opera from an art for the elite into a popular art, hence the absence of any restrictions regarding the composed item: Geddafi.
The new opera music will not be classical but will include a mixture of the rap and the pop, etc in order to attract a new audience of youth who belong to other races in Britain.
A source close to Mossa told Asharq Al-Awsat that Mossa adopted that position as a silent protest against the increasing biting criticisms to which the AL had been exposed recently, and against some people's attempt to hold the AL and its secretary general responsible for the failure of Arab common action over the past two years.
It is to be mentioned that during the opening session of the 16th Arab Summit that was held in Tunis in May last Mossa highlighted the necessity of finding a quick solution to the AL suffocating financial crisis, which may lead the AL to go bankrupt and stop most of its vital activities.
A report compiled by the AL Secretariat said that the hazards resulting from the AL-member states unpunctuality in paying off their contributions to the AL on due time were ridiculously.
RELATION BETWEEN US BALFOUR DECLARATION AND NEW EGYPTIAN ROLE
And finally, What does Egypt hope to achieve through this move?
Egypt's accepta nce of playing that role came after the visit paid by Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom to Egypt and his meeting with presidential advisor Osama Al-Baz on 7 June.
If this assumption is true, the link between the two incidents will be the then so-called Second Balfour Declaration announced by US President Bush during President Mubarak's visit to the US.
It is noticed here that this American Balfour declaration was given to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon during his visit to the White House.
To the contrary, nothing of that happened, but rather there was unprecedented Egyptian readiness to return to Gaza within the framework of the Israeli withdrawal plan.
Egypt may look to its role from the perspective of its support of the Palestinians and guaranteeing an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.
Sharon clearly stressed his refusal of any political dimension for the Egyptian role.
And even if circumstances required that the Egyptian role should gain a political dimension after the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, this dimension will remain within the limits of mediation between the Palestinians and Israelis. It will remain just like an Arab shadow of the American role, which is essentially aimed to give Israel the right to veto the proposals and solutions that don't harmonize with its views and political and security interests.
In fact, given the deterioration of the Palestinian situation including the PNA; divisions, corruption and the Israeli ferocious attacks not to mention the deteriorating Arab political situation, the PNA had to accept the proposed Egyptian role as this role may be a protection shield in the face of Israeli attacks.
The Israelis want to make security in Gaza an Egyptian responsibility and the Palestinians want Egypt to return them to the negotiating table with the Israelis.
Palestinian factions may alleviate their refusal of the Egyptian role, but until when?
However, the refusal of the plan by Sharon's Likud party caused it to change and be divided into four stages, each of which to be subjected to a vote by the cabinet.
In fact, this happened many times with the Egyptians and Palestinians.
Nobody knows, including the Egyptians themselves.
Anyhow, the answer to this question is known by Egyptian foreign policy-makers until further notice.
Medium and long-term loans out of Egypt's total foreign debts at the end of the third quarter hit 27,650,300 US dollars from 27,955,700 US dollars at the end of the second quarter.
"I just want my family's property of houses and lands that were usurped by Israel or even by Sharon himself."
TECHNOLOGICAL SYSTEM TO ACTIVATE AND SUPPORT INVENTIONS AND INNOVATIONS IN ARAB REGION
The Egyptian Patent Office always seeks to develop its tools and technologies to support the national intellectual property rights system and national scientific and technological policies, which seek to support innovation and encourage vertical and horizontal technological transfer and attract foreign investment, he said. It also aims to be a nucleus for a technological system to activate and support inventions in the Arab world through cooperation and integration.
These two girls share many other girls the titles: "mothers" and "street girls".
When those mothers reach the age of 21, the age at which they should leave the center, they will benefit by a fund for supporting them and involving them and their children in the society.
This center is run by Al-Amal Orphanage for girls. The officials said that the rate of pregnancy is very high among those girls as they are exposed to rape and sexual abuse.

He added that there were no plan to stop building Azharite institutes or cancel religious education in Egypt in response to America, according to current reports.
He pointed out that those who represent faith should take great care the wise use of words so as to reach the goal - the development of the Islamic society. Those who criticize Islam in the world are trying to ascribe backwardness in the Islamic world to Islam itself, which is a false argument.
There should be some reasonable distance between mosques to ensure optimum use of each mosque."
It also pointed out bad health conditions of female farmers and many diseases such as those resulting from giving birth at the hands of midwives and lack of vaccines. Other diseases result from smokes of kerosene used in houses, not to mention anemia, which amounts to 55 percent. Some other diseases result from lack of calories and protein or because of pesticides and consumption, it said.
Yesterday (4th July), Minister of Wakfs (Religious Endowments) Dr Hamdi Zaqzouq said that several decisions had been taken regarding building Azharite religious institutes and mosques. He emphasized that such procedures aimed at promoting objectivity and observing demographic distinctions as well as public controls and standards.
Azharite sources said, "Attempts have been made to hush up the matter to avoid public opinion incitement. However, this blackout or denial became useless as the government decision text including 10 items had been sent to Al-Azhar officials."
EGYPT TO ORGANIZE ISLAMIC CHRISTIAN SPORTS FESTIVAL
Churches often sponsor useful activities for youth and children during the summer vacation to support them intellectually, culturally, spiritually and socially.
Egyptian Copts translated their anger and condemnation of baheb es-sima (I Love the Cinema) movie, which is showing, into action. Four senior priests as well as Christian and Muslim lawyers submitted a memo to Prosecutor General Maher Abdel-Wahed's office, calling on him to have the movie stopped and take legal action against the movie's producer and director.
It is noteworthy that a number of dramas had previously stimulated Copts, such as awan al-ward (the Season of Flowers) serial, which portrayed an ideal marriage between a Muslim man and a Coptic girl, a marriage that is opposed by Egyptian Copts. The serial's scenario was, consequently, changed in later episodes to emphasize that the church considers such a kind of marriage as troublesome.

100,000 AMERICAN TOURISTS VISITED EGYPT IN 6 MONTHS
"The problem of attracting the American market is attributed to the absence of direct foreign airlines to Egypt," head of the Egyptian Federation of Chambers of Tourism Elhami Azayyat said, adding that this problem tops the problems that face growth of this market. He urged that such companies be encouraged to open direct airlines. "There're large numbers of American tourists who want to visit Egypt, but the absence of direct airlines hinders their move. Moreover, the American tourist lacks awareness about Egyptian destinations, let alone unrest in the Middle East that affects the move of tourists, especially after American tourism to Israel had come to a halt," ASTA chief in Egypt said.
This comes within the framework of intensive Egyptian contribution to the 3-day conference. Besides Rashid, the Egyptian delegation will comprise a number of businessmen and experts in the field of textiles and ready-made clothes.

Under the above heading, Dr. Khaled Al-Dekheil, Saudi writer and professor of political science in Saudi universities, wrote to say: The Egyptian move towards Palestine insistently raises four important questions: Why did Egypt choose to carry out this mission at this particular time and specifically with Sharon?
Why did Egypt choose to take over this mission at this particular time?
The Egyptian president visited Washington last May.
This declaration was announced during Sharon's visit to the White House and only two days after Mubarak's visit to it.
This declaration is a big shift in the US policy towards the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Now we come to the second question; why did Israel accept the Egyptian role and the return of Egypt to Gaza, particularly as Israel is known for its flat refusal of any non-American interference between it and the Palestinians?
Political advisor to President Mubarak said one of the aims of the Egyptian move is to prevent Israel from sweeping Palestinian territories and to stop assassinations and violations against the Palestinians.
As Osama Al-Baz hinted, Sharon refused any mediation by Cairo and insisted that the Egyptian role should not go beyond achieving security stability in Gaza Strip and along the border. Al-Hayat newspaper quoted Israeli press sources as saying that Sharon said, "I will not allow Egypt to play the role of a mediator between us and the Palestinians or to launch direct or indirect negotiations with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) because this will make the disengagement plan bilateral and not unilateral. It will also undermine the roadmap principles that provide for not holding negotiations with the Palestinians unless they combat terrorism."
The strange thing is that Cairo knows this better than others and knows that the limits of its role are narrower than it thinks.
In the meantime, the PNA will be keen that the Egyptian role should not be an alternative to it in negotiations.
Egypt, however, cannot achieve either.
And in return for what?
This means that the Egyptian role became dependent upon Israeli political accounts and balances even before it started, just like the Palestinian situation.
All this is based on the supposition that the Bush Administration will win a second term in office.
So, why did Egypt decide to play a role it cannot assume?
FOREIGN DEBT DECLINES BY $368 MILLION
The report added that the total value of short-term debts at the end of the third quarter accounted for 2.784 billion dollars against 1,747,300 dollars in the second quarter of the same year.
This is not a complaint by a Palestinian following the destruction of his house at the hands of the Israeli army or words by an Arab in Israel that usurped his lands, but it is a cry by (Egyptian) citizen Murid Mahmoud Azzarbawi. Israel had usurped 12 feddans owned by his family since 1922. Such lands were officially registered in the Land Registration Department, known as "Taboo", in the Palestinian government in 1937. This is considered a decisive proof that Azzarbawi is entitled to have access to this land, especially as Israel had announced in 1948 following its establishment that the only proof of possession of lands by individuals, whether they were Arabs or Jews, would be determined according to the registers of such a department.
Egypt has kicked off concrete steps towards a technological system to activate and support inventions and innovations in the Arab world through regional cooperation among Arab intellectual property bureaus in the area of building basic capability, developing human sources and crystallizing the current situation and future vision of the Arab Patent Office.
Science, technology and production are three components directly connected with development policies and plans as science is a basis for technology, which is the main pillar of production - the backbone of development. Thorough development requires continued technological development, which accelerates its rates and makes its results more effective. Arab countries are agreed on such concepts, a thing which makes the intellectual property system enter the system of effectuating and supporting innovation in the Arab region and exchange successful expertise in this field among Arab and foreign patent offices.
Although the number of street kids in Egypt hovers between 1-1.5 million boys and girls, the number of mothers among them is unknown and on the increase, as every street girl is exposed to rape on a daily basis, and consequently fall pregnant.

CRISIS BETWEEN GOV'T, AL-AZHAR DUE TO STOPPING RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS BUILDING
Zaqazoq denied any foreign pressure leading to such a decision. He said, "50 years ago, Egypt had about 10 religious institutes and 3 Azharite faculties.
The decision's main items included not giving permits for building any mosque or Azharite institute until previous approvals were obtained under the concerned bodies supervision. The rule governing buildings that were constructed without a permit is to have them demolished and have the legal procedures applied. Governors shall take the necessary steps to stop their completion and prevent providing them with utilities. Buildings which did not take the shape of a mosque like "Zawyah" (small places for worship), can be made use of through projects which are useful to the community like illiteracy combating centers.

The memo included objections to some shots in the film, which they consider as deriding their religion. "The movie also shows quarrels, hot scenes and beating a priest with a shoe in a church, which they consider as an insult to Egypt's Copts," the memo said. Clergymen are not opposed to having Copts shown in dramas, but they object to the use of holy texts and mocking some religious creeds in the film, the memo added, pointing out Egyptian Copts' keenness on supporting arts and creativeness provided that such artistic works should not insult heavenly religions.

Under such reforms, all banking entities and those entities which provide similar activities but do not have enough money for this purpose and face competition requirements, will have to quit the market, thus posing more burdens to them even though the monetary stability atmosphere in the country pushed them to demand disengagement with banks. This disengagement materialized late 2002.
He is in the belief that the absence of small-sized entities may allow these firms to fill the gap they left, especially regarding monetary transfers made by exchange firms worldwide.
In exclusive statements to Al-Alam Al-Youm paper, he added that investment opportunities in Egypt are very strong, as Egypt has a distinguished position on geographical and economic maps.

Under the above heading, Solyman Goda, a columnist with Al-Wafd, writes a back-page article to say: When I (the writer) read the letter sent to Ahmed Nazif, the prime minister-designate, to form a new cabinet, I found that it fell short of the political reform issue.
If someone says that a priority in this stage should be given to the grinding economic predicament I can advise him to get back to the letter in question, which says the economic reform issue is almost over and, thence, the new cabinet has other tasks, mainly including modern technology, in which the new premier is specialized.
50% said that the ex-government performance was "weak", 30% said "acceptable" and 20% said "good".
Like all ministers of a technocrat background, the man is taciturn when the issue dealt with transcends his technical realm. It is not clear, therefore, how important decisions may be taken regarding the activation of markets, raising the rates of development, increasing exports, the rate of exchange control or controlling the growing deficit in the state public budget.
The issue of political reform has attracted so much public interest and attention that it has almost reached the point of no return. This has even made state symbols and leaderships deal with that issue which used to be a taboo that cannot be broached.
Samir Ragab, board chairman of Al-Gomhouria newspaper, wrote an article about the new cabinet reshuffle to say: One of the obvious characteristics of the new government is that it was appointed to protect and defend the interests of the majority and achieve their aspirations and ambitions.
The new cabinet reshuffle included, for the first time, figures with no relation whatsoever to the government. They firmly believe in the policy of economic liberalization both in form and content.
In view of the emergency state in effect in Egypt since 1981; under the dilapidated Constitution which has no longer been fit for survival; without a new political platform; and in the dominant state of chaos and improvision, a new government was formed in the way underground organizations are formed, regardless of the public opinion and political forces.
The new cabinet formation included 2 former and 2 incumbent university presidents.
They slammed failure to bring to book ministers and key officials before and after resignation or retirement.
For the first time in many years and many governments, we have been released of the economists' control over the government, Daoud added, noting that since Ali Lotfi's government, Egypt concentrated its vision on the economic crisis only, as if Egypt has no other crises. Even this did not result in a solution to the crisis.
For his part, Secretary General of Al-Wafd Party Al-Sayed Badawi said, "The most important demand required from the government is political reform. We cannot disregard the fact that along more than 20 years, 6 governments failed to make any popular or political achievement. "Conditions have worsened due to political corruption. Therefore, the conditions would be improved only through a genuine and complete political and democratic reform that depends on transparency, accountability and power rotation.
On such grounds relies the new government formation in contrast to its former counterparts tracks. This confirms an understanding of the real reasons for chronic crises in Egypt, especially disregarding the importance of modernizing the state and its techniques through integration with the technology community to make the most of it in the development of the infrastructure to attract further investments and therefore achieve a development leap, create job opportunities and more importantly benefit by the enhanced return of contracts with international modern information and communications technology bloc.
Ever since the new generation started its move to rectify positions in the ruling party and invest the feedback in the development of the state's positions it has relied on personal connections to select persons with academic assets and investment experience or technological culture based on personal ambition and talents.
The process of selecting the new government elements contain extremely important indications confirming the launch of the second stage of Egyptian state modernization. It indicates the implementation of the rule of displacement and renovation instead of the immediate all-out coup and change. Such a strategy has been adopted by the young generation against the old guard inside the National Democratic Party two years ago. Instead of imposing the new generation, it adopted the strategy of calm gradual solutions through a series of practices and the enhancement of its capacities and influence deliberately without any violent public confrontations.
What raises fears, too, is the fact that the government formation is empty of any elements in the political experience or record or elements that had positions towards pending thorny issues in the society. This may lead to the government continuation of refrainment from dealing with the political and constitutional file required for the achievement of a genuine success of the aspired after economic reform, thus remaining hostage to economic missions and technicalities.
Washington exerts pressure on the Egyptian side to activate the QIZ projects that consecrate the Israeli access into the Egyptian and Arab economy, Al-Ezabi said, adding that there are many factors that lessen the reliability of the Egyptian situation that rejects the establishment of such zones. For instance, the textile industry would face a crisis as a result of cancelling the quota system as of next January. Moreover, many countries such as China, Turkey and Thailand are waiting for getting access to the American market in the fields of textile and ready-made clothes. On the other hand, the Egyptian products' competitive edge is humble, so long as the customs charges hitting 30% are still imposed on them, as a condition for giving them access to the US market, not to mention the profits promoted by the advocates of such zones, estimated at 500 million dollars.
The Jordanian textile exports to the US market topped 500 million dollars last year, compared to 12 million dollars in 1997. This rise would have a direct effect on Egyptian decision taking regarding the QIZ, especially as Israel has contributions, albeit limited, in some textile and ready-made projects in Egypt, Al-Darsh said.

EGYPTIAN POLITICIANS SEE NO REAL CHANGE IN NEW GOVERNMENT
The new government, like previous ones, will fail to achieve tangible aims because the agenda is the same and there is no specific view for comprehensive reform, whether political or economic, Abaza said. Such a reform, he added, can only be achieved through a real democratic system along with an atmosphere of transparency, parliamentary and public control through free media.
"Let's wait, as there may be good things, particularly as we do not have enough information to judge the new government.
Chairman of the Businessmen Association, Gamal Al-Nazer said the presence of Dr. Nazif at the top of the new government and his record in the communications ministry implies that he has administrative skills and is able to lead a working team and coordinate between ministries. Moreover, the establishment of the investment ministry was a main demand by the private sector for a long time. The presence of Dr. Youssef Botros Ghali as a finance minister will make him more successful now that he has been acquainted with the problems of the financial sector which impede external trade.
Assistant manager of the Al-Ahram Center for Strategic Studies researcher, Nabil Abdel-Fattah said the first remark about the new make-up is confusion and non-existence of a clear view of the part of the prime minister as he took some time in naming the new elements of the government.

Moreover, serious discussions are being held to change the provision which stipulates that a half of the parliament members should be of white collar and the other half of blue collar. This law has been put into effect since 23rd July 1952 Revolution.
Under this headline, Mohamed Abou-Hadid of Al-Gomhouria wrote to say: In the resigned cabinet of Dr. Atef Ebeid, Safwat El-Sherif and Dr. Youssef Wali were the oldest ministers, as they occupied their posts at the same time on 3rd January 1982 and retained them for 22 years and 6 months.
Minister of Defence and Military Production Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi has the second longest term in office following Farouk Hosni who preceded him by about four years. Tantawi was appointed on 20th May 1991.
Dr. Ghali is also the "Joker minister" since he has been appointed for four ministries.

An experiment of launching the Israeli Hetz (arrow) missile will be conducted soon in the US after the missile launchers are transported to the US, said the Hebrew Maariv newspaper. The Israelis and Americans will take part in the experiment. The experiment has been regarded by Israeli security milieus as a "historical event", or rather a dramatic quantum leap in the military cooperation between Washington and Tel Aviv and an American approval of Israel's development of that missile. "It is the only missile worldwide that can intercept inter-continental ballistic missiles," they added.
Military sources see that the development of Hetz and the deployment of Patriot missiles are very important in view of the news that have it that Syria had developed a 700-km-range Scud missile that could bear chemical warheads, thus threatening Israel as a whole. "They are also a response to Iran's possession of long-range ballistic missiles Shahab 3," they added.
Sources close to the security bodies and the Foreign Ministry say that the plan has three programmes to deal with the situation once Arafat passes away.
Chaos will go rampant and there would be a struggle for power afterwards. In the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) a coup will be made against the traditional leadership. The elements, who will take over, believe only in resisting the Israeli occupation. They reject any understanding with the authority, and do not accept any settlement.
* Having previous contacts from now on to agree that Arafat be buried in Abu Dies rather than the campus of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, so as to avoid problems at that time.
Ihud Olmert, acting prime minister, commented on leaking that plan saying, "All that I can say is that the Israeli government takes no interest in harming Arafat at all."
Such developments cannot be regarded as mere ink on paper or just unbinding political statements on the Arab model.
This challenge crystallized clearly in light of the fact that the incumbent NATO is different from the one that was existing during the cold war era. The latter's first mission was to defend Western Europe and the American interests against the Soviet camp that broke up later on.
It is not a secret that the Egyptian doubts regarding NATO's new role have become stronger, as the new American policy confirms that the NATO should play a role in the required changes or reforms in the Arab region. It is to be mentioned that Condoleezza Rice referred in December 2003 that NATO should open offices in the Arab countries to oversee and make sure of the implementation of the required reforms. This means that NATO will play the role of guardian of Arab internal changes. Moreover, NATO is a main international player in the so-called anti-terrorism war.
Considering the sensitivity of the issue of security among the Arab countries, the very simple starting point of setting up a security Arab forum, in which the Arab countries will exchange their security concerns frankly and transparently and without certain institutional commitments, might be a step towards the Arab realization of both the security challenges that face the Arab region as a whole and the security concerns of each party.
69 MAGHREBIAN WOMEN TRAINED IN LEADERSHIP IN US INSTITUTE
The US ambassador to Tunis said at the closing up ceremony of the training course that the Middle East Partnership Initiative's aim to help women occupy leading posts in their societies does not target the Maghrebian women only but rather all the region's women.
Sources linked the new changes with great participations to choosing a new political and public personality from young cadres to hold the NDP Secretary General position at the end of the congress with a view to separating between this post and the chairmanship of Shura Council which is currently occupied by Safwat Al-Sherif. This comes within the framework of a tendency to develop and activate partisan action in the coming stage.
Egyptian partisans, parliamentarians and activists criticized the parties law, pointing out that it is full of mistakes and against parties and looks down on parties. It contains several violations for the constitution.
Abul-Ela Madi, founders' agent of Al-Wasat Party which was refused three times by the parties committee, said the refusal does not relate to his party's platform but rather to the ruling party desire to have no rivals.

SELLING PUBLIC FUND SHARES IN JOINT STOCK COMPANIES ASSIGNED TO INVESTMENT MINISTRY

NEW STRATEGY FOR BOOSTING AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS TO SAUDI MARKET
Under this strategy, contracts would be concluded with the auctioneers nominated by the attorney - on his own responsibility - for auctions of Jeddah and Riyadh with a view to directing shipments to the auction of the highest price. The main reference in this regard would be the attorney not the auctioneer, as the two parties would be opponents where the auctioneer wants quick selling to get his commission while the attorney wants selling at the highest price for the interest of exporters. Over the coming period, Egyptian exporters would present competitive export offers in terms of quality, price, packaging and adherence to the conditions of supply of products to the Saudi market. Moreover, Egyptian exporters would create channels of contact and continuous dealings with Saudi importers away from casual deals, in addition to concluding contracts with Saudi trade agencies and institutions that have distinguished competitiveness, thus achieving the marketing aims of Egyptian companies according to the real study of the market.

CONTROVERSY OVER A COURT RULING RENDERING CUSTOMS SERVICE CHARGES UNCONSTITUTIONAL
Nevertheless, it transpired later that the Supreme Constitutional Court issued a ruling, a copy of which was got by Asharq Al-Awsat, on 5 September rendering the service charges at customs outlets unconstitutional. The court ruled that the first and last paragraphs of article 111 of the customs law no. 66 of 1963 are unconstitutional. Thus, the ministerial decrees that provide for imposing service charges at customs outlets were dropped. Former head of the Customs Department Kamel Al-Naggar said the application of the economic reform program in the early 1990s was followed by reduction of some categories of the customs tariff.
For his part, professor of financial legislation and lawyer at the Court of Cassation Dr. Zakaria Bayyoumi said the ruling on unconstitutionality of service charges would be applied retrospectively for two reasons; the first is that the law no. 168 of 1998 did not cancel the retroactive application of unconstitutionality rulings related to non-tax texts. The second reason is that the ruling of the Supreme Constitutional Court on dropping the finance minister's decrees regarding imposition of service charges was issued on a non-tax text, as it relates to the cancellation of charges rather than taxes. So, the ruling explained clearly the difference between a charge and tax. Thus, the ruling should be applied retroactively to future

This is based on Egypt's central position, available heavy industry potential and low production costs. A study is also underway for making use of the experiment of those Russian plants, which turned from military industries to civil manufacturing, in the Egyptian industrial modernization program, in addition to cooperation in making influenza serums at the factories of the Biological Products and Vaccines Holing Company.

The US Department of State said on Saturday that the US Administration was keen on stressing the vital role played by Egypt in the Middle East region to achieve peace and stability. The statements came after the US House of Representatives dropped a motion to reduce US aid to Egypt.
US economic aid to Egypt stood at $571 million and it is being used in sanitary, technical and infrastructure projects in Egypt to improve the living standards of citizens.
It is unintelligible why our press or rulers should not pause before the reasons explained by the American Administration and Congressmen in their defence for the maintenance of such assistance.
Addressing the Congress, Colin Powell says, "Any change in military assistance to Egypt may heavily undermine the strong Egyptian American partnership which was strongly built after Camp David Accords which still constitute the firm Foundation for achieving the goals of American foreign policy in the Middle East.
The discussions about the military assistance to Egypt were a chance to come to grips with many facts, about which some people are in the dark while others know but wink at.

Pope Shenouda said there is a big common ground between Islam and Christianity in promoting ethics and noble morals without intervening in the creeds of each other.
In exclusives to Al-Masry Al-Youm, Tantawi stressed that the committee does not interfere in the Egyptian internal affairs and that Egypt has nothing to hide as far as religious freedoms are concerned.
American sources told Asharq Al-Awsat that Pope Shenouda Patriarch of Saint Mark Episcopate apologized for not receiving the delegation of the US Committee of International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) which is currently visiting Cairo.
However, the official uncovered attempts to convince him to meet the USCIRF on another day.
On the other hand, an official source in the papal Cathedral in Abbasseya said, "Egypt's fraternity and religious freedom necessitate refusing to meet such committees that seek to intervene in Egypt's internal affairs."
In return, NHRC deputy Dr. Ahjmed Kamal Aboul-Magd chairman blasted the USCIRF, saying that the Egyptians know well how to resolve their problems. They are not in need of any help from anybody, Aboul-Magd said.
The Copts believe they could solve their simple daily life problems through dialogue with the political leadership, which loses no time in getting to solve their problems.
Al-Sha'er told AL-Masry Al-Youm that he met the US committee members inside the parliament's hall within the framework of USCIRF meeting with the PA's Committee on Foreign Relations. "I reject the USCIRF's visit to the parliament.
ACTIVITY OF USCIRF
The committee member also said that another member of the Committee, withdrew from the meeting which was attended by Mohamed Othman after that member had whispered to them, in his capacity as the political analyst of the committee, that it is dangerous to deal with a number of issues, warning that this may cause a big problem.

Nuclear energy experts wondered why the government failed to search and prospect for Uranium, even though it is available in huge quantities in the Eastern Desert and Sinai.
Hammad, who works as a consultant of the International Atomic Energy Agency's technical committee, said that Egypt should search for new energies such as the nuclear energy in lieu of depletable oil.

Earlier, the society said that the event, the first of its kind in Palestine, was meant to urge individuals and institutions to possess artistic works.
Eighteen Palestinian artists donated their works to the society and two-thirds of each painting price would be allocated to the activities of the society while the artist would keep the third for himself.
"We always feel that plastic art has not taken due attention in Palestine. This activity is very important and the event fares well".
Haneya who, like other Hamas leaders, has disappeared since the assassination of Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and then Dr. Abdel-Aziz Rantisi last March and April, said that the Palestinian Authority is fully to blame for what happened. He added that the condition undergone by Gaza Strip was a natural result of the Authority's policy and its bodies' practices in the last years. It also reflects the state of corruption, which ran rampant in different fields. Although reform sometimes seemed to be sought, the same policies and practices went on unimpeded.
He added that the Palestinians should react by reinforcing solidarity, banning internecine fighting sparing Palestinian blood and protecting the resistance and uprising project.

MESH'AL MAKES PHONE CALLS WITH ARAFAT, ABBAS Hamas Politburo chief Khalid Mesh'al warned against "taking up arms" against each other in two separate phone conversations with Palestinian National Authority (PNA) chairman Yasser Arafat and former prime minister Mahmoud Abbas.
Hamas and Islamic Jihad made no haste comments on the latest goings-on in Gaza, as was the case with the Egyptian proposed role in the Sharon's unilateral disengagement plan.
High-ranking Palestinian sources said though Arafat acted quite late, the man offered a cover for resistance and Palestinian principled stances.
They decided that the threats to Israel no longer come from the Iraqi or Syrian armament, but rather from the Iranian nuclear armament and the sophisticated Egyptian weaponry as well as the regional terrorist organizations access to sophisticated unconventional weapons.
It also possesses some unconventional, chemical and biological weapons and is persistently seeking to develop nuclear weapons.
Security leaders said that the second threat to Israel is also related to Iran, Lebanese Hizbullah and Al-Qaeda terrorist organization as well as various Palestinian organizations, as they regard Israel its fundamental target.
The concern that is ranked third on the list of Israeli fears lies in Egypt. In spite of the peace treaty signed between Israel and Egypt, the Egyptian army is remarkably keen on developing its military arsenal and acquisition of American weaponry. Although security leaders said that they did not sense any danger from Egypt in the short term, such armament causes their concern about the future.
This, however, does not make the Israeli military forget Syria as, to them, it is still Iran's partner in supporting Hizbullah and other resistance organizations.
50 POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS PARTIES WILL PARTICIPATE IN IRAQI "NATIONAL CONFERENCE"
Any candidate should not be under 30 years, nor should he have committed crimes or occupied a leading position in the disbanded Baath party, he pointed out.

ARABS' DEBTS EXCEEDED $600 BILLION AND MAY RISE EVEN HIGHER
Some reports issued by the Arab Monetary Fund and the AL Economic and Social Council pointed out that such domestic and external debts ranged from $550 to 600 billion and are steadily on the rise as a result of the debt service and the low national income of most Arab countries, with the relative exception of the oil Gulf states. The volume of external debts in 2003 amounted to over $160 billion compared with $144 billion in 2000 according to the unified Arab economic report which regarded the Arab debts case as a result of a structural crisis in Arab economies. This crisis started to escalate gradually 3 decades ago as a result of international crises like the monetary system crisis, the energy crisis, the food and unemployment crises as well as the crises of debts in the world. This has caused the region's economies to suffer from recession and stagnation while they were suffering from sluggish GDP rates of growth, widening the food gap so much so that it became a must to borrow from Western countries and the US as well as international financing institutions to save the government's face regarding the deterioration of the Arab citizen's real income compared with his counterpart in European countries as no remarkable growth was witnessed by that income while the costs of living rose as a result of rising prices and the devaluation of the domestic currency against the main currencies. When the Egyptian pound, for example devaluated against the American dollar, inflation occurred, thus negatively impacting on the payment balance and weakening the competitive edge of Arab exports on international markets. This, consequently, caused a disruption in Arab trade balances.
He added that borrowing from abroad is not totally wrong as it may have positive effects when it supports plans of economic and social development through the exploitation of such loans for full employment of domestic
The reactors are expected to be erected in Mersin Province, south of Turkey, or Sinop on the Black Sea.
The milieus told Al-Hayat that, if he wins a second term in office next November, Bush will work to launch a military strike against Iran and topple the regime in Tehran.
Members of the US Administration urge that tendency due to "worry about the policy of deception and manipulation adopted by Iran, particularly with respect to its nuclear arsenal and the spread of anarchy in the Iraqi arena".
This means that the uni-superpower in the world which is currently haunted by the idea of the rise of a unified Europe on the one hand and China on the other hand needs to control one of the most important economic growth tools: energy and its prices.
The reinforcement of American influence in oil regions did always need excuses and justifications like those supplied by Osama Bin Laden on September 11th 2001 and by Saddam in the Gulf in 1991.
In other words, small countries are not allowed to play the game of the big, especially when the court is vital like the Gulf region which makes anybody controlling it in a position to control oil prices and hence production cost and consumption in big industrial countries.
Iran's determination today to reinforce its influence in Iraq at the expense of American influence and its adherence to its nuclear programme suggest that Tehran did not learn the lesson of Mossaegh's regime fall in 1953 or Shah's regime fall in 1979 or the "double containment" policy based on encouraging the Iraqi president in 1980 to launch the 8-year war backed by Washington to exhaust Iran and rein in its regional ambition.
The American government allocated $10 million to support cotton farmers in the USA and to help them sell their raw cotton at competitive prices inside and outside America. The competition between American cotton production and the Egyptian one on American market became unequal as American cotton price is less than the Egyptian one by 30%. Egyptian exporters failed to market 1.3 million kantars of long-staple cotton whether internally or externally. The Egyptian cotton stockpiled in warehouses, which loads exporters with extra burdens of storing and insurance costs which amounted to LE300 million.

He said, "It would be difficult for such entities to raise their capital to 500 million pounds in the remaining period in light of absence of any serious desire on the part of investors to increase their investments. Those banks would, therefore, have to withdraw or merge into other big entities.
Procedures are underway for founding a new risk capital company with a capital of 8 million pounds to work in the Egyptian market.

Hamza's case may even be more complicated because it is only natural that a weak youth may feel helpless in front of favouritism and corruption in Egypt, but to wrong or dare to wrong a person so famous, talented and successful as Mamdouh Hamza is surely one of the wonders of the democratic institutionalized government in Egypt!
In the interview, the engineer who left his fingerprint on Bibliotheca Alexandrina as well as other major projects in most Arab and Western countries said that his office used to employ 400 personnel who were reduced to 250 and will perhaps go down even further due to persecution. The interview weighed so heavily on me as I wondered whether even the outstanding would have to be arrested in London or Paris so that their cases might be known to us.
One thousand questions have made me feel helpless as a journalist. More seriously even, the government cannot see such questions in the least!
There must be such a big disruption and excesses in the Housing Ministry, that allowed the Minister, according to Al-Gomhouria reports, to prevent Hamza from entering the Ministry and, therefore, from pursuing his works.
The case, from this perspective, is a political one that is related to the rule's integrity and public confidence in it. This is a time for reckoning!
The case is in the hands of judicial and security agencies in Britain, he said, emphasizing that no Egyptian security agency contacted the office or Hamza's partners. The question is related to Hamza in his personal, rather than professional capacity.

This phenomenon added further discontent to the citizens who are already discontented with high prices, bread queues and low salaries.
However, the phenomenon does not having anything to do with security measures any more as it turned into a kind of haughtiness and lavishness.
The scene in streets was so provocative, particularly as some guards tended to show off, drive cars at breakneck speed and breach traffic rules.

For his part, Gamal Mubarak appears to have turned a deaf ear to people's talk, which, he believes, is often fruitless and useless.
Well...GGamal has given himself unpermitted access to the "house", finding no advisor who can tell him that Egypt is a house whose owners cherish and are proud of it even if it is made of mud and straw, and that the rules of entering the house, including permission, should be respected. So, he may know whether he is welcome, he may not deal with them in a supercilious and haughty way in their house, or impose himself on them. He may also give them the right to choose the place where they can meet him.
After all, Gamal should reconsider his vision, take permission from this people and launch a fresh starting point.

The four banks make endeavours to make sure that the ministry is serious in implementing the "mechanism" to help itself play a role in resuming lending of those units, some of which need to complete their activities to pay off the remaining installments.
Three private and joint banks, namely Egyptian Commercial Bank (ECB), Suez Canal Bank and United Bank of Egypt, presented a request to the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) to get its approval to amalgamate in one banking entity of paid-up capital in excess of 600 million pounds.
Deputy board chairman and managing director of the ECB Gamal Muharram refused to comment on the request submitted to the CBE. Meanwhile, he said the ECB has alternatives for increasing its paid-up capital to 500 million pounds in order to comply with the banking act and the decisions taken by the CBE board which compel banks to increase their capital by the middle of next July at most.
NBE PUTS UP ITS SHARE IN MIDOR REFINERY FOR SALE
The coming few weeks are expected to witness the implementation of a plan to promote some female bankers to higher echelons, especially at the level of the four public banks where such changes will be decided after the general assemblies discuss budgets and financial statements of profits and losses next December, banking sources said.
In Bank of Alexandria, its deputy chairwoman Fatama Lotfi is expected to be promoted to the chairmanship post, especially as its president Mahmoud Abdel-Latif is expected to head Banque Misr in case its incumbent president Mohamed Barakat headed the National Bank of Egypt whose president Hussein Abdel-Aziz may be pensioned off, especially as he was given an extra term in office after he had reached retirement age. The next stage will also witness the promotion of Bank of Alexandria's advisor Laila Abu Liela.
Despite the progress made by Egyptian ladies to occupy leading posts in banks, men see that women's role is still limited, especially in light of the fact that no lady has ever headed any Egyptian private or public bank.
On the other hand, vice-president of Bank of Alexandria Fatama Lotfi emphasized that promoting females bankers to higher positions was ascribed in the first place to their efficiency, pointing out that there was no particular plan to promote ladies.
Some prominent ladies are supported by working teams in their banks. Ironically, most of those teams are men, Yassin said.
He told the Middle East News Agency (MENA) that total spending on investment, both public and private, also shot up by around 10 billion pounds to 81 billion pounds last year.

1.9 BILLION POUNDS TO RUN TRAINS ELECTRONICALLY
Minister of Petroleum Sameh Fahmi said investment in the oil, gas and petrochemical industry is a cornerstone for the ministry's strategy.
The pattern of investment in the oil sector changed over the last five years, with foreign investments having hit around 9.5 billion US dollars, including 2.8 billion dollars' worth of non-recoverable investments and 6.7 billion pounds' worth of research, exploration and development investments.

Minister of Foreign Trade and Industry Rashid Mohamed Rashid reiterated that Egypt would not accept a qualified industrial zone (QIZ) with the US unless it brought it genuine economic benefits.
The QIZ, which allows Egypt to export tariff-free products to the US provided that they include an Israeli stake, is mainly aimed to increase Egyptian exports. Jordan, which concluded a similar deal with the US four years ago, has managed to increase its exports to the US up to 900 million US dollars from 1.5 million US dollars.

Egyptian and Russian sources agree that volume of bilateral trade is so meager if taken into account the economic potentials of the two countries. Russian official statistics pointed out that the volume of the trade exchange between Egypt and Russia was estimated at 417 million dollars last year, or 2% of the Egyptian external trade in comparison to 455.6 million dollars in 2001 and 508 million dollars in 2002.

MISR IRAN BANK RAISES CAPITAL BY $11 MILLION
Bahgat's debts to 3 public banks to be settled Al-Alam Al-Youm daily learnt that a final agreement was reached yesterday (21 November) between the famous businessman Ahmed Bahgat on one hand and Chairman of the National Bank of Egypt (NBE) Hussein Abdel Aziz and Chairman of the Bank of Alexandria Mahmoud Abdel-Lattif. According to that agreement bad debts due on Bahgat Group to the two banks which were estimated at over 2 billion pounds would be settled.
* Debts shall be repaid over 7 years.
BANKS, BAHGAT GROUP TO CLINCH HUGE DEBT-SETTLEMENT DEAL
This means that the government will seek seriously to reach settlement deals with insolvent debtors both at home and abroad to have 17 billion pounds' worth of debts cleared.
Consumption is in the safe limits and the ministry supplies governorates with 680,000 tons of wheat on a monthly basis in addition to 125,000 tons as an additional share for facing the increase in consumption.
Experts warned of further probable consequences in case of continuation of dollar's decline on international capital markets, particularly as the American policy now depends on the weak dollar to decrease the trade balance deficit by increasing exports and decreasing imports.
Banks did not monitor any marked shift to deposit in euro or pound sterling at the expense of dollar.
For his part, head of exchange firms division at the Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Mohamed Hassan Al-Abyad noticed a relative increase in demand for dollar, especially after Eid El-Fitr. The weakness of companies' euro sources made them incapable of meeting the growing demand for that currency. Al-Abyad expected the demand for the dollar to continue over the coming weeks. This is a normal matter in such a time every year due to the increase of imports.
Zaki expected that such burdens will increase this year if the euro continued increasing, especially in light of indicators that expect a noticeable increase in imports due to a decline of import costs after the clear decline of the new customs duties which were put into effect as of 10/9/2004. It is required to redistribute the map of imports so as to curb probable losses, he said. He suggested looking for other alternatives to the European-made raw materials, intermediary products, production input and capital equipment whose prices jumped up against other currencies related to the dollar, including the Egyptian pound.
Egypt has an ambitious plan to double the volume of such investments and inject them into a fresh tourist destination, which is the "time share", which Egypt is currently promoting, he said. Through the "time share", a tourist can find a permanent accommodation in the North Coast and the Red Sea areas, which can encourage him to repeat his visit to Egypt, Al-Maghrabi added.
Egypt is ready for receiving foreign investments as its economy growth rate surged up from 3.2% to 4.1% last year and is expected to rise to 5% this year, said Premier Ahmed Nazif.
FIRST FUND FOR FINANCING INDUSTRY
He pointed out that there were two existing projects for financing industry; one aims at facilitating cooperation between banks and companies, and the second, which is under the auspices of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), is for defaulting projects with the National Bank of Egypt (NBE) and Banque Misr through the cooperation with Industries Federation and industry modernization program, especially as these methods are the fastest way for raising projects from fall and creating new job openings.
For his part, Investment Concord Company chairman Mohamed Younis said that he would contribute to increasing capitals of joint stock companies for 12 years. Then, he would separate by contribution rate and such a contribution would be put up for public subscription, and investment would take place in profit-making companies or losing companies whose positions may be improved, if capital is provided. A priority will be given to those companies which have export potential.
Name of sheikh Moussa Helal, chieftain of the Arab Al-Mahameed tribe in Darfur emerged as leader of the Janjaweed militia. Darfur rebels also put Helal on top of a list of names who are allegedly accused of perpetrating ethnic cleansing.
Q: Who are you - I mean you and your tribe?
Q: Being Arab travelling herdsmen searching for grasslands was the reason for conflicts between Al-Mahameed and other farming tribes, who are mostly of African origin, wasn't it?
For example, 1150 heads of camels were stolen: can a thief do that.
A: Yes, the agenda was at first secret but it was unveiled latter on through their circulars and mobilization of some tribes against Arab ones.
Q: Don't you resort to official authorities to settle such skirmishes?
In an area called Dengo, north Kabkabiya, North Darfur province, they poisoned all our wells, an action that claimed the lives of a number of herdsmen and cattle. They also burned our grasslands in Nerteni.
A: Yes, every year they burn and encroach upon our grasslands in a regular and provocative way. The Ghor and Zaghawa's agenda is political and authoritative in an illegitimate way.
A: Firstly, the Janjaweed is an old local term in Darfur language. It is "Janjaweet" not "Janaweed". The Janjaweed are thieves and armed highwaymen.
A: The question should rather be: Who have accused us?
Q: What was your feeling and reaction?
I'm really surprised how great entities like the USA and the UN are trapped in misinformation unless they are intent on spreading such misleading information.
A: Yes.
A: He talked to me generally about Darfur and its security Q: Didn't he talk to you about any charges?
Q: Don't you or the other blacklisted elements fear that you may be tried internationally in a way or another?
A: Yes, they include some Arabs, including some of my clan, like the fact that John Garang's movement in south Sudan includes some northerners. Therefore, it is inaccurate to talk about a conflict between the Arabs and the Africans.
Most of the other tribes did the same and some of their youths were enlisted. Frankly speaking, such steps helped curb rebellion.
The volatile situation in Darfur can be traced in history. At first, the dispute was on the conventional tribal level. These disputes used to happen not only in Darfur area but in all parts of Sudan and many other African countries between Bedouins and farmers over water and pasturelands.
Then, Sudan's Liberation Movement and Justice and Equity Movement were formed at that atmosphere. Elements of these two movements traveled abroad and sought help from anti-Sudan organizations. Unfortunately, they found a safe haven in some foreign countries, including Eritrea and Germany. Moreover, they tried to garner support from some political circles, including the US Zionist Conservative right, and non-governmental organizations. Mass media, as usual, played an important role in that crisis, as they used to air scenes from Darfur that invoke similar tragedies in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Rwanda. Pompous and sounding words such as "ethnic cleansing" and "genocide" were frequently repeated by mass media to describe the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Darfur.
Third: The Sudanese government is doing well in that respect.
Al-Hussaini was, then, very concerned about Christian exodus from Jerusalem, the Palestinian lands, Israel and even from the whole Arab region.
The churches blasts in Iraq which happened at the beginning of the week is a criminal act in that context and a threat to the US control over the country.
It is noteworthy that in Saddam Hussein's repressive regime, the biggest number of churches was built. If some Christians were tortured or executed in that era, they were so treated only as members of opposition parties.
Palestine and Israel are witnessing constant Christian exodus whose reasons are not only economic factors but also related to misgivings regarding political positions.
The question raised after churches blasts in Iraq is this: Is this an Al Qaeda agenda to create a sectarian sedition in Iraq as was the case in Lebanon to hit Christianity? It is noteworthy, too, that one of Israel's goals is to manipulate terrorist acts perpetrated by some terrorist organizations to execute a strategy mentioned by Faisal Al Hussaini to try to evacuate the region of a multiplicity of sects and to enable Israel to attract world countries to its side in that conflict in the face of radical religious parties which are allegedly Islamic.
Among the personalities who condemned the attacks were Ayatallah Ali Al-Sistani, Syrian Mufti (religious authority) Ahmed Kaftaro, and Shiite leader Muqtada Al-Sadr.
Some Christians were killed or kidnapped for the sake of money just as others belonging to other sects who are targeted by gangs.
In a press statement, issued yesterday he said, "Such practices completely run counter to Islamic Sharia which urges the human soul's sanctity and the protection and the respect of the state's citizens including followers of heavenly religions who are protected by the Islamic state.
A statement issued by his office in Najaf confirmed that all efforts should be coordinated and everybody including government and people should cooperate to put an end to assaults on Iraqis and eliminate the aggressors.
In a statement transmitted by official Syrian News Agency (SNA), he emphasized that killing Iraqis and violating Islamic and Christian sanctities, regardless of their religion or creed is pure evil for Iraq rather than honourable resistance. It rather tarnishes its image and truth."
He called on Iraqi Islamic and Christian authorities to cooperate in order to nip the sedition in the bud and forestall evil attempts to strike common life.
Q: How many universities are there in Iraq at present?
Q: How many students do you expect to be enrolled during the next 2005-2006 academic year?
Q: Are they still living in Iraq?
Sabotage rate of university buildings hit 84%, especially in south and center of Iraq in addition to some Baghdad universities. Al-Mostanseriya and the Polytechnic universities were totally destroyed.
However, they still insist on teaching their subjects. Q: What do you think about the assassination of professors, and who could be behind these assassinations?
Said Al-Lawendi member of the Egyptian Foreign Affairs Council wrote an article in Al-Ahram to the following effect: The voices calling for the deployment of Arab and Islamic forces in Iraq are setting higher these days.
Any reviewer of the USA policy since the outbreak of the first World War will find that the policy of hiding behind others has been a constant policy in the American diplomacy orientations. The brunt of all the losses would thus be borne by those in the forefront while the USA wins in two ways, firstly by suffering the least possible losses and secondly by emerging victorious. Its case at the end of the Second World War may be cited as an example here and then the others case of the Balkans war when it pushed the NATO forces (rather than the American forces alone) and in the Kuwait Liberation war in 1991, it also suffered the fewest casualties among its troops thanks to Arab forces participation.
such an idea advocated by some parties aims, among other things, at the manipulation of facts and developments to serve only the American scheme aiming at the imposition of full American control over Iraq and turning its lands into an American springboard in the Greater Middle East project!
However, it can safely be said that even if such American tricks could take in the American electorate (directed by Washington's mass media machine) they would not manage to lead the Arab people's up the garden path as they see any American presence in Iraq as occupation.
Addressing Israelis, Abu-Zohr said, "You (Israelis) have neither mercy nor morals, we sacrificed ourselves, lost our families, home and relatives for the sake of you but you leave us in the lurch."
Due to his dangerous role, he was sentenced to death in Lebanon, as a result his family took its way to Lebanon leaving him in Israel.
About 2500 persons of Lahd militants are currently living in Israel, 100 persons of them, including key officers are currently leading a respectable life while the rest are leading a miserable life.
Sources inside the Lebanese Hizbullah and Amal Movement omitted to comment on a statement by a group called 'Gaddafi Fedayeen' threatened those who filed a lawsuit before the Lebanese judiciary about the disappearance of the Lebanese Shiite cleric Mussa Al-Sadr during a visit he paid to Libya, with paying dearly.
According to well-informed sources, this group is likely to be one of the Lebanon based groups affiliated to the Libyan Revolutionary Committees.
Al-Amoudi conveyed his deep apology and regret, through his lawyer Stanley Cohen, to the Saudi government and people for his "limited" role, according to his lawyer, in the Libyan conspiracy.
For his part, the prosecutor announced the withdrawal of the remaining charges, demanding that the case-related documents be classified as secret. The three charges are: receiving funds from a foreign country (Libya); lying to the immigration department; and evading taxes.
Although some experts including Mahfel, believe that the dialect spoken by the long-lived people of Ma'lola, Jab'adin and Bakh'a villages, 50 kilometers to the north of Damascus, is not the Christ language but rather an Aramaic dialect, Rizkallah moved among such villages and others to preserve the Christ's language.
Rizkallah told Al-Hayat that he was concentrating his efforts to persuade youths to learn how to speak and write the Aramaic, and to be able to compose poetry and sing some folkloric songs.
For being isolated, Ma'lola kept an Aramaic dialect even though other languages affected it because it is a first-place tourist village.
CONTROVERSY IN BAHRAIN OVER SETTING UP AUTHORITY FOR PROPAGATING VIRTUE There is much controversy in Bahrain over a parliamentary proposal by a fundamentalist deputy to set an authority for the propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice which may not enjoy any security powers.
Al-Miawda, head of fundamentalist Political Originality Society and its parliamentary bloc pointed that he who thinks that the authority of the propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice would be domineering are lacking in understanding and extremely ignorant. He accused secularists of "maliciously marring the tenet of virtue propagation through fabricated lies". He added that the fact that "they control the mass media prevents exposing their scandals and lies".
Al-Na'imi showed understanding of the traders' fears of the fundamentalist movement and the propositions put forward by some religious scholars in some economic and social aspects, thus impeding social development and progress and running counter to Bahrain's commitments to the international charters and laws which it had signed.
Machines, electric and electronic appliances represented about 50% of total foreign trade exchange at free zones. Mobile sets, computer hardware, machines and receivers were the main traded items while natural diamond and tobacco topped the list of other traded items, the economic bulletin issued by the chamber said.
Natural diamond trade hit 211 million dirhams and India was its main exporter while Belgium was the main re-exporter of it. Indian exports of natural diamonds increased by 84% compared to 2002.
Dubai free trade zones achieved a trade surplus of one billion dirhams with Kuwait, Iraq and Pakistan.
Abou Sida pointed out that the goal of the forum was to ensure the sustainability of dialogue between all parties (the officialdom, the elite and the people) over reform and democratic change in Arab countries.
The forum, announced two days ago, will be joined by 18 personalities from Egypt, Tunisia, Lebanon, Iraq, Algeria, Syria and Kuwait.
Following a meeting held by the Council yesterday (29th July), Deputy chairman of the council, Dr. Ahmed Kamal Aboul Majd said that the report ignored assets while underlining debits from its own point of view.
NEW STAGE IN ALGERIA
Al-Amari, who has led the army in the face of fundamentalist violence since 1992, is one of the architects of former president Al-Shazli Bin Jadid's resignation.
The two sides, however, were keen on keeping those differences behind the scenes. Power struggle went on through symbolic frames rather than direct confrontation: The President confirmed his adherence to his competences enshrined in the constitution, and the military institution confirms its neutrality towards the internal conflict along with its attachment to the role of the Republic's guard.
Bouteflika was also unable to get rid of certain officers, especially in the security bodies.
Bouteflika's landslide in the elections, in which the role of the military establishment was believed to be so limited in comparison with the previous elections, pointed out that coexistence is tending to end.
All these factors show a transfer of weight in decision-making from the defense ministry to the presidency, which, according to observers' expectations, will reflect on the improvement of Algeria-Maghreb relations.
The US Alpha forces have been stationed in the historic city of Babylon since the US invasion of Iraq.
"Representatives of the Monuments Directorate in Babylon governorate and representatives of the US forces have paid a visit to such sites with a view to getting acquainted with the damage but they could not go inside the US camp. Therefore, we can not realize the real volume of damage", he said, noting that his ministry considers that any building or digging operations in such sites are sabotage acts that help distort and change the features of this historic site."
Syria let its borders with Iraq open to help the Iraqi people humanitarianly after the war on Iraq when Iraqi refugees increased till they amounted to 200,000 and 225,000.
The Syrian government offered many facilities to them including the possibility of renting and owning flats, which led to an increase of 25 percent in flat prices. Analysts believe that Damascus opposition to the war on Iraq made the Iraqi refugees prefer Syria to other countries.
However, Christians who go to Damascus live in Dowaile'a and Jermana districts. Churches also offer some services to the refugees. "We help hundreds of poor families regardless of their religion because this is a humanitarian duty," a clergyman told Al-Hayat. Citizens from Jermana told Al-Hayat on Friday that real estate prices edged up by 25 percent due to Iraqis' demand for accommodation in this area, which has about 150,000 in habitants.
Syrian Industry Chamber asked the Ministry of Economy at the end of last year to postpone access of Arab countries fizzy drinks to its territories within the framework of Great Arab Free Trade Zone, till late this year with a view to giving Syrian fizzy drinks industry a chance to complete its qualification, especially small and medium-sized establishments whose number exceeds 70 ones. These establishments provide more than 1500 job opportunities.
These products were excluded in order to protect national production from fierce competition.
The Bush Administration, which faces an aggravating situation in Iraq, is seeking to lobby the international community to pressurize Iran without resorting to military means that could further ignite the Iraqi battleground and expand the scope of conflict, sources told Al-Hayat newspaper.
Meanwhile, the sources expressed deep concern over the tough Israeli positions that put the Iranian nuclear program on top of the list of potential threats to the Hebrew State. Israel could launch a military strike against Iranian nuclear facilities, as was the case with the Iraqi nuclear program in the early 1980s.
Experts believe that Tehran would have two battlegrounds in that case: The Iraqi theatre in which it could move Iraqi Shiite groups to launch attacks against US troops there and offer logistics to them.
Informed sources with the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) told Al-Hayat daily that Hamas would not be an "obstacle" to any planned Israeli withdrawal from Gaza Strip under a memo of understanding with Egypt during a recent visit to Cairo by Hamas Political Bureau chief Khalid Meshaal.
Cairo, they maintained, cannot put the squeeze on Hamas to stop firing Qassam rockets as long as it has no guarantees from Israel to stop its military operations, including house-storming, killings, house demolitions and farmland-bulldozing. During the meeting, both sides could explain their positions so obviously, thus leading to the understanding, the sources added.
Hamas sources told Al-Hayat that the movement recently participated in sessions and discussions on the coming election, including its shape, relative representation and women's quota and others. However, the group has not yet decided whether it will contest the elections or not.
Addressing a rally of settlers during his visit to two settlements in the West Bank, Olmert said that the government intends to dismantle a large number of settlements after the execution of the disengagement plan.
Olmert statements coincided with other statements in Yediot Aharonot by Chief of Staff in which he said, "Theoretically and as far as military considerations are concerned, Israel can reach an agreement with Syria through withdrawing from Golan Heights."
Official figures showed that Egypt's commodity imports from Israel edged by 2.1 million pounds to 12.8 million pounds in the first three months of this year compared to the corresponding period of last year.
Israeli political milieus accused Turkey of trying to backtrack on the agreed upon water deal in favour of similar deal that Ankara has achieved with Libya.
Israel did not give much care to it at as it was not enthusiastic about the deal from the beginning and most Israeli leaders preferred canceling it and resorting to the desalination of sea water.
They discovered that there are negotiations between Turkey and Libya on a water deal according to it Turkey would export I billion cubic meters of water to Libya on a yearly basis.
We do not want Turkey to change its attitude towards Israel because of its relations with Arab countries," Israeli source said.
He proposed holding a conference to be attended by all political forces with a view to dealing with East Sudan's problems. He admitted to the presence of problems in East Sudan, but he classified them as development related ones.
In a related development, head of the Sudan People Liberation Army (SPLA) John Garang suggested forming a peacekeeping force comprising 30,000 soldiers to avoid a genocide in Darfur.
EGYPTIAN DEFENSE MINISTER TO VISIT KHARTOUM
Egypt has a strong presence there through humanitarian and health activities carried out by the Egyptian army and the Egyptian Red Crescent through camps in the areas where the displaced gathered in Darfur.
"Such movements to join parties and political forces ranks are meant to face the government mechanism in dealing with us. Such mechanism depends on two axes, the first is dismembering parties and political forces and the second is the street and the people's indifference and passivity regarding participation in political life," He noted.
He denied what was reported about the failure of Ikhwan moves towards Al-Wafd, the Nasserite and Al-Tagammo'h parties, especially the recent ones.
Egyptian People's Assembly deputies urged the Foreign Ministry to lead an intensive diplomatic Arab Islamic action in the UN and the International Committee for Human Rights to stop Jewish emigration to Israel.
EGYPTIAN LEFTISTS PREPARE FOR SETTING UP A FORUM TO UNIFY THEIR STANDS ON REFORM.
He emphasized that it was not based on any political ideological grounds but attracted anybody that believed in socialism and peaceful democratic shift of the society and the state in favour of the working classes of the Egyptian people.
The forum will end by a final session aiming at unifying the left sectors and expanding the Egyptian leftist action platform.

The sources said that the Foreign Ministry informed the embassy that Jewish Memory Foundation referred a report with a copy of Al-Lewa' Al-Islami paper to the American Congress and the White House.
PAPYRUS REVEALS JEWS' AMBITIONS IN ALEXANDRIA
Commenting on the papyrus, Al-Abbadi said, "Fomenting sedition by the Jews is deeply rooted in history. When Nero, for instance, appointed an Alexandria citizen of a Jewish origin as Egypt's ruler, the citizen changed his religion, an act that stimulated the Jews to incite the masses. The ruler, in turn, tried in vain to advise them to be wise. Therefore, he had to suppress their rebellion."
It is noteworthy that Sharon's disengagement plan, which was endorsed by the Israeli government in June, stipulates that such a route should be under Israeli control, and Gaza seaport and international airport be kept shut down.
According to Israeli sources, the current trend in such talks, which will be held shortly in Cairo, is summed up in the following:
- A group of Egyptian officers shall enter Gaza Strip to train Palestinian police and security bodies in police work, imposing order and rule of law, combating terrorism and disorder, and training other units in camps in Egypt.
Egypt stresses that the agreement should be signed under international auspices.
The Egyptians demand that the disengagement plan together with its schedule of implementation should be endorsed by the Israeli government prior to the conference.
Sharon intends to hold a decisive meeting in this respect with Labour leader Shemon Peres to convince him of the Likud viewpoint.
They will be deployed in 350 kilometers from the Mediterranean Sea, southwest Rafah, to Elat on the Red Sea.
Instructions have been issued by Egyptian Foreign Minister, Ahmed Aboul-Gheit to summon the Israeli ambassador and inform him of Cairo's rejection of Israeli government endorsement of expanding some settlements in the occupied Palestinian lands. He also asked the Egyptian embassy in Tel Aviv to carry the same message to the Israeli government.
WESTERN PLAN TO TRIGGER DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT "DAMS" IN NILE BASIN COUNTRIES: MINISTER
Addressing the World Water Day ceremony on Tuesday, the minister said there are dams and barrages on 85 percent of US watercourses.
The ministry also pointed out that Egyptian Foreign Minster Ahmed Abul-Gheit and his Sudanese counterpart Mostafa Othman Ismail signed the document that ratified the agreement reached by the two countries on 4th last April in Cairo.

In the same context, lawyer of Islamic groups in Egypt Mamdouh Ismail appealed to Al-Azhar grand sheikh Mohamed Sayed Tantawi to ask to the government to bolster Mandour and Clark's requests. Ismail, asked Tantawi to mediate with the US administration to extradite Abdel Rahman, who once worked a professor with the Religion Fundamentals College, Al-Azhar University.
The parties stipulated for accepting the initiative that each opposition party should have representatives in that committee even if that led to its membership exceeding thirty.
The new amendments were finally meant to be issued at the beginning of the new parliamentary sessions of the PA and Shura Council next November.

LULL IN REAL ESTATE MARKET DESPITE DEREGULATION OF DOLLAR
The decline in rates of exchange may lead to a decline in demand for those units but it is yet unknown to what extent that decline will go. Some expectations, however, say that the increase in income as a result of economic activity will increase individuals' ability to buy.
Every body linked such a rise to the international rise in rebar prices in the world and the devaluation of the pound against the dollar. Nevertheless, our price declines took place in real estate markets in spite of the dollar devaluation.
The problem, according to Battah lies in the fact that the real estate market will not be affected by the decline in rates of exchange but rather by the demand which is still low as a result of low wages and the general recession in the real estate market. The market will not recover unless the state sponsored economic reform could attract new investments in the field of building, thus accelerating capital rotation and raising wages levels.

40,000 CHRISTIANS LEFT IRAQ AFTER CHURCH ATTACKS
IRAQ: LEGITIMACY AND RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY MISSING!
Such a conference will not be the end of the world or an end in itself nor does it belongs to one certain group. It is rather a temporary representation framework which aims at moving the wheels of a state that is in the process of being born!
In light of such an ambiguous legitimacy, the "occupation authority" must remain the predominant power in decision-making, while the government can only serve as a facade or cover!
One of the main conditions is that Al-Mahdi Army should be disarmed and should withdraw its elements from the city. One of the most important indications of the agreement effectiveness is that Al-Sadr trend should willingly participate in the National Conference. Disarmament of the Sadrites cannot naturally be without a return. It is also natural that participation in the conference does not mean any thing for the Sadrites.
It is, however, true as well that the "Shiite" house and its extensions in the new authority has also failed either to include Sadr in the current political process or to prevent a confrontation between him and the Americans.

Muktada Al-Sadr Shiites wanted to resume fighting to drive out occupiers, while the Shiites of Al Sistani, Alawi, Al Gafari and others wanted to proceed piecemeal through policies on the other hand and having tools that could gradually replace the occupier.
Such masses are undoubtedly a victim of a Baathist policy practiced in economy, politics and culture over a period of a third of a century.
Such an argument is a reasonable way of evading a stronger contention that brands such a struggle of being so audacious and so foolish that instead of shortening the life span of occupation through politics it might lead to its perpetuation and aggravating its ferocity!
We, after all, have a stock of experiences that prove that such a question when unilaterally posed led only to calamities the latest of which is what has become of Muktada Al Sadr, the hope of the national salvation, the hope matched only in that raised by struggler brother Abu Mousab.
Sanhagi is one of the prominent cadres of the military institution. He was a military attache in France, and is considered as one of those who are close to the presidency.

The Sudanese authorities are watching out for an imminent attack by opposition armed factions on key sites in eastern Sudan from Eritrean lands. They raised the security alert level and kept all security and military bodies on standby.

Fikri emphasized that he could only do that due to the intransigence of the censorship and its former head who started procrastinations of the film throughout 8 months running even though such procedures take no more than 3 months. The film was finally rejected without giving any reasons for that rejection ignoring the approval of the three censors Committee which lauded the film when it was shown to them last February.
Ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) in Egypt has resolved the controversy on the nature of resolutions to be taken by the party's annual congress to be held next September.
The party organ "Mayo newspaper" emphasized that Al Sherif would retain his position which means that it would not be assigned to Gamal Mubarak. It pointed out that the party annual congress was not authorized to hold elections or make any changes which fall into the General Congress' terms of "reference".
The party did not point out any intention to convert the president's selection system from the referendum on one candidate to elections from among more than one candidate, which opposition forces and parties insist upon.
Some believe that some steps should be taken early enough before Gamal is nominated as candidate of contesting the presidential elections. Such steps include assigning him an executive position or promoting him to the position of the party secretary general in order to make presidential candidature seem natural.
The FAO official told Al-Alam Al-Youm that locust swarms are now 400 kilometers away from Darfur.

AN EGYPTIAN CRISIS!
To start with, political thinker and analyst Dr. Mahmoud Amin Al-Alem says that the USA is carrying out its colonialist schemes in the region to control the Middle East, seize Darfur and tamper with Sudanese lands with a view to seizing Sudan's resources and weakening Egypt by controlling the Nile sources and besieging it from the South and the East.
Nassserite Party Indoctrination Secretary, Farouq Al-Ashri says that the USA wants to control Darfur as an extension to its control over South and West Sudan which abound in petroleum as well as uranium, iron and phosphate. Sudan has a strategic position as it is the gate to the African center and south. Control of Sudan is also part of a big scheme to dominate and control the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa especially as the Arabs and Africans are in a state of weakness while the USA is preparing to control the Middle East and the world.
He points out that it would be difficult for the USA to intervene militarily in Sudan especially as the Iraqi resistance is still giving the USA severe lessons. However, Bush may well be tempted by his stupidity to plunge into Sudan's bog in search of economic interests. However, Bush would try to enter Darfur under the banner of the UN. If the war was lost, failure would be blamed on the UN, but if it was won, credit would be given to the USA for achieving victory, as a prelude to getting the booty.
Q: You're starting an extensive African round these days. Does choosing Africa as a start for your foreign rounds have any particular significance?
Q: Egypt used to have a pioneering role in supporting the movements of liberation and independence in Africa in the 1960's. Is there still anything that Egyptian could offer to Africa? A: Egypt is still an African country just as it is an Arab and Mediterranean one. It is, after all, the gift of the Nile that rises from the heart of Africa.
There is also Senghor University in Alexandria which receives hundreds of students from Francophone Africa countries every year. Egyptian universities open their doors to African students. Cairo Centre for Dispute Settlement and Peacekeeping also offers training courses to boost the continent's countries capabilities in keeping peace and stability. We urge donor countries to effectively contribute to supporting its programmes and activities.
However, the growing role played by South Africa is quite obvious. Do you think that such a role can act as a rival of the Egyptian role or do you see that as mere exaggeration of the issue? A: This is a legitimate question.

The army authorities are trying to keep all such procedures out of the limelight lest hard-line religious milieus should intervene as they adhere to the fourth article of the "Return Act" modified in 1970, which provides that the Jew who deserves the numerous advantages, and financial aid granted to immigrants should be born of a Jewish mother or who was judaized but should not be the son of another religion.
Some religious movements allege that about half the Russian immigrants who emigrated to the Hebrew State at the beginning of the 1990's were not Jews as enormous numbers of them headed for churches every week throughout the Hebrew State.
He was born in 29th September 1961 between the birth and eruption of the Palestinian revolution. However, the political ambitions of Dahlan who headed the Preventive Security Forces emerged early inside Fatah Movement and leadership nearly from the time he was assigned to supervise youth affairs inside Fatah. Dahlan was then 17 years old. He was jailed in Israeli prisons from 1981 to 1986.
Dahlan's success in Gaza is not attributed to the issue of security but rather to a center run by his wife who is also his cousin Mrs. Jalilah Dahlan. This center has humanitarian dimensions as it offers help to orphans, poor and handicapped people; a matter that concerns the martyrs' families in particular.
Every day, rumors say he would hold a new post.
MUQTADA AL-SADR WILL ONLY BE ANOTHER MULLAH OMAR
The picture of Iraq in this stage is to a great extent, reminiscent of that of Afghanistan on the eve of Naguiballah's secular government collapse and the departure of Soviet armies.
Let's imagine what alternative would step in if such an imaginary collapse was immediately followed by the departure of the American forces in the entire absence of a main force capable of filling the vacuum, controlling the situation and precluding what happened in Afghanistan when Naguiballah's government collapsed and the Soviet Union armies in an absolute debacle!
Under this headline, deputy chief editor of Al-Hayat Abdel-Wahab Badrakhan writes an article which runs to the following effect:
Neither Muqtada Al-Sadr nor his trend could put up features of such a solution, hence the inevitability of confrontation especially as the real authority (the American one) decided to classify Al-Sadr trend as an element of alarm and confusion.
Such trends, like other trends, relied on the Americans to return to the country and get involved in the political game even though the latter very often ran counter to their original principles.
While having their eyes on power to ensure its shift to the Shiites and to establish such a change through the American governor's decrees, they took little notice of the conditions of the Shiites who have suffered for decades from negligence, lack of development, exacerbation of poverty and deprivation. Therefore, it was only logical that Al-Sadr trend should appear as an expression of that extensive category of the Iraqi population. It was as if the trend had randomly and accidentally found itself after occupation authority decisions turned thousands of Iraqis jobless but heavily armed.
Such Iraqi-American ignoring of facts was apparently to blame for the reality which fed the emergence of Al-Sadr trend.
Obviously, the Najaf battle has a symbolic and religious significance, but it also has a "non-Iraqi" significance too, a fact which apparently escapes many people's notice.
IRAQ: FACTORY TO PRODUCE 230,000 CARS ANNUALLY TO BE SET UP
On the other hand, the Iraqi Federation of Industries (IFI) signed a protocol for industrial cooperation with a number of Arab and foreign countries.
GULFITES ARE COMING With the proximity of the date of implementing the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) unified currency agreement late next year, Gulf States started putting the finishing touches in preparation for such a historic event in the GCC history.
The application of the unified currency will provide transparency in commodity and service prices along borders, which will encourage the integration of the market and will put an end to the defects of labor market and help increase production.
Islamists, on the other hand, slammed this license revealing that the Kuwaiti Association for Human Rights that won the cabinet's approval yesterday is an association of a "secular orientation" and did not play any role in confronting what they considered violations committed recently by security bodies against Islamist detainees. Islamists asked the government to license these two Islamic associations that had previously applied for licenses.
The activists of this association are mostly liberals, which aroused reservations by Islamists, as Muslim Brotherhood Group and Salafi trends had applied for setting a human rights association for each of them, but Social Affairs Minister Faisal Al-Hiji did not respond to their requests.
GULF COUNTRIES TO BE LINKED WITH RAILWAY LINE
Twenty years ago, Kuwait rejected, for the same reason, an ambassador nominated by Washington.
He added that Libaron was not the first American diplomat in Kuwait who had worked in Israel before coming to Kuwait. Former American ambassador to Kuwait, had been member of the American mission in Tel Aviv and was, yet, the subject of Kuwaiti appreciation during his service in the American Embassy in Kuwait.
Libaron is the fifth American ambassador to Kuwait since the US lead the Desert Storm to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi occupation in 1991.
War on Shiite Cleric Muqtada al-Sadr is another face of the scenarios of war on Iran.
Test-firing Shihab-3 missile by Iran, however, was aimed at reminding its foes that it is a growing military force after the downfall of Saddam Hussein's regime though it does not want to deal with the US as its archenemy relying on its experience in cooperation with Washington in anti-terror war.
If the Americans want to achieve some pre-elections gains, Iran could be helpful in that regard.
The urgent question now is not how we reached that situation, but how to avoid its serious consequences.
Saddam's sin, however, was attacking Kuwait.
New head of the Egyptian Federation of Industries Galal el-Zorba said that Egypt should immediately sign a QIZ (qualified industrial zone) agreement with the United States to boost Egypt's exports to it. Such an agreement stipulates that exported products should include Israeli components.
BILL TO RECRUIT GIRLS VOLUNTARILY
AUC INSISTENCE ON BANNING NIQAB! The American University in Cairo (AUC) has officially emphasized its objection to any female students wearing niqab (face veil) entering the university, thus resolving a controversy recently raised by some Muslim Brotherhood group deputies in the People's Assembly and the case to be examined by the Administrative Judiciary next November.
The University said it believed that the university community professors, students and personnel have the right to establish a good rapport whether in classrooms, the library, the labs or any other place in the university premises adding that such a decision had nothing to do with the religious aspect, and the university, therefore, cannot be regarded as banning wearing the niqab.
This was followed by a query posed by Muslim Brotherhood deputy, Ali Laban in the parliament to Minister of Education, the Premier and the Minister of the Interior about the AUC rejection of female students wearing the niqab describing the university's decision as an assault of the Egyptian society's morals.
The list also includes the new taxes, securities market and anti-trust bills.

Asharq Al-Awsat made a lengthy interview with former finance minister Mohieddi Al-Gharib, who has been exonerated after 25 months of trial, excerpts from which run to the following effect:
All the citizens whom I met and whom I don't know said they knew that I was innocent, and this enough for me. The citizen's confidence is the most important to me, especially as I served the country for 14 years as head of the Investment Authority and as minister of finance. I really did my best, and everybody knows this well, so they expected my innocence after they had been shocked by the imprisonment sentence issued against me. I will not open files that may do harm to my country.
A: Truth is not always good nor is the timing of revealing it in the national interest. I don't seek to restore my right, nor do I want to harm those who did me wrong. I think it's better to cite here the Quranic verse, "and verily, whosoever shows patience and forgives would truly be from the things recommended by Allah". There is no personal difference with anybody.
A: The regime has its own way of compensation, even I don't want to be compensated for the material harm even though I was materially harmed to the extent that I had to sell my flat and spend its money on my case. I also spent all my savings, which I made during my work in the Gulf countries for 6 years as manager of Abu Dhabi project, UAE whose capital was 500 million dollars during the period 1972-1978. After that, I was board member of the Arab Investment Fund in Kuwait. My pension is my only source of livelihood at present after the university had stopped paying my salary since the beginning of the trial.
Ibrahim Pasha, in spite of his short tenure, is the legitimate father of Egypt's modern army, Khedive Ismail, despite his lavishness, was known for his ambition for developing a European-styled Egypt, and Fuad, in spite of his sullenness and isolation from the people's movement, could develop education, intellectual and cultural institutions and civil society organizations. The country then saw the July 23, 1952 Revolution against King Faruk, who was corrupt, but not disloyal. The national revolution tried to drastically reverse Egyptian life and the nature of inter-Arab relations, and made accomplishments and failures at the same time. Yet, Egypt remained the enlightenment pioneer in the 19th century, leader of liberation in the 20th century. Thus, it is natural for Egypt to go on in the direction towards a reform that may usher the region into the 21st century.
Fifth: the symptoms of reform and about-face are connected with the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) annual congress. Egypt has made considerable headway in this direction, but, still, has to go on resolutely and sincerely. This can be realized only through concerted efforts as reform in Egypt is related not only to the state but also to the society, its civil institutions and cultural organizations as well as governing values and deep-rooted traditions. Accordingly, modernizing education, exporting national culture and exploiting state-of-the-art technology under a thorough and integrated political and economic reform are the harbingers of a modern life on Egypt's soil and springboards for a mental revival that may be conducive to sound timely decisions to be taken on all fronts and in all directions.

Egypt's delegate to the UN in New York conveyed an urgent message from Abul Gheit to the UN Secretary General, while Egypt's mission in Geneva is coordinating Arab efforts aiming at spurring the UN Human Rights Committee to hold an emergency meeting.
"We were taken aback by the minister's article in which he announced after a long introduction that he felt sorry due to Adolf Hitler's practices against the Jews during the Second World War and that neither Ahmed's article about the falsehood of the Holocaust nor his statement that the real Holocaust is the goings-on in Palestine and Iraq at the hands of the American-Zionist occupation reflect the Egyptians' vision or the National Democratic Party's (NDP) policies and thought," the statement said.

The sugar beet contribution to total sugar production is currently estimated at 27% in comparison with 7.4% in 2000. This is due to the difficulty of expanding in establishing sugar cane factories because cultivated areas and irrigation water are limited in Egypt.

THE LE200-BILLION DEFICIT SCOURGE!
Such a terrible imbalance between resources and expenditure in the public budget may be ascribed to basic structural factors that may be traced back to fiascos in financial and economic policies adopted since the 1970's.

EGYPTIAN GULF BANK'S CAPITAL UP TO $127.8 MILLION
93% OF YOUTH HAVE NO ELECTORAL CARDS
Hamas leader in Palestinian territories Mahmoud Al-Zahar announced the movement's readiness to reach a common ground with other Palestinian factions and the Palestinian Authority on the bases of "phased-in steps" provided that the determination of strategic goals be left to the Palestinian people through ballot boxes in free and fair elections.
Israeli withdrawal from Gaza Strip will take the Palestinian cause out of negotiations frame because it is a land that was freed through resistance, he said, calling for the repetition of a such model, which proves the validity of Hamas political vision.
The sources said that the Arab intelligence department submitted the file only three days after it had been officially asked to do so by Mossad Chief Meir Dagan. They pointed out that the file contained detailed information on Hamas presence in Tehran, Damascus, Beirut, Khartoum and Sanaa as well as some Gulf states and Hamas leaderships abroad.
In London, Arab sources pointed out that the Arab intelligence department file mainly dealt with Hamas leaderships abroad. The file information on Meshaal and his deputy, Mousa Abu Marzouk as well as political bureau members, Imad Al- Alami and Mohammed Nezal concentrated on the security aspects related to their movements, residence, habits and personal traits and behaviour as well as on data about their food, drink, and laundry and the character and role of each of them.
The Mossad asked an Arab intelligence department to collect information about the movement leaders abroad, a case which was ascribed by the sources to the shortage of information about Hamas structure abroad and the inability to penetrate the organizational structure due to Hamas strictness in selection of cadres and limited recruitment of new elements.
Through yesterday's blast, Ariel Sharon's government has thus started the second stage in the liquidation of Hamas leaders, activists and symbols, this time outside Palestine.
Sharon's short-term plans, of course, include expelling Hamas from Damascus and Beirut and even Beqaa without having to repeat the Turkish scenario that extracted Kurdistani Labour Party leader, Abdulla Ocalan from the Syrian umbrella so long as luck smiled upon Sharon through the American enormous campaign to cut to size the Syrian role in the region and force it to withdraw into its own worth.
Between pulling the teeth and cutting the wings there lies a lot of whispering about the roles of "wings" in this region unprecedentedly beleaguered by American-Israeli pressure which are carefully scheduled by President George W. Bush and his partner in what is called the war on terrorism, starting with Palestine through Iraq down to Lebanon where Hizbullah is placed on the list.
What is even more serious than expelling Hamas forcibly from Syria etc, is that the blasts synchronize with the Pentagon launch of a campaign on the Syrian Baath Party accusing it of providing support and funds to terrorism in Iraq as if the next goal of the Baath Administration, i.e. what the Americans' calls to the dismantlement of Al-Baath were urgent and impervious to any procrastination or speculation.
The reduction of ideological divergent views also covered opinions on negotiations with Israel as the military wing, which is supposed to obey the directives of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) leadership, now lashes out at the principle of negotiations between the PNA and Israel, condemns them as illegal, suspects their motives and even brands such communications as "disloyalty".
Thence, it was not difficult to enlist "martyrs".
This pushed the occupation army to set up invincible fortifications around Jewish settlements and military positions. Seeking to invent means of overcoming such fortifications, Palestinian resistance groups made improvised missiles, which, though not very effective, helped marginalize the role of fortifications in protecting Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers.
This pushed Israel to attack hundreds of lathing and smithery workshops under the pretext that they played a role in making such rockets.
FORMER PALESTINIAN PREMIER ABU MAZEN: I DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE RESISTANCE OPTION
Q-Has the Palestinian issue entered a dark tunnel and there is no hope for a solution whether at the Palestinian, Israeli, or international level?
In return, the other party, which is Palestinian, is required to close up national ranks. The authority should prepare itself to control its agencies and start a reform process that includes financial, administrative, and economic issues. Security seems to be the first thing that should undergo a reform. Then, an inter-Palestinian dialogue could be opened that would lead to a unified Palestinian opinion. The other expected steps like the elections and others should come after that. All this would make it possible to sit at the negotiating table with the Israeli side under quartet sponsorship for applying the roadmap.
A-I do not know. Q-You were one of the decision-makers, so shall I conclude that there was no determination when you took over as prime minister in the past period?
We took steps in order for the American government to pressure Israel to take similar steps. But, the US did not do this and did not hurry to pressure Israel. The Palestinian side started a frustration process towards the government. Let me say that this constituted an obstacle to the government performance, which gave me no choice but to leave the government through rendering my resignation.
Was it the authority with all its components though you were the head of a government that came from this authority?
Sharon's government does not want peace.
A-Resistance has nothing to do with reform.
Q-As regards the Israeli plan for unilateral withdrawal from Gaza and the application of the unilateral disengagement plan, do you think that there are real objections on the Israeli side?
This plan includes the following points. The first point is the withdrawal from Gaza. The second point is the attachment of settlement blocks in the West Bank to Israel. The third point is the prevention of refugees from returning.
A-I do not think so. Historically speaking, Israel has always said that Gaza is an evil land that it should leave. If they wanted to continue, they would continue. We do not want to exaggerate the matters and say that this is due to the resistance and wait to get more than this.
A-I rule out the option of military resistance in anything. We entered the Palestinian territories in 1994 for peace and in the name of peace. We should continue with this option because we have no other option but that of peace.
A: We are in a new stage requiring the unification of security bodies into 3 main bodies, firstly, internal security by which we mean the Ministry of the Interior and its affiliated bodies, secondly, the National Security and thirdly, Public Intelligence.
A: Each organization we have has its own philosophy in the conflict with Israel. The Islamic factions (Hamas and Jihad) have their own vision based on the continuation of struggle till all historic Palestine is restored, while other factions accept a Palestinian state on any liberated part, by which they mean the land occupied in 1967. Now there is a conflict between us and the Israelis about these concepts, they hit us so hard to deter the Palestinian party that retaliates with martyrdom operations. This means that there is a conflict between two wills neither of which has surrendered so far. The Intifada may flare up if the other party relaxed for a while, as offensives are then expected.
A: Egyptian brothers have played an important role in that sphere through Maj. Gen. Omar Soliman who paid more than one visit to the Palestinian President Yassir Arafat who is besieged in his headquarters in Ramallah. The team assisting Minister Soliman visited Gaza because they are very active in the operation of following up the Palestinian security file. They made great efforts in light of the forthcoming Israeli withdrawal from Gaza Strip so that the coming period may be devoted to preparing the scene due to the American role absence due to preoccupation with the presidential elections at the end of this year. In light also of the absence and exclusion of the European role, Egyptian brothers thought it apt to exploit the 3-4 month period to make some achievement in the form of preparations of the scene for the post-American elections period and the preparations for the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza by holding negotiations very shortly between various Palestinian factions besides constantly communicating over the programme of a comprehensive national action. We think that the most appropriate programme in that regard is the PLO programme which combines all factions apart from Islamic ones (Hamas and Jihad) and of course there will be some way out of the problem of their joining us.
A: Until an agreement is reached between the factions, there should be training steps on the Palestinian part. This training would be undertaken by Egypt due to its capabilities and experience in that field especially the Palestinians are unanimous about the Egyptian role. During the recent visit paid by Minister Omar Soliman to President Arafat, it was agreed on a training plan. Soliman presented a definite mechanism starting with a high level Palestinian delegation discussing with officials in Egypt the type of training and how to sustain it as well as the continuance of Egyptian-Palestinian security understanding in the service of Palestinian interests.
A: We are committed to maintaining security but according to the Palestinian reality. This means that we will not harass resistance men, as what I mean by security is criminal security including theft, murder, drug-trafficking, etc.
On Sunday, ministers of 15 Arab countries okayed in Amman the "governance initiative to serve development in Arab countries" as a prelude to launching it officially in a conference to be held in the Dead Sea area, Jordan, next December.
"The good governance initiative is a reply to the American reform plan, which aims at controlling the region, obliterating the Arab identity and replacing it with a Middle Eastern one," Lebanese Minister of Administrative Development Karim Bakradouni said.
The first-day discussions highlighted the necessity of "a joint comprehensive strategy" among Arab countries and in every individual country, reorganization of the institutional structure to run this "vital sector", involving the private sector in the processes of operation and investment of desalination projects, building dams, maximizing the use of and protecting groundwater, and recycling sanitary drainage to alleviate burdens on public budgets.
He announced that his ministry concentrated on raising the performance of water and sanitary drainage sectors to catch up with international organizations' performance. It also concentrates on a change plan to meet current and future needs, seeking the help of international firms to benefit by their expertise, setting two plans for privatization and raising consumption awareness, he added, pointing out that striking a balance between supply and demand required the reconsideration of the institutional status.
The sources pointed out that Khatami would try to exploit Turkey's exacerbating fears of Kurdish domination of the scene in Iraq, especially after the American attack on the city of Telafr where the population is predominantly Turkmen as well as reports published by Turkish newspapers about a tripartite American-Israeli-Kurdish coordination in the North of Iraq to achieve practical goals through purchasing lands in the north of Iraq as a prelude to setting up joint projects with the Kurds who denied that, regarding it as a kind of false propaganda by Turkish newspapers.
On the other hand, the sources uncovered that Turkey had been invited to mediate between Washington and Tehran in the nuclear crisis, especially as it is eligible for that role and would try to test the water of Khatami in that regard.
This company will introduce a new method, which is currently growing worldwide (outsourcing) and offer integrated services to different organizations through specialized companies, Minister Kamel said.

Al-Arabi learnt that the World Bank had continued its pressures on the Egyptian government to respond to its demands in order that it might extend $1-billion loan to Egypt. Such demands include the privatization of public Egyptian banks, reduction of direct or indirect subsidy allocations, reduction of the subsidy granted to economic authorities like the railways, public transport and sanitary drainage.
The plan also includes updating and developing the banking sector through the privatization of joint banks to whose capital the public sector and public authorities contribute. A list of 32 joint banks has, therefore, been prepared in a bid to think of the priorities and schedule required for putting them up for privatization. This plan started to be put into effect when Societe Generale Bank (Paris) owned 74% of Egyptian National Societe General Bank, thus giving bigger weight to French management in the bank.
During this period, there was a rise in the relative weight of the capital market from 3% to 16% as well as the contracting saving institutions in the form of insurance companies and pension funds from 18% to 20% whereas the financial assets of the banking body alone claimed about 130% of the GDP in 2003.
Nazif's visit to Washington is after the adjournment or cancellation of President's Mubarak visit to Washington due to his domestic appointments and the approach of presidential elections.

AZHAR GRAND SHEIKH: WE OBEY ALLAH NOT AMERICA
As regards accusations against Al-Azhar that it refused to legitimize male Christians marrying female Muslims, he said, "This is unimaginable.
It is as if Egypt were entirely free of any sources of noise pollution so that only the azan (call to prayers) was all of a sudden discovered by minister of Wakfs Dr. Mahmoud Hamdi Zaqzouq to be disturbing.
Minister of Wakfs (Islamic endowments), Dr. Mahmoud Hamdi Zaqzouq was exposed to a spate of accusations. He was cruelly attacked by People's Assembly (PA) and Shura Council deputies when he put forward the idea at a meeting with them.
We have faced the Minister of Wakfs with all that and asked him for details about his idea that turned out to be still under consideration and may be subject to possibilities of success and failure.
I argue once again and emphasize that the aim behind the central transmission of the azan is to preserve people's comfort and to observe the tenets of religion and search for the most beautiful of voices so that proper religion may attract rather than repel!
These ideas are all lacking in eligibility for the simple reason that there are several small mosques (zawyas) which have not been annexed to the Ministry of Wakfs yet, and can not, therefore, be controlled in terms of the azan.
Q: Some think that the central transmission of the azan is a prelude to the unification of Friday sermons and then the cancellation of the Fajr (Dawn) azan under the pretext of avoiding disturbance?
Those who reiterate such talks should fear God and spare their religious officials the harm of their tongue. They should also know that we are under no pressure from anybody no matter of what status. We are keen on propagating our advocacy in the way that would please God and his Messenger (p.b.u.h.).

Hinting at the campaign launched against the Egyptian government by some expatriate Copts during and after the incident, the judge said, "Those who cried for help from America and Clinton should have asked for help from Egypt, the mother that does not discriminate among her children."

The dazzling advancement of Ariel Sharon represents a climb of the radical trend, which comprises the religious, nationalist and settlement currents in Israel. It means that the sound of arrogance, for which Sharon stands with his track record of crimes and massacres, is the sound that the Israelis prefer to hear at present.

All that means only one thing: under the leadership of Sharon, Israel the state has become the embodiment of Neo-Nazism in the Middle East. As Nazi Germany did under the leadership of Hitler and the Third Reich, using military force as the only language with its neighbours, Israel is now doing the same.

Any such leniency with the Israeli rightists would probably tempt Israel to step up hostilities against the Arabs as the absence of an Arab unified tone would weaken the Arab parties without exception.
M.S. Asharq Al-Awsat, 7/2/2001
In an interview with the Saudi newspaper "Okath," published on February 6, Bassiyoni said Sharon's plan for solving the Palestinian issue relies on three main steps.

BULLDOZER RETURNS, WITH FUEL TANKS EMPTY?
There are three main reasons for Sharon's weakness.
The second reason for Sharon's weakness is his rightist electoral base, which comprises fanatical nationalists, morbid settlers, religious hard-liners and Russian immigrants.
The Israelis voted for Sharon out of their fear of the Intifada that has raged for five months.
This came in an article by Patrick Sale.
Even trying to talk about Sharon as a political leader or head of government is something that many of the Israelis themselves do not find easy, for he is the leader of the gang of settlers that rules Israel now, which came to power under explicit slogans that leave those who dream of the peace of the brave, those who prostrate themselves and those who normalize relations, no opportunity to continue in their illusions, much less convince us of them.

The Pope, who is the spiritual leader of Egyptian Copts, was addressing an audience of about 3,000, most of them Copts, in a symposium that was held on 6 February on the margins of Cairo International Book Fair. During his address, he touched on several topics, and his reaction to the sentences in Al Kusheh case was welcomed by the audience, who applauded for several minutes. Official Coptic circles had criticized the sentences, expressing anger at the statement delivered by the Judge, Counselor Mohammad Afifi, in which he denounced three priests of the Church of Sohag for "neglecting to do their duty in controlling Coptic citizens" and "provoking feelings."
MFA, Al Hayat, 8/2/2001
Islam did not achieve these objectives without meeting the conditions on which their accomplishment depended, namely: 1-	Belief in monotheism.
With regard to unity, it is the duty stipulated by the Quran in many ayats, (verses).
In fact, the real world of Islam has not taken the order given in the above ayats as an order that must be obeyed, but has interpreted it as some sort of advice and an invitation to unity. This is a failure in understanding, a deficiency in perception and an inability to grasp the meanings of the order of Allah, who wants to see this Ummah united as a result of the elements of unity and the ingredients of existence it has. Muslims believe in Allah, the One God. They do not differ in that respect.
We even wish that they would give us fatwas on how compulsory the duty of unity is according to Quranic orders.

"TAMAZIGHT",POLITICAL PARTY IN MOROCCO AFTER ALGERIA
For their part, the Moroccan authorities are keen on extending all facilities to the Tamazight people. Moroccan Prime Minister Abdel-Rahman Youssefi tabled a new education bill to parliament, whose provisions recognize for the first time in Morocco's history the Tamazight culture.
Some Tamazight figures had ministerial portfolios in the government and two political parties were formed - the Gathering for Culture and Democracy under Saeed Sa'di and Progress and Socialism under Hussein Aiyat Ahmed.
The cons of this trend are of the opinion that it resembles the imperialist project, which France tried to set up when it tried to implement a project in 1930 to boost the Berbers. The imperialists tried at that time to separate the Tamazight Berbers from the Arabs with the objective of winning the sympathy of the Tamazight tribes. However, the Tamazight tribes were the first to fight this project.
They demand only the minimum of their legitimate rights to lead an honest life. They have even gone down to the point of asking for equality with their ex jailers: the agents of Antoine Lahad, who left their marks on their skinny and sick bodies and locked the doors of life, happiness and hope in their faces.
The freed prisoner Kifah Afifi, who had spent several years at Al Khiyam Jail, was quite explicit in her comment on the lenient sentences passed by Lebanese courts against the agents of Antoine Lahad.
Mohammad Kassim's family fell apart after he had been sent to prison. His first shock after his release was when he discovered that his children had been sent to an orphanage during his long absence. The second shock was finding himself in dire straits because he had no job from which he could get money that would help him deal with the more pressing needs of his family. His third shock, and the most devastating one according to Mohammad, was seeing his ex jailer walking free on the street, instead of being in prison serving a long term.
What do the ex prisoners of war say? The former captives say: "We demand that the government give us jobs, consider everyone of us as a soldier in the Lebanese Army, decorate us with the Medal of Freedom and give us housing loans.
An unidentified official at the National Authority for Serum and Vaccine which is in charge of importing most of blood derivatives, vaccines and plasma said that the Authority is still importing blood derivatives from Britain including some pharmaceuticals used for treating patients who contracted hemophilia and suffer from hematorrhea.

HOW CAN SEX BE TAUGHT IN EGYPTIAN SCHOOLS?
Dr Nadia Gamal Eddin, Director of the National Centre for Educational and Developmental Research, said, "There is no problem at all in teaching the facts of life to children and youths, as appropriate to their age group. Life is indivisible; it is a set of kinds of knowledge and skills that are required by every human being, according to his needs in the different stages of life.
I do not believe that there is any separate subject called sex education, because our current circumstances and our traditions that continue to exist preclude that. Other societies may have it, though."
Dr Ahmad Omar Hashim, President of Al Azhar University, said, "I do not support the idea of allocating a separate curriculum to sex education. I favour the educational system applied by Al Azhar in teaching the matters related to sex through the explanation of religious provisions.
The catastrophe is not the victory of the hateful murderer Sharon: it is what is with the Israeli society and the Israel electorate that voted for him and that continue to live in the sick dreams of Zionism and refuse to wake up.
Within Israel itself, a front of the widest possible boundaries, as Palestinian Minister Yasser Abd Rabbou, said, a front that would comprise all Palestinians, starting with Hamas to the Communists in the far left and all Palestinian organizations and factions, in addition to every Israeli who does not belong to the right and advocates peace, for these Israelis support the same general objectives of the Palestinians.
As for Egyptian-Israeli relations, Osama Al-Baz, the President's Political Advisor in exclusive statements to Al-Ahram Al-Arabi, affirmed that the Egyptian policy was not based on any Israeli premier's personality but rather on his government policy. "The future of relations with Israel should not be decided now, as we have to wait until we see what Sharon will do," he added.
According to Al-Baz, Likud may slow down the peace process and exercise pressures on the Palestinians. All these considerations may lead to a Likud government or coalition where the Likud may play an effective role in procrastination and tampering with time as well as talk about phased out deals for further years, as if Israel were alone in the arena where the other party has no requirements or legitimate rights in living or freedom.
Major General Salaheddin Selim, a strategic expert, says that Sharon had exploited the Israelis' desire for giving priority to their own security rather than political settlement with the Arabs in general and the Palestinians in particular. This was made possible by an Arab fragile solidarity and content with simple reactions since the political settlement with Palestinians, Syrians and the Lebanese faltered in 1996. They only offered some financial and humanitarian assistance to the Arabs in the occupied Palestine.
They must be ready for all possibilities, especially as Sharon, the assassin, would stop at nothing. To adopt a wait and see attitude, therefore, would lead to a disaster. The Arabs have several steps to take. They can mobilize Arab forces to square up to any aggression, coordinate efforts and seek international support against aggression. President Mubarak's tours would have been significant for Sharon if they had been paid to Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Libya rather than other countries, in which case the significance would have a bearing on the summit to be convened in Amman.
The Supreme State Security Prosecution (SSSP) has decided to appeal against the ruling issued by Sohag Criminal Court on the case of the second Kusheh incidents that took place on 31st December 1999, and 2nd and 3rd January, 2000, claiming the lives of 20 victims and damaging 56 kiosks, houses and shops. Charges were levelled at 96 defendants, including 38 Christians and six escapees. One of the defendants received a ten year prison sentence and another defendant received a 2-year prison sentence with labour.

MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD DEPUTY GUIDE GENERAL: BAR ASSOCIATION ELECTIONS PROVED THAT BROTHERHOOD IS A REALITY THAT CANNOT BE IGNORED
Following are excerpts from Asharq Al Awsat's interview with Maamoon Al Hudaibi:
Everybody agreed that the Bar Association elections were held in an atmosphere of neutrality and integrity. Not a single vote was challenged, and all the participants in the electoral process, including members of security services, supervisors and the lawyers who voted in the elections, were up to the expected high performance. Not one incident occurred to sour that atmosphere, either.
Q: Does the government's refraining from interference in the elections mean that it wants to turn over a new leaf with the Muslim Brotherhood?
As you must know, a believer should be discreet and wise, and public interest is the target that everyone in public office should seek. Therefore, the Muslim Brotherhood saw that the conditions in the country and the state of affairs of the community required the existence of some sort of integration among all trends. I do not believe that this could be, as some have claimed, opportunism, or any other of the terms that we did not wish to hear.
Q: The Muslim Brotherhood has representatives in the People's Assembly and a majority presence in the Bar Association. However, it is denied a legitimate status for political practice. How do you see this contrast?
Q: Do not you have any apprehensions against the presence of somebody like Sameh Ashoor, a confirmed Nasserite, in the position of Bar Association chairman while the Muslim Brotherhood holds the majority of the seats of the association's council?
A: We seek the interest of the country, and we believe that the will of the voters must be respected and that the government must lift its security restrictions on the Muslim Brotherhood cadres and leaderships and recognize the Brotherhood as a political force that cannot be ignored or neglected.

Therefore, 15 passenger-car producer companies in Egypt would be affected. The investments of such companies amount to LE7 billion. Moreover, a large number of car feeding factories whose investments exceed LE2 billion would also be affected by the retreat in the car sales volume due to the imposition of the new development tax. It is noteworthy that the total investments of car industry in Egypt stand at over LE9 billion.
RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR IN CAIRO: INTER TRADE PROBLEMS ARE ON PUTIN-MUBARAK'S TALKS AGENDA
He denied that his country had put obstacles or taxes in the way of Egyptian exports to Russian markets.
For example, in the Soviet Union era, Russia and Egypt used to exchange commodities according to trade agreements between the two governments without having to use free currencies.
In the Soviet Union era, commodities were transported via Rhine and Letshev and Odessa ports but after the breaking up of the Soviet Union, Ukraine had a grip on these ports and Russia had only two ports, Taganrog and Novo Novosibirsk.
The solution to this problem can be sought through holding meetings between the two countries businessmen to coordinate and become acquainted with the market needs," he concluded.
The official in charge of Israel's relations with Arab and European countries in the Israeli Chamber of Commerce said yesterday that the extension of the Israeli-Jordanian trade agreement means that Jordanian exports to Israel and Israeli exports to Jordan would enjoy equal facilities on both sides.

When the issue of the African ship, carrying 200 children to be sold as slaves, was raised and started to be fiercely attacked on the international arena without reasonable justifications, I felt that there was a conspiracy behind this issue.

It transpired that Graham the son leads a strong American lobby, including a rabbi, one of the convicts under the Water Gate scandal, Jessie Helmiz, a far rightist, and the widow of Martin Luther King.
"It is the smell of money," said an employee with the relief program.
However, reality has proved that the popular tide goes in one direction and the official position goes in another and that what is going on in the corridors of politics has nothing to do with media statements.
Maximizing the will of resistance and spurring martyrdom are the sole response which can bring Sharon, first, and all unfair and unjust international forces, second, to their senses. This response may also comfort those who are extremely infuriated by bitter incidents such as the non-convention of Israel Boycott Office,mere convention!

Opposition Nasserite Party MP Abdel-Azim al-Maghrabi lashed out at the parliament for being reluctant to discuss Israeli aggression, saying that the ongoing mad unprecedented colonial attack against the Arab nation is an insult to Arab countries. The members asked to be allowed to "express their views on what is going on to reassure to the children of the stones and Intifada or uprising that we support them."
He also accused Egyptian media of not giving a true picture of the feelings of the Egyptian people, who are boiling with anger about Israeli actions against the Palestinian people.
Nasserite Party MP Hamdeen Sabahi warned against a potential war that may be imposed on Egypt in the light of indications showed by the Zionist enemy, including threats to re-occupy Sinai and hit the High Dam.

Sheikh Abdel-Aziz Ben Abdullah Al Al-Sheikh, the Mufti of Saudi Arabia, has issued a fatwa (religious opinion) that raised disputes among Muslims. He said: "killing oneself amid a group of enemies, or the so-called suicidal attacks, is not Islamic and is not considered a kind of Jihad in the cause of God."
If commando operations, in their different forms, are sacrifices aimed at eliminating the harm inflicted on the Muslim community, they will be Islamically permissible, as a Muslim individual is allowed to save the Muslim community against harm inflicted on it through shouldering such harm himself, Dr. Imam says. This kind of commando operations, however, should be carried out among fighters, he says. This means that it should be implemented inside military barracks or in confrontation of the army or those who take up arms. "As for haphazard explosions that hit fighters and non- fighters, it is not, I believe, permissible, unless they are made as a kind of reciprocal treatment.
These operations are not considered suicidal operations, as suicides are aimed at nothing, but these operations are aimed at defending the homeland.
We should encourage these commando operations and prepare an army of this kind, particularly these days," he adds.

As for the decrease of Egyptian exports to Russia, there are some reasons that have to do with the Russian market. These reasons are represented in the changes in Russia in the transition period, the great number of amendments introduced to the laws including import operations, and the crises facing the banking sector now and then as it has not risen to the international level yet.
Egypt is considered the third biggest country that receives financial and technical aid annually from Germany, pointed out a study compiled by the commercial representation body affiliated to the Egyptian Ministry of Economy and Foreign Trade on the occasion of President Mubarak's visits to Germany, Romania and Russia.

The volume of tourist investment in Egypt as of 1993 is estimated at LE14 billion of which foreign investments represent 25% of the total cost, the minister indicated.

A Congolese French-speaking newspaper published a report worded by professional writers, despite the primitiveness of the mass media in Congo. The report, leaked to different mass media as well as political and popular sectors, claimed that some retired Zairian armed forces officers had secret relations with some Egyptian diplomats upon encouragement from Belgium and the US to spy in their favors.
Accusations, directed at Egypt, aim at covering up the main players in Congo. The American interests, particularly the strategic and economic ones, were harmed due to Kapila's rule.

Some businessmen belong to these forces, as they are concerned with achieving urgent profits, regardless of anything else.
-	The security institution.

AK/ Al-Hayat, 27/5/2001
Social solidarity, which was the main characteristic of villagers, is about to vanish. Houses are about to swallow arable land, the source of life and pillar of rural economy. Pollution threatens the countryside with the spread of several diseases and epidemics. Consumer tastes are growing and changing the nature of social and productive conduct. Deeply rooted traditions are on the wane.
Dr. Al-Badawi said there are five main problems from which the countryside suffers. These problems are: -	Pollution, especially in canal water and streets -	The rise in the subterranean water level due to supplying potable water to houses.
The population growth rate in the village is remarkably going down, he said, pointing out that this rate stands at 14 per thousand only. This is ascribed to the change in the village pattern of life and the emigration of workers outside the village. Moreover, the crop structure has changed, as farmers tended to cultivate watermelon and sugar beet, instead of conventional crops, said Dr. Al-Badawi. Workshops and shops of different crafts have been introduced to the countryside, and possession of arable land has been fragmented, he added.
The problem of dropouts of primary and preparatory education is attributed to defects in the educational process, such as the rise in the class density (65 pupils per class), teachers' maltreatment of pupils, she said. This problem is also ascribed to the poverty of many families that find themselves compelled to halt their sons' education to help them in providing sustenance for the families.

In a few days' time, President Hosni Mubarak will pass a presidential decree, giving investors free ownership of investment projects land in the industrial zones in Upper Egyptian governorates. This comes within the State's plan to facilitate matters for investors and attract more capital and advanced technology to governorates and convert them into investment attractive and urban development zones, so that they may contribute to raising export- oriented production and creating new job opportunities.
Protesto and bankruptcy rulings went up last year to reach about 500,000 against 420,000 verdicts in 1999, a rise of 15% and 25% when compared with 1998 during which they reached 365,000, said Usama Gaafar, board member of the Chamber of Commerce in Cairo.
He revealed that the total capital of protesto and bankruptcy rulings reached about LE18 billion last year.
As a result of the poor rate of sales, traders default on the payment of their dues to their counterparts whether traders or importers, which urges the creditor to file lawsuits against the debtors, thus announcing his bankruptcy so as to obtain his dues.
This was stated by Head of the Investment and Free Zones Authority Dr. Mohamed Al-Ghamrawi, who affirmed that the industrial zones are one of the major mechanisms instrumental in the implementation of the State's plan that is aimed at providing 800,000 job opportunities annually to contain the unemployment problem. One of the main goals of constructing industrial zones is the expansion in small and medium sized industries that can meet the needs of the main and feeding industries to contribute to raising export-oriented production.
He went on to say that trade exchange with Israel began to go down due to the Israeli aggressive practices that ignited the political climate in the region resulting in the creation of a mainstream rejecting any economic cooperation with Israel.
Director of Technical Secretariat of Arab Health Ministers, Dr. Hussein Hamoudah pointed out that the meeting of the Arab Blood Banks Authority directors that would wind up its meetings today had discussed the urgent provision of the required blood.

Salama Ahmed Salama writes:	 The Press Syndicate has sharply criticized the State for not implementing the judicial rulings on the cancellation of the suspension of Al-Shaab newspaper, organ of the frozen Labor Party.
On the one hand, it asserts every now and then its respect of the judiciary and its independence, saying that it does not interfere in its affairs and that it is proud of its justice and integrity. However, on the other hand, it dodges from implementing its rulings in matters related to certain partisan or political interests, or to interests of some categories, figures, government bodies, or semi-government bodies.

?	"S-300" missiles: these are ground-to-air and anti-aircraft missiles, can fly at low and high heights, can act as anti-missile missiles and are better than US "Patriot" missiles according to military experts.
Israel was the only country in the region to have the anti-missile systems, mainly including the "Arrow" System, granting it the advantage of repulsing any potential missile attacks and giving it a free rein to fire its neighbors, including Syria, with ground-to-ground missiles.
The paper added that Israel's debacle in South Lebanon may be repeated elsewhere.

It seems that the fact that the banned Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) Group have controlled most seats in the Egyptian Bar Association would not ensure the state of stability, which the lawyers had been looking forward to prior to the elections that followed the Association being under a five-year receivership. The Association is currently undergoing a state of argument due to attempts made by Coptic lawyer Mamdouh Ramzi to set up a committee of Christian legislation inside the Association on model of the committee on Islamic Sharia controlled by Muslim Brotherhood Group, and is considered the main stronghold of the Group activities inside the Association.

Al-Husseini was not killed by Israeli terrorists nor was he killed due to their brutal aggressions.
He only told them "Do not hate us in such a way", but they insisted on hatred and insults which was too much for his tender heart which was full of love for Jerusalem and the Palestinian cause to bear.
Al-Husseini was regrettably killed with a Kuwaiti rather than Israeli dagger.
These expectations did not last for long. Less than four months following the take-over of the Republican Administration, the Jewish lobby returned to the American decision-making centers, not only in the Department of State, as was the case in the past, but also in the office of the Vice President, the Department of State and the Department of Defense (Pentagon).

POPE SHENOUDA: UNDERSTANDING, RATHER THAN FUNDAMENTALS OF ISLAM IS AMENABLE TO INNOVATION!
It is only a modern understanding of such fundamentals that every generation should aim to achieve.
The Pope added that ijtihad (independent judgement) in religion or Islam has limits. Things, should, therefore, be kept in control as our age has witnessed a multiplicity of thought, philosophy, sciences, scientific achievements so much so that the issue of the permissible and the impermissible have become a controversial matter.
Hossam Sweilam, a retired staff major general, writes an article to say:
Parallel to this, Israel seeks to return to Sinai via another door - economy.
Israeli commanders, who believe that there is no way for achieving Israel's national targets except through its military tools, will use these tools to achieve their goals. Other Israeli leaders, who think that the use of the political, economic and cultural tools to penetrate the Arab societies is the optimum way for achieving Israel's hegemony over the region, will seek to achieve this via normalization. The ideas of this latter team are being promoted by Shimon Peres in his book "A New Middle East." The military institution, however, is preparing for achieving these targets via a sixth military round, expected to take place within a period of 5 to 8 years.
Moreover, Sinai is not only important to Egypt alone, but also to the Arab nation as a whole. It has become the shield of the Arabs, as the latest wars proved that Sinai is the land of the decisive Arab battle.
This is not a call to ignore the truth, but rather a call against misreading it.
The Palestinians could force the Israelis to raise the alert to maximum and elected Sharon under the impression that he would be able to break the Palestinian will, a job that has proven so far to be too much for him. Unfortunately for him, the tables seem to be on the brink of turning against him, especially as the Palestinians' impregnable determination managed to carry out operations in Israel that outnumbered any operations performed by Palestinians under any other Israeli government.
The uprising managed to abort the attempts to Israel-ize the 1948 Palestinians. As when the worst came to the worst, they found themselves in the Palestinian rather than the Israeli ditch. According to an opinion poll carried out by Peace Research Institute of Arab Jewish Studies Center, a considerable retreat took place in Arab citizens' affiliation to Israel-ization in contrast with a stronger affiliation to Palestinization.
The anniversary of June 5, 1967 comes this year under conditions that totally differ from those of previous years, during which the tone of peaceful coexistence and illusions of false peace, which Israel sought, with the help of the US, to impose by force or through tricks, was dominant.
No one in Egypt seeks to go to war or calls for it. However, the Israeli aggression may make of it an inevitable option.
AM/ Al-Ahram, 5/6/2001
The charges do not stop at that. They escalate one day after another, as if these regimes were responsible for the eruption of violence between the Palestinians and the Israelis, or as if there were a request to launch war against the ruling Arab regimes on the ground that reaching Tel Aviv should be achieved on the ruins of these regimes.
Many expectations assert that the people will opt for the use of military force to respond to the Israeli crimes and massacres against the Arab Palestinian people. Not only this; I believe that the Arab peoples will be compelled to launch war against the Israelis after they have become sure that force only can put an end to the brutal massacres we watch everyday on the Arab and international satellite channels.
-	Egypt and Syria only, as was the case in October 1973 War?
The Arabs paid $600 billion in the past years to buy weapons to defend themselves against their known enemies and against the unexpected ones. What an astronomical figure that could have eliminated poverty and joblessness from all Arab countries and financed all ambitious economic plans that stopped due to lack of finance!

The assembly stressed the necessity of enforcing the provisions of law no 38 for the year 1977, amended under law no 118 for the year 1983 which stipulates that activities of organizing Umrah be confined to Egyptian travel agencies so as to be commercial agents and representatives of Saudi companies in Egypt, which complies with the provisions of article 21, of the Saudi statute.
In its decisions, the assembly underlined the necessity of protecting the Egyptian agencies' rights in case suspension of operations is imposed as a penalty on the Saudi company so that the Egyptian travel agency contracting with it may not be punished too. In such case, the Egyptian company would be entitled to contract with another Saudi company according to regulations within a period of not more than one week as of the date of the issuance of the Saudi company suspension decision.

An economic study by the Ministry of Agriculture warned against the rising volume of the local waste of grain production which increases grain imports.
The study added that most crop waste occurs during the phases of ripening, harvesting, processing and final consumption. If the crop is harvested after it has perfectly ripened, waste can be reduced by 50% in that stage in the three crops. Raising consumption awareness and raising bread making efficiency and using other alternatives for subsidizing bread prices, can also reduce the waste of wheat and corn in the final consumption stage by 50%.
As for corn, the reduction of waste in the harvest and final consumption stages equals a rise in corn local production by 24.55 thousand tons and a decrease in consumption by about 30.05 thousand tons. Imports can be cut down by 54.6 thousand tons of corn, thus corn producers income may be increased by LE166 million. The State can save 49.25 million cubic meters of irrigation water.
EGYPTIAN EXPORTS OUT OF RUSSIAN BEAR'S ACCOUNTS
In the past, the government used to intervene in determining the exports and imports to and from this market according to bilateral agreements concluded with the Soviet Union, he says. The government imported commodities stated in the agreement, and the other side did the same. This means that export was guaranteed at that time. Moreover, the importing company was the sole body that represented the Russian government and it accepted Egyptian companies' prices, he adds. At that time, Egyptian products were imposed on them because they were subject to the mechanism of oriented economy, dominated by the government, he points out.
Thus, Egyptian products entered unequal competition with the products of these countries. This has become clear in the point that the prices of these states' products were accepted. Moreover, these states' products depended on their good quality and nearness to the Russian market, he adds. Hence, openness has greatly influenced the Russian taste, which was represented in the rejection of bad products, Sheta says.
Instability:
Responsibility: ?
Moreover, there are Egyptian goods that are not accepted at present due to their low quality or high prices. This differs from the days of industrial protection when the government used to impose certain commodities on consumers, he says.

ARAB STATES HAVE MORE MILITARY CAPABILITIES THAN ISRAEL
Do the Arabs lack the ability to deter Israel, which possesses nuclear arms?

I want to draw the attention of those who discredit our political regime, those who adopt sensationalizing attitudes towards the Palestinian issue, swindlers who pretend to be ultra- pan Arabists, and those who appear on Arab TV channels expressing their anger with the Arabs and Egyptians alike to simple facts:
Third, peace between Israel and us benefited Egypt as much as it benefited Israel.
Such era has gone with the wind, especially as Egypt has paid much for that.
Egypt's role in this, which we strongly back, is supporting the Palestinian uprisings politically, internationally and financially, and helping the Palestinians obtain their freedom and independence, and establish their state with its full sovereignty. I think that our Egyptian political regime is playing this role well!
The deal will be carried out through Egyptian and Russian companies, he added.

Egyptian parliamentarians asked the government to set up a number of new cities along the Egyptian-Israeli border in southern and northern Sinai. This took place within the framework of a strategic plan for protecting Egyptian borders and meeting the requirements of Egyptian national security. Such cities' population would be purely Egyptian.

ISRAEL SEEKS TO REGISTER ARAB ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES WITH INTERNATIONAL HERITAGE COMMITTEE AS BEING JEWISH
According to the sources, the Zionist list shows clearly a future Zionist scheme that aims at enabling the State of the Zionist entity to penetrate the Arab societies, not only the Palestinian society.

ISRAEL'S GUARDS AT BAB EL MANDEB
Maj. Gen. Gamal Mazloum, a strategic expert, said that the Israeli attempts to impose hegemony on Bab El Mandeb are designed to bring pressure to bear on Egypt, Sudan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, particularly as it managed to clinch military agreements with Eritrea in 1992, providing for aiding Eritrean forces. It has become familiar to see Israel's Air, Naval and Intelligence experts in the region, he said.
Abu Bakr warned that such Israeli stations and bases were designed to be used in military operations in the Red Sea, when necessary, and controlling its coasts, so as to avert the repetition of what happened in October 1973 War. The Israeli presence also includes special forces, paratroopers, and commando units, as well as airborne troops equipped with modern helicopters and "Dolphin" submarines, threatening the Red Sea basin countries' interests, he added.

The trade volume hits $200 million, out of which $150 million are accounted for by Romanian imports, while the Egyptian exports amount only to $50 million. Such a poor performance of Egyptian exports to the Romanian market is ascribed to Romanian importers' lack of liquidity, an effect of the financial crisis in East Europe. Consequently, the Egyptian party is seeking to hold an agreement of guarantees against the risks of default.

"If such a war broke out, its agonies would affect not only the Israelis and the Arabs, but also many other parts of the world," he added. "The number of Palestinian deaths reached an unbearable limit as the Israeli military machine is directly aimed at a disarmed people who would hardly use stones to defend themselves," he said.
Merrill Lynch relation with the Egyptian market started in the early 1990's with the help of consultants in Cairo. In its first transactions, it concentrated on the Stock Exchange, especially during the period from 1993 to 1997, which witnessed the highest dealings whether sale or purchase by foreigners.
Merrill Lynch does not conceal its efforts to help Israel in occupying the biggest financial status in the Middle East. The overt Zionist-oriented institution deals permanently with 850 Jewish experts, of whom 400 were born in Israel.
The role of this Jewish institution will not be confined to the dollar marketing of bonds. Rather, it will extend to different Egyptian economic fields with the objective of penetrating them, something against which the People's Assembly (PA) members warned. Adel Eid, a lawyer and a PA member, asked the government to repeal its agreement with this suspicious institution, which is closely related to the Israeli Mossad, something that endangers Egyptian national security.
An Egyptian prominent official told Asharq Al-Awsat that the news of Khatami's winning of a second term of office, which would last for four years as Iranian President was expected and constitutes no surprise. "Some indicators point out Khatami's reformist policies, maintaining both public support and popularity," he added.
Egyptian officials say that Cairo is still waiting for an official reply from the Iranian Foreign Ministry to a recommendation made by Tehran Municipality Local Council regarding the converting of the name of a street from Khaled Al-Islamboli (the assassin of late president of Egypt Sadat in 1981) to Mohamed Al-Durrah Street.
A People's Assembly (PA) member, representing the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP), has tabled an urgent inquiry to Prime Minister Dr. Atef Ebeid and the two Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Finance about claims by Israel and some Jews abroad that they have property in Egypt that they want to restore.
At a time when American and European efforts are being exerted to resume security cooperation between the Palestinians and Israelis following the suicidal operation of Tel Aviv in preparation for returning to the table of negotiation, military and sociological experts in Israel said gangs in the ranks of settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip may carry out suicidal operations against the Palestinians.
MARTYRS FROM ISRAELI-WESTERN PERSPECTIVES
In terms of education, 47% of the martyrs had academic education degrees, 29% had secondary education certificates and 24% finished primary education.
The profile of Yedioth Aharonot provides a chance for studying the phenomenon of martyrdom, which is different from that dominating the mass media especially the Western mass media.
According to the western study, which vibrated in the Arab media, the phenomenon title was always linked to two points; the first was entitled frustration, despair and poverty; and the second was entitled the failure of the settlement operation.
The second point is related to despair and frustration.
As for the issue of marital status, it can be said that it is only natural that the bachelors and the poor would be less attached to earthly pleasures than the married and the rich.
There is a kind of education that implants in the youth minds the slogan of "death for the cause of Allah, is our highest aspiration." Martyrdom is the path to the highest ranks in the Hereafter, thus encouraging young men to vie for such action.
Neither resistance movements, nor their members linked military action to the developments of the settlement process as they rejected it and hoped that it would be aborted in favor of the continuation of resistance, until occupation was removed.
After all, though these large numbers of young men who are able to exhaust the enemy much more than what happened in Lebanon, some come to look sarcastically at the proposals of many people to the effect that occupation forces can be pushed beyond the green line in that stage if the Palestinian and Arab political will is available.
He said that the European Program for Modernizing Egyptian Industry had been signed in December 1998. The program according to which the European party will extend 250 million euros in the first stage, did not seriously help in updating the industry or sharpening its competitive edge. This is ascribed to the European party insistance that the majority of the personnel who would be in charge of running the program should be Europeans contrary to similar agreements concluded by the EU with Tunisia and Algeria despite the fact that Egypt contributes to the program by about 180 million euros, he uncovered.
He also showed the importance of allocating part of the EU aid for the scientific research and applying it to the field of conversion industries with the objective of developing them and modernizing their operation methods and sharpening their competitive edge.

Al-Wafd, 11/6/2001
The rate of population increase hits 160 thousand per year at present, a figure that is sharply lower than that before the year 1990.
The rise in population amounted to 1.12% in 1999 and retreated to 1.09% in the year 2000, according to primary figures. Late last century, this figure was expected to reach 1.6%.
Official sources expected that Minister of Economy, Youssef Botrous Ghali would be shaken off in light of the current investigations in the Stock Exchange offences.
The suicidal operation in Tel Aviv led to tremendous American and European pressure on the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). This pressure synchronized with a change that took place in international public opinion in favor of Israel.
Regarding the Palestinian side, Hamas and Jihad might be ready to obey Arafat's decision on "cease-fire," if this would spare the Palestinian arena international pressure and a severe Israeli military strike, reported to have been planned by Sharon. This plan only awaits the green light under any pretext. However, Hamas and Jihad may reconsider their stance, if the practical "cease-fire" meant the halt of the uprising so simply.
Al-Wasat interviews Al-Rantisi who resides in Gaza. Question: Will Hamas respond to the cease-fire?
We are not an army.
Answer: Our relation with the PNA is good. There are no problems between us.
Question: Hasn't Arafat asked you directly to cease fire?
It did not only deny the Palestinian people's rights in their entirety, but also placed the Aqsa Mosque on the negotiating table to bargain on it. Moreover, it is denying our people's right to control the Aqsa Mosque.
Those bombers of those operations belong to families that live in abject poverty?
All people watched on the TV how those martyrs courageously read the statements before the operations, as if they were going to attend their weddings.
Moreover, those who are not recruited in the Israeli army from Britain, the US, the Netherlands and came from here and there to uproot me from my homeland. So, they are not innocent.
However, we do not target their children, nor do we think that this is halal (permitted by Islam).

The deal is to be completed by the end of this month, following the approval of French and British competition protection authorities, he added.
Hossam Rageh, Managing Director of "Alliance Capital," a fund running firm, said Lafarge's control over 25 percent of the cement market in Egypt would not unfavorably affect the market as there are mega local entities in Egypt such as Suez Cement Company. The market will be negatively affected if a single company monopolizes about 80 percent of the cement market, he said.

Salah Al-Din Hafez writes an article under the above heading. Excerpts run to the following effect:
At this very moment, all people moved nervously and started a race against time to mitigate the nerves of the agitated monster Sharon, pressurize Arafat, recall the "good" efforts of the American CIA Commander George Tenet, and exploit the cover of the initiative of Mitchell's committee or of Egypt and Jordanian initiative which was rejected by Israel before.
The answer that is being said overtly is the return to the negotiations, making them start from scratch, according to Sharon, who said so more than once. He said that the Oslo agreements had fallen.
Let's reconsider the matter! Don't you have a wise man?
A report compiled by the CAA said the burdens of foreign debts service soared from $1.45 billion to $1.4753 billion.
As soon as Egyptian-Israeli peace accords were signed, Israel sought to put in effect a plan to penetrate Egyptians' minds through its embassy in Cairo, consulate in Alexandria and its academic center, which made 300 suspicious research papers over19 years. The papers handled the Egyptian educational system, political upbringing and racial and religious groups in Egypt. There were also other researches on art, culture, academic activities and normalization of cultural, political, economic and social relations. The papers are aimed at penetrating Egyptians' minds and intellectual society.
Israeli "Yedioth Aharonot" reported that the Egyptian Ministry of Transport greenlit an Israeli-Dutch company to develop Damietta and Port Said harbors, while another Israeli enterprise failed to undertake East Port Said Project.
The serious thing in the issue is that the Israeli lobby is under protection and that the door is open for it to penetrate and act as it wills, according to Dr. Gamal Zahran, head of Political Science Department in Suez Canal University. There are four reasons which absolutely protect this lobby; rampant corruption, negligent control agencies, silence on lobby formations and long-standing stay of the ruling elite.

The businessmen spoke about their discontent with the government's inability to face economic troubles.
A number of the People's Assembly (PA) members tabled more than an interpellation to open the file of the case of mobile network obtained by Naguib Sawiris.
Eleven female members of the People's Assembly (PA) said they intend to form a parliamentary lobby with the objective of defending the rights of the sons of more than 250 thousand Egyptian women who are married to foreigners. It is to be mentioned that the Egyptian Law refuses to grant them the Egyptian nationality, which is granted to the sons of the Egyptian fathers only.
"A survey was made at all concerned official bodies and Egyptian embassies. It transpired that no Egyptian woman married an Israeli. The majority of Egyptian women married Arabs, particularly from the Gulf. Besides, there were marriages between Egyptians and Syrians at the time of unity between Egypt and Syria," they added.
This meaning was confirmed by the impeachment of former Egyptian minister of finance Mohie Eddin Al- Gharib and some ministry officials in the so-called "major customs case" in Cairo last week. An anti-corruption drive protects public funds and underscores the clean-handedness of a regime.
In Morocco, crackdowns on corruption have been launched since the parliament made up a probe panel to investigate into the dossier of the national fund for loan on tourist and real property to probe the causes of its crisis and losses, which exceeded 400 million US dollars as former officials at the Ministry of Finance and Central Bank were reported to be involved in the case. In its report last March, the parliamentary fact- finding committee concluded that the aspects of lavish spending, invented by the former officials, were direct reasons for the bankruptcy of the fund, which was granted 200 million US dollars from the state treasury and offered 350-million-pound privileged loans from commercial banks, in addition to extra sums of 200 million US dollars extended by shareholders to reorganize the fund's capital after its losses hit roughly 14 billion dirhams.
Feverish diplomatic contacts by the Khartoum government with Arab, Islamic and international parties to explain the dimensions of the war with the rebels in South Sudan have several serious indicators.
The internal front, including the political parties and several trends in the North, is no longer unanimous in one opinion over the South crisis. Moreover, Al-Sadeq Al-Mahdi, former premier and leader of the opposition Ummah Party, warned in Washington against the imposition of Sudan's unity on the Southerners. He asserted that self-determination for the South has become cornerstone for solving the conflict. He asked for attaching self-determination to the Egyptian-Libyan initiative and consulting with the concerned states in the region.
HOUSING LOAN VOLUME HITS LE9 BILLION UNDER REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE LAW
This resulted in a landlords' tendency to become lenient with buyers that only 25% of the price of a flat could be first payment, while the remaining sum would be paid over a period of 10-20 years, but at a relatively high interest rate, which would sharply impact on the buyers' incomes and hence their refrainment from buying real estate units.
The real estate mortgage law would by no means be the first attempt to support the low-income brackets if good intentions really turned into actions as in 1976 a general fund for low cost housing affiliated to the Minister of Housing was established.
Since 1993, there has been abundance in posh housing in contrast with a sharp decrease in low-income units supply, especially in view of the State tendency to list government housing companies for privatization.
A sum of LE14 billion has been spent on the infrastructure in the new cities in 2001, including water stations, sanitary drainage, power stations, telephones and roads. A total of 83 million square meters allocated to individuals as plots of land for villas and housing projects had been provided with infrastructure. These are being carried out by the Ministry of Housing, in addition to the plots of land allocated to private sector companies that undertake the introduction of utilities. A relative demand was claimed by the Sixth of October and the Tenth of Ramadan Cities, where one meter hit about one thousand pounds, while averaging about six thousand pounds in Nasr City and Heliopolis and 5- 10 thousand pounds in Al-Mohandessein, according to the status of the district. In Zamalek and Garden City no definite price per meter can be fixed simply because building operations are now almost on hold, but if a flat is put up for sale, the price per meter will average LE12 thousand.
In exclusive statements to Al-Alam Al-Youm, Khamis noted that the private sector contributed to the program by 7 million euros in the first stage that would increase in the coming stages.

He also underscored that the export level is low, compared with the gross domestic product. It is to be mentioned that the level of such investments is lower than that of the Far East and Central European countries and most of the Middle Eastern and North African countries, he revealed.

VALUE ADDED TAX, "CLEAN" ALTERNATIVE TO SALES TAX
2- The general tax categories structure which has been partially rationalised still needs analysis and study for more rationalisation so that the positive categories (above zero) may not exceed two.
The study concluded that the value added tax would not have retroactive impacts as it would not bring about any rise in the burdens shouldered by the low-income brackets. This tax would leave a limited impact on the distribution of tax burdens as most commodities and services are not now subject to the general sales tax and therefore the new tax addition would be constricted.

EGYPT & UNITED STATES AT ODDS ON EVE OF MAHER'S VISIT TO WASHINGTON
The New York Times report, which was written by Mary Anne Weaver, did not stop at criticizing the Egyptian judicial system and discussing the case of Saad Eddin Ebrahim from his arrest through his trial and the conditions in which he lived in prison. It went beyond that to attack the Egyptian political system and discuss the issues of democracy and elections, criticizing the manner in which the Egyptian government deals with Islamic movements.

Hassan Abu Shaira, living in Al-Ezza Camp, served with the Israelis and carried out operations for them, but the "fever", or rather "the blessing" of intifada inflicted him so he has now became obsessed with the souls of martyrs.

Their anger stems from their feeling that they had been duped even by one person!
In the press, the reputation of any defendant is freely tarnished after the newspapers turned into private estates units. The second point is the abuse of the right to freedom, as unrestricted freedom is a genuine disaster.
It was a sort of pornography, a well-known course of the tabloid papers! What was published is incriminated by every law in any country.

There have been accumulations of problems and crises between the Copts and the State and the Copts and the Muslims.

Their total is even higher than that of the totals of all the other Christian communities in the Arab Mashrik put together. However, there is a prevalent impression in the Arab world that Copts are a primarily Egyptian affair, not an active Arab entity.
And why do we go that long back in history?
I want to say that Arab Christians from all communities and countries have been a positive asset in, first, the building of the Islamic Arab civilization and, second, the assertion and the nurturing of the nationalist concept. Therefore, we must always look at them from the perspective of putting them at the heart of the Arab Nation, not in the margins as secondary elements, as their historic contributions say otherwise and their nationalist efforts cannot be denied.

During talks held by Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher with officials at the American Administration last week, the USA put a condition that loans and grants given to the SFD should be revised before it pumps new funds in the form of grants or loans.
The value of loans and grants expected this year is $350 million.

Hamas and Jihad were doing the same thing.
After such a splendid uprising and a more splendid wave of resistance, the Islamic resistance is required to abide by the rules of the negotiation game and dance to their rhythms. This cannot be accepted.
They did so in the past, as all people remember, and will do the same in the future. Meanwhile, they hope that the Palestinian people will unite behind the option of resistance till they uproot occupation.
Undoubtedly, what has been going on at the political level since the Tel Aviv operation causes double-angle apprehensions to the Islamic side in the Palestinian equation. The first angle of apprehensions is related to fears over victory that loomed in the horizons due to the strong will, sacrifices and martyrs who intimidated the enemy.

According to Dia'eddin Rashwan, they were demonstrations against the State rather than Mamdouh Mahran (board chairman and chief editor of Al-Nabaa newspaper) regardless of the fact that the main slogan chanted then was directed against Mahran's person.
Hence, the eruption that took place! Morcos went on to say nobody could deny that a package of accumulation had been building up even though everybody thought it had been forgotten especially after the Kusheh events.
Political channels, therefore, need to be re-energized. Zakher, nevertheless, rules out the possibility that the matter may turn into some sort of Christian political violence in the future, simply because Coptic youths, being party of Egyptian youth are religious quite devoid of any political concerns. The slogans chanted during the demonstrations were simply a means of giving vent to grief and anger because the sanctities had been encroached upon rather than anything else as no slogans were chanted against the Government for instance.
The research also expects the emergence of Christian religious organizations acting against what they would call, "the defeatist religious leadership." Coptic businessmen and the so-called defeatist Coptic elite may be exposed to some verbal assaults. On the other hand, another kind of violence may erupt against the State and the hard-line Islamists, but the role will be assigned to the American West through gradually escalating steps linked to how steady the subordination of the regime in Egypt will prove to the West especially America.

Sources said that the total value of Egyptian bonds offered on international markets exceeds $1.5 billion, which is more than the amount previously agreed upon, as it had been agreed to start operations by offering bonds whose total value would not exceed $500 million.
Southeast Asia is living in a state of tense anticipation at present, as a result of the launching of Indian-Israeli-American alliance in the face of Pakistani-Chinese alliance, particularly after the emergence of Western reports that mentioned the possibility of changing the course of the Arab oil pipelines so that they may go to the Indian Ocean, which would put the pipelines at the mercy of countries overlooking the Indian Ocean, such as China. The importance of this area, which some politicians now describe as the "area of this century," is increased by its geographical position and the fact that its inhabitants account for one-quarter of the world's population.
Indian and Israeli officials have been exchanging visits at an intensive rate, culminating in the visit to Tel Aviv by the Indian Foreign Minister, during which the two countries elevated their relationship to the level of strategic partnership.
The Pakistanis have indirectly accused the Iranians of seeking a continuation of the conflict and chaos in Afghanistan. The persistence of this state of anarchy in Afghanistan concerns Pakistan because it denies it access to the markets of Central Asia, as such access depends on stability in Afghanistan, without which the routes of Pakistani commerce would not be secure.

A bilateral joint fact-finding committee was formed for probing the details of the situation. All bodies concerned prepared a memo including all details to submit it to President Mubarak.
They were given this assignment by the highest level in the People's Assembly, so as to eliminate the loopholes revealed by the recent parliamentary elections, which covered both the People's Assembly and the Shura Council and resulted in over 950 challenges that accused deputies of doctoring votes and threatened to bring about the disbandment of the People's Assembly.
The new legislation will also comprise a special paragraph on the children born in marriages between Egyptian men and foreign women, so as to impose restrictions on access to People's Assembly seats for the children of Israeli women who married Egyptian nationals.

The Yahud explosion is not mere retaliation, nor is it an assertion of the fragile cease-fire claimed by Israel, failure of American mediation that appointed Sharon the decider of the start of political moves in the region, and melting of the "the frozenness period" mentioned in Mitchell's report. Rather, this explosion is an announcement of the birth of "the national and Islamic forces" organization to liberate Palestine. Moreover, this explosion is an assertion that the Palestinian uprising succeeded in ending all organizational differences among the resistance factions and their unity vis-à-vis the Israeli occupation. This explosion succeeded in taking these factions out of the stage of slogans to that of Jihad.

The People's Assembly will close on 4 July its first session, which has lasted since its election in November 2000 and was full of hot events and very active issues, particularly after the victory of 17 members of the banned Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) Group in parliamentary elections. The success of Muslim Brotherhood members in winning seats in the People's Assembly caused much controversy in Egyptian political and legislative circles at that time, as their victory made the Muslim Brotherhood Group the second largest parliamentary force after the government and the largest opposition force.
However, what really grabs attention in the performance of the Muslim Brotherhood representatives is that they deliberately raised issues that personally concerned them than they did others. For instance, they focused on education issues, deliberately embarrassing the Minister of Education in the wake of several decisions he had made for transferring Muslim Brotherhood members within his ministry to administrative positions. They also had the Minister of the Interior in a tight corner on account of the arrest campaign he had launched against some Muslim Brotherhood members in various governorates. The deputies also raised some issues that were regarded by some people as a degradation of the People's Assembly, such as the beauty-queen competition and the printing of photographs of indecently dressed women and men kissing women that the Muslim Brotherhood considered as immodest. This orientation distracted the Muslim Brotherhood representatives in the People's Assembly from other issues that concerned the public.

Iran broke silence to which it adhere last week, when an Iranian group, called the "followers of Imam Ali Ben Abu Taleb," launched a mural, the second of its kind in the Iranian capital, for Khaled Al- Islamboli, killer of late president of Egypt Sadat in 1981. In a press conference held in Teheran on July 2, Hamid Wasfi, spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, showed his country's content with the level of current development of its relations with Egypt in all fields. However, he affirmed that it was difficult to set a time for the resumption of full diplomatic relations between the two countries.
According to Arab diplomatic sources in Cairo, these sudden statements come within the framework of the Iranian government's efforts to contain Egyptian official discontent, which erupted when the Iranian authorities did not intervene to prevent the hard-liners from launching the mural of Khaled Al-Islamboli last week.
Abdel-Rahim dealt with political and external issues.
Abdel-Rahim also addressed UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, pointing out the massacres perpetrated by the Israeli army.
Both peoples are proud of their historical, geographical and civilizational weight in the region.
The difference between Egypt and Iran is that Iranian young men know the role of politics in their daily lives and resist those who want to eliminate them.
They contented themselves with a deal with the regime under which the roles were set. Of course, only part of our intellectuals, not all of them, participated in this deal, as some of them are still fighting. However, the concept of "the front" to face those who took possession of the homeland has been absent for decades in Egypt. Young men in Iran did not prove themselves without intellectuals who steered and taught them.
FOR FIRST TIME IN ITS HISTORY, SYRIA ISSUES REPORT ON GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
ZH/ Al-Ahram Al-Arabi, 7/7/2001
To follow are four tricks, approved by the PA: First Trick: 	In 1988, the PA was deceived and approved the amendments to oil agreements with foreign companies to be in favor of them.
As a result, Egypt imports crude oil from foreigners. This is an endless loss, as Egypt's production of crude oil plummeted to about 600 thousand barrels per day, against 850 thousand barrels per day in previous years.
It granted the concession to foreigners in 1995 upon a request from oil sector officials at that time. Almost 1900 thousand barrels per day, valued at $13 million per annum, are being produced at present. This sum of money could have been purely Egyptian, instead of being shared by foreigners at present. Due to these four tricks in the past ten years, Egypt lost $18 billion, in addition to its endless losses due to the depletion of its oil reserves owing to the first and second tricks.
This was stated by Minister of Transport Ibrahim Al-Demeiri, who pointed out that the French government had given the stamp of approval for financing the feasibility study of the project first stage.

The recent popular Coptic protests together with the official rejection of some press reports that did harm to Christianity, its sanctities and symbols were by no means unrelated to some previous, perhaps not so hot, events that reveal a lack of a strict constitutional codification of the relation between the religion and the state in Egypt, which foreshadows even further similar occurrences unless such a problem was decisively resolved!
What seems to be urgently needed here is a constitutional provision that makes it clear that the dominant religion in Egypt is Islam, which is the religion of the majority, while Christianity is the religion of the rest of the Egyptians with the adherents of both religions enjoying equal constitutional guarantees and rights.
Shenuda added that such regulation of visits came in response to proposals he received from some Copts in this respect.
It is well-known that most Egyptian monasteries do not receive visitors during fasting periods.

The PA office just satisfied the Ikhwanite MPs through selecting Dr. Akram Al-Sha'er, an Ikhwanite MP, as member of the Executive Committee of the Parliamentary Division. In the meantime, a number of Ikhwanite PA members, including Mahfouz Helmi, Akram Al-Sha'er and Gamal Heshmat, said they would start efforts from now on to have the decision (of recognition) issued in the coming session.

In light of world orientations in the banking industry and the conditions of the banking sector in Egypt, it is clear that there is a need to merge banks together because big financial entities can stand competition more than small ones.
Before the government announces its plan to merge banks together, a number of foreign banks operating in Egypt started to probe the process of amalgamation and establishment of a joint bank. These processes include:
Merger is taking place at a time when the Egyptian banking market has undergone variables, especially as the quota of joint and foreign banks increased on the market, while that of the public banks (Banque du Caire, Banque Misr, Bank of Alexandria and the National Bank of Egypt) plummeted from 75% to 50% out of the banking activity total. The retreat is still on, despite the rise in the volume of the market itself.
"The real conflict is with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who has a black track record and is the one who rakes the flames of war or douses them," Assad said, affirming that his country supported Hizbullah morally and politically, but not materially. "Stopping Hizbullah operations at Shabaa Farms is not the Syrian Army's job," he pointed out.
So, the real conflict between us and the Israelis is over who ignites the war and who prevents it."
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD WELCOMES SYRIA'S AUTHORIZATION OF ISLAMIC FORUM IN DAMASCUS

MUBARAK'S MEETING WITH POPE SHENUDA III MAY CLOSE FILE OF DEFROCKED MONK
Despite the fact that all agencies played their role in containing the crisis, starting from striking the newspaper owner and chief editor Mamdouh Mahran off the Press Syndicate and withdrawing the paper's license along with bringing him to trial before the Supreme State Security Court, the meeting of Mubarak with the Pope is the means that would close that file in the way that the Copts desire and put an end to reports that some tried to promote during the crisis to the effect that the security had leaked the videotape of the monk's immoral practices to the newspaper. It is worth mentioning that President Mubarak during his interview with Makram Mohamed Ahmed, Chief Editor of Al-Mussawar weekly magazine, denied such reports as groundless and untrue.
Initial investigations point out that the death may have been caused by the monk having had some poisoned food.
Asharq Al-Awsat learned from Al-Paramous Church, one of Wadi Al-Natroun Churches 120 km away from Cairo on Cairo-Alexandria Desert Road, that the monk, 60, had given up monasticism and had been degraded from his religious rank in 1971 and had no relation with the Church since then.

Abdel-Bari Attwan, Chief Editor of Al-Quds Al-Arabi, writes an editorial under the above heading. Excerpts run to the following effect:
The Egyptian government does not want to hold an Arab summit, nor does it want to go to war, or open the borders to support the uprising with weapons. It does not want Egyptians to show their wrath, nor does it want them to demonstrate in solidarity with their brothers in the occupied territories. The Egyptian government does not want to close down the Israeli Embassy and expel the Israeli diplomats from Cairo.
There is no harm in admitting that the steering wheel is in Cairo and the source of true influence on the Arab World is in Cairo; i.e. if Egypt turns left, the Arab will turn left, and if it turns right, they will turn with it. Egypt invented the option of peace and considered it a strategic one.
AK, Al-Quds Al-Arabi, 7/8/2001
The note pointed to confessions of Israeli retired military officials and the depositions of eyewitnesses to the massacres to which Egyptian POWs were exposed. The note included the names of Israeli officials, foremost among whom are Ariel Sharon and Benjamin Bin Eliezer and others.

Apart from composite and phosphate fertilizers, all sorts of Israeli food and industrial commodities exports were suspended during the period, the sources said.
We have been suffering from a degeneration of Egypt's diplomatic capability since 1996 when the stimulus and response diplomacy started, together with inability to take political initiative either regionally or internationally.
That failure is blamed on Minister Maher who criticizes the committee on Arab summit resolutions follow-up, shows no enthusiasm for micro or emergency Arab summit. He applauds the decision regarding international observers in Genoa summit for the G8. He is always looking forward to assistance from the American friend. Maher's modesty lends itself to his vision of Egypt's role as defusing the crisis rather than playing any leading role in solving it, a role based on an almost unanimous Arab support, emanating from keenness on the achievement of an Arab reconciliation that has long been delayed by American pressure, in the first place, and individual self-interest of separate countries, secondly and thirdly by the intransigence of some Arab Gulf rulers.
It is perhaps too early or even too difficult to ask Maher to think and then act regarding the relations of alliance and strategic cooperation between Egypt and the big powers including some pivotal third world countries. We've been too late in attaining partnership with China covering political, economic and defence areas. Neither did we restore our markets in Russia or Russian contribution to our military capabilities. Our technological and defense cooperation with both Pakistan and Iran has remained mysteriously lost!

Nuclear power experts say that Egypt has the required expertise and that such a step will provide the increasing needs of fuel in Egypt and usher the country into other fields that depend on nuclear power, particularly land reclamation, where nuclear power is used for water- desalination.
Dr Al Barad'ee affirmed that the participation of the private sector in that field had become common in all advanced countries, as that sector had the large investments and technological capabilities required for erecting nuclear stations, adding that nuclear stations could boost the energy capabilities of Egypt and other developing countries.
He added that Egypt had the expertise required for building nuclear reactors for generating electricity and that it was no longer prohibited to invest money in that field because of its connection to state economies and its being an effective means of production.
"The entry of investments into the field of nuclear power will be the first step towards entering new fields that do depend on nuclear power at present but will need it only in the future, and these industries will make great economic additions. For example, there are the fields of radioactive isotopes, food-preservation and radiotherapy. Financing will play a great role in this field, too, because it is the main element of success for the establishment of a nuclear industry that will provide our peaceful needs and also generate power.
Noor Eddin Mohammad, a businessman, believes that attention to unconventional sources of energy, particularly nuclear power, had become a strategic focus of countries, especially those which did not produce petroleum and had to import it. "Businessmen and investors are responsible in great part for finding the sources of the energy for operating their projects."

When it comes to relations with Turkey, which are both complex and historical, we find it difficult to decide who is to blame for the errors committed.

The study stressed the necessity of enhancing the competitive edge of Egyptian exports through taking some steps the most significant of which are privatizing the chief services at ports and the financial sector and introducing reforms to the constitutions of some institutions such as the customs administration and the tax systems. Although the reform movement is complicated and needs great efforts, it is indispensable and necessary for increasing exports especially as the delay of such reforms till the institutions are modernized will take much time as the modernization of those institutions comes as a reaction to the competitive pressure. Statistics point out that the Egyptian exports in early 1990's went up from $4.2 billion to $6.3 billion in 1999/2000. Also, the Egyptian exports to a greater number of markets varied and the industrial exports increased from 27% of the total exports in 1990/1991 to 45% in 1999/2000 while the traditional exports such as crude oil and agricultural commodities went down from 40% to 19% during the reporting period.

ARAB STRATEGIC REPORT: THE WAR OPTION BETWEEN ARABS AND ISRAEL IS MORE LIKELY THAN THE PEACE OPTION
Such war climates have even aggravated by Israeli threats to launch a war in the region, the eruption of Al-Aqsa uprising as well as the exacerbation of the arms race problem as the region retained its traditional place at the top of arms buyers throughout the world. Military expenditure in the Middle East in 1999 reached $60 billion and the main countries involved in Arab-Israeli conflict, according to an international report witnessed enormous quantitative and qualitative development. Such countries have thus taken great lengths to develop their armed forces in such an uncontrollable or irrevocable manner in the foreseeable future, especially as Israeli former Premier, Ihud Barak had once said that the possession of a great military power represents a priority for Israel that exceeds any priority for peace with the Arabs.
The report pointed out that viewpoints adopted by the various parties to the conflict were characterized by intransigence let alone the biased position adopted by the Americans to Israeli demands, so much so that the they started pressuring Palestinian President Arafat and some Arab leaders to force him to render capitulations.
Although the report pointed to the waning effect of the regime's institutions and their inability to accommodate both international and regional variables, it also mentioned those positive phenomena:
The report monitors an only breakthrough in Arab security relations in the form of joint maneuvers and exercises between some Arab countries.
The Arabs opt for politics rather than the economy!
On the other hand, major Arab countries including Egypt adopt intensive defensive policies based on the proposition that stability of the peaceful relations requires a military force capable of defending peace.
Egypt's elections highlighted Muslim Brotherhood skill:
The report praised what it called the Ikhwanite institution skills and remarkable success compared with other political forces in introducing a new mechanism characterized by political efficiency as the group knew when to withdraw from involvement in the management of the details of the contestants running his election battle and when to intervene by choosing such contestants and pace making their election battle movement.
The European Union urged the Egyptian government in a memo to immediately adopt anti-laundering law as a main item in the Egyptian-European partnership agreement. This legislation should be adopted before the end of next month, the EU said in the memo.
However, this does not mean that there are laundering cases in Egypt, but Egypt's opening to the outside world, economic liberalization and integration of Egypt's economy into the world economy might require an anti-laundering legislation in a bid to protect the national economy.
Deputy General Manger of the Egyptian Commercial Bank Samir Gad has said this law is necessary, but it should be adopted once economic conditions have improved and recession and stagnation have come to a close.
High ranking official at the bank said a study had been already conducted to peg the pound to the euro, the US dollar and the Japanese Yen affirming that the time is now ripe for performing such a linkage operation.

On the other hand, it was announced in Washington that Egypt presented yesterday (August 17) ideas for peace and it might be able to announce more details in two days. This was announced by Usama Al-Baz, Political Adviser to President Hosni Mubarak, in Washington yesterday on the heels of talks with US Secretary of State Collin Powel.
Under this headline, prominent writer of Asharq Al-Awsat, Ahmed Al-Rabei wrote a column which ran to the following effect only in part:
Such Syrian waiting will not serve Syrian purposes as waiting has never served as a pressure factor, on the contrary it has been a waste of time, bolstering the status quo position that contravenes international legitimacy and encouraging Israelis to build more settlements in the Golan heights changing its demographic traits through intensifying Israeli presence at the expense of its original population.
The occupation of the symbolic Orient House rules out the recognition of the Palestinians, Arabs, or Muslims of the Israelis and the possibility of reaching coexistence with them.
He is just opening the gate of hell before the peoples of the region, expecting the declaration of a new war. War, to our mind, is the war of terrorism or struggle as called by each party. This war will not be confined to Israel or the occupied land but will also stretch out to every place in the world, where there are the forces of oppression and terrorism, which bully unarmed people, i.e. the US and Israel. No one in the world would be able to bring this war to a halt once it broke out. This war will be a real hell-fire just for Sharon's knowledge.
There have been many calls in the Arab street for the time being for necessarily declaring war on Israel to defend the Palestinian people against the daily massacre to which they have been exposed since the occupation started in general and the Aqsa Mosque incidents (Intifada), which broke out late last September, in particular. 1 	However, no one could identify the quality of this required war.
Syria even stood as a spectator when similar massacres took place in the bloody 1982 summer, during which the Palestinians were besieged, slain at camps in Beirut, Lebanon, and were expelled from the front line with Israel.
Even following the departure of King Hussin of Jordan, the blow dealt by the Jordanian regime to Hamas was non-gratis present to Israel.
However, Hizbullah can launch a sort of skirmishes from the liberated Lebanese south, but it is difficult to imagine that matters may develop into war between Lebanon as a whole, both state and people, and Israel.
Moreover, there are additional intricate problems in the political thought of war, which lie in the failure to expressly identify the goals of this war, whether it is aimed at annihilating the Israelis, easing pressure on the Palestinians, restoring the occupied Palestinian territories or preserving Jerusalem.

The American senior officials met by Al-Baz, nevertheless, adhered to their viewpoint that the matter should be left to Israel and the Palestinian National Authority to decide to urgently stop fighting and resume settlement talks. Washington is preparing to oppose the Arab campaign to send international observers to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which is by far less than the original Palestinian request to send an international force to protect the Palestinians.

He aspires after that aim for the sake of his family, brothers, relatives and all coming generations so that they may enjoy that land.
This is the difference between people believing in a cause of life and destiny and others who stay, to the end of their lives, tracked down just like any night gang.
The recent field developments in the Palestinian-Israeli confrontation have certainly undermined the illusions of the political settlement based on Oslo peace agreement, notwithstanding some unreasonable contentions hither and thither.
Stopping this bet does not mean ignoring or neglecting the US role. But, what is required is acting for changing the US position by means of pressure and use of Arab strength cards, rather than standing at the door of the White House in quest for change from Washington.
Earnest efforts should be exerted to gain the international public opinion.
On August 18, the Syrian government passed a bill to amend some articles of the press law and update them. This will be the second press law to be passed by Syria throughout its modern history after the elapse of 51 years since the draft of the current law was worded during the French mandate (1920-1946).

EGYPTIAN LAWYER TRACKS DOWN FRENCH & BRITISH CRIMINALS OF WAR!
Al-Wahsh did not content himself with demanding the trial of the Israeli war criminals, but he developed his attack by seeking to sue French and British military officials who took part in the 1956 War. In his memo to the Public Prosecutor, Al-Wahsh said as long as the 1956 War had been conducted by the Zionist entity in collaboration with France and Britain on Egyptian soil just because the Egyptians insisted on ousting every usurper or oppressive colonizer and the three armies commanders perpetrated massacres and war crimes against Egyptian individuals, their trial before the Egyptian law was imperative.
The Egyptian authorities have hard evidence of this incident. They have a message Al-Rawi wrote with his blood in which he affirmed that he was killed at the hands of the French. The Red Cross also issued a certificate proving that incident.

The per capita quota of expenditure on food in the poor bracket hits LE377 annually or 58.5% of their income which represents 36% of the per capita average quota in the middle class bracket and 29% of per capita quota in well-to-do families, the study indicated. This shows that the per capita quota of spending on food in poor families went down when compared to its counterpart in the middle class and rich families. This is reflected on the quantity and type of food an individual gets. The diet of an individual belonging to the poor bracket basically consists of starchy foods and legumes on which spending hits 38.2% of this average total.

Third, Israel has stormed Palestinian cities and villages, seized the PNA symbols and institutions, especially the Orient House, let alone a serial of heinous assassinations, which are crimes committed by a State even though other responsible states would refrain from committing them. They can only be committed by terrorist groups by which I mean the operations of political murders perpetrated against Palestinian resistance leaderships.
There are some facts that have started to crystallize, for instance: 	1 - The USA, though supposedly the uni-superpower and leader of the modern world, is currently trying to disown its responsibilities in various regions of the world. This has, nevertheless, been most obvious in its deliberate abandonment of its role towards peace and stability between the Palestinians and Israel.
4 - Yes, it's true that Egypt is trying, Jordan is attempting, Saudi Arabia supporting, Syria steadfastly rejecting, Iraq voicing enthusiasm and the other Arab countries express full support of the first Arab and Islamic cause. Yet, the reaction, on the other hand, remains limited even though not recording the point of nil.
This, to my mind, requires some sort of diplomatic and mass media experience in order to put forward proposals that are specifically different from any former ones because we do need new ideas and constructive initiatives in this dark stage of our national history.
I honestly wonder if we do not use all available cards now, when are we going to use them? The Palestinian cause seems on the brink of liquidation and the world with the USA at its head, stands armfolded showing either passivity or fluidity at best.
From birth to death and even after death, an Egyptian never stops paying taxes, fees and "extortions" to the government.
Experts estimate the volume of tax evasion at LE5 billion annually, while others say the volume of tax evasion doubles this figure.
Moreover, Egyptians pay fees in return for consular measures, passports, work licenses, Ids, birth and death certificates, traffic, driving licenses,etc.
The poor shoulder most of these taxes and taxpayers pay them unconsciously.
The monthly bulletin of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) uncovered that last March the Public Treasury issued LE50 billion bonds in favor of the CBE, according to the Law no. 97 for the year 2000. Commenting on this, Dr. Ahmed Al-Ghandour, professor of economy at Cairo University, says: "These bonds are debts owed by the government, which, most probably, does not repay them. These bonds were issued in return for new monetary issuance."
Domestic debts, owed by the government, amounted to about LE187 billion last May and balances of bonds and bills reached LE132 billion, of which LE29 billion were treasury bonds, says the bulletin. Stocks of bonds rose from LE52 billion during the second quarter of the fiscal year 2000/2001 to LE103 billion during the third quarter of the same year.

RESTRUCTURING OF SPINNING & WEAVING INDUSTRY COSTS $1.7 BILLION
The Premier asked for determining sums of money required for having the textile industry reformed, said the source, adding that these sums of money were estimated at $1.7 billion at least.
The minister summed up the textile sector problems in the following: Shortcomings of marketing activities, low level of Egyptian products' competitive edge, backwardness of machines and tools used in the factories, limited sources of finance and the rise in the number of labor.
Egypt backtracked on the idea of privatizing potable water and sanitary drainage while trying to convince the private sector to finance water projects and operate and maintain them as this participation by the private sector will help decrease subsidy and pump fresh investments away from the State's general budget.
The percentage of wasted water went up due to the deterioration of the current networks set up 55 years ago. Consequently, replacement and renovation needed huge investments, which requires reconsideration of management system.

On the other hand, the study, which was prepared in a workshop held recently by the Cabinet's Information Center during which it has been announced that an early warning system for the Egyptian financial sector had been reached, indicated that there is a bullish tendency in the private sector's foreign loaning as the annual growth rate of this loaning is as follows: 3.4%, 15.2%, 1.8% and 9.5% during the years 1997/98, 1998/99, 1999/2000 and the quarter starting from July till September of 2000 consecutively. The study ascribed this rise mainly to the restrictions imposed by the banking system in order to curb the granting of credit for financing imports from domestic resources in "hard currency". The study expected that in light of the continuation of the current economic growth rate, or expansion in growth, and the continuation of banking restrictions this kind of loaning may grow greatly. Thus it is considered in its preliminary stages at present. In case the private sector's short-term foreign loaning growth rate exceeds the growth rate of this sector, it may enter the vicious circle of loaning, something which will undoubtedly negatively affect its performance in the future, the study warned.
The ideal policy that should be followed in the case of the Egyptian economy should include selected shrinking elements that can decrease demand for foreign commodities and improve demand that absorb the domestic product and the target increases. In this case the prices level may go down and the product level and employment may rise and exchange market will not deteriorate.

All indicators assert that cotton yield in the new season will reach about 5.5 million kantars, cultivated in 750 thousand feddans, against 4.2 million kantars last season, cultivated in 540 thousand feddans.
These proposed prices will enable spinneries to work at economical costs and spare them the importation of about one million kantars at $6 million, which will increase demand for hard currencies, he points out. In the same context, Abdel-Latif Al-Tabakh, Cotton Adviser at the Holding Company, says: "We should separate the prices at which the spinneries buy cotton from the farmers' prices. The government should shoulder such price differences via a price equalization fund."
Abaza says: "The rise in the dollar exchange rate against the Egyptian pound will enable us to reduce the export prices without any impact on the farmers' prices, which will not be less than last year prices. Egypt aims at exporting about two million kantars at least." He points out that the expected reduction will be in favor of Egyptian cotton this season. However, this will sharpen competition with the American pima cotton, whose exports last season reached 1.5 million kantars, while actual exports of Egyptian cotton amounted to 1.2 million kantars at the end of this week.
Rejection: 	Abdel-Hakim Hagag, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Fund on Supporting Spinning and Weaving Industry, rejects this study in its entirety. This study comes within the framework of anti-Egyptian cotton orientations, which threaten about ten million people, whose sustenance rely on this crop, he says. Moreover, depriving Egyptian spinneries of Egyptian cotton will decrease, not increase, exports because cotton importation will confine Egyptian industry to sewing only, he says.

But Mohammad Raslan, the lawyer whose complaint was the basis upon which the Administrative Affairs Court pronounced its decision, said that preparations for the celebration took place before the end of that period and that the court decision required the government to stop all activities that are related to the celebration or preparations for it, unless another decision was passed to revoke that decision.
They pointed out that those visitors did the village no good in terms of commerce, as they brought everything they needed with them from outside Egypt and the local people usually refused to do business with them, either out of hatred or for fear of involvement in what might be construed as violations of the law.
No voice in Cairo is louder than an upcoming ministerial meeting to be presided over by President Hosni Mubarak on October 1 to review the government performance and probe cabinet ministers' future blueprints, even though Egypt is almost immersed in preparations for the new academic year as an army of 18 million pupils and students will start study on September 15.

In a study on Israeli strategy for cooperation with Arab countries in the field of petroleum, Hammuda says that the Israeli expansion of the oil pipeline is aimed at attracting as much Iranian crude as possible to the Israeli pipeline instead of the Suez Canal and SUMED pipeline and erecting a number of storage projects for storage crude for customers. He explains that the stored crude would be released on the market quickly at times of high demand to avail the high prices, pointing out that the services rendered through the pipeline will be developed in such a way that the marketing management of the Israeli pipeline will contract for carrying the oil through the pipeline from export ports to Ashkelon, from which it will be exported to western and northern consumers on Israeli tankers. Israel will provide tanker refueling and crude storage services free of charge to permanent customers, which could make international oil-trading companies use the Elat-Ashkelon pipeline for carrying crude, particularly from Iran, and even high-sulfur Egyptian crude, such as that produced at Ras Badran and Ras Gharib, as SUMED pipeline is designed to carry only low-sulfur crude.
It revealed an Israeli strategy for normalization of relations with Arab States in the field of oil and gas production, indicating that that strategy comprised several axes, including building a pipeline network for carrying Arab crude through Israel and erecting a number of refineries in cooperation with Arab countries. The strategy aimed at making Israel the centre for collecting and exporting natural gas in the region, which would pose a serious challenge to Arab development in general and the Arab oil and gas industry in particular, the study warned.
Sources close to the meeting said that the committees on resolving a number of issues of cooperation with Europe, Africa and others have started to ponder over new actions to make positions more active and take positive moves.
A Ministry of Transport statement, released by the Cabinet's Information and Decision Support Center, said that the railway transport revenues in the corresponding period totaled 406 million pounds, including 290 million pounds in passenger transport and 116 million pounds in cargo transport proceeds against 272 million pounds in passenger transport revenues last year and 105 million pounds' worth of cargo transport.
Hassan Amer, well-known economic affairs journalist, writes a feature with Sawt Al- Ommah. Excerpts run to the following effect:
Unfortunately, Egypt's economic future is contingent upon these "museum" leaderships that have absolute powers in running banking resources.
Ali Negm started his career at the National Bank of Egypt (NBE).
Due to his seniority, he was promoted to governor of the CBE.
In a few years' time, he led the bank to the brink of bankruptcy.
He is a kin to the revolutionary (July 1952) power.
He remained in this post till he reached the age of retirement.
Anyway, Banque Misr was not a success during the past three decades, except for a short period taken up by Mohamed Ali Hafez. Banque Misr remained a mere partner to a limited and pressed market that is contingent upon its aging leaderships.
When Fatahallah Rifaat (a free officer) took up the leadership of the Principal Bank for Agricultural Development, he chose Ezzi director of his office.
However, he invested his influence in maintaining the presidency of Al-Watany Bank of Egypt forever.
He was "a good minister of finance."
No one offered to purchase it, except for one investor.
He is the man of the government who confronted Dr. Mustafa Al-Saeed, whom he succeeded in chairing the parliamentary economic committee.
The government rewarded him with the presidency of the Arab Investment Bank.
It was hard for the government to leave the guy away from it. So, it selected him president of the Export Development Bank of Egypt. By the way, this man is talented in repeating "sexy and unsexy jokes."
The sole exception was Banque du Caire.
They resorted to all means to stay in their posts.
This came in the monthly report of the Economy and Foreign Trade Ministry. Semi- processed exports went up by 22%, compared with the same period (last year), while exports of fuel and raw cotton plummeted by 7% and 14.7% respectively, said the report.
These deposits amounted to LE290 billion last June against LE284 billion in May. Deposits in domestic currency reached LE217 billion in June 2001 against LE213 billion in May of the same year. Deposits in foreign currencies amounted to the equivalent of LE72.6 billion in June 2001 against LE70.8 billion last May. Domestic liquidity rose from LE280 billion in May to LE285 billion in June, a rate of 11.6%, said the report.
Yesterday (September 11), it was announced in Damascus that two agreements were signed by Syria and Turkey on bringing about cooperation in the fields of security, terrorism combat and prevention of narcotics smuggling via their borders. These agreements come within the framework of boosting relations between the two countries, which would result in a visit by President Bashar Assad to Ankara following talks to be held by Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem with his Syrian counterpart Farouk Al- Shara in Damascus soon.
The second agreement provides for "bringing about cooperation to return illegal emigrants to their country. This stems from the two sides' insistence on developing cooperation between them in the field of preserving security along their joint borders and banning illegal travel of persons between the two countries."
It is believed in Turkey that the new security agreement will enable Ankara to call for being handed over Turkish Kurds who may resort to Syria, or groups of the Kurdistani Labor Party.
People's Assembly (PA) members described the new housing bill sponsored by the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) Committee on Housing and which dealt with the relations between landlords and tenants as a "time bomb" that might explode at anytime.
The PA members contending the bill said that the endorsement of the bill in its present form without amendments primarily means the government would have to increase the salaries and wages of the personnel by the same ratio of the new rise. This will force the government to bring about a comprehensive change in the pay structure and inflationary rates.
It appears that the frequent reopening of the Coptic wound over the past years was behind what everybody now perceives as an undeclared decision by the Egyptian ruling elite to see that the whole Coptic issue should be subjected, perhaps for the first time, not only to microscopic examination but to surgical interference as well.
What is more is that the desire for reforming the Church has spilled over the boundaries of the cultured elite into the Coptic masses, which went out on demonstrations, carrying loudspeakers and photographs of Anba Aminus and denouncing Pope Shinouda's decision to banish him.
He also prohibited photography and videotaping during marriage ceremonies to enforce the respect due to Church ceremonies. In addition, he reduced the allocations of priests and prohibited their travel in cars, in an apparent restoration of the way of life of the early priests.
According to studies made by Muslims and Copts, since Pope Shinouda assumed his position, the Church has behaved as if the State "were not there," to quote the words of late President Sadat, or as if it were an equal of the State. It appears that the pretext of the Church that no institution should interfere in the religious affairs of Copts is being reconsidered by the Egyptian community and its institutions.
Tarek Al-Bishri wonders how the Coptic mentality is being shaped in terms of its outlook at the national community and the relationship between Copts and other Egyptians, i.e. Muslims. He also points out the seriousness of the emerging trend of separating Coptic history from the Egyptian history in general and focusing on certain events that are being interpreted from a sectarian perspective, which paves the way for a "culture of hatred" and is in obvious contradiction with the heritage of objective works of Coptic historians, such as The Story of the Coptic Church by Iris Habib and The Precious Virgin, or even the works of the Coptic History Committee, including The History of the Coptic Nation, A Synopsis Of The History Of Christianity In Egypt.
This is another evidence of the pressing need for a comprehensive review of the prevailing current in the national cultural project that has gradually lost its ability to stand in the face of the winds of social, political and cultural change that blow on the Egyptian community, which needs a new formula built on the principles required by a modern community that is entering the twenty-first century.
Yesterday (September 11), the Shura Council's Health Committee continued listening to the views of scientists and specialists regarding the controversy that caused violent confrontation between Health Minister Ismail Sallam and Medical Association Chairman Dr. Hamdi Al-Sayed and their opponents, especially Akhbar Al-Youm Board Chairman and Chief Editor, who is closely related to decision-makers.

Following a cabinet meeting in Cairo, which he presided over, Mubarak said: "No one can expect or imagine what happened today in the US, particularly the number of victims."
An official at the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine said the Movement opposes the killing of civilians. He held the "American policy" in heated areas of the world responsible for the assaults witnessed by the US yesterday.
A statement, issued at the end of a Jordanian government meeting, asserted that the wave of terrorist acts to which the US is exposed contravened all religious and human values. Qatar and Kuwait denounced the "terrorist attacks."
While local TVs were relaying live the collapse of the World Trade Center and fires at the Pentagon, the southern district in Lebanon and the Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut and South Lebanon witnessed the "bullets of happiness," fired by masked armed men.
An official Saudi source was quoted as saying: "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia utterly condemns such acts which contradict religious values and human civilizational concepts, and as such we sadly and heartedly condole with the families of the victims and US President George W. Bush as well as the American people."
Al-Akhbar exclusively publishes the executive draft statute for real estate financing law, which will be implemented on September 25, 2001.
Al-Akhbar, 13/9/2001

The rest of the world can speak for itself. As for me, I will talk only of what ails me and the reader. The blind American support of Israel damages American interest in the Middle East and creates a fertile breeding ground for terrorists who compete to die in their war against the United States.

The Afghani pilot explained that the training given to the young men had included lectures, or what is called "ground training" in aviation academies, after which they had been relocated to a military airfield near Bamyan City.
MFA, Asharq Al Awsat, 13/9/2001
Most analysts focused on the "direct relation" between the bombings and developments in the Middle East. From the moment the collision of the first airliner with the World Trade Centre became known, all television channels in Russia began live broadcasting from New York, Washington D. C. and Tel Aviv. Russian television screens were rife with the images of extremist Israeli figures, such as Yevgdor Lieberman and Nathan Sharansky. The rhetoric of most analysts was that the bombings in New York, Washington D. C., Jerusalem, Moscow and Chechnya had only one source: "Islamic terrorism" that cooperated in all the "arenas of confrontation" against its enemies.

In cooperation with the Egyptian universities, the Building Research Center and Arab Contractors, the ministry is going to set theoretical and practical training courses for engineers at all ministries, starting with those of the Ministry of Housing, he said.
The Egyptian Banks Union called upon the Government to backtrack on imposing a reserve for securing bank deposits at the Banking System, which is defined at a rate of 15% of deposits volume.
Most developed countries such as America, England and Germany, which have the best banking systems worldwide, do not acknowledge this insurance percentage principle, he added. Consequently, the Egyptian Banking System needn't retain this percentage, especially that Egyptian banks have never used such a reserve to redress their problems which means thus this reserve is a mere unfeasible burden.
Dr Ahmed al-Ghandour, former dean of the Faculty of Economics and Political Sciences and board member of the CBE, objected to the cancellation of this percentage indicating that any banking system in the world gains the confidence of its clients through its reputation, services and to what extent it secures the deposits, whether small or large.
The Egyptian parliament had received a related letter with a court ruling invalidating the membership of Rami Lakah who has Egyptian and French nationalities.
The resolution of the dual nationality problem will take two political and legal directions, putting international relations into account, the sources said, expecting those Egyptians who fall in the "snare of Israelis", especially the young men who go to Israel in pursuit of work, to be strictly ordered not to accept Israeli nationality, or their Egyptian nationality will be cancelled. A draft law will be debated at the new parliamentary session to resolve the issue, they added.
Egypt's trade with the US constitutes 25% (of Egypt's trade) and the American trade with the world represents 40% of the total world trade, he said.

The most important of such regulations is what is stated in Article 13 of the statute concerning the evaluation of the material value of the customs duties imposed on imported deals. This article stipulates that the Customs Department is entitled to asking importers for paying customs differentials to the Department within two years of the customs release, whether the deal was commodities or materials, in case the Customs Department saw that the customs duties paid by the importer were low or incorrectly estimated. Mostafa Zaki, Chairman of the Importers Division said this article is unfair to importers. "We, importers, submit our tax return on expenditure and income on a yearly basis.
PROPOSED BILL ON PUTTING CABINET MINISTERS ON TRIAL
MT / Rose Al-Youssef, 15/9/2001

Israel is eager to offer its expertise in assassinations in the hope that its crimes against the Palestinians may be seen as exemplary models for the new war, which the Western World wants to wage accompanied with Arab and Islamic countries in order to eliminate terrorism.
This campaign was mounted due to the Ambassador's statements, in which he refused to draw a comparison between terrorism to which the US was exposed and the operations to which Israel is exposed.
Asked about Israeli Premier Ariel Sharon's statements to US Secretary of State Collin Powel that "each of us has a Ben Laden and our Ben Laden is Yasser Arafat," the French Ambassador said: "This is a comparison that is far from reality."

Fahmy Hewaidi, the famous Islamist writer, selected this title for an article he wrote in Al Ahram, in which he said:
However, the way in which the attack was executed raises strong doubts about the identity of the culprits, particularly as the performance of the operation goes a long way over the ceiling of the attempts previously made by Bin Laden and his cronies, who are now the target of the anticipated war. This operation required "super" organization, as former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger rightly said. It also entailed a high level of skilled piloting, not to mention the superb level of imaginative and innovative thinking behind its planning. All of these elements were never evident - or not featured together, to be more accurate - in any operation launched by individuals or groups from the Middle East over the past forty years, at least.
The list of suspects contains the names of three Saudis, and it has been found that one of them died a year ago, while the second has finished his training in the United States and is back to his country and the third lives in Jeddah.
Even if some Muslims prove to be behind this act, it defies understanding why everybody is not punished for their own deeds and why each and every Muslim group is required to announce its innocence and deny responsibility for that act. Not only that, for some of us have acted as if we had to hold our breath and leave everything in our hands to wait for the American reaction, whose scope we do not know and whose objectives we are not sure about. Even the Palestinian Return Centre in London distributed a circular in which it announced the cancellation of a symposium it has scheduled for 17 September to commemorate the anniversary of Sabra and Chatilla massacres at the Eastern and African Studies College.
The great scientist spent nine months in jail, during which his life and family were destroyed. However, the legal team that defended him managed to prove that the charges against him had been falsified and the FBI had deceived the judge who ordered his imprisonment. It was found that news reports had indicated that China might have penetrated security at the Los Alamos Laboratory, America's most important nuclear research stronghold. The Chinese scientist, who was working at the laboratory at that time, was an easy prey, a perfect suspect that the charge could be stuck to, which would stop the talk about the information leak immediately.
Mohamed Abdel-Hakam Diyab, an Egyptian writer residing in London, writes an article under the above heading.
All slogans adopted by the American Administration and other Western powers have noticeably turned into lies and falsifications.
That was why it was only natural that contentment would be the response to what they deemed as heavenly retribution. Some, rightfully, say that it is not right to gloat over others misfortunes. However, what can be done with that racist policy that deny Arabs and Muslims any human treatment? Any harm done to such a policy would, therefore, bring about contentment for the oppressed who is by the end of the day only human neither a stone nor a slave for Western racism, whose orders he is supposed to abide by without any attempt to complain. The West keeps on describing the Arabs as barbarous and backward, branding them of every defect and always gloating over any misfortunes that might afflict them.
Saddam Hussein was of the view that the terrorist operations "are the beginning of a certain defeat of the US." Saddam advised the Arab countries not to cooperate with the US in its efforts to form an "anti-terrorism international alliance." Addressing Tunisian Foreign Minister Al-Habib Ben Yehiya in Baghdad on Thursday, September 13, Saddam said: "I fear that the Arabs, who are related to America, will fall, as did the countries that were related to the Soviet Union."
Observers considered Powell's statements a clear hint to an action prepared by the US against Iraq.

The opposition parties and the ruling General People's Congress Party have agreed on resolving some points of disagreement that are related to the project for amending the election law, which has been a topic of debate between the two sides since June this year.
The agreement also contains an article that stresses the principle of partisan participation and representation in the supreme committee for elections, so that all parties may submit names of candidates for membership of the committee in consultation with the President.
However, one point remains outstanding because the political committee was unable to solve it, namely the electoral domicile of military personnel. The committee decided to refer this point to the legal committee for resolution with the help of a six-man political committee that the two sides agreed to create.

People's Assembly (PA) independent members, led by the G-17 that represents the officially banned Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) Group, have decided to launch a legislative revolution during the new parliamentary session, called "the revolution of purging Egyptian laws of Communist ideas and autocracy."
According to the statute, partisan PA members have the right to speak before the independents, they pointed out. The parliamentary statute includes restrictions on their freedom of expression, as they are not allowed to table motions or quests for notification before the government presents its program to the PA, they said, pointing out that this is a violation of the constitutional provisions.
Political milieus inside the Egyptian government said the coming period would witness a honeymoon between the independent members and the G-17 so that their requests might be realized. However, the G-17 are trying to persuade the independent PA members to join them in a bid to declare the establishment of an Islamic party.

Leaders of Palestinian opposition groups in Damascus kept silent about the information that the United States has delivered to a number of concerned countries, including Syria, a list of seven demands related to organizations that Washington described as "terrorist."
We would like to remind our readers that this attitude came in the wake of attempts by some Palestinian organizations, including Nayef Hawatma's Democratic Front, to comment on the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. Assistant US Secretary of State William Burns had handed a number of ambassadors to the United States, including Syria's ambassador, Rostom Al Zu'abi, a list of seven American demands, including: -	Arrest and trial of the terrorists in their countries, -	Stoppage of travel of terrorists from and to their countries, -	Disclosure of their countries' information on terrorists to the partners in the international community. -	Extradition or expulsion of individuals who are wanted for crimes to the countries claiming them. -	Speaking strongly against terrorism, regardless of its declared objectives.
The Syrian government has resisted great pressures for expelling the Palestinian leaders in the past.
A knowledgeable source observed that "The American list of terrorist organizations was either compiled from the perspective of Israeli interest, made with a view to including drug networks that are not related to terrorism or prepared in such a way as to include organizations that certain countries describe as terrorist." The official pointed out that "such classification would not lead to a world or Arab attitude unanimity in favour of the war against terrorism."

The US believes that it is an entity that cannot be defeated, Al-Baz said. However, after the hits to the World Trade Center and the Pentagon - the symbols of greatness, grandeur and power - the question is: "How will the US respond? Against whom the assaults will be launched?"
JORDANIAN MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD AFFIRMS THAT MODERATION IS REAL TARGET OF THE WEST
Observers agree that the Islamic current in Jordan has sustained the heaviest loss as a consequence of the incidents of "Black Tuesday." The Jordanian government's clampdown on the Islamists had already been quite active before Tuesday 11 September, and forecasts indicate that it will become even more ferocious in the days to come, under the pretext of global tension and the hunt-down of Islamists.
America has provided no proof that it will exclude moderate trends from the anticipated campaign, and this is what is causing concern to the Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Jordan, particularly Sheikh Abdul Majeed Al Zunaibat.
Valiri Saranov, Commander of the Russian Army Joint Operation Room in North Caucasus, said the link between the latest incidents in the US and the combat operations in Chechnya is the Arabs.

The chairman of Nuclear Agency points out the importance of this sand in extracting important metals used in planes, submarines, ceramics, refractories and welding bars industries. It consequently helps increase the national income and creates new jobs for the youth.
The report, which was submitted on 18 September by Heba Handousa, Chairman of the Egyptian Economic Research Forum at the Cairo-based UN Information Office Headquarters to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), said North African countries maintained the same level they had reached last year in the field of attracting direct foreign investments. While direct foreign investments flowing into Algeria and Morocco went down, the volume of investments flowing into Sudan, which basically concentrated in oil excavation went up to $370 million.
Foreign investments also went down, even slightly, in some other 20 countries. The region countries, which receive direct foreign investments topped by oil producing countries such as; Nigeria, Angola and South Africa, did not make a change.
As regards the domains in which the most important 100 giant companies work worldwide, they concentrate their investments on the industries of electronics, electrical appliances, cars and means of transport, petroleum, foodstuffs and beverages.
Preparations are underway in anticipation of a visit that will be paid by a group of investment delegations to Egypt next month. From 27 October to 2 November, a visit will be paid by representatives of German companies operating in the field of importing natural stones from Egypt.

SOLANA: MUBARAK WON'T ACCEPT THE WORD "CRUSADE"
ONLY 0.1% OF EGYPT'S SUBTERRANEAN WATER GOES TO ISRAEL
He also indicated that the direction of water movement towards the Israeli territories under the current conditions of water utilization in Egypt did not exceed 10 million cubic metres per year, which represented only 5% of the subterranean water used in Sinai and 0.1% of the subterranean water used in Egypt.
Yesterday, Egyptian parliamentarians urged the government to immediately make contacts with the American authorities to get acquainted with the details and causes of the death of Egyptian Copt in Los Angeles in the US. The incident of which take place on 18 September 2001 is believed to be related to the wave of violence against Muslims and Arabs in the US.
The recent terrorist attacks in the United States have led to warnings to American citizens all over the world to exercise caution for fear that they may fall prey to terrorist attacks. The list of countries that Americans were warned about includes Egypt, which has some 40,000 Americans living in it, most of them working as experts and managers in oil, mining, electronic and automobile production companies, in addition to the huge staff of the American Embassy in Cairo and the US Consulate in Alexandria.
The US Embassy in Cairo released a communiqué saying that its monitoring of the security situation in Egypt had not revealed a certain danger against its nationals. However, the embassy urged American citizens to exercise caution, attributing its warning to the lack of adequate information on the activities and plans of groups that might target American citizens and interests all over the world.
What a strange contrast that defies explanation!
It does not even get a single mention in any of the analyses about the parties that may have been involved in the planning and execution of the incidents of "Black Tuesday" on American soil.
Even after the exhaustive three-day interrogation of the five Israelis who were arrested only four hours after the devastating attacks while they were photographing and videotaping the carnage and whooping at the site of the bombing, this incident did not leave any impression to talk of on the United States, despite the fact that one of the jubilant Israelis held a European nationality besides his Israeli citizenship, which is a prerogative that only Mossad operatives or agents enjoy.
VERY BLEAK PICTURE
America will not hesitate to implement its plans for apprehending and assassinating terrorist leaders or sponsors and overthrowing those regimes that were involved in some terrorist operations from the American point of view.
It is worth noting here that most of the target locations where the presence of terrorist hide is suspected are scattered all over the map of Arab and Muslim countries.
In an unexpected development on 19 September, Morocco's King Mohammad VI relieved Interior Minister Ahmad Al Midawi from his office, replacing him with Idris Gatto, who was director general of the Royal Bureau of Phosphate.
According to information that Asharq Al Awsat has obtained from different sources, the Ministry of Interior, which was assigned the task of drafting an election law for presentation to the government before submission to the Parliament during its forthcoming autumn session for approval, was late in finishing its task.
Gatto's previous posts include chairman of the Moroccan Federal Corporation for Leather Industries. He is member of the Bureau of the Moroccan General Economic Confederacy. He also served as deputy chairman of the Moroccan Exporters Society.
Idris Gatto was awarded the Crown Medal, Cavalier Class. He is married and has four children. His appointment marks the new Moroccan regime's ruthless ending of the domination of Idris Al Basri's school in the Ministry of Interior.
Khartoum made an implicit admission that it had received American demands for disclosure of information on elements that had lived in Sudan and were believed to be "terrorist," together with other demands that the government refused to elaborate on.

We only do not want the Palestinian to detonate himself onto innocent people.

He went on, saying, "We agree that the whole world may go to arms to fight terrorism in a legitimate manner, but we do not approve of a war against Muslims.
There are also Muslim countries that are ready to stand with America against terrorism, but only in a way that would satisfy their conscience."
The Grand Mufti of Egypt, Sheikh Nasr Farid Wassel, said that the term "crusade" could lead to a rift between Islam and Christianity, revive the wars of the past, divide the world, fuel conflict and prevent the achievement of world peace, which is the main objective for all countries at present, as all countries are members of one international family who exchange interests. "This is the objective that is sought by the United States, and it serves America's interests in the first place, because peace will bring it numerous benefits at material, political and cultural levels, while war and lack of peace will damage its interests in all fields and create an animosity that I do not think the United States is after," he said.

The executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt, Hisham Fahmi says that despite the difficulty of defining the implications of what happened in New York and Washington on investment in Egypt, it is undoubtful that such investments would be affected for a while until the whole features of the picture became evident.
Head of the Importers General Department at the Egyptian Federation Chambers Union Commerce Moustafa Zaki added that imports would inevitably be affected as the American goods claim 35% of Egyptian imports structure amounting to about $9.3 billion.
He emphasized that such a problem would aggravate the international economic recession especially in the Middle East countries including Egypt.
Tourism experts in Egypt also predicted that prospective American military operations would bring about an ebb in tourism movement in the region, which would definitely affect tourism industry in Egypt.
On the other hand, Investment and Free Zones Authority denied any negative implication on American investments in Egypt.
MMS Asharq Al-Awsat, 22/9/2001
Galal Al-Zorba says, "There is a state of embarrassment and concern regarding the movement of trade in America. Buyers of ready-made clothes do not know what would happen and there is a sort of refrainment from travel to any place. They also refrain from meeting their suppliers due to lack of situation evaluation regarding sales and purchases during that period. He expected that such recession would be temporary if Egypt suffered from no negative implications.
In case of our incurring heavy losses with the American market, we would head for other markets such as Europe as it would not be so sensitive but we are going to start from scratch!
The general director of the Commercial Office of the Korean embassy in Cairo said Korean investments in Egypt had recently risen to hit $150 million most of which was concentrated in automative industry which produces about 200,000 cars annually i.e. 33% of Egypt's auto manufacture market.
Commending the growth rate of Egyptian economy, he alluded to some obstacles still facing foreign investors especially those concerning information transparency, some sluggishness of procedures particularly those relating to customs procedures which take so much time, thereby hindering the production process.
During its meeting on 21 September under the chairmanship of its governor Ismail Hassan, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) board of directors approved the reduction of foreign monetary reserves rate by one percent i.e. from 15% to 14% so as to ensure additional liquidity, without any costs, for banks at a value of 2 billion pounds.
AL AZHAR SCHOLARS WARN AGAINST SCHEMES FOR HITTING NATIONALIST & ISLAMIC FORCES
The communiqué said, "Islam does not condone shedding the blood of innocent people, nor does it authorize terrorizing people, whatever their creeds or beliefs. Further, it incriminates aggression on civilian targets, even in the course of a defensive war, so long as such targets are not directly connected to the war."
It also praised President Hosni Mubarak's stand on the international coalition against terrorism and his reservations on Egypt's participation in that coalition, as well as his declared opposition of delivering American military strikes to the Muslim people of Afghanistan.

When Lord Allenby restored Jerusalem in the First World War, he stood at the Tomb of Saladin, saying "Oh, Saladin, we have returned."
Although he apologized for that, the word "crusade" was a sincere and genuine expression of the spirit awakened by the bloody attack on the World Trade Center (WTC) towers and the Pentagon.
This is the only interpretation for aggressions on Arabs and Muslims in US and European cities according to US Administration's fabrications.
To imagine that the United States Administration is confused and does not know what to do or whom to hit, as some people think now, is naïve. The United States is not redeploying its forces futilely from one place to another until it finds the targets that they will be used against, nor is it moving these troops around just to contain the anger of the American people.
-	Guaranteeing the closure of Afghanistan's borders by all of its neighbours.
The battle will go on for several weeks until a new loyal government is installed in Afghanistan. The United States has already approached several Afghan quarters, despite the support previously provided by Washington to the Taliban in their struggle against Ahmad Shah Masoud, who was supported by Iran and Russia.
-	Reinforcing the policy of embargo and containment imposed on certain Arab countries, such as Iraq.
It is actually ironic that the current American activities may give us a chance to see Russian soldiers on the Tajik-Afghan border helping American troops carry out their mission in Afghanistan, or American aircraft using the abandoned airfields in border areas.
Al-Ahram Al-Arabi weekly made an interview with Amin Huwaidi, Egypt's former Intelligence chief and ex-minister, on the recent attacks on the US. Following are the salient extracts: 	Q: What happened from the point of view of a former intelligence and military official?
The most serious thing for a state administration is to feel that its depth is threatened.
It further failed to defend its interests, while it demands security for others.
Why are they so hated? Why were their embassies threatened?
The US is now like a raging bison and a bleeding wolf which can do anything.
Q: Does the US decision to deal a fatal blow to Afghanistan constitute a beginning of a third world war?
If it eradicates Osama Bin Laden's followers, will it guarantee that another Bin Laden will not come up?
General Hamid Gul, former chief of Pakistani intelligence, who supervised the fighting against the Soviets in Afghanistan and witnessed the emergence of the Taliban in the tent camps in Pakistan, warned that over 100,000 Pakistani fighters would wage war on the United States if the Americans invaded Afghanistan.
General Gul sees three scenarios for the coming war, the most likely one being an American occupation of Afghanistan and the application of a project for reconstruction of the country, along the lines of the Marshall Project in Europe in the wake of World War Two.
He also affirmed that Iran would support the campaign, or at least would not oppose it, because it had been publicly hostile to the Taliban and did not want it to remain in power in Afghanistan, indicating that the closure of the borders of countries around Afghanistan and the Pakistani commitment to stopping support to the Taliban would make it possible to round up the remnants of the Taliban's troops and end the movement's role in a short time.
32-The moment the two Word Trade Centre towers collapsed in New York, Israel prepared a plan of the means by which it could take revenge on the Arab World taking advantage of the state of confusion between legitimate resistance and terrorism. While the Israeli intelligence was busy preparing its forces for that task, Zionists mass media in America and Europe were busy enhancing that erroneous concept as a prelude to the comprehensive reprisal.

MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD LEADING FIGURE PRAISES REJECTION OF MILITARY AXES
Secretary-General of the Bar Association Saif al-Islam Hassan al-Banna, a key figure in the Muslim Brotherhood Group said, "Mubarak's attitude reflected the attitude of the Egyptian people who condemn all types of terrorism but in the meantime reject military axes which the US is trying to form in order to hurt the Muslim Nation.
He said to Al-Hayat " During the Gulf War, there was a clear-cut Arab Islamic position expressing rejection of the idea that Arab country should occupy another Arab country. The liberation of Kuwait operation, therefore, was performed in accordance with the international legitimacy which President Mubarak and Egypt are keen on.
He added that public opinion could not be ignored and denounced describing the American campaign as a "crusade". He wondered if the Egyptian and Arab street was required to accept the American allegation that President Bush made a slip of the tongue.
According to Abdel-Hai Mutma'in, spokesman of Supreme Commander of Taliban Movement Mullah Mohamed Omar, the USA had practically demolished the proposal of persuading Bin Laden to leave Afghanistan.
Regarding the enormous difference between the two military powers of the USA and Taliban, Daif said, "We trust in Allah and are ready for Jihad. We have dangerous weapons, the most important of which is popular support as all the people except a few oppositionists do stand by us.
Daif emphasized that Pakistan had been trying to mediate between Taliban and the USA but he saw no chances for such a mediation because of what he deemed as USA insistence on hitting Taliban. He added that some Pakistani officials told the Movement leaders that Washington had planned for those potential attacks 3 months ago, adding that the plans included killing Osama Bin Laden and Mullah Omar.

The statement signed by 74 movement leaders and scholars and received by Al-Hayat yesterday said that they denounced the terrorist aggression on colossal American installations, which claimed the lives of innocent victims belonging to over 60 countries and many creeds. They did so because Islam had given sanctity to human life and the Quran provided that the taking of one life is tantamount to killing all humanity.
The leaders and scholars urged "all governments in the world especially the American Administration to curb its anger and refrain from taking any random or unilateral action using force just because of mere suspicion."
They said that "the malaise of escalating terrorism all over the world cannot be cured without the adoption of an integrated policy that combines justice in the retribution of the perpetrators and serious action to uproot its roots that lie in oppression and exploitation policies."

It has not been established yet whether Sheikh Jaber, Emir of Kuwait, will lose his memory wholly or partly just as what happened to his neighbour and ally King Fahd.
A Kuwaiti parliamentary source believes that in case the emirate issue is settled in favour of Sheikh Subah Al-Ahmed, Sheikh Mohammed Subah Al-Salim, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, will prominently figure out among those who are nominated to hold the post of an heir to the throne as he obtained a Ph.

WHEN IN DOUBT, GO TO WAR
Yes indeed, a fair trial for a cold-blooded, lunatic murderer who admitted his crime!
However, the US Administration started the procedures for execution immediately after the attacks, not only for Osama Bin Laden, not only for the hard-line ruling Taliban Movement, but for all the poor and hungry people of Afghanistan.
Are the actions of the Irish Republican Army, in which British restaurants, hotels, railway stations and post offices are bombed, attributed to Christianity or all the Irish, or are the accusations restricted to the guilty party?
This means that the West is in a state of war that is built on doubt or suspicion.
Certainly nobody can predict the consequences of such a collision.
Washington has imposed common defence treaties on most regional countries to codify the presence of American troops there for many years to come. It also pressured Gulf rulers into killing the Damascus Declaration in its cradle and blocking any Egyptian role in defending Gulf security as part of Arab national security. Now the United States wants to impose its military presence and hegemony on most Arab States for the sake of its crusade against terrorism, which could last for ten years, according to the estimate of President George Bush, Jr. It is really amazing that the President of the United States is pressuring Arab States into joining the multinational coalition led by the United States despite the stalemate of the Middle East peace process and the relegation of the Palestinian Cause to fourth or fifth place, after Bush's war against his enemies, security and military globalization, America's economic globalization and perhaps regional security arrangements in the Middle East.

18-Under the above heading Mahmoud Al-Maraghi, an Egyptian prominent writer, wrote an article to the following effect:
The US Administration has closely monitored the events in Egypt, fluctuating between making overtures to political Islamic groups and observing and attacking armed action groups, whose activities have given a new dimension by American reports, so that they are now classified as international terrorist groups.
The group aims at overthrowing the ruling regime and establishing an Islamic state in Egypt, but the report does not care about that; it only focuses on the fact that one of the group's leaders, Refa'ee Taha Mousa, had put his signature on a fatwa (Islamic legal opinion) issued by Osama Bin Laden in 1998 that said that it was necessary to target American citizens and all American objectives.
21-The Islamic Jihad Organization is the opposite of the Islamic Group, although it is also tied to Osama Bin Laden. Its objective is to topple the regime and establish an Islamic state. Jihad also aims at targeting American and Israeli interests inside and outside Egypt. It is active in Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sudan, Lebanon and Britain.
The same question may apply, albeit with more urgency, in the case of Algeria, which continues to be ravaged by terrorism. It also applies to Yemen, which also stands accused of harbouring Bin Laden terrorists, despite its government's cooperation with the United States on the USS Cole's incident.
This is world bedlam, or it is the role of the bully, which the United States sees itself as capable of - because of its excessive might - as well as forced to assume because the real culprits in the recent incidents cannot be found and the American public opinion has to be pacified.
49-Derkezli, born in Damascus 57 years ago said he was a well-known businessman in Europe and America and that he had the American nationality but resident in the Qatari capital for the time being, where he acts as consultant to well-known companies there, some of which are American.

Experts of Dubai delegation participating in the "Travel to the Mediterranean Sea" exhibition which launched its activities in Cairo on 26 September expected that the positive developments of economic and commercial relations between Egypt and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) be reflected in tourism and travel movement between the two sides through the increase of direct flights which hit 14 on a weekly basis at present. Seven of these flights are flown by UAE aviation and Egyptian airlines except indirect flights which are flown by other airlines, which makes Cairo the largest Arab capital in terms of the number of flights with Dubai airport.
Experts see that these numbers are expected to increase on the backdrop of the distinguished relations between the two countries and the geographical importance of each of them. The Egyptian community is the biggest one in the UAE as its number amounts to 150 thousand working in different sectors and fields.
Universities' presidents gave strict instructions to the managers of university hostels to ban any talk about the American crisis inside hostels' mosques.

70-No country has ever been as lucky as Iran, which can find those who square up to its enemies in the hardest of times.
That is why Iran was eager to see Iraq bombarded during the Kuwait Liberation War. Iran did not hesitate to support the alliance on the spot. Today Iran is also eager to see Taliban smashed and marginalised.

8-A: For the second time in a decade it becomes evident that for the Americans and the West in general, Israel is not an asset for any constructive action but a debit and impediment and is, therefore, asked to keep away, in order to avoid any detriments of any constructive efforts!
For America, Israel seems rather like a relative who is a loafer or a beggar whose relatives (America, for instance) keep him hidden from any guests to avoid embarrassment!

42-A: It is highly likely that the great powers, particularly the United States, realize now, as they did in 1991, that the Middle East is an extremely sensitive area and that leaving the conflicts among its countries is a serious matter whose consequences will not be restricted to the Middle East countries alone. It appears that the US Administration's view of the Arab-Israeli conflict is starting to undergo some change and is currently going through reshaping and reconsideration. Washington has found that the persistence of this conflict, regardless of the pretexts used by Israel, is against the stability of the whole world and impacts on other issues and causes. Therefore, the United States will have to play an active part and not just watch the situation from far away; It will no longer deem it sufficient to call on the parties to adopt more positive positions.
It is most likely that the United States is aware that it is not in its interest to go into a crisis or confrontation with an Arab country, particularly one that is known for moderation, positive political line and leaning towards the European Union and the United States. Washington will be wrong if it throws the blame for the attacks on any Arab country, because no Arab country supports terrorism, and everybody has taken a clear stand of denunciation against terrorist actions.

23-All the talk about terrorism is currently focused on individuals and groups, but nobody is paying any attention to governments and ruling regimes although some of them have graduated from the school of terrorism with honours and should be at the top of the list of wanted terrorists, if what is sought at present is actually the establishment of justice and the uprooting of terrorism.
The first one is that that can carry out this mission, as the latter group alone deserves the wrath of the war against terrorism, for they are, in fact, the real source of terrorism, thanks to their oppressive policies, and the practices they use should be countered and combated; the disappearance of some of the institutions and services of this category of regimes will be a real contribution to the efforts for causing the sources of terrorism to dry up.
If some regimes are of the opinion that the activities of the advocates of democracy threaten security, sour social peace etc under normal condition, it is anybody's guess what fate awaits them under exceptional conditions like those which prevail in the world at present.

The matter is primarily related to America's national security strategy and the application of military security globalization concepts in the areas of vital interest to the United States. In September 1996, the United States declared a number of national security interests as being among its priorities in the interests of American national security up to 2015. For starters, the first national interest is that the United States remain the only superpower in the world, free to make its own decision and keeping up its technology, economic and cultural superiority and maintaining its international prestige.
33-The fifth interest is the conclusion of peaceful settlements in the Middle East that would coincide with redrawing the political map of this region, which is rife with regional and international conflicts, according to the American view. The sixth national interest is to secure the flow of oil from the Arabian Gulf and the Caspian Sea into the West with the rates and prices that suit the West itself and protect international shipping routes to insure unimpeded freedom of international commerce and ascertain that American and European exports to Arab States and Southeast Asia, particularly weapons, will remain unrestricted.
34-A careful examination of this strategic and political aspects makes it possible to understand how the United States has availed the wonderful opportunity that it presented itself for building an effective American coalition in the Indian Subcontinent and the Islamic Central Asia, reinforcing its presence in the Arabian Gulf and planning for actually projecting its power into Southeast Asia.

Regardless of feelings of frustration that seized the Iranian delegation due to the faltering of attempts to fix a definite time for the restoration of relations or at least diplomatic normalization initiation at this stage through the opening of the two embassies as a preliminary step, some sparks of hope emerged during the Egyptian- Iranian talks - the fact that the two countries' positions towards dealing with the recent events in the USA have proved quite identical, especially in the aftermath of the Washington and New York explosions and the Egyptian-Iranian reservation about any military adventure in Afghanistan as well as declining to join the international coalition called for by the USA in cooperation with European Union countries.

PROJECTS WORTH $10 BILLION PUT OFF

The fact that Hizbullah could abort all enemy attempts to trigger sedition to cover up for its soldiers turning tail in Lebanon, thus turning into a symbol for those aspiring after freedom and independence especially for the sons of the Palestinian people who followed in its footsteps in combatting Zionist terrorism and criminality, has made the enemy and the American administration seize every possible chance to put the blame on the party sometimes in the name of terrorism and sometimes under the pretext of posing threat to American and Zionist interests.

The Taliban regime's tenure certainly came to a close ahead of the attack as the movement, unlike its counterparts, does not have any agencies and establishments. Its fighters surely resorted to hills not to preserve their regime but to confront the US forces just as they did with similar forces over the last 200 years.

Mohammad Abdallah, Managing Director of Suez Canal Insurance Company, said that the Egyptian insurance market had already begun to show the effects of the tensioned atmosphere inside and outside the United States. "Foreign insurance companies have imposed hard conditions for reinsurance operations and premiums," he said.

The new measures include reconsideration of overseas investments in light of the state of havoc that reigns in several world markets, adoption of strict conditions for financing long- term investments that could be affected negatively by the current developments, particularly in the fields of tourism, aviation and insurance, and keeping files open for certain bank customers in strong connections with foreign markets.

However, several Arab intelligence services immediately saw through the mission, saying that the United States would depend on conventional tactics in the beginning, carrying out large-scale assassinations of the leaders of Arab resistance groups, fronts and organizations, which would be followed by a sweeping American attack on the bases of those organizations. Those operations would be staged out of military facilities in Turkey, particularly Incirlik Air Base in the south and Marmara Naval Base on the Marmara Sea, particularly as any move staged out of the Gulf would be rejected and would bring much trouble to the American forces and the Arab Gulf States that might allow those forces to carry out their missions which the Arabs rejected, if not tabooed.
32-In all likelihood, and according to Arab political and security circles, there will be no clash in the current stage between the United States and some Arab States that contain legitimate Arab resistance factions and organizations that are claimed by American intelligence agencies as anti-American and are therefore given shelter and protection by countries like Syria and Lebanon. However, the clash will come at a later stage, but not before the end of this year at least. Why?

76-Member of Nasserite Party General Secretariat, Mahir Makhlouf says that everybody is suffering from a state of utter frustration because of both internal and external circumstances, so much so that death would not be the worst option. I, nevertheless, cannot predict how the Nasserite Party would deal with the situation in the Egyptian Street if America hit an Arab country. However, the committee on coordination between parties must urgently meet and reach a unified stance towards the problem. Why would the Egyptian parties take such a step crucial as it is? Perhaps because of the restrictions that have long been imposed by the government on partisan action!
For his part, Yassin Serageddin does not expect Al-Wafd Party or any other party to go beyond denunciation or condemnation, thus following in the government's footsteps. This is largely due to parties being preoccupied with their internal disputes. We, therefore, do not expect any party to call for staging a popular demonstration for instance, while demonstrations would be staged inside university campuses quite independently of any partisan or political activity.

He called for the diversification of tourism products in Egypt and the boosting of inter-Arab tourism to make up for the decline in the size of tourist inflows from European countries as well as the USA as a result of the current crisis.
The report, which was prepared by Commercial Minister Plenipotentiary Ryadh Al Badawi, Chief of the Egyptian Commercial Representation Office in Washington, indicated that the American International Trade Commission's decision came after rejection of the complaint against Egypt by five members against only one member who had supported the complaint, which meant something close to unanimity in Egypt's favour. The report added that the rejection of the complaint against Egypt in particular, out of some 26 countries, would boost Egypt's steel exports to the American market in the future, particularly if dumping charges were imposed on the export of the other countries that had been included in the complaint, which would give Egyptian steel exports a relative edge over those of other countries.

46-Afourki's statements coincided with reports that the United States and Britain had deployed forces to strategic locations in Eritrea in anticipation of attacks by fundamentalist groups that were stationed in Horn of Africa countries.
Ethiopia has had to venture into Somali territories and occupy parts of them to control this fundamentalist presence along its borders.
49-Restiveness is increasing in the circles of Sudanese Islamists, who fear that their country is heading for a vortex of developments and changing alliances that the country may pay for in the political environment, stability and democratic process they aspire to.
Apparently, the American team is still unable to obtain the required real information.
It is interesting that the most zealous advocates of cooperation with the United States are spearheaded by officials who were singled out for accusation of involvement in the abortive attempt on Egyptian President Mubarak in Addis Ababa in 1995, including Dr Naf'e Ali Naf'e, Minister of Federal Government and former head of the Sudanese security service.
51-So, the security cooperation between Washington and Khartoum is now an undeniable fact, and it raises a very interesting question: what is the price of this cooperation deal, and what gains can the ruling Islamic Movement make out of the cooperation?
Many think that the "hawks" of the NIF are making superhuman efforts for extracting a promise from the United States and European countries that they would support the regime's continuity, so long as it has accepted the reforms that the new alliance with Washington will entail.
14-The Dumping and Subsidy Control Service is preparing for issuing the final decision on the review of surcharges on the tyres imported from the Japanese Sumitomo and Toyo Companies, now that the investigations of the two companies' dumped products on the Egyptian market are complete.

EGYPT'S UREA FERTILIZER EXPORTS RECORD 179 MILLION US DOLLARS
Under this headline Farouq Al-Ashri, writer and journalist wrote this article which ran to the following effect: Imagine the financial deficit in Egypt's budget reaching LE200 billion!
Former prime minister Atef Ebeid's government had announced that the estimated deficit would be in the range of LE52.3 billion. This means that the current government that took over the responsibility about a fortnight following the start of this fiscal year had caused a fourfold rise in the deficit compared with expectations when the budget was being prepared only during 9 months of the abovementioned year of which another 3 months are left. How much more will that deficit claim by the end of this year?
Unfortunately, according to the official data published on the volume of total investments by the government, economic authorities and the public sector combined did not exceed LE40.3 billion in all economic activities. Where would all such funds have been spent?
According to the results of the latest comprehensive survey conducted by CAPMS on the income and expenditure and consumption rates of the Egyptian family in 1999/2000, the poor spend more on food and drinks compared with other categories. For example, while the 20% lowest income category spend 57.7% of their income on food and drinks in urban areas, only 28% was spent by the 20% highest income category in urban areas. In rural areas, too, higher percentage was spent on food and drinks compared with urban families (67.6% and 48.6%) respectively.

The Mossad had asked for the file after the twin suicide bombing operation in Beer Sheva last month and after accusing Hamas leadership especially its political bureau chairman of giving instructions prior to Israeli officials' threats to assassinate him in the Syrian capital.
The security "file" said that Mashaal was the primary official both in the interior and abroad according to the movement's constitution. Moussa Abou Marzouk is his deputy for political affairs. Imad Al-Alami is responsible for communications with Hamas officials in the interior.
BOOBY TRAPS IN DAMASCUS!
Those who know the nature of those leaders movement, should expect the extension of the physical liquidation series to the Lebanese territories where outstanding leaders in Hamas used to participate in festivals especially those organized by Hizbullah.
The Israeli attempt to give the lie to Hamas departure from Syria has yet a graver implication, - exposing Syrian security as penetrated in the depth while Syria's eyes were on its borders with Iraq where it showed cooperation with American military experts to prevent infiltration after it had received a strongly toned message from the Assistant Secretary of State for the Middle East Affairs, William Burns.
The most serious thing about that partnership is that its declared goals are not speculations or bids for deals neither with Syria nor anybody else. The stage of coexistence with reality has come to an end and what is demanded of any country transcends the termination of any regional role for any country in the region so that previous blackmails would continue till any country would, at best, hope for keeping its borders safe or sometimes wish for a guarantee to keep the political structure of that country unimpaired.
PALESTINIAN FACTIONS...IIDEOLOGICAL DIVERGENT VIEWS DWINDLE, RELIGIOUS DISCOURSE OVERWHELMS
Not only did ideological disagreements among resistance factions dwindle away but differences in the means and forms of resistance eroded away as well.
Competition between diverse factions on winning the Palestinian public opinion pushed them to imitate each other in the forms of resistance operations and the development of their action patterns.
Resistance movements had manufactured mortars at the beginning, but Hamas moved from using mortars to 2-8-km missiles called "Qassam", which have become the only means to attack Jewish settlements from Gaza Strip.

Mahmoud Abbas Abu Mazen took over as prime minister in the Palestinian National Authority as a first step towards reform, but he was forced to leave his position some months later out of frustration and under Palestinian pressure, as he sees it, and the refrainment of the Israeli and American sides from offering him any help.
How far do you agree with this opinion?
Q-How can this situation be overcome?
A-To the contrary, we had intentions and determination, so we made many achievements. Many security agencies were unified and we started basic financial, administrative, and legal steps. We went to America and other countries.
Q-Who obstructed the performance of the government?
A-There are non-governmental bodies, there are the executive committee and the central committee, and there are circles and figures that contributed to this obstruction of the government performance.
The majority of the Israeli people seek and want peace, but the opinion has no power. It is the opinion of the government that has power. I know that Sharon does not want peace.
Occupation has nothing to do with reform. Some say that reform should be postponed until occupation is removed, but this is nonsense.
A-Objections are real. The evidence is that the Israeli extremists who killed Isaac Rabin did not kill him for personal reasons, but due to political reasons. Now, they are objecting to the steps relating to the withdrawal from Gaza. That is why their threats could be serious to the extent that they could assault any of the Israeli officials.
Q-Can we imagine one day after ten years of adopting the peace option that Abu Mazen would adopt the resistance option?
At the beginning of the military uprising, some said that this uprising would lead to the liberation of the homeland. The result is that the homeland was re-occupied. They said the uprising would stop settlement, but the result is that settlement doubled.

He told a news briefing in Baghdad that his ministry invited plastic artists to join the contest to design a new flag that may reflect Iraq's unity with its different nationalities, communities and cultures and demonstrate the civilizational heritage of the Mesopotamian country.
He has been a member of a medical mission that toured the area.
I wonder how they could go back to their ordinary villages voluntarily after they have seen this "luxurious" way of life", he added.
The Sudanese central government has done a lot to contain the crisis in Darfur through boosting security and intensifying police presence in the province, the doctor said.
Who is responsible for the loss of my daughter ... the Americans or the Iraqi police?
Another family lost her 17-year-old daughter and the neighbourhood's young men felt ashamed because they could not help prevent that kidnap in their neighbourhood. Father of Dalal, the kidnapped daughter, says, "A girl in such an age is kidnapped!
However, the police are helpless, as they cannot pursue gang rings. They hardly could retaliate attacks on their stations.
KIRKUK: INSISTENCE ON REMOVING ARAB CHARACTERISTICS FROM THE CITY The Kurds are unanimous that Kirkuk is an "inalienable part" of Iraqi Kurdistan that should be reunified. Some people believe that the city is not purely "Kurdish".
Although the Kurds are unanimous on the attitude towards Kirkuk, the reader of the situation of the oil-rich city does not have a full picture of the crisis without knowing other Arab and Turkmen forces living there.
Then, he added, a census should be carried out under a neutral body and a self-determination referendum should be held later to decide whether the city will join Kurdistan confederacy or stay under the central government.
The problem is with the Arabs, whom Saddam had brought to the city to deface its Kurdish characteristics, especially from the Shiite south. We ask that Kurds come back to their villages, where they were expelled.
Keeping Arabs in Kirkuk means keeping the Arab identity of the city forced by Saddam Hussein's regime.
Nevertheless, general elections cannot be held without putting things right in the city, normalizing positions, return of Kurds, departure of Arabs, carrying out a census under a neutral body and holding a self-determination plebiscite.
In an interview with him in New Youk by Al-Hayat, he highlighted that any Israeli activity in Iraq would be a "big mistake" and that Ankara is monitoring the situation in Israel in spite of Israel's denial of having any activity in Iraq.
Q: It was reported recently the possibility of an Israeli preemptive military strike against the Iranian nuclear facilities, and US Secretary of State Colin Powell said that all options are on the cards, how do you, as a neighbor to Iran, look at these threats?
Q: There was Turkish resentment at Israeli presence in Iraq, especially in the Kurdish area, and Turkey held talks with the Israelis in this respect.
It would be a great mistake if the Israelis were proved to be involved in Iraq.
There are media reports.
Holding elections on schedule?
A: Turkey will be affected to a great extent.
Of course, if Iraq was partitioned, the coalition forces would be blamed for that. They would be asked: why did you come here?
General Commander of Iranian Revolutionary Guard, Major General Rahim Safawi said that President George Bush's strategy in Iraq had failed.
This came at a time when Iran seemed ready to go to all lengths by severing relations with the International Agency for Atomic Energy if its file was referred to the Security Council to impose potential sanctions.
He advised the Americans and the Europeans to realize Iran's regional capacity recognize its rights and not ignore its weight in the region.
He went on to say that the strategy adopted by the American President in Iraq failed and achieved no results. he added that the Americans incurred losses at the economic level and failed at the political, military and international law levels.
However, some participants tend to prolong intervals between meetings, an indicator that such a gathering will not last for long with its current formation, especially as a number of opposition parties - three in number - declined to join such a committee and made contacts with a fourth party to form another "committee".

"The co-founders will resort to the court for the third time and will not give up their right to practise public action within a legal framework," Sultan told Al-Hayat. "The government knows well that there is no relation between our party and the Ikhwan group and that the co-founders severed their relation with the Ikhwan in 1996," Sultan added, accusing the NDP of seeking to control political action and power in Egypt, an act that will abort any reform.
Its founders' agent Hamdin Sabbahi submitted a request to the PAC to have the party licensed last May.
Deputies, Seif Mahmoud, Refaat Beshir and Ahmed Abou-Hiji emphasized that they would put up a bill in that concern in the next parliamentary session which would begin next month. They said that the project would include the costs of using two cars per minister in terms of maintenance or fuel so that they might not be exceeded throughout the fiscal year. This would be done through coupons to be monthly issued. The minister would bear any excess sums by paying them out of his own salary thus sparing the government any extra expenses.
Regarding advertising campaigns, the state spent LE204 million and 190 thousand during the same period.

EGYPTIAN KUWAITI BANK AT THE SUDAN
As for the activity of the new bank to be founded by Egyptian and Kuwaiti businessmen, Al-Qosi said that the investors asked for establishing a business and investment bank with a view to financing new investment projects in the Sudan.
Asked about the advantages given by the Sudan to Arab and foreign investors, especially those who want to get access to the banking sector therein, Al-Qosi said the Sudan has an investment law which is considered the best among world countries seeking to court foreign investments in addition to the growth rate which hit 6% annually, among the highest rates at the international level, and the stability of the exchange rate of the Sudanese currency for more than 6 years as well as the stability of the inflation rate.

In a joint memo referred to the government, members of the Egyptian Businessmen Association and Egyptian Federation of Chambers of Commerce emphasized that that drop, which amounted to 7 percent of the real value of the rate of exchange, would lead to big losses for all exporters who concluded export contracts according to the previous rates of exchange.
Member of the Exportation Committee Ashraf Al-Attal warned that most importing countries rejected the new prices, thus decreasing demand for Egyptian exports in many African and some European countries. This will definitely lead to heavy losses and closure of many exporting companies, he pointed out.

INDIA IS THE BIGGEST IMPORTER OF EGYPTIAN COTTON THIS SEASON
EGYPT, INDIA TO LAUNCH BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION COOPERATION
The Indian institute organizes several training courses and programs to raise the skills of CEOs prepared to occupy key posts.
A: This campaign is originally meant to meet the needs of the American national security, which were drawn up in 1996 and pinpointed what security interests and strategic goals America would have till 2015. According to that plan, America hopes it will fill the gap between its effective presence in South East Asia and its economic and military hegemony in most Middle Eastern countries especially Arab Gulf States. America, therefore, wants to achieve an effective military presence based on sea, air and ground bases in the Indian peninsula's countries and South East Asia. It also wants to abort any alliance and military cooperation relations that link China or Russia with South Asian countries through including both China and Russia in the current American strategy and retaining the uni-superpower order in the second decade of the twenty first century.
4-Q: Afghanistan is known to be tough in terms of population and terrain. It had already vanquished British as well as Soviet occupation. Does America realize how dangerous the war in Afghanistan is in light of its ability to wage guerrilla war?
America had imagined that Taliban's ranks would suffer a schism, but this, so far, has not happened. It thought that it would set up a government of some Pushtu who showed willingness, but those turned to be almost American intelligence agents who look for a political or material price for their services, but are of little tribal weight.
This means that the Arabs do finance the American economic military aid programme, a small part of which reaches Egypt and Jordan. America economically controls the Gulf oil and owns a strategic stock in Arab Gulf States. It, furthermore, controls the Arab oil rate of production and marketing strategy.
8-Yesterday high level French official said that the war in Afghanistan had entered an extremely difficult stage for the international coalition.
On the one hand, Iran is not keen on King Zahir Shah returning, while Pakistan has its eye on the lion's share in the Pushtu's conference Loya Gurga of the Pushtus.
9-M.S. Asharq Al-Awsat, 28/10/2001
The poll respondents ruled out the possibility that Usama Bin Laden had organized or financed the attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York or the Pentagon in Washington on 11 September.
Most of the respondents believe that their country should not support the United States in its war in any way.
14-	Sudanese Foreign Minister Mostafa Othman Ismail said the Sudanese government had made a dialogue with former US president Bill Clinton's administration in the summer of 1996 on turning over Osama Bin Laden to US authorities.
Since the Sudan was on intimate terms with this European country and it earlier showed cooperation with France when it gave international terrorist Carlos up to French authorities, Bin Laden decided to leave the Sudan. Bin Laden had three options, the best was Somalia, but his aides felt that he would face several risks if he left for Somalia so he decided to head for Afghanistan.
18-Ayatollah Ali Khameini's stand at the onset of the American aggression on Afghanistan was clear in its denunciation of the aggression and uncovering its real purposes.
Iran's refusal to allow the use of its airspace for strikes against Afghanistan is a good stand, but it is far less than the Islamic Republic can do, particularly as that fighting is taking place along its own border.
Iran has been surrounded by American and Israeli enemies from three sides: (1) Turkey; (2) Central Asia and; (3) the Gulf, where the American forces are deployed.
But if it wants to be just another strong, influential country in the region, it can just seek an understanding with the Americans, and with others, for that matter.
19-Iranian officials must realize, and I believe that they actually do, that Iran is a target in all cases.
It will also be a strategic victory for Muslims for the whole world to see, and will deter America from thinking of expanding its military operations.
21-PRESIDENT MUBARAK: ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY OVER JERUSALEM MEANS A HUNDRED YEARS WAR!

39-CONTACTS BETWEEN CAIRO AND BAGHDAD OVER MEETING OF ATTA WITH IRAQI DIPLOMAT IN PRAGUE
41-HAH Asharq Al-Awsat, 28/10/2001
45-REPORTS ABOUT REFERRAL OF NEW CASE OF EGYPTIAN JIHAD ORGANIZATION TO MILITARY JUDICIARY
Asharq Al-Awsat sources expected that case would include a major surprise if one of the founders of Jihad Group, Mohamed Abdel-Rehim Asharqawi was included. Al-Sharqawi was a member in the first underground Jihad Organization along with Ayman Al-Zawahri in the late 1960's. He has also been in the custody of Egyptian security bodies since 1995 when they received him from the Pakistani authorities.
The investigation memo confirmed that the Bortos Organization was in contact with Jihad's leader, Ayman Al-Zawahri and accused the defendants of joining a banned organization founded on the violation of the law and the Constitution with a view to obstructing the law and the State institutions and possessing unlicensed arms and disrupting social peace and security, besides possessing publications promoting the organization's ideology and urging a toppling of the ruling regime by force.
Sources in Saint Mark Cathedral in Cairo said on 28 October that Sheikh Al Qassimi had met recently with Anba Abraham, Archbishop of Jerusalem and the Near East, and had assured him of his appreciation of Egypt and its leadership and the high esteem at which he held Pope Shinouda III.
52-Reports prepared by the commercial chamber of commerce in Cairo unveiled that the volume of consumption expenditure in the holy month of Ramadan (the Muslim fasting month) and Eid Al-Fitr (Lesser Bairam) last year hit 11.504 billion pounds as the expenditure on cakes, biscuits, and cookies reached 430 million pounds.
55-The appointment of a vice-president for Egypt remains of uppermost importance, whatever the politicians and the intellectuals say to the contrary. There should be a vice-president that the people can trust and feel assured as a result of his presence. President Hosni Mubarak himself is not annoyed by talk about the issue of the vice-president, and those close to him have started hinting that a vice-president will be appointed soon. Dr Usama Al Baz, President Mubarak's Political Adviser, was more explicit when he said in his interview with Al Musawwar that a vice-president was being selected from a list of 20 people.
Dr Abdel Azim Anis, the renowned Leftist intellectual, laughingly said, "I believe that the people whose names are on the list of twenty names are those who are on good terms with the senior officials in Egypt. However, I have a different opinion: I prefer that the people choose their president and vice-president directly, as is the practice in most democracies, and I think the President is thinking of that.
Dr Abdel Meguid Farrag, untenured professor in the Faculty of Economics and Political Sciences, said, "Although I have certain criteria for anyone who fills the position of vice-president in my mind, such as being not over 50 years old, so that he may gain the sort of experience that President Hosni Mubarak gained while he was in this position, I cannot think of anybody within this age group who can fill the post. However, I nominate Dr Kamal Abul Magd, former minister of information, because he is flexible and can deal with all trends. In addition, he is a moderate Islamist who has the ability to polarize and contain all trends. There is also Khalid Mohieddin, Chairman of the Grouping Progressive Party, but he is an old man, and Dr Ebrahim Badran, former president of Cairo University and former member of the National Democratic Party's Politburo.
The only thing that is certain about this situation is that the Constitution does not force the President to appoint a vice-president and that the President has free choice in that regard. As for the characteristics of the vice-president, I believe that they are those stipulated by the Constitution, such as having Egyptian citizenship and Egyptian parents. But the vice-president should not be expected to necessarily have political experience, because political experience is not required by the Constitution. Anyway, I doubt very much that anybody knows what is going on in the President's mind, but the only thing that is certain is that President Hosni Mubarak will choose a patriotic and honest vice-president who can be trusted with the interests of the Egyptian people and is liked by the different classes of the people.
57-MFA, Sawt Al Ummah, 31/10/2001
"There is a big difference between the sentiment that the Arab and Muslim Nation feels towards Jerusalem and the financial support that finds its way to the city," he said, explaining that the money pumped into colonialization projects in Jerusalem by a single Jew, like the American billionaire Meslobich, was more than the funds earmarked by the Islamic Development Bank for the city. "This is a saddening comparison. Jews, including individuals and organizations, are donating billions of dollars for Judaization of Jerusalem, but we are giving only sentiment and little money to Jerusalem," he pointed out.
62-British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov in Moscow. The British minister announced that his country wanted to eliminate a danger whose source lay in Iraq, pointing out that he did not suspect the existence of a connection between the Chenchen fighters and Usama Bin Laden.

70-DOVES ARE BACK IN JORDANIAN ISLAMIC MOVEMENT'S DRIVER'S SEAT
It is worth noting that the incumbent secretary general of the Islamic Action Front Party, Dr Abdel Latif Arabiyat, who is famous for his moderation, cannot run for another term, as the party's bylaws prevent a secretary general from serving for more than two consecutive terms, so both the hard-liners and the moderates are now expected to fall over each other in their efforts for winning the favour of the centrist trend, which tends to side with the moderates.
72-MFA, Al Wasat, 29/10/2001
In terms of number, the number of Islamic banks and organizations has grown to over 200 establishments operating in most world countries. In terms of money, these establishments manage more than $ 150 billion.
78-A new aviation company that will be launched in the first of December is expected to change the rules of commercial aviation all over the African continent.
The new carrier is expected to make several purchases of aircraft, including a deal that may be close to $ 500 million in early 2002, and the expansion of its fleet will continue over the following years through more purchases as the company seeks wider carrying rights within and without Africa.
He also revealed that there were serious talks that had reached an advanced stage with investors from four African countries, including South Africa, adding that there was a probable Egyptian partner, as well as smaller investors with whom the company was negotiating.
In the second phase, we will buy between six and eight new planes," Sabri said, indicating that the deal would be in the region of $ 500 million and was expected to be concluded within the next few months.
1-ECONOMIC CABINET TO OPERATE UNDER NEW CALCULATIONS AFTER CHANGE OF HALF OF ITS MEMBERS
Another aspect of the calculations that goes beyond the limits of representation within the economic cabinet is that the abolition of the Ministry of Economy has resulted in dividing parts of its turf among the Central Bank, the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones and the Prime Minister, giving more relative weight to the Central Bank Governor.
This situation calls for reconsideration of the balance of powers within the economic cabinet where making life-or- death decisions is concerned.
The main feature of the first bill is that it will affirm the autonomy of the Central Bank and give the bank full authority over all the units of the Egyptian banking system, together with powers for drawing the monetary policy and controlling sources of cash in Egypt.
He pointed out that the Egyptian Exports Development Bank subordination to the Ministry of Foreign Trade was one of specialization by virtue of its field of activity and as a result of the Minister of Foreign Trade's chairmanship of its general assembly, as per the bank's bylaws.
Issued capital of these projects hit $6 billion while investment amounted to about $17 billion.
The volume of produced commodities exports in different free zones to foreign markets hit $540 million, he said. Investment projects under free zones system is considered an important mechanism of increasing exports which contributes to the provision of new job opportunities in order to contain the unemployment problem.
The investors will not feel that they are dealing with separate and different bodies, Al-Ghamrawi added.
According to the report, this increase includes a LE 3.4 billion increase in the funds circulated outside the Central Bank vaults and a LE 2.1 billion increase in banks' local currency deposits in the Central Bank.
12-MFA, Al Ahrar, 26/11/2001
Meanwhile, government banking system leaders held urgent meetings until mid- November 26 night on how to square up to the current crisis and find a congenial approach as the decisions have unfavorably affected the exchange rates, foreign contracts and Egyptian product costs.
The CBE will also be responsible for working out monetary policies, monitoring their implementation, running cash fluidity, directing credit, managing foreign exchange and foreign debts, including private sector's debts, and overseeing the payment balance, as per the legislation.
16-INTER-BANK AGREEMENT ABOLISHED AFTER WRONG INTERPRETATION THAT IT WILL CURB IMPORTS
"The participants also agreed on a procedure for insuring compliance with the UN Security Council resolutions that ban the transfer of funds generated by illegal activities and laid down a process for implementing these decisions by importers and banks and their branches," he explained.
Meanwhile, the Chairman of the Federation of Industries, Abdel Mon'im So'oudi, affirmed that there was completed agreement between business organizations and the Government and the Central Bank on the decisions adopted by the Government.
Primary indicators, however, show a retreat in exports to Europe and a rise in costs on the heels of a rise in the cost of transport and freight and a retreat in Egyptian expatriates remittances as well as a decline in tourism revenues. On the other hand, Aboul-Oyoun said in press statements that Egyptians' deposits with the banking system were steadily on the increase and were quite safe. He added that all banks (63 banks) and 2900 branches in all governorates in addition to development and agricultural credit banks have the sufficient guarantees to protect such deposits through the application of the international criteria for control over the deposits and loans. He added that the total deposits according to the latest statistics hit about LE301 billion.
23-Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) governor, Mahmoud Aboul-Oyoun said the bank would not stop providing the market with requirements of foreign currencies. The dollar rate of exchange will stabilize during the coming period.
New facilities to import spare parts are now pondered on, he said, adding that financing imports through the documents for collection would continue as long as it was proven beyond doubt that the imported commodities were shipped before 1st December next.

Banks have no databases of foreign markets and rival commodities and products, it said.
35-Although government bodies are now bent on compiling an anti-money laundering bill, government economic bodies are still embroiled in disputes over the real figure of the volume of the money laundered in Egypt. While the international committee on anti-money laundering (FATF) put the money laundered through foreign exchange firms and banks in Egypt at $15 billion, Egypt was included on the list of countries not cooperating in the field of combating money laundering operations. On the other hand, Dr Youssef Boutros Ghali, Minister of Foreign Trade denied these reports, pointing out that the committee did not rely on official information or data issued from any official body, but rather on haphazard, inaccurate data published in a book.
Control bodies are monitoring suspicious cases.
Head of Importers Department at Chambers of Commerce Federation, Moustafa Zaki said that the dollar had risen since the CBE decisions because of an increase in the number of import operations under the collection documents system and the importers' resorting to the completion of such operations by the beginning of December, which is the deadline fixed by the CBE for stopping that system.
Secretary General of Importers Department, Mohamed Abdul-Maguid Rostum said there should be a transitional period for the implementation of such measures to avoid falling victim to speculators in the dollar.
Fifth, approvals should be granted to import operations through collection documents for operations not exceeding $10 thousands as they are often samples or consignments in Cairo Airport.
The committee will also discuss the possibility of offering the Government's shares in some of the joint companies for sale, particularly its share in those companies where the majority of shares has already been sold but the Public Enterprise Sector Ministry continues to own some shares.
Al Alam Al Youm learned that the Public Enterprise Sector Ministry has not received any bids from investors for most of these companies, despite the fact that some 40 Egyptian and foreign investors had bought the brochures containing the conditions of sale that had been prepared by holding companies for selling the loss-making companies.
He said at a news briefing on Monday that the delay in offering the stocks is due to the careful study of marketing and assessing of the value of each companies' shares according to its activity, financial position, budget indices and profits. A book evaluation was made for all the seven electricity distributors nationwide until June 30, and what remains is the market assessment, the minister added.
45-MT / Al-Ahram, 27/11/2001

"This will be included in the specifications brochures of the Ministry's bids in the future," Younis added.
58-25% ANNUAL INCREASE IN YARN, TEXTILE, AGRICULTURAL AND MEDICINE EXPORTS
SOBBAH AL-AHMED PLEDGES TO PREVENT THE PASSING OF A BILL FOR SHARI'A IMPLEMENTATION In the last couple of days, two developments took place to indicate that the relation between the Kuwaiti government and the Islamists tended to be lukewarm especially due to the continuation of the implications of the international campaign against the Islamic groups.
In a press statement, he added "The bill is being adopted by many deputies in light of the keenness of the Kuwaiti people majority to Islamatize the laws in the country."
On that occasion some deputies said they would demand a parliamentary discussion of the way security forces had dealt with Magid Al-Metairi, who had been exposed to beating and torture to force him to admit to crime he had not committed.
BUSH REJECTS BARTER DEALS
Saying that its war in Afghanistan comes on top of its priorities before anything else makes its policy towards the Middle East a fluctuating one without any feeling of committing any mistakes.
If some people consider this a disdain of Arab feelings, the American Administration considers this a result of lack of Arab weight internationally.
However, the meeting was not held because Dr. Sorour was preoccupied following three sessions held by the PA.
AMERICA DRAGS MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD INTO WAR AGAINST TERROR
He added, "The Americans are obviously flailing in confusion and have no information about anything at all. They are like somebody who is scared by his own shadow and does not know his hand from his foot. The claim that Taqwa Bank is involved in funding Al Qaida Organization or terrorist groups is evidence that the Americans are totally lost. If they had any evidence against Usama Bin Laden or any others, they would present it to the public, not to governments as they did.
Taqwa Bank sustained heavy losses some three years ago, as a result of the economic crisis in Southeast Asian countries. Its customers in Western countries were also harassed on account of the Islamic façade it presented. As a consequence, Taqwa Bank was liquidated.

That tape has been the third that was transmitted by Al-Jazeerah for Bin Laden since the attacks of September 11th on Washington and New York. He wondered if there were any other source of our catastrophes besides the UN.

It said that "such Palestinian elements belong to Palestinian Preventive Security system adding that they had already been sent to Afghanistan.
The plan participated in by the American preventive Security System includes the dispatching of 150 members to Afghanistan via Jordan, and then Pakistan as Palestinian volunteers to take part in Jihad against the American aggression and then gradually penetrate into Al-Qaeda Organization ranks to reach the place of Osama Bin Laden and then inform the American forces about it or liquidate him.

"Furthermore," explained the Court, "the documents (provided by the plaintiff) confirm that the Social Justice Party received support during the period from 1995 to 1997, which renders this support a customary procedure that agrees with the Constitution. Besides, the administrative quarters should not base their position on the lack of a legal text requiring them to provide support to all parties on equal footing, as such a position contradicts with the principle of equality and equal opportunity and undermines multiplicity of parties, which is the foundation of the political system in Egypt."
The Group condemned the arrests describing them as "unjust".
There are other 25 Brotherhood leading figures, foremost of whom is Eng Mohammed Khairat Al-Shater, under custody charged with similar accusation. They were arrested in a house of one of them in Imbaba, Giza, four months ago.
The Ikhwan prominent figure, Dr Essam al-Eryan, expressed astonishment at the new campaign, considering its timing "as raising questions on the authorities adopting a new policy against Ikhwan in the framework of the international conditions and the developments on the arena". " It is known that the American campaign shifted from targeting violent-related organizations accused of involvement in the attacks on New York to national liberation groups", al-Eryan said.
The sources stated that Major Mohammad Ahmad Salama, 37, Chief of Detectives of the Egyptian Rafah town, had been hit by an Israeli bullet in his left thigh while he was inspecting security conditions in the border town.
US FORCES EGYPTIANS TO HAVE PRIOR CERTIFICATE FROM INTERPOL TO GET VISA Unprecedentedly, the US embassy in Cairo asked some Egyptians wishing to travel to the US to obtain a prior certificate from the Interpol, indicating that they are not wanted in Egypt.
Like the US embassy, other European embassies in Cairo have also been gripped in scare, concern and suspicion. For instance, the Italian embassy has tightened up procedures at the same level of the US embassy. The sum of money necessary for getting a visa to Italy has risen up to 210 pounds, which can not be refunded if the application is turned down, according to the new procedures. Only two persons have applied for an entry visa to Italy since the September 11 events.
Mohamed Abdullah Dawoud of Egyptian nationality said, "I applied for an entry visa to Germany to participate in a poultry industry fair and it was not the first time for me to apply. But, the embassy turned down my application and I missed the chance to attend the fair."

NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR WOMEN TO COOPERATE WITH CHURCH ON PROTECTING YOUNG GENERATIONS AGAINST ADDICTION
SIDHOUM REBELS AGAINST THE POPE!
Sidhoum thinks that political and mass media coverage of the waves of exchanged violence (as he so calls the struggle of our unarmed people against the occupation forces' violence) usually lacked reason and wisdom. But why?
However, we should discriminate between individual attitudes and the attitude of the group.
What peculiar personal views Youssef Sidhoum mouthed can by no means carry any national allegiance and therefore should absolutely be rejected. Can a person who claims to be Christian or alleges (for personal gains) that his newspaper is the mouthpiece of Christians approve of a people like the Afghans being killed without a reason?
The only person whose words can be taken as expressing the Church's opinion is the Pope Shenuda himself. The members of the Synod views on the Palestinian cause are well known to everybody both on the actual and verbal levels. The Copts have already been prevented from visiting Jerusalem until it returns to Arab sovereignty. Regardless of the consequent political developments that brought about a wide variety of amendments to many things, the Church's position remained constant and clear.
Deputy Catholic Patriarch, Anba Hanna Qulta said he believed that Sidhoum was expressing only his personal point of view as nobody, no matter what position he occupies, can violate the constants upheld by the national community Muslims and Christians alike.
in cold blood. A Palestinian source told Asharq Al-Awsat that an ambulance reached the site to take the Palestinians, who were injured in their heads.
Israel has not succeeded in making its assassination of Abu Ali Mostafa, Secretary General of the Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a fatal blow to the front. In early October, the PFLP responded by electing Ahmad Sa'adat as its new secretary general.
Following are excerpts from the interview. Q: Do not you think that Zeevi's assassination was a blow to President Arafat's efforts for denying Israel an opportunity to exploit the international community's preoccupation with terrorism?
We are back to square one, we are back to the same terms and conditions: either we surrender and accept what is offered us by Israel and the powers that never treat the weak fairly, or we resist.
These arrests imply that after the Palestinian Authority had revolted against the terms and conditions of the Oslo Agreement in the wake of the September Intifada and refused to resume the role of being the tool that protects the security of the occupiers and their settlers, it has succumbed once again to these terms and conditions.
A: Our relations with the Palestinian Authority and the PLO can be put in a context of unity and contradiction.
Such changes would impose our respect on those who deal with us, moving us from the circle of sympathy to that of acknowledgement of the realities imposed by our people's resistance of the occupation.
A: We agree with Hamas and Jihad and all other forces within the context of the unity of efforts for conducting the battle of defending our people against the Zionist enemy and escalating the Intifada and resistance until the objectives of our people are accomplished.
For instance, while Hamas and the Islamic Jihad believe that Islam should be the basis for legislation in the Palestinian community, we in the Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine believe that the laws of the Palestinian community must rest on a foundation of a secular, modern and democratic law that separates religion and state and separates the judicial, legislative and executive estates, in addition to providing much room for free expression, free press and women's rights and protecting human rights.

The report pointed out that our Commercial Bureau aims at amicably solving all commercial disputes between the Egyptian companies and their South Korean counterparts.
The rise in trade exchange came as a result of the two countries benefiting from the advantages and customs exemptions provided by the Egyptian and Tunisian trade-exchange agreement.
58-LE 6 BILLION DEBTS TO BE PAID TO SUPPLIERS & CONTRACTORS
Among the proposed measures will also be the reduction of subsidy to service and economic organizations from the state budget. Five government authorities will be turned into holding companies to alleviate the burden on the budget.

This is considered the second step Egypt took to show commitment to international rules and measures. The first step was the Justice Ministry's compilation of an anti-money laundering bill in order to prove that it is committed to the demands of the international financial committee affiliated to the European Union (EU).
The bill suggested that a specialized central agency be set up and be legally competent to acquire data and conduct investigations and exchange information with other countries and coordinate efforts with control bodies.
The Central Bank Governor, Mahmoud Abul Oyoun, said that the plan aimed at establishing a data network that would link the Central Bank and the main branches of the banks that constituted the Egyptian banking system at national level. "We will change our operations from exchanging customer information in paper form to an on-line direct communication system that will feature networks hooked up to the Central Bank database. This system will comply with all the laws and regulations that are currently in effect. All customer information confidentiality and information protection rules will also be taken into account," he said.

However, the study of the Ministry of Commerce affirms that advertisements give consumers a better idea about the product and its specifications. It says that advertisements are useful to the media, despite consumers' complaints that advertisements are imposed on television programs in an exaggerated manner and are spread over the pages of every newspaper so that they crowd out journalese material. The study also points out that advertisement help the media survive and remain independent, while the audience can avoid television advertisements by changing channels when commercials are aired or flipping over the newspaper or magazine pages that contain advertisement which they are not interested in seeing.

They have already started to launch the scheme, he said. The Iraqi army has moved a brigade of the seventh division to the north of Zamar in Mosul, he added.
He went on to say, "One of these lines is moving to the Kurdish area, which, if happens, the administration deems a serious thing that threatens the safe area and will have political and security effects."
He emphasized that the Iraqi Kurds "would resist this plan aiming to strangle them for it is a matter of life and death."
5-Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Abdul Aziz showed remarkable interest in women's affairs during a meeting with the Second Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister Prince Sultan Bin Abdul Aziz and a number of officials responsible for education of boys and girls on 4 November.
He also pointed out that the topic of issuing women with identity cards had been discussed with Interior Minister Prince Nayef Bin Abdul Aziz, who had "promised that something good was in the offing." The Crown Prince also commented that such matters were quite sensitive for women and, God willing, they would be concluded by the Government.
A Gulf sociologist said that the Saudi leadership was heading for restoring balance to the Saudi community that had been dominated by men for long years, which had impeded the capabilities of the complementary component for building a perfect, integrated society, particularly as women are capable of contributing to construction and development in such a manner that would not compromise the principles of Islamic Sharia. "Women have proved their mettle and perseverance, and have discharged the responsibilities entrusted to them in a distinguished manner," he pointed out.
Prince Abdullah's statements also brought to mind the statements of Defence Minister Prince Sultan Bin Abdul Aziz at Commerce House in Jeddah in May 2000. Prince Sultan had revealed the existence of a trend within the Saudi Government for expanding on the employment of women in a number of official sectors, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Planning. He had also said that 70% of the female staff of the General Directorate for Girls' Education, which is responsible for supervising the education of females, would replace their male coworkers and that the issuance of identity cards to Saudi women was under consideration.

Regarding the issue of Hizbullah's having to hand over its weapons, Safir said, "The Taif accord made it incumbent on all Lebanese to hand over their weapons." He added that Hizbullah was struggling to liberate the land which have already been liberated except for Shebaa Farms which we consider as Lebanese while some others consider them as disputed land between Lebanon and Syria. We, therefore, asked Syria to admit to the fact that those farms were Lebanese so that we might try to liberate them by peaceful means, which is possible through international agencies.

Knowledgeable sources said in Beirut that Assad and Hariri had affirmed during their meeting that a clear line should be drawn between resistance and terrorism and that such a position must be reinforced through persistent consultations with friendly countries that had weight on the international scene The sources added, "Assertions were made during the meeting that efforts should be exerted for making the international community pressure Israel into respecting UN Security Council resolutions 242, 338 and 425 and succumbing to international legitimacy by returning to the Middle East peace process on the basis of applications of these resolutions and the principles adopted during the Madrid Conference on the basis of the land-for-peace principle.
13-ACEVIT THREATENS TO ANNEX NORTHERN CYPRUS IF THE SOUTH JOINED THE EUROPEAN UNION
The Turkish Premier added that the annexation process can take the form of a self rule to run it internally while leaving foreign policy and defence to Turkey.
Some observers said that Ankara which predicts some dark clouds in its relations with the European Union on Cyprus and the European raid deployment force and combatting terrorism has been trying to secure American support for its attitude towards the Cypriot issue after the Turkish officials were convinced that the European Union would accept Cyprus as a new member and consider the Turkish presence in Northern Cyprus as occupation of lands affiliated to the Union, which might trigger a political or even military confrontation with Turkey.
The list showed the truth of the statements given by Israeli foreign minister Shimon Peres, during his latest visits to Washington on November 24 (last month), when he told Israeli press correspondents that Bush considered Hezbollah (in Lebanon) a terrorist organization and that the same thing applied to anti-settlement project Palestinian movements.
He added "America has been, for long, using both persuasion and intimidation with liberation movements. It has sent us several messages, but we adhere to our rights to liberate every inch of our land." He added, "All American lists won't intimidate us. This step will complicate relations between the USA and the Arab peoples."
He wondered who had installed the USA and Britain as judges of what is terrorist or non-terrorist.
He went on to say that, "The Arab league and all Arab countries should act to reject such a list and its implications."

Aidid accused Abdul Qassim Sallad's transitional government of collaboration with the Islamic Union for undermining security and stability in the region (it must be noted here that 20 members of the Somalese Parliament belong to the Islamic Union).
Aidid indicated that the Islamic Union Group, which is stationed on Somali soil with the blessing and support of the provisional government, has strong influence and receive support from quarters outside Somalia, pointing out that the Somali people would not tolerate any more suffering and misery.
We are not warmongers, and we do not want to fight, so long as no aggression happens against our territories."
"Until when will the United States continue to deliver arms to Israel, and will neighbouring countries just stand and watch and do nothing?" the President wondered, pointing out that Israel's neighbours could acquire nuclear weapons, particularly as a market for nuclear, chemical and biological weapons already existed, which would lead the whole world to a catastrophe.
He pointed out that Israel's continuation of being the only nuclear power in the Middle East could not be accepted by Egypt.
35-The American administration has started laying down a new plan in the context of the American campaign to face terrorism in parallel with the military operations in Afghanistan. The American plans are based on exerting pressure on a number of Arab countries - particularly the Gulf States - to change some of their religious education curricula to accord with what are called the new international changes under the pretext of developing education.
The new American policy comes after a study by American organs of the history of the current leaders of the extremist hard-line groups particularly the prominent members of the Qaeda Organization and their educational and cultural upbringing.
38-Gamal Mubarak, member of the National Democratic Party's General Secretariat said that there is a tendency to pass a law on parliamentary elections before the People's Assembly elections in 2005.
40-PA AD HOC COMMITTEE TO AMEND ELECTION LAW
Some General Committee members explained that Mubarak had not expressly touched on the amendment of the elections law in order not to lead to the adoption, by some, of Mubarak's point of view and trying to delude public opinion into believing that President Mubarak supports a new system of elections through the list electoral system instead of the individual one.
Al-Gomhouria, 13/11/2001
He called on the Government to amend the Constitution to allow for more democracy and hold free, fair elections that would express the will of the people without interference in favour of the National Democratic Party. "Elections should be supervised by the judicial estate inside and outside poll stations," he added, pointing out that the continuing application of the emergency law over all the past years did not protect the people's security or protect their rights but violated them in an unprecedented manner instead.
So long as this is Gamal Mubarak's final decision, it is our duty to express our opinions on what he has accomplished, as well as what he should do to achieve his objective, which, if he succeeds in attaining it, will be a much-needed addition to political practice.
The first element of success would be for him to separate himself completely from the Government and the State, so that his activities may not take an official tinge and that he may dissipate the impression that he is supported by State bodies that facilitate his projects, which are important and necessary.
The second element of success is to adopt attitudes and stands that differ from some of the orientations of the National Democratic Party and the State and are closer to those of the demands of opposition parties, including the calls for making necessary amendments in the Constitution, expanding the base of public freedoms, abolishing freedom-restricting laws, allowing the free publication of newspapers and resuming the process for emptying the jails of those who are detained without accusation or conviction.
For such occasions are mainly characterized by absence of the majority-holding National Democratic Party, which leaves them to others as if its youths had blunt national feelings, or even as if had no youths at all.
The definition is closer to a generalized judgement that is free from specifying conditions than it is to a specific fatwa that addresses certain conditions of time and place.
"The events have been going on for about two months. Al Azhar's recent statement was derived from the books of the fundamentalists. However, what is important is the effect, the influence. It is important that Al Azhar has a real role in the issues of the Muslim Nation," he said.
He said, "The debate on jihad has been going on for decades. People have felt over the past years that Al Azhar did not give any opinion on any issue unless asked to, while the issues of real concern to the nation were being discussed in its absence.
Debate is more useful in such cases than a dialogue that might be described as just an attempt to score a point on a certain situation without being actually willing to participate in that situation."
Although Al Azhar's statement contained a severe attack on the Israeli aggressions against the Palestinian people and the American attacks on the (poor and unarmed) Aghan people, this does not contradict in any way with the justifications cited by those who declare jihad today to enlist all Muslims in it."
He pointed out that the Egyptian authorities had turned down the establishment of the bank ten years ago. He denied knowledge of any projects in Egypt. Al-Hudhaibi as well as others refused elaborating on the personality of the bank president, Youssif Nada. They said they only knew that he had left Egypt among many others in 1954 after Al-Mansheya incident and the extensive crackdown that followed it against the Ikhwanites who had been charged with attempting to assassinate former Egyptian President Gamal Abdel-Naser.
57-MS/ Asharq Al-Awsat, 14/11/2001
But, the recent arrests have been the first since the September 11 attack and came at a completely inappropriate time, especially as other arrests of Islamist students at Egyptian universities occurred at the same time. The names of those Ikhwan students were deleted from the electoral registers of student unions, while the university administrations declined to enforce the court verdicts made in favor of those students.
The campaign was launched against Egypt by the Washington Post and New York Times, whose Zionist writer Thomas Friedman started his attack with an article just a few days ahead of his article against Egypt (November 6), also carried by the Herald Tribune (November 7) on Saudi Arabia.
Thus, the arrests (of Ikhwan members) show a double standard by Egyptian authorities, which seem to deny Americans what they allowed themselves to do.
From Morocco to Egypt, Saudi Arabia as far as Indonesia, protests in the streets have eased up to a large extent or have completely stopped."
However, the seriousness of this thing appeared before Mubarak at the Camp David summit when Clinton contacted him to ask him to put the squeeze on Arafat to cede Jerusalem and Al-Haram Al- Sharif to Barak.
EGYPT: AL ROUDHA INHABITANTS DID NOT MIND MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD ACTIVITIES, BUT NOW FEAR CRUISE MISSILES!
People got used to seeing university professors, syndicate symbols and other public figures among Muslim Brotherhood cadres and members going up to that flat. It was noticeable that they never go in groups but rather as individuals as they quite know that they are being observed and that cameras are fixed at hidden places to record any body who gets in or out of that building.
Even though the American primary steps took place elsewhere quite away from Manyal Al-Roudha district, the American officials constant confirmation that the campaign would not stop at bombing Afghanistan but would extend to include all bodies and individual considered by Washington as involved in terrorist activities has already aroused worry among the street inhabitants. Some even feared that some American cruise missiles might be launched at the street to finish off Mashour and his companions!
TEACHING MEDICINE FROM A RELIGIOUS PERSPECTIVE
A: It is a very close relation as that subject is part of forensic medicine. Both are concerned with legalities and individual and social rights. The need to that subject emerged after the technology revolution and the modern techniques that emerged in the field of medicine. It is different from the medical ethics which had been for long taught in all Egyptian faculties of medicine, as part of forensic medicine syllabi.
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN EGYPTIAN UNIVERSITIES HISTORY: COPTS TO BE APPOINTED TO THE POST OF ISLAMIC STUDIES DEMONSTRATOR!
The research and academic bookshop is full of Islamic treatises authored by Copts.
I learnt how to memorize the holy Koran, recite it and I also learnt the theoretical side of the Islamic educational methodology including jurisprudence and other very Islamic topics. At the end of the study I got an excellent degree in the subject of Islamic studies and also my general grade was excellent, to the surprise of my colleagues and teachers. I, then, presented a paper on Treatment using the Prophetic Medicine and used the holy Koran in the practical application of curing with honey as well the treatment of incurable diseases, which proves the truth of what was mentioned in the holy Koran 14 centuries ago.
After that great struggle and success as top of the class throughout the long years of study of the language, I am looking forward to being appointed to the post of demonstrator in the department I have been attached to in order to continue my educational studies, thanks to the encouragement of all my teachers who want me to be one of their colleagues in the department staff.
The famous actress Hala Sedqi filed a lawsuit asking to be divorced from her husband Magdi William Youssef. He was notified with his wife's lawsuit on which she said that the aforementioned was her husband according to valid church contract dated 19 January 1993. The marriage was consummated and the couple lived together. She asked to be separated from him in return for waiving all her financial and legitimate rights and returning the LE500 dowry he had given to her but he refused. And because she hates living with him which makes the continuation of conjugal life out of the question, she divorces herself by relinquishing all her financial and legitimate rights due to this hatred with which she fears of transgressing the limits set by God Almighty.

* Barring President Yasser Arafat from achieving "any political gain through his terrorism."
In this point, we have totally notched up the goal as the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) failed to drag any Arab military, even Lebanon's Hizbullah, to the battle.
In response, Ya'loun said that he admitted that there were problems, contradictions and failures, but he said, "the final results of events show that we have achieved a major victory over the Palestinian people."
There is neither an American, European or Israeli peace initiative, but there are only ideas put forward with the target of Crystalizing them into a new innovative plan that may rescue the region from deterioration, he said.
It is not a coincidence, as he who opposes the establishment of such State will cause Israel to turn into a Palestinian State.
NASRALLAH: LEBANON IS REAL TARGET OF WASHINGTON'S REQUEST FOR PUTTING HIZBULLAH ON TERRORIST LIST
The Secretary General of Hizbullah also warned that "succumbing to the conditions of the United States Administration will only turn Lebanon into a local police force that the American Administration can order about, just like Pakistan," pointing out that the American demands started with freezing bank accounts and then expanded to include the political system.
Dr. Mahmoud Abul-Oyoun said that such decrees came within the framework of government efforts to cope with the challenges faced by the economy in order to maintain high operation rates that would boost productive capacity. Those decrees include: 	* Temporary suspension for 3 months of commodity importation through payment documents no matter how close the relation between exporters and importers might be.

Selecting this headline for his column, Dawood Al Shuryan wrote: The Yemeni police implemented the Education Ministry's decision to close the Quranic School of the Salafite trend, on the ground that the school was following a hardline policy in teaching Islamic jurisprudence and interpretation of the Holy Quran.
Closing a Quranic school by police and torturing a citizen to force him to confess to a crime he had not committed are just a couple of many scenes of the contributions of Arab States to the United States-led war against terrorism.
Terrorism will diminish only with more freedom and justice, not with oppression, torture and treating defendants as guilty until proven innocent.
The narrow approach of retaliation must be bridged into the spaciousness of dialogue and freedom.

SAUDI ARABIA'S HEAD IN AMERICAN AUCTION
The campaigners accuse Saudi Arabia of being a breeding ground for dangerous "terrorists" whose beliefs are based on the Wahabite ideology, which is attributed to the founder of the Kingdom, reformist Sheikh Mohammad Abdul Wahab.
Some of them even went to the extreme of branding the Saudis as racists on account of the Kingdom's refusal to allow non-Muslim visitors access to the Holy Lands, which are off-limits to non-Muslims by order from the Prophet.
But before attaining its objectives, the United States first has to settle the scores of the past century.
The reports coming from there indicate that there is deep disagreement between two currents, one of which wants to bow to the American will and hastily implement the American recommendations to the letter, while that other wants to keep Saudi Arabia as it is, with its positive and negative points unchanged.
MFA, Al Quds Al Arabi, 14/11/2001
He also rejects being captured by the American Special Forces or the Northern Alliance because this will be "a big defeat for him." Second, Bin Laden has given certain instructions to those close companions, who will remain with him till the last moment, to shoot him if he is surrounded by the Americans and if they wanted to capture him, especially if there is no room for escape. Bin Laden asked his companions to swear that they would do so, and so they did. Moreover, Bin Laden asked one of his sons to pledge to kill him, instead of being arrested by the Americans or any other hostile body.
Fifth, information, obtained by the American Administration, says most probably Usama Bin Laden, together with his companions, is hiding in a mountainous area in Qandahar, which includes the provinces of Oruzgan, Zabol and Helmand. According to this information, Bin Laden has set up a group of secret hiding-places, equipped with necessary needs, in the mountains of Oruzgan. He also built a fortified mountainous complex in this area that is prepared for residence for several months.
In the chase operation, the American authorities depend on advanced reconnaissance and spy planes, military satellites and developed electronic equipment that watch every part of Afghanistan. The American authorities also depend on three specific factors to find the whereabouts of Bin Laden and attack them.
AM, Al-Watan, a Saudi newspaper, 21/11/2001
During a press conference that the Congress delegation held at Beirut Airport at the end of its visit of several hours, Congressman Nick Rahhal (D) was careful to point out that putting Hizbullah on the terrorist list had resulted from far memories in incidents that had occurred in the past and for which Hizbullah might have been indirectly responsible.
The Lebanese government sent a wish to Washington that the American officials would soften their criticisms of Lebanon after Hezbollah had been included in the terrorism organizations list which Washington insisted on having their assets frozen as that would affect the already deteriorating economic position in Lebanon. The Lebanese wish was carried through official diplomatic means asking Washington to understand the political and economic situation especially in the coming feasts period because the American insinuations that Lebanon's failure to cooperate in the file of terrorism and those wanted in the USA might have negative impacts on the Lebanese economic situation.
The sources added that Washington believed that the Lebanese government would have to stop Hezbollah activities on the borders with Israel.
He added, "The American administration looks at our region through Israeli eyes and implements Israeli policies."
"We little know when Israel will attack Lebanon or when it would overrun it once more," he said adding, "Regardless of all Israeli accusations to Hizbullah, Israel did not dare to shell any target in Lebanon as it well knows that any aggression on it would be costly for Israel."
The sources added that if the security and economic pressures combined and even the economic pressure alone against Lebanon were taken to extremes, their dangers might lie in the following: 	Undermining the central government in Lebanon as a deteriorating economic position might affect political stability.
Neither would Arab reactions to a possible American escalations be in Washington's interests especially as the party Secretary General Hassan Nasralla has already turned into a symbol of liberation and resistance for the Arab public opinion.
When America reminds the world of its pledges of "mass wars" under the umbrella of "anti-terrorism war", and as its fighters and bombers cross Russian borders, it would hardly be surprising to see the Iranian flag above American troops flying to Baghram in Afghanistan!
All are soldiers in the service of the uni-super power in the third world war which will undoubtedly change all the balances, concepts and classifications or even maps if the Bush demands for protecting American national security against the terrorism devil require it.
The Arabs have lost the Palestinian uprising cause which have been among the first victims of the attacks of Washington and New York because the black has turned white.
Consequently, no less than full-hearted scrambling would be accepted including renunciation of any kind of resistance or opposition to the imminent peace in the Middle East!
It has started to realize that the continuous bombing it has carried out for weeks of Afghan cities and Taliban forces, during which it has unleashed more than 30,000 tons of bombs and missiles at Afghanistan, has simply opened the way for return of Russian influence to Afghanistan, after the United States itself had worked for a whole decade, from 1979 to 1989, to support the Afghans with money, equipment and weapons in their fight against the Soviets to drive them out of their country under the slogan of "fighting Communism."
As a result, he had to go back to Peshawar on the same day to meet with leaders of Afghan ethnic groups, in a bid to persuade all parties to work together for creating a government with a wide representation base that would be divided fairly among all Afghan factions, including the Pashtuns, to which the Taliban belongs.
So what does the United States do now?
In fact, this is exactly what is happening now, as senior officials of the Defence and Foreign Ministries have departed Moscow on their way to the Tajik capital, Duschanbe, on their way to Afghanistan to prepare for Russia's return there, at least through political influence if not in the form of military presence.

The American reports think that Muslim Brotherhood Group is in fact the real parent of the Islamic Group headed by Omar Abdel-Rahman, currently jailed in America. Jihad Organization leaders had spent a long time of Ikhwanite ideaology. Several religious organizations in the Gulf, furthermore, still see the Muslim Brotherhood as the ideal for any successful religious organization.
Tahani Turki wrote:
The American education program, which 15 schools have joined so far, is based on discussion and dialogue between pupils on a number of issues, including peace, the environment, the dialogue among religions and civilizations, common understanding and coexistence, in addition to exchanging comments on current events, including the World Trade Centre bombing and the 11 September attacks on New York and Washington.
I would imagine that this program could be applied to pupils in all Arab countries to deepen their awareness of nationalist principles and cement ties among Arab peoples. But if such a program is applied by two countries that have no element of similarity of religious beliefs, social values or even economic standards, the only natural result will be for the stronger side to prevail and impose its own values on the weaker one."

More serious even than the occurrence of such terrorist crimes, is the suspicious silence maintained by Washington and European capitals which failed even to denounce or condemn the killing of the children.
Nor can it be assumed that such inhuman crimes were spontaneous or accidental as they had certainly been willfully premeditated by the terrorist killers inside Israel who wanted to send a message to the American Administration in defiance of any action on their part towards peace.

31-Sudanese-Ugandan relations are most likely to undergo a fresh stage of tension in the coming days against the background of the Ugandan President Yuri Mosevini's call at the United Nations General Assembly to divide Sudan into Muslim north and Christian south.

Sudanese Charge D'affaires in Kampala Serageddin Hamid said no one can divide Sudan, reiterating that this matter "is by no means on the cards."

While the SPLM is menacing the country's petroleum production and exportation facilities, our dear friend, the USA, has extended its unilateral sanctions on Sudan. The United States provided John Garang with $ 13 million in direct financial support in 2001, plus weapons, ammunition, logistical supplies and intelligence information. But Egypt and Libya, on the other hand, have been afraid of the wrath of the man in the White House, thus pussyfooting on supporting Khartoum with arms, and even with Sudanese volunteers who reside on Egyptian and Libyan soil, to help it deter the southern rebels and the bandit gangs that roam the eastern part of the country and foil the scheme for separating southern Sudan, which is actually aimed at hitting Egypt's water interests and Arab-African relations.
Some of the pillars of the ancient diplomatic corps of our dear country do not realize that Washington considers Egypt and Libya as part of the central area of the Middle East while it regards Sudan as part of the Greater African Horn, which the United States wants to reshape politically very soon. Washington has been setting the stage for redrawing the political map of the Horn of Africa, as reflected by its insinuations that the Bush anti-terror campaign may extend to Somalia, which the United States claims to be harbouring some elements of Al Qaeda Organization, not to mention its claims that some of the warlords of the Somali warring factions are dealing in drugs, an allegation that naturally provokes feelings in the United States against them.
I sincerely believe that Egypt and Libya should stand together against the conspiracy for partitioning Sudan, the Arab country with dual ethnic roots and dual religious beliefs that appears on America's list of rogue states that the United States sees as a source of danger to its security. This list includes North Korea, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya and Sudan, most of which are Arab or Muslim countries that the Americans want to send up the same route of Somalia and Afghanistan, so that they may be ravaged by civil wars, lose their political weight and international characters, have their political system go down in flames and then wait for the change that would turn them into areas of American influence, thus becoming surrogates of Washington, politically, economically and militarily, all within the context of America's global hegemony.

93-UNTOLD SECRETS BEHIND CABINET RESHUFFLE
There is a third winner, although he is not a runner in the race: Foreign Minister Ahmad Maher, whose kingdom has been expanded to include international cooperation.
The decree stipulates that the Prime Minister has become responsible for the banking sector, the Central Bank of Egypt and insurance companies.
These classic functions have atrophied, and the banking system is now responsible for raising funding, managing and maximizing by issuing bonds, deposit certificates and securities, establishing investment funds and assurance funds and engaging in speculation.
He has two programs under one slogan: "Cost-effective resource management," which he has announced time and again.

The most pressing responsibility is that Egypt is in the midst of an economic crisis and its balance of trade is under tremendous pressures, and so is its balance of payments.

Most of "Arab Afghans" are students and former officials in the Arab Gulf countries, who had gone to Afghanistan to take part in Jihad or holy war there and then returned to Somalia and Sudan, rather than their homelands.
The Arab Afghans have melted into the Somali society and started to organize their grassroots, taking the advantage of the absence of a central Somali government, especially in the capital controlled by Islamists representing the following three main groups; 	First; the Somali Islamic Union, which has a limited activity.
The Somali Islamic Union, whose activities have decreased in the recent years, was a former alley of late general Mohammed Fareh Edid, until the somali reconciliation conference was held. He then entered into an alliance with Ethiopia and those Islamists, who supported the "Legitimate Tribunals", "Reform" and most Salafi Islamic organizations.
It fought Ethiopia in the eastern part of its borders.
Eritrea's intelligence service waged war against the Arab Afghans, who were allied with the Islamic union.
Washington immediately established a security coalition with Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan and Uganda, and listed the Somali Islamic Union and Rahma (Mercy) Organization for Relief as terrorist organizations.
There have been increasing whispers about a US determination to commence the second round of its anti-terrorism campaign by launching lightning attacks on the strongholds of Islamists in Somalia and Sudan.
Thus, Ethiopia is expected to be a decisive factor in fighting against "terrorist" organizations in the Horn of Africa.

WHO WOULD OPEN THE EGYPTIAN-INDIAN ECONOMIC FILE?
The question now is: Why did not the two countries take advantage of their political and historical as well as their traditional friendship to promote their commercial and economic relations?!
Let's give the Indian side the opportunity to talk about the identity of the untraditional ideas that are required for picking commercial relations up to the level of the strong political relations.
The bilateral relations, he added, are trying to cope with the developments and challenges of the contemporary world as well as the new dimensions, including the post-cold war scenario and the growing concentration on economic cooperation.
First, the two countries have actually presented a model for fast-growing cooperation in the area of trade and economy.
Fourth, Indian companies pay great attention to the contribution to the textile and fertilizer sector in Egypt.
The same question was directed at the Egyptian side that was represented by Zeinb Morsi, the official in charge of the Egyptian-Indian relations file and the Egyptian-Asian relations dossier.
Explaining this point, she said that the role of both the business council and the joint chamber of commerce is confined to boosting trade exchange and exports. "I believe that the business council and the chamber of commerce need restructuring and reformation, so that they may be the foundations for the development of commercial relations.
Third, a new economic zone should be founded for India as we have vast area of land where new economic zones can be set up. Every state could thus obtain a zone to set up a complex of industrial and investment projects affiliated to it.

2.		Just as happened in Shakspeare's famous play "Macbeth", all the seas of the world would not suffice to wash the hands of Arab leaders who would head for Amman this week to hold their summit of innocent Palestinian blood. The sea waves might turn red but their hands would continue to be stained as ever.
5.		In the case of Palestine, however, where the leadership chose to bury the hatchet, and raise the white flag claiming they sought the "peace of the brave" relinquishing even their right of self-defence and letting both left and right cheeks let alone the nape and the bottom be the subject of slaps and kicks even though their rights were quite confirmed by international documents, UN resolutions and world unanimity, their an armed children fail to find a rescuer. On the contrary they have been asked by the American President to stop "violence" and "terrorism" or rather give up the stratagem of "death" when they are shot at to spare Sharon and Arab moderate leaders the embarrassment!
If criminal of war Sharon has been elected for a definite purpose, namely to complete what he had started when he committed Sabra and Shatila massacres, if he has been so hailed in Washington while Arab leaders who boast about peace are not so warmly welcomed; if Sahron has been so looked up to though he went there as a beggar while those who pump money into American treasury fail to get the same treatment; if Sharon, criminal as he is, can get sympathy with his cause in spite of being a burden to American protection, if all that happens, then how reasonable and highly justified those Arab leaders would be if they decided to tender mass resignations during their summit or (which would be a better choice) if they decided on a mass suicide, thus acting on Colonel Geddafi's advice!

43.		SHARON TO SEND ENVOY TO AMMAN, ISRAELI PRESSMEN DENIED ACCESS TO ARAB SUMMIT
The Israeli message comes before holding the Arab summit to be hosted by Jordan and after Jordan had apologized for not receiving the Israeli Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres who had shown willingness to visit Amman and Cairo last week to discuss ways and means of resuming peace negotiations in the region.
49.		For a week, Abu Dhabi hotels were full as weapons companies official and unofficial agents and participants in Idex Exhibition for Weapons occupied all hotels so much so that some important personalities who arrived late failed to find accommodation. The exhibition is one of the marketing outlets for international weapons industry. 860 companies have participated in it from 43 countries over the world amidst Arab almost complete absence whether by companies or official delegations. The Jordanian monarch, it is true, and the Sudanese President have visited the exhibition on the margin of their meeting with Sheikh Zayed, but Arab absence at that event raised many questions.
53.		On the margin of the exhibition, a Gulf defence conference was held to discuss facing the dangers. The conference was participated in by a big number of defence experts. The researches and discussions especially western ones seemed to concentrate on the potential dangers from Iran and Iraq. It seemed that some of them had originally attended the conference to promote that concept in particular even though some of them seemed to voice a purely personal opinion, recalling to memory the war for the liberation of Kuwait and the role of the foreign forces.
56.		A somewhat balanced outlook, nevertheless, was presented by Saudi professor, Dr. Saleh Al-Mani, when he said the Gulf security could hardly be separated from Arab-Israeli conflict especially when it comes to Jerusalem. He suggested that armament be allowed to go side by side with the adoption of constructive diplomacy in a bid to achieve peace in the region through the drawing up of common strategies between Gulf states, Iran and Iraq to guarantee security and stability in the region. The Western forces represent only temporary solution. Such a concept would put an end to arms race.
60.		THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT DEFENDS EMERGENCY STATE AND WARNS AGAINST TERRORIST ACTS RENEWAL
The two deputies emphasized that prisons are packed with innocent detainees whose positions should be reviewed so that those proven unguilty may be released.
He underlined that "violence started only under emergency law." He called for stopping referring civilians to courts martial and cancelling non-civil courts." 65.		Parliament Affairs Minsiter, then, re-emphasized that it cannot be said for certain that terrorist operations have ended.
68.		The coalition of the rabbis and generals in the Zionist State at both the national and regional levels feel that the Israeli deterrence credibility had shaken tremendously especially in the face of Al-Aqsa Intifada and south Lebanon and that Israel started to suffer from the implications of a regional shrinkage stage that started with its withdrawal from Sinai in 1982, then gradually from Lebanon in May, 2000, and jeopardizing internal security through handing over 39.1% of Palestinian lands occupied in 1967 either partially or wholly to the Yasser Arafat's National Palestinian Authority under 1st and 2nd Oslo agreements.
72.		Israel and its current leaderships therefore, have motivation for aggression including arrogance tempted by power in light of the current military strategic imbalance between it and each of the Arab ring countries surrounding it, besides its strategic nuclear deterrent, which could be resorted to if driven to defend its survival if a new military confrontation carried omens of its defeat and if there were chances of its lands being penetrated by Arab forces from more than one strategic direction as was the case in the 1973 War.
75.		The Israelis are planning that such lighting operations would take two or three days. If they were launched against the Syrian forces in Bekaa valley, the Israeli forces would go back to north Israel to avoid regional implications especially on the part of Egypt and some other key Arab countries in the regional Arab order.
79.		The effect of the summit resolutions will be linked to the Palestinian people's ability to carefully sustain intifada action and deliberately escalate hostile activities against some Israeli military targets in Israel and Shab'a farms.
They can stand to defend any common stand or indeed impose it as long as it comes within the right and international legitimacy.
In other words, Israel and American Jews, not Palestinians are his enemies.

95.	M.Sh. Al-Ahrar, 27/3/2001
99.		Assuming the appearance of peace advocate since his prime ministerial election campaign, Sharon said in his first address as winner of the election that he would not set up any new Jewish settlements. No settlements therefore would be erected in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Executing the Israeli project within Israel renders the question more complex and serious.
Israel further dismantled about 200 Arab villages in Galilee after it had forced the villagers to leave them. It, then, constructed there Jewish settlements, villages, kibbutzes, cities and military camps.
101.		Although the said project carries different appellations, its real name, which shows the essential purpose of the project, is "Judaisation of Galilee". This landscape is still inhabited by an Arab majority (1948 Palestinians).
103.		MT / Al-Wasat, 26/3/2001
He will, for the first time, meet with the American President George W. Bush. I hope his meeting with Bush and all American politicians will succeed in achieving peace for our dear country and all the region.
110.		The Pope went on enumerating the cases which some irresponsible groups attempts to raise clouds about. He said, "When we come to the Church construction and renovation issue, we find that the President has directed that all places of worship receive the same treatment, which was very kind of him!
114.		Official procedures started in Cairo for constituting the first Egyptian anti- Zionism society including representatives of different political and intellectual trends in Egypt, foremost among whom are Dr. Abdel Wahab Al-Meseiri, Islamic Lawyer Dr. Mohamed Selim Al-Awa, woman of letters Radwa Ashoor, Engineer Abu Al-Ila Madhi, Wasat party co-founders deputy, leftists Ahmed Nabil Al-Hilali and law professor Salah Sadek, the society co-founders deputy.
117.		The association is expected to submit its documents to the Ministry of Social Affairs next week, according to the Egyptian law provisions, after the administrative and financial structures were framed and bylaws worded up.
120.		As for the Islamic community in Egypt, a change in clothes synchronized with the economic development from an agricultural society to an industrial one. In the agricultural era Egyptian woman clothes were suited to agricultural requirements. Once the society turned into an industrial one after 1919 Revolution and after the construction of Banque Misr, women clothes started to change gradually until women took off their Niqab (a veil covering all the woman's face except her eyes). Once in the work market women started to relinquish their decent Islamic costumes and wear, instead, western garments ranging from short dresses to jeans!
When Nasser died and Sadat succeeded him, a clash cropped up between him and the Leftists and the Nasserites. Sadat released the Muslim Brotherhood members. So, when the events of 18 and 19 January 1977 took place, and Communists were accused, Sadat speculated on the Islamic rightists. Hence, political Islam was unleashed and starting a wave of violence in universities, streets, and regional cities to impose Hejab.
125.	M.Sh. Al-Gomhouria, 27/3/2001
The committee meets annually and has previously mounted agricultural training courses and mutual visits programs.
132.		Egyptian security bodies and officials of UN forces stationed in Sinai examined the outer façade of the crossing point, which was exposed to Israeli bullets and filed a report on the incident, as that was a violation of the peace treaty signed by Egypt and Israel.
136.		The banned Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) Group in Egypt called for establishing an independent judicial body to supervise all parliamentary and local elections in Egypt. Such a body should have a police force affiliated to it.

Besides, the equipment required for treatment of natural gas is cheaper as compared to those required for treating the gas that comes out of oilfields, which comes out only with crude oil. Moreover, this project affords an opportunity for exporting Egyptian natural gas through the Libyan gas network, which is connected to the North African gas grid that covers Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco and crosses the Mediterranean to Southern European countries, particularly Italy and Spain. These advantages will give Egypt access to a wide range of options for exporting its natural gas surplus through Jordan in the east or Libya in the west, in addition to exportation of liquefied gas by tankers from the gas liquefying stations at the Mediterranean gas fields to Southern Europe. All these exports will be done within the context of the memoranda of cooperation and understanding that were signed by Petroleum Minister Fahmi with Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and multinational companies that discover and exploit natural gas fields, including American, Dutch, British, Italian and Spanish companies, which were recently joined by Gas du France.

Abul Oyoon pointed out that failure to pass the money laundering law would affect the flow of investments from international financing and lending organizations and restrict Egypt's access to financial facilities at privileged terms. "Foreign banks may also cease their dealings with Egyptian banks," he said, reminding committee members that a clear definition of the money laundering crime and the actions that would be classified as such should be reached, so as to eliminate the possibility of leveling accusations on the force of mere suspicions.

Question: In the beginning, we want to know the classification of Egypt's imports and the rate of each of which. Answer: We import very large quantities of intermediary and capital goods, which represent 58% of Egypt's total imports.
Question: What about the rate of the investment goods, imported by the private sector?
This rise will not enable the Egyptian exports to compete with others and raise the transportation fees, as transportation is a decisive element in foreign trade.
Answer: The Minister of Foreign Trade held a meeting with the agents of international navigational companies in a bid to reduce the transportation fees. However, the Ministry has not so far informed us of any developments. Israel preceded us. It has already reached an agreement with the navigational and insurance companies, as it is not included in the theater of operation and it is not a party to the international anti-terrorism alliance. The world companies allowed it to apply the same old prices.

"These companies are already privatized, for their ownership is shared by the Government and the private sector at varying degrees," he explained. "Therefore, what will be liquidated will actually be the publicly-owned shares only, and the companies themselves will not be privatized, so they will not be subject to the privatization facilities that were recently introduced by the Ministerial Committee for Privatization, as they will be sold only as shares because the assets of each of them are jointly owned by a number of partners.

Following a meeting with leaderships of petroleum sector companies, the minister also said that the adjustment of the natural gas pricing system in the petroleum agreements with foreign partners would create a surplus of some $ 230 million, while the starting of operations in major projects on time would lead to the production of diesel fuel and butane gas to curb their imports, which would also create a surplus of about $ 700 million.

83-A recent report by the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMS) says that at the time when food consumption is at its seasonal peak because of the Ramadan fasting, for which Egyptians buy foods that they do not normally buy in such large quantities, such as nuts, dried figs and apricots etc, the consumer goods price index registered a slight rise of 0.03%, despite the drop in prices of grains and carbohydrates. Meanwhile, the prices of other goods and services have remained constant, particularly those of housing, fuel, transportation, garments, fabrics, furniture, detergents, education, entertainment and medical care.

In Doha, Sheikh Yousef Al Qaradawi, a prominent Islamic scholar, said that the statues made by ancient peoples before Islam were "historic heritage," indicating that Muslims had conquered Afghanistan in the first century After Hijra and the statues had been there but they did not think of destroying them. He addressed the Taliban, saying, "I advise our brothers in the Taliban Movement to reconsider the decision they have made, because it is very serious and will have far-reaching repercussions in many aspects."
25.		Pope Shenuda III, Patriarch of Saint Mark Episcopate, met Egypt's Mufti Dr. Nasr Farid Wasel in his office at Dar Al-Ifta for the first time since he was appointed Mufti in 1996.26.	Egypt's Mufti told Asharq Al-Awsat that such a visit was paid by the Pope on the occasion of Corban Bairam and was devoted to national unity promotion, but did not touch on any political issues. They also talked about Islamic-Christian dialogue and Dar Al-Ifta joining the inter-faith dialogue committee. Egypt's Mufti and Pope Shenuda reviewed the humanitarian side of the current conflict in the occupied lands.
30.		He pointed out a difference between the Egyptian Orthodox and Catholic Churches over how to deal with the Jerusalem issue. While the former rejects any visits to Jerusalem as a kind of normalization, the latter separates between politics and religion and does not consider such visits as normalization. They are not visits to the Jews, but to holy Christian places in Jerusalem away from any political considerations.
34.		Within the framework of its campaign against the new bill on documents, Al-Wafd continues reviewing the opinions of politicians, men of the law, media men and university professors. They unanimously rejected this draft law and branded it as "suspicious." Justifying their rejection, they said this bill is full of defects and imposes blatant restrictions on the freedom of exchanging information and knowledge.
36.		Justice Mohamed Hamed Al-Gamal, former president of the State Council: Bill covers up government's crises:
39.		Justice Sabri Al-Biali, former head of the Administration Prosecution, is of the view that this bill is a restriction on the freedom of the press and journalists, especially when matters are related to the freedom of expression and criticism.
41.		Justice Tarek Al-Bishri, former first vice president of the State Council, says information is important for anybody to express his view on public issues. Hence, everybody should be given the chance to get acquainted with true information from its reliable sources.
Hence, there is no need for having another law passed to incriminate the same act, unless the government wants to intimidate its opposers and those who publish or spread items about its sins. 44.		This bill, however, is full of contradictions. If we believe that the publication of documents is against the interest of the homeland, the body that should approve or disapprove the publication of these documents should be the People's Assembly because it represents the people in their entirety. Giving this right to the Cabinet is unjustifiable, unless the government wants to make the Cabinet "the master of its own decisions and the supreme judge;" thus, we will return to the era of the police state in its worst form.
48.		The bill, proposed by the government, followed the campaign launched by Al-Wafd to expose the conditions of the Social Fund for Development at a time when the regime does not want to show its weakness. By this bill, the regime wants the press to cover up crimes. Suffice it to say we cannot bring a minister or a governor to book, or even control them effectively and the press was the sole pulpit that speaks about corruption in government departments and ministries. Hence, this draft law will slaughter freedoms and disregard democracy.
The Penal Code bans the publication of anything that does harm to the State security. So, what is new about this bill if it is applied?

The official denied that there was consultation over other issues, such as the UAE islands occupied by Iran, pointing out that Iran is interested in keeping its relations with GCC members at a level higher than good, particularly as the recent security agreements reflected the degree of Iranian interest in those relations. He also stated that GCC members should regard their good relations with Teheran as a tool of pressure on Iran for pulling its forces out of the UAE islands, pointing out that there was no justification for Gulf States to fail to use such privileged relations as a leverage. "Kuwait, in particular, has strong relations with Iran, which is aware of the importance of keeping those relations good. However, Gulf pressure is nonexistent," he concluded.
The Administration has asked Israel to refrain from interfering in the Iraq issue at this time, when the United States is seeking to impose "strict control" over the Iraqi-Turkish border.

10-THANKS TO BUREAUCRACY, EGYPT LOSES YACHT TOURISM REVENUES
Random duties are considered the biggest stumbling block that obstructs the growth of yacht tourism in Egypt as they reduce the number of yachts coming to the Red Sea and cause the refrainment of yacht owners from visiting Egypt in favour of neighbouring countries that seek to offer further incentives and facilities and even cancel the duties altogether.
If the yacht's owner wanted to move from one place to another in the governorate, he would have to repay the same duties in order to be given a new licence that would enable him to navigate. This made it permissible for many neighbouring countries to attract their tourism through big material facilities.
The report indicated a decline in imports in 2000 hitting LE8.7 billion against LE9.3 billion registered in 1998. The value of imported cheese accounted for LE120.5 million, kid toys including Ramadan fanous (lantern) LE26.6 million, cat and dog food LE1.7 million and yameesh (dried fruit) LE82.2 million, the report said.

Official sources pointed out that the volume of Egypt's imports of miscellaneous products, most of which are children toys, consumer goods, chocolate, gums, needles, thread, and simple house appliances, rose remarkably hitting LE5.404 billion.
The new increase will be financed through remitting 900 million pounds from the bank's reserves and profits on condition that a legal reserve is made up for the bank from the remaining public reserves. Other reserves can also be made through setting aside 5% of the annual net profits, Ebeid pointed out.
The Auction and Bid Statute which will be issued by the CBE will constitute the structure that would govern contracts concluded by the bank, he pointed out.
23-On 3 December, the Central Bank of Egypt formally notified banks that implementation of the decisions adopted on 19 November, which caused wide ripples in banking and economic circles, will be postponed.
Abul Oyoon justified the postponement of the 19 November decisions as being aimed at dissipating the state of concern that had prevailed in business circles with regard to regulation of importation activities, as a result of misinterpretation of the results of the banking leaderships' meeting and its consequences on the foreign exchange market.
The foreign exchange orders placed with the Central Bank currently total about $ 500 million, most of which are ordered by big private sector banks that deal in foreign currencies at a large scale.
25-BROADSIDE AGAINST CONTRADICTORY DECISIONS OF GOVERNMENT, CBE
Mustafa al-Said, a former minister of economy, said the recent resolutions were good and could reduce consumption in the short run to address the shortage of resources following the September 11 US events. But the CBE failed to make good use of decisions, he said.

Since President Mubarak stated that imports should be rationalized and luxury shunned in consideration of the country's circumstances, particularly after the September 11 events, the forces of the Axis of Chaos have been mustering and maneouvering to undermine any attempts to control imports because they know that this may check other things and lead to the luxury class which has a high voice in the ruling party losing a large part of their huge wealth and privileges. According to some official conceptions the scenario went something like this. The governor of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) issued a decree to change the financial mechanism of imports at a short notice and without a sufficient opportunity been given for adjustments and a study of the environment surrounding the decision. This was followed by a debate in the economic committee of the NDP in which the governor announced his adherence to the decrees explaining their importance and the dangers of currency speculations.
In Port Said, the green buck reached a rate of 5.5 pounds and 5.15 pounds for bulk purchases. In downtown Cairo the rate stood at 490 piasters and is going up beyond the five pound limit.

55-Egyptian economic sources have warned against a new inflationary wave afflicting Egyptian markets due to the government failure to control rates of exchange and the rise of the dollar and Arab and foreign currencies against the Egyptian pound to record rates. Those sources pointed out that most commodities, products, production supplies, medium commodities and spare parts produced in Egypt mainly depend on imported components. They pointed out that raising transport rates as well as maritime freight and the multiplicity of duties and burdens borne by the producer would lead to a rise in prices in order that production may continue and avoid factories and companies coming to a halt.

"I believe that Russia's role will magnify whenever stability is achieved in it," he points out. "In fact, the peace process is passing through a dark tunnel. If such darkness continues for a certain period, it will abort the peace process for years to come.
"The American attitude towards Sudan is more flexible at present, or at least the Americans are in a state of anticipation of the policy to be followed by the Sudanese government.
Regarding the claims of spreading anti-Semitism concepts in the Egyptian newspapers, he says: "I believe that it is in the interest of everybody to keep away from mingling Judaism with the State of Israel because not all Jews are Israelis and not all Jews support Israel. It is not in my interest to link all Jews in the world to the State of Israel."
Although Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is wriggling out of the peace commitments day after day, giving rein to his illusions and dangerous policies, Washington still being the sole sponsor of the peace process contents itself with moving its lips forward before carefully whispering reproach so that sensitive feelings of the gory general may not be hurt.
In fact, the answer is simple.
Commenting on the latest aggression on the Lebanese territories, Al-Ahram editorial said: Israel will bear the responsibility for the grave consequences of its provocative barbaric acts, as Syria and Lebanon will not be alone in this confrontation. The Israeli war machine is witnessing daily challenges from an unarmed Arab people in Palestine. The humiliating withdrawal and defeat inflicted upon this machine in the raging South Lebanon can still be remembered. It appears that the lessons drawn from it were not adequate enough to deter the leaders of evil and aggression in Israel.
I am virtually urging the Palestinians to despair by which I do not mean resigning oneself to defeatism as death would then be the better option, no doubt. What I mean is an effective fertile despair.
Their territories have just turned into isolated islands in their own homeland, surrounded by Israel settlements, camps and detours. The Negev canal will soon come to link the Mediterranean sea with the dead sea, thus turning the Palestinian homeland figurative dismemberment into solid reality!
I am calling them for despair of the rise of Israeli peace movement that would cite the case of co-existing with the Palestinians and reducing the attitudes of most Israelis and Israeli politicians to a mere quest for Israeli security even if that costs all the lives of the Palestinians!
Then and only then will Israel change its position!
The People's Assembly (PA) Foreign Affairs Committee Deputy Chairman, Dr. Mustafa Al- Fiqi, believed that the Arab attempts to have a UN resolution issued for sending international forces or observers for protecting the Palestinian people from atrocities committed daily by the Israeli forces, need to be both politically and legally studied as the Arabs should ask themselves: "Can the presence of international forces involve the possibility of stopping the intifada?"
At the invitation of the Ministry of Culture, an urgent meeting will be held in Cairo during the period from 24-26 April by heads of antiquities authorities in Arab countries in order to lay down a strategy for protecting Jerusalem monuments.
He also affirmed that any Arab or regional dealings with Israel in the field of heritage protection should be stopped in solidarity with the Palestinian stand on that score.
The notice said that no dogs or Israelis are allowed to enter. The Israeli ambassador said such words showed Egyptian animosity to the Israelis.
It seems that the farces of Boeing, seeking to defend its reputation at Egypt's expense, will not come to an end. The victims' families defense council told Rose Al-Youssef that Boeing had sued Gameel Al-Batoti family in order to have his estate impounded. They also said that the details of the lawsuit would be shown to them in a few days' time on the basis that they are the lawyers for Batoti's family.
It seems that Egyptian pilot, Ali Murad is destined to be a symbol of Egyptian hostility to every thing Israeli!
Murad was flying an EgyptAir airliner on an ordinary flight from Cairo to Beirut with 126 passengers on board the plane. Just when he was getting ready for landing at Beirut airport and only 4 miles from the airport site, he was surprised to hear the control tower asking him to get away from the airport and turn left as Beirut was exposed to an Israeli air bombing.
. He therefore decided to turn 35 degrees left but three Israeli planes including two bombers came into sight. Two of them passed him safely. The third plane was a short distance ahead of him.
This time, he would not be in a position to prove that he had done the right thing. However, will EgyptAir be able to internationally sue Israel for exposing a civilian airliner and its passengers to danger and causing the company to incur heavy losses?

He added that he listened to Abdel-Wahab and Umm Kulthom (two late and famous Egyptian singers) as they had many good songs but again, being busy he does not have enough time to listen to their songs.
Egyptian journalist, Talaat Romeih would almost certainly be the only candidate for the position of chief editor of Al-Shaab, an opposition organ suspended since last June, should the newspaper be back, a very likely happening according to Labour Party advocates and Egyptian Islamic groups who found in that organ the only mouthpiece in Egypt.
Al-Shaab lawyers expect the newspaper to be published again after the administrative decrees withholding its return had been dropped.
The Egyptian Interior Ministry is now preparing to set up a police data bank, so that the Egyptian police would be turned in a few years' time into electronic police, said assistant minister for data and documentation police Major General Sami Al-Bahnasawi.

Israeli threats to Lebanon and Syria synchronized yesterday for the second day in a row with information of diplomatic sources, pointing out that the French Foreign Minister, who is scheduled to visit Beirut and Damascus late April, would carry dangerous news about Sharon's government intentions to step military actions against Syria via Lebanon.
WILL SHARON MOVE FROM FOLLY TO INSANITY?
Sharon will find himself before a staunch political barrier represented in the Labor Party, if he goes beyond this limited military action to strike in the Syrian depth. This would put Israel before a known fact that the Second Disengagement Agreement of 1974 had collapsed. Thus, Sharon will have set off the Golan Front, besides Lebanon and the Palestinians, which means that he will move from folly into insanity.
At that time, one will not be astonished to see the Arab leaders arriving at Ben Gurion Airport to take part in a summit, or see an Arab capital playing host to Israel's leaders.
Then, on March 24, 1995 the then Israeli premier Rabin, months before his assassination, raised this idea anew. Attending a working supper following the last quadripartite summit with Presidents Hosni Mubarak and Yasser Arafat and King Hussein, Rabin raised this idea of having Israel join the AL following the comprehensive peaceful settlement. The Israeli leaders still have great hopes in the future.
The sole surprise in Gaddafi's call was represented in the fact that it was voiced by a man who considered himself the last knight of Arabism. Moreover, Gaddafi's call will give the supporters of normalization a chance to adopt this call fully without any agreements or calls for rejection, as was the case ten years ago.

The Movement will also present papers to the Kuwaiti political street, including its views on the economic topics, petroleum, foreign policies files and the required relation between the government and parliament.
The Movement believes that the Royal Family is the strongest institution among the above- mentioned four. It says Al-Sobah's dependence on historic, constitutional and practical rules protected it against elimination.
The Royal Family's leading figures should distance themselves from competing with the public over finance, economy and public posts.

Economic observers expect a crisis to erupt between the Government and moneychangers because of some articles of the new bill that will be submitted to the People's Assembly during the current session, as these articles will raise the minimum capital of exchange companies from LE 1 million to LE 50 million each.
Exchange companies suggested the establishment of an organization for managing and regulating the foreign exchange market, indicating that the proposed organization be headed by the Prime Minister and comprise representatives of exchange companies and banks operating in Egypt. The organization, which would be supervised by the Central Bank of Egypt, would monitor the situation on the market, propose solutions to crisis and shortages, determine the peak times for buying foreign currencies, particularly US dollars and prevent the emergence of more crises in the future.
He added that it was necessary for the Central Bank to improve supervision and control over the foreign currency market and stop using threats against exchange companies while it followed a policy of full pacification with banks despite their well-known violations.

The minister called for setting exportation targets that could be realized, so as to expand the marketing of Egyptian goods on international markets, affirming that the local market could absorb a large percentage of local products to stop the "importation mania," particularly as Egypt possessed a diverse production base and skilled labour.

Dr Nabila Attiya, Director of Marketing in the World Coding Organization, Egypt Branch, said that the companies in question included 330 foodstuff companies, 64 pharmaceutical companies and 62 companies that operated in other fields.

He revealed that the decision that had been taken by Dr. Youssef Wali to allow the importation of Irish meat after Egypt had ascertained the application of conditions and specifications would double bilateral trade especially as Ireland comes at the top of the world countries in terms of meat exportation to Egypt. Meat imports volume amounted to 70 thousand tons per annum before the issuance of the ban decree.

IKHWANITES SHOCKED AFTER BAR ASSOCIATION ELECTIONS
In consequence, Muslim Brotherhood candidates failed to face the candidates of other political forces and could only achieve good results in Alexandria where four of the group's elements won the elections. The Ikhwanite candidates in Fayoum also failed thus bringing a big loss to the group that could hardly be made up in by the win achieved by their three candidates in Beni Suef especially after two out of three Ikhwanite candidates had failed in Damietta.
23-Abdel-Maksoud pointed out procedural errors that led to such results adding that the Group's alliance with other candidates in some governorates urged other political forces to gather in the face of Ikhwanite lists in such governorates.
25-IKHWAN LIKELY TO CONTEST SHURA COUNCIL ELECTIONS
He said: "Just as we succeeded in securing People's Assembly elections that were held in the second half of last year in an unprecedented way, Shura Council elections will need great efforts and therefore are being prepared for operations that purge criminal hotbeds and combat thuggery and early detect various activities that try to hide behind the elections.
32-Supported by four PA members belonging to the Grouping and Nasserite Parties (Mohamed Al-Badrashini, Hamdein Sabbahi, Al-Badri Farghali and Heidar Baghdadi), the Ikhwanite PA members decided to table urgent inquiries to the government in the PA sittings that will start next Saturday (April 7). They asked that immediate investigations should be made into the statements of the Israeli Ambassador in Cairo that meetings had been held in Cairo between Egyptian agricultural experts and officials and their Israeli counterparts. 33-The PA members asked the government to urgently clarify facts before the PA about what the Israeli Ambassador had announced.
The PA members accused the Israeli Ambassador in particular and the Israeli government in general of trying to drive a wedge between Egypt and the Arab countries, as the Israeli Ambassador's statement was voiced a few hours after the end of the latest Arab summit in Amman.
39-These ideas came to my mind on the heels of the announcement of the Bar Association elections. They had earlier come to my mind after the latest elections of the People's Assembly (PA). At that time, I hesitated to express them because they are sensitive and I doubted whether they would be published or not!
This also reminds us of the years throughout which we did not recognize China and branded it as "Communist," but recognized another small state that we called "national" China.
We permit the foundation of parties that have no popularity and exercise the right of veto against the Ikhwanites.
45-Professional associations were more important than universities. The Ikhwanites also won the elections at the major associations.
47-To ridicule them, some say that the slogan of "Islam is the solution" says nothing. I don't know what do those some mean by that.
49-This came in an article by Dr Said Ismail Ali.
But, they asked him to assure the Egyptian authorities that they had not perpetrated what can be described as violation of the Egyptian laws, which enshrine the freedom of doctrine.
56-Al-Akhbar got manipulation documents in the control sheets of the four previous years. Initial investigations unfolded the genuineness of many of the incidents thus revealing amazing facts, so that what happened may be counted as an unprecedented scandal in Cairo University.

82-It seems that the elite in Egypt don't prefer open places.
Thus, they lack privacy and distinction." 85-The members of the club of the elite number 900 of senior politicians and businessmen.
Therefore, it was astonishing for this club to turn down the membership of famous artists, such as Yosra, an actress, who tried to join the club but failed, Adel Imam, a very famous artist, and others.
88-Regarding food, the rites of eating in the club resemble those of the "Arabian Nights." After choosing the appetizers, drinks and the main dish, the member sits in a luxurious room where all kinds of appetizers are served for him.
The lift, which takes the members up to the club, is a small museum. Its decors are a la the nineteenth century. Its walls take the form of a library on which the covers of books used in the lift's decors appear. Each cover carries the name of one of the club members, inscribed in gold Latin letters.
91-The club, established in 1997 with the participation of two major press institutions in Egypt - Al-Ahram and Al-Akhbar, does not recognize the category of artists because some of them are chased by rumors that are not accepted in the club of the seniors. However, this does not mean that they are banned from entering the club and enjoying it. The club sometimes agrees to grant honorary membership to an artist, who is approved unanimously by the members.
The walls have the same color of the snug chairs. In every corner of the club stands a historic Italian statue that is made of glimmering copper and that stretches its hand with a gold tray full of all kinds of deluxe chocolates.
Hence, the children are allowed to enter the club on Fridays. On these days, the club administration puts the rare works of art in special cabinets away from the reach of children.
Although the area of the club is small from the geographical point of view, the area of secrecy can absorb half of the globe. It is, as we said earlier, the right of each member to sit in the way he likes, to determine the people whom he may see accidentally or even sits alone in a closed room to make a phone call or have moments of contemplation.
100-The seminar raised several issues and elicited a number of viewpoints to face such issues.

121-The company also offered the rebuilding and rehabilitation of the cement lab in Berbera, constructing an asphalt factory, setting up a project for fishing and another for meat and agricultural products' packaging, and establishing a slaughterhouse.
Abraham, born in the Palestinian City of Jaffa, is in the seventh decade of his age. He was an arms dealer in the past. He visited Lebanon during the Israeli sweeping of South Lebanon in 1982. He served in the army with Ariel Sharon and is one of his strong supporters.
125-Therefore, the military and political background of the man raises questions about to what extent his projects are innocent and about the targets of his company in Somaliland, especially as its work revolves around the strategic city of Berbera that overlooks the door to the Red Sea, through which giant oil tankers coming from the Gulf as well as Arab and international trade and tourist ships pass.
129-The new satellite will cost 300-400 million US dollars, which will be mainly financed through US military assistance to Israel, they added. This means that US companies are expected to produce most, and may be all, of the satellite components.
133-"HAMAS" CALLS FOR ELECTING NEW LEADERSHIP TO FACE ISRAEL
135-The Hamas' leading figure asked: "Who has the right to determine the quota of Hamas and give it legitimacy?" To grant Hamas a certain rate of the PLO seats means that the movement will enter into political bargains that it does not accept, he said.
Mashaal urged President Arafat to release the rest of the political detainees in the PNA prisons, particularly in Jericho and Nablus prisons, so that all Palestinians may play their role in eliminating injustice and harm from which the Palestinian people suffer.
141-Talking about economic damage, Al-Aridi said it accounted for $5 billion; six thousand houses had been demolished and 100 thousand fruitful trees had been destroyed. Muslims and Christians alike were prevented from performing their religious rites in Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Beit Jala; the number of the unemployed hit 65% of the working force, while Israeli forces go on shelling Palestinian cities.
However, the list of the wanted did not include any senior officials in the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
Hence, "the treatment" of those figures or some of them would inevitably lead to the reduction of Palestinian violence, as the movement of a group of them would be paralyzed due to assassination, kidnapping or detention, while some others would keep away from trouble when they see Israel's fire approaching them.
149-Asharq Al-Awsat got the details of a draft called the scenario of peaceful solution to Southern Sudan problem. The draft was delivered two days ago to Sudanese President Omar Al-Bashir by Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi.

The Parliament Speaker, Dr. Fatehi Sorour had approved of holding the hearings which would be participated in by Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh, Dr. Mohamed Sayed Tantawi, Pope Shenuda III and Egypt's Mufti, Dr. Nasr Farid Wasil, the ministers of Information, Culture, Youth and Wakfs as well as some specialists to prepare a report to be referred to the Government.
SHEIKH OF AL AZHAR CALLS FOR DISTINGUISHING STRUGGLE FROM TERRORISM

The Government started the implementation of the US directives regarding the amending of academic curricula and controlling mosques so as to exclude what it considers terrorism from religion.
The US also called for sending American missions to Cairo to monitor the purification of religious curricula in Egypt in addition to strictly controlling mosques and religious institutions claimed to be extremists' incubators.
GOVERNMENT DENIED SPONSORING ZAKAT BILL The Egyptian Government has dotted the i's and crossed the t's to put an end to the controversy that enraged Al-Azhar leaderships about a rumor that the Government referred a draft law on collecting Zakat (an obligatory amount of money payable by the well-to-do of Muslims to the poor, ed) to the People's Assembly.
For his part, Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar, Dr. Mohamed Sayyed Tantawi told Al-Ittihad that what had been said by the minister of finance was the best response to that project, as he personally did not accept that project from the very beginning and he would have opposed the idea about the Government undertaking the collection of Zakat itself in an obligatory way. Giving Zakat is a form of worship and it is impermissible for the Government to compel anybody to pay the Zakat. The collection of the Zakat by the Government makes people, especially Copts as they are not obliged to pay it, confused between Zakat and taxes. However, the collection of the Zakat by the Government will made the copts raise doubts about it, Tantawi said.
The Interior Ministry had refused to allow that citizen to travel to Israel. The court emphasized that Pope Shenuda III had issued a decree banning Egyptian Copts from travelling to the Holy places in Jerusalem until Arab Jerusalem is liberated.
EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT MAY FLOAT POUND
Arrangements for an expected meeting of the donor countries next February were the decisive leg of pressure brought to bear on the government and the CBE. to get access to the sum it needed. Egypt has two options - either it completely floats the pound or it lets its rate decrease to the black-market rate and relaxes the administrative grip of monetary authorities on the central rate of the US dollar. In other words, the banks are given a moving margin far from the 3-percent ceiling so that they can not be emptied of foreign exchange. However, the second option appears to be more acceptable up till now.

Although the chairman of the society, Tarek Al Eissa, rejected the American announcement that the society's humanitarian relief branch in Pakistan had been categorized as involved in terrorism and has supplied the press with detailed responses to the claims of the U.S. Department of Justice, everybody knows that the charge of terrorism is easy to throw but it is very difficult to be refuted in the post 11 September 2001 world.

An Islamic source told Al-Hayat that charity action officials in Kuwait "would not mind cooperating to prove being not guilty of any charges. They also appreciated the balanced way the Islamic societies were being treated by the Kuwaiti government under the current conditions. He, however, added, "We have reservations and questions concerning the appropriateness, acceptability or necessity of submitting everything about our society to a non-Kuwaiti body, although we are responsible only to Kuwaiti law." He went on saying, "Would not it be logical for the Americans to level more specific accusations so that they might be replied to by relevant bodies?"

If they choose the latter, their imports will be weighed after payment of customs duty and then sent in sealed packages to the Scales and Stamps Authority at the importers' expense.
In an exclusive to Al-Alam Al-Youm, he said that such a percentage represents customs duties ceiling on imports which is, to a great extent, suitable for protecting domestic industry and ensure equal competition between the domestic product and its imported counterpart.
He went on to say that whatever protection measures are taken, they are temporary ones adding that what we should be after is raising our competitive capabilities and repairing productive disruptions to enable the domestic product to face up to competition challenges vis-à-vis foreign counterparts.

The General Director of Alexandria Maritime Bank, Mamdouh Karam, told Al-Hayat that this means the continuation of the rise of direct investment cost, especially with the retreat of the pound exchange rate against the dollar. That is to say, Karam added, the incoming capital to Egypt faces the difficulty of taking preventive procedures against exchange rates fluctuations. Part of the invested capital should be kept without being transferred to the pound in order that it remains safe, he believes. The government, he continued, started to compensate foreign investors for that through eliminating all restrictions on rights of possessing in addition to granting other privileges concerning tax dealings.
He emphasized that Egypt would never procrastinate the payment of her external debts and what was rumored in that regard had no grounds.

POLITICAL ISLAM IN REVENGE CROSSHAIRS, TARGETS INCLUDE ALGERIA, KUWAIT, LEBANON & EGYPT
But reaching this sort of arrangement was no mean feat. The active presence of Islamists in Algeria began with the constitutional amendment of 1989, which ushered partisan multiplicity. It was the same amendment that allowed the FIS to win the first round of legislative elections, which was held in December 1991 with an overwhelming majority, a coup that triggered the cancellation of elections later. The dazzling success of the Islamists on the Algerian street paved the way for attempts to win firm footing for other Islamic parties, such as the Mahfouz Nihanah's Hams, which joined the government in 1995 and was followed by Lahabib Adami's Al Nahda Movement in 1997, the same year in which the amended parties law was passed to ban the establishment of religious parties.
Maamouni also said, "Democracy required wide and diverse participation by all the parties that are active on the political scene. No party that upholds the law and refrains from outbidding on this nation's principles or exploiting religious or ethnic issues for political purposes should be excluded."
However, public work on the political scene is much better than underground work, and taming these (Islamic) parties and merging them in political life is better than disbanding them and denying them their political rights."
He believes that no policy of an administration, government or country, however strong, can affect the will of the followers of the Islamic movement or bring about a change of heart among these followers. He explained that the Islamic movements he meant were those which were free from extremism and radicalism. "The Islamic movement is apprehensive of the despotism of its own rulers. It is afraid of the revenge of these rulers, not of foreign quarters, for it fears that its rulers will exploit this special situation to undermine the State, democracy and human rights " he pointed out.
He also pointed out that instability and disturbance in some countries were mostly caused by disrespect of such peculiarities, explaining that the 11 September events had demonstrated the importance of handling matters in a moderate manner, so as to deny extremists the pretexts they sought for sheltering and breeding in our Arab and Muslim communities.
Therefore, the future holds promise for Arab peoples and communities, but only if they get the American and European message regarding terrorism and its extensions." The opposite to Dr Ahmad Al Baghdadi's view was expressed by Dr Wael Al Hissawi of Kuwait University, who is also the chief editor of Al Furqan magazine, mouthpiece of the Society for Revival of Islamic Heritage that is considered as the second largest Islamic society in Kuwait.
While Hizbullah is only the biggest of several fundamentalist Islamic parities, its presence on the political scene has upset the balance of political powers in Lebanon and dwarfed all other fundamentalist Islamic movements.
Fundamentalist Islamic movements date back to 1964, when the "Islamic Group" was established in Tripoli, capital of the northern part of Lebanon. In 1972, the Islamic Group established the first military organization, which it called the Mujahideen, for fighting Zionism and its collaborators under the slogan of "true jihad that is free of any fraud or deviation." Sheik Said Sha'ban, leader of the Islamic Group, explained the reasons for establishing the Mujahideen Organization by saying, "We found that the State had turned from an arbitrator among citizens into a biased supporter of one side against the other in the 1970's. We saw the sectarian Christian parties training and arming their members and feeding them hatred against others.
"It may be said that the fixed Islamic principles in Lebanon revolve around the Arab- Israeli conflict. Lebanese Islamic movements do not see a possibility for their isolation from this conflict, as they represent a natural extension of the Islamic groups that fight Israel in Palestine." Egyptian rejection: There are three tabooed Islamic parties in Egypt.
Although I was expecting the situation to change so that the Government's stand on Islamic parties may be altered or at least become more flexible, the September attacks have brought about a completely different situation, and they may even make the Government adopt a firmer stand in its rejection of Islamic parties" He also warned against the continuing denial of political existence of the Islamists and the imposition of more restrictions against them, pointing out that such a situation could lead to undesirable consequences.
He explained that his assessment was based on the Government's copying of some of the terms used on Islamist rhetoric, such as the necessity of discrimination between terrorist actions and political activities, avoidance of random accusations of terrorism and adoption of a fairer view in dealing with the issues of the Muslim World. General view: Dia Rashwan, chief editor of the Religious Status Report, believes that the US Administration deliberately put all political Islamic groups in one basket in its war against terrorism and has widened the circle of suspicion so much that all Islamic movements, moderate and violent alike, are now accused of so-called terrorism. "The 11 September events have planted new obstacles and created more problems for moderate political Islamic groups," he said.
In Moscow it was transmitted that Israel asked the United States to launch its military campaign against Iraq beginning with the Iraqi western provinces. Israel showed willingness to play a role in dealing "accurate strikes" to Iraq and putting "tactics", once worked out against the Palestinians, at the US disposal.
Iraq's insistence on developing mass destruction weapons is considered imminent terrorist threats to the American national security, he said. Regardless of whether Iraq is involved in the September 11th incidents or not, Washington will not hesitate to deal previntive strikes to destroy Iraqi mass destruction weapon programmes, he pointed out.
The Jews-owned Mig News agency, which has large contacts with Israeli high-ranking circles, pointed out that preparations for a "campaign" against Iraq started and research was currently done for a substitute president name among the high commanders of the Iraqi army. Opposition factions are prepared to play a role similar to that of the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan.

There will be a joint security system of the Balkan countries to verify the identity of the applicant for the entry visa. They also will agree among each other upon the granting of entry visas. In case one of the Balkan countries refuses to grant the entry visa to an applicant, other countries will not be allowed to issue a new visa for him.
Salah Eddin Al Gorshi, a Tunisian writer, wrote in Al Hayat: The distance that separates the United States' war against what America dubs as terrorism from slipping into an open cultural and political confrontation with the religious feelings of hundreds of millions of Muslims is now only hair-thin.
Like every victor, the Americans' appreciation of the importance of their allies, or the need to be considerate to them or at least take into account their circumstances and feelings, has declined.
The United States wants to deprive the Palestinian people of its right of legitimate resistance, while it has backed Sharon's policy of genocide and terrorism, which Washington regards as legitimate self-defence.
American military and political leaders do not take into consideration the importance of psychological and historical elements in shaping public opinion and fueling resistance, particularly in the Middle East.
The United States has shed all the values, agreements and even the ideological rhetoric it has followed since its establishment with regard to human rights. It now pursues its enemies in the same manner of a caveman hunting his prey.
There is no doubt that this education needs a comprehensive review of its programs, curricula, objectives, means of communication and priority, given its backwardness as compared to the education provided by Christian religious education institutions, for instance.
The problem is not in the text; it is in reading it and practicing what it preaches.
Both of them belong to different schools that rarely agree, and the Taliban Movement is an exception in this regard.
The two parties found that globalization and the war were two faces of the same coin and were fueled by the same logic and aimed at achieving the same interests.
While the events of 11 September 2001 shook the whole world and changed its history or, to quote the Economist, 11 September was "The day that changed the world," these events left behind many results. These results, some of which have already been confirmed while the rest are on their way to crystallization, include the following: -	It has been confirmed that the alternate enemy of the West is Islamic fundamentalism in its violent aspect, or what Fukoyama dubbed the neo-fascists. The definition of the enemy can be broadened in the future to include Islam itself, depending on the reactions of Muslim countries. So far, Muslim countries are divided over the inevitability of confrontation. Most of the people on the Muslim street support Osama Bin Laden and his colleagues, as shown by opinion polls.
-	There is a Western agenda for adopting a policy of "containment" instead of "clashing," as the West stands to lose in any clash, even if comes out victor militarily. Western societies are advanced and rich, while Muslim communities are backward, hungry and needy. The losing party in any confrontation is the richer and more advanced one.
Humanity will be back to square one, this time as a result of the setback of radical Islamic groups and their cancellation of ten centuries of human development.
Why do they hate us?
Can a small group control a whole country under conditions of almost complete absence of the role of the individual there?
There is another scenario about the alliance of the leaders of these Muslim countries with the United States and the West for elimination of Islamic fundamentalism for good. Under this scenario, the leaders of the Muslim countries in question will receive the American reward of leaving them on their seats of power, looting their countries and depriving their peoples of their natural rights to democracy and freedom, which would lead to more backwardness, corruption and oppression in the Muslim world. If this happens, the chasm between the Muslim world and the advanced world will become wider and wider, and the Muslim countries will eventually fall down like autumn leaves as a result of their backwardness.

He went on, saying, "The martyrdom operations in Haifa and Jerusalem came at a deadly time for Arab States. This stage does not require expression of emotions; what it needs is extreme caution."
Egyptian insurance companies started the new year with asking the government to solve a main problem they were involved in during 2000.

Egypt had called for several initiatives to bolster cooperation between the COMESA countries. Last year, it played host to the coordination meeting of the COMESA countries over the World Trade Organization issues.
On the other hand, Egyptian imports also increased during the same period from $137.18 million in 1997 to $186.75 million in 2000. This led to an increase in trade balance deficit not in favour of Egypt from $101.17 million in 19997 to $139.13 million in 2000.
Consequently, any comparison between the returns gained by Egypt and the costs it incurred as a result of its membership in the COMESA must reach the conclusion that no economic returns were gained by Egypt. The only acceptable excuse perhaps was that the Nile Basin countries are considered members in the COMESA, which lends political rather than economic significance to its membership.
The committee's meetings, which lasted for two days, were cochaired by Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr Yousef Boutros Ghali and Iraqi Minister of Trade Dr Mohamed Mahdi Saleh.
In the field of housing, the committee agreed on launching joint projects for building low-cost housing and roads and maintaining bridges.

The government reviewed the bill on a weekly basis with Washington and on a bimonthly basis with the Security Council after the two parties had asked all countries particularly the European ones to draft an anti-money laundering law to fight religious extremism and drug and arms trade within 3 months since 15 September last.
The deputies asked that bill be confined to drug trade, which causes many serious economic problems in the countries accommodating its money and activities.

ISRAEL DEMANDS INTERNATIONAL FORCES TO LIQUIDATE PALESTINIAN ORGANIZATIONS
Arafat, however, asked for a 10- day period of grace to pursue those organizations.
IRAN'S POTENTIAL ROLE IN HITTING IRAQ
Thus, the question of hitting Iraq has become only a matter of time, rather than principle.
By adopting the 1382 resolution, the warning has taken an international feature in one form or another, with a time limit until early June, 2002.
The US public opinion seems to become now ready to accept casualties among its forces, inasmuch as the aim is to eradicate terrorism and preclude the recurrence of the September 11 events.
Iran can play this role through supporting Iraq's Shiite opposition forces, who will march towards Baghdad from the southern part, attending the advance of Kurdish opposition forces towards the capital from the northern part.
It is known that Kurds' affairs are sensitive to Turkey.
After all, will Arabs stand idle?
Under this headline, Saudi writer Khalid Al-Dekheil wrote an article, some excerpts of which run to the following effect: Last week's events in the region have confirmed what was suspected for years, i.e. that the peace process was just a manoeuvre, or just a ridiculous lie imposed by the Americans on the region to serve their own purposes in the first place.
I don't think I would be adding anything new if I described the peace process as the big lie.
Secondly, the peace process is a mere lie because it lacks any binding legal referentiality.
Anything else would, consequently, be of no importance.
On the other hand, occupation, land sequestration, house demolition, daily murdering of innocent civilians and the displacement policy for the sake of constructing further settlements cannot be described as violent or terrorist operations in the conventional sense of the term.
It is a sort of open-ended talks, which might have no end just as Israel wants it to be.
What is important is to reach temporary agreements that maintain stability, and arrangements and recommendations to create the appropriate framework for sitting at the negotiation table.
This implies that any other means of setting up that state would render it illegitimate in the eyes of the Americans and the British.
This used to take place in the recent past.
If that was how the President of the prospective Palestinian state, where then is that peace process much talked about?
Nor should this be surprising to us as terrorism has now turned into an ideology.
We may thus jump to the conclusion that the Arab countries lack one of the most prerequisites of statehood - ideology and the ability to promote it.
ABRAHA ABANDONS HIS ELEPHANT OF PROPHET'S ERA, GOES BACK TO MECCA ON CRUISE MISSILE
Since the September incidents, the campaign in American media has escalated to levels that alarmed the Saudi Royal Family, making some of its prominent leaders feel concerned about the Saudi regime itself.
To achieve this goal, the American media have focused on dissection of the government system in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf States, describing it as a fascist, uncivilized system because it is built on religion, morals and norms.
The Saudi Royal Family saw the campaign as targeting not Saudis as individuals, but the Saudi system as a whole.
Many people wonder about the secrets behind America's turning against its ally, Saudi Arabia, particularly after a decade of privileged relations that looked so strong that they could not be shaken by a measly media campaign.
We must take into account that this particular American war depends mainly on money, as the US Administration, which threw itself into a military adventure, depends on Afghan bandits and mercenaries for fighting its dirty war in Afghanistan against the Taliban and Al Qaeda Organization and has allocated gigantic amounts for that purpose.
This way, we can understand the sudden hostility to the Saudi Royal Family and expect what the US Administration can do to protect its interests and insure the continuous flow of Arab money into its coffers and those of the Zionist entity, which has been taking Arab money by the handful to finance its destructive projects against Islam and Muslims.
This animosity continues to control the way of thinking and behaviour of many American officials, particularly under the new Administration that has surrounded itself with a large number of extremist fundamentalists, who apparently want to settle old scores with the Arab and Muslims Worlds and seek to erase Arab and Islamic presence from the whole Western World.
However, what is more bizarre is that the US Administration does not even bat an eye when it makes such demands from a country that is supposed to be an independent, sovereign state, for its close relationship with the Saudi Royal Family, particularly since the Gulf War, has given it a sort of self-confidence and an unbearable arrogance that make it believe that it can just order the Saudis around and the only thing that the Saudis can do is say yes to their masters!
KHATAMI WARNS AGAINST APATHY AT UNIVERSITIES: AVOIDANCE OF POLITICS MAY LEAD TO EXPLOSION!

Washington called upon some countries concerned to secretly help it topple the Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's regime so that Iraq could be spared the danger of controversial military strike. Reports also pointed out that Washington was considering delaying the major military strike against Iraq at present after it had received warnings from Egypt, Saudi Arabia and some other European and foreign countries that cast doubt on the American pieces of evidence against Iraq.
We have to take note of a very important point here: this is exactly what Ariel Sharon is doing in the West Bank and Ghaza Strip at present.
The actions against Hamas, Jihad and Hizbullah are only a practical expression of this approach. Efforts must be exerted for altering the "regional ideological order," so to speak, in the Arab region, for the United States has discovered that some school curricula and media programs, particularly in Pakistan and some Arab countries, had been instrumental in what the Americans now call "breeding terrorists."
-	But all this must be preceded by total military victory over extremist political Islam.
The overwhelming success of the American military campaign against Afghanistan will encourage the United States to go ahead and spread the "Pax Americana" all over the rest of the region.
Among the main prime movers of such an alliance will be Arab nationalism, which several Western thinkers have warned against its revival if the United States and Israel miscalculated, plus, of course, radical Muslim forces.
What is more is that if the United States makes a mistake in ,first, dealing with the Arab world "piecemeal," or as fragmented tribes rather than a whole Arab nation that has a vast historical background and an ancient cultural role , second, in creating a set of ruling elite groups whose main mission would be to facilitate the consumption of American goods by the rich among their peoples and, third, in imposing an unfair settlement on the Palestinians to appease Israel, this sort of blunder will make the option of suicidal attacks extremely attractive to several groups in Arab communities.
This will most likely happen in 2002, but the end of the Cold War in this region may trigger ferocious wars that will never end if the West underestimates the importance of the Arabs' national and social grievances.
In reply to media men questions, he said if Egypt decided to take such a decision, she would announce that herself without waiting for others to do that.

EGYPT, SAUDI ARABIA SIGN MEMORANDUM OF COOPERATION FOR BOOSTING ECONOMIC RELATIONS
MFA, Asharq Al Awsat, 7/1/2002
The Egyptians ascribed their complaint to the fact that Saudi Arabian exports to Egyptian, amount to about ten fold that of Egypt to Saudi Arabi, according to the Egyptian Chambers of Commerce Head, Khalid Abu-Ismail and to the continuation of the ban imposed on the Egyptian potato for 17 months due to a news item published in an Egyptian paper which was given the lie at the time.

Commenting on that issue, Egyptian embassy charge d'affaires in Tel Aviv, Ihab Al-Sherif said, "This is a purely legal matter.

Therefore, there should be methods that can guarantee a partial judicial oversight and continuation of judicial activities at the same time.
They said that they would form a control front to oversee what will take place on the ground in the local council voting, adding that they would interrogate the government if any rigging operations took place. The government's reluctance to supervise the electoral process may be due to a government plan to rig elections in favor of ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) candidates, especially as the government was gripped in panic over the successful judicial surveillance experiment in the recent parliamentary elections, in which Muslim Brotherhood members, independents and over 200 independents, who were axed from the NDP but forced to return to it following their win in the recent voting to maintain a sweeping majority, won parliamentary seats.

MT / Afaq Arabia, 10/1/2002
We are responsible - there is no doubt about that - for a great part of the defamation, distortion and falsification that have been done to our religion, national spirit and identity, and I believe that the current situation warrants the following observation: First: It is time for us to think of the future with an approach that is different from the one we have used in the past and better than the one we are using at present. The world has changed, and what was possible yesterday is not acceptable today. Similarly, what was impossible before the 11 September 2001 events is now possible. Wise nations and peoples that are aware of the world around them are the ones that are now reviewing their policies, adjusting their positions and renewing their way of thinking, not the ones that are disabled and are standing "with their hands tied," to quote Prince Abdullah's speech, which is a turning point in the current Arab way of thinking by all measures.
Fifth: Political corruption and economic backwardness are the legitimate parents of terrorism, that hideous enemy which has targeted man everywhere forever. The absence of a clear view, the haziness of vision, the proliferation of corruption and the poor political representation of the Arab street are all tributaries that pour their waters into a big river where ships of violence are sailing at full steam ahead without any lifeboats onboard or in sight.
Eighth: Facing terrorism locally and uprooting it internationally and eliminating its causes in every Arab and Muslim country are an urgent requirement under the current conditions, for it is better done by us than by the United States. The Yemeni President has discreetly and intelligently played such a role to spare his country the consequences of falling victim to an outside attack. Egypt has also been engaged for two decades in an internecine war against ferocious terrorism, paying dearly in its children's blood and its national economy, so that it may remain capable of maintaining stability and forging ahead towards its objectives and the aspirations of its people.
THE ARGENTINEAN WAY!
In actual fact, the Egyptian people has divorced the Government, the parties and the press for good and no longer wants to count on anybody but itself. It has apparently decided to take its destiny in its own hands and to take its rights and freedom by force and beat the repressive government the checkmate way in chess!
Al-Arabi Chief Editor Adbullah al-Sinawi writes his back page column Black and White, which runs to the following effect only in part: We won't have to consult fortune-tellers to ascertain that the year 2002 will be worse than 2001 and that 2003 will be worse than the two years that preceded it, and so on and so forth from worse to the worst!
Failure and ruin addicts keep on giving us lessons. The more failure they are soaked in , the more brilliant their chances of promotion seem!
It servise us well as that democratic margin will remain limited till we learn the virtue of freedom that must be taken by force rather than received as a gift. We also deserve to have such weak beleaguered parties!
Try, while you are about it, to ponder the meaning of popular, almost complete disability to support the Palestinian uprising. It seems that impotance of peoples is a disease that is automatically contracted from impotent governments!

The ruling party will voice its views on the question of amendments once relevant deliberations and discussions are over. They will be then sent to other political forces or a national committee for looking into constitutional changes, Omar added.
They also called for paying more attention to national industry and lifting the additional burdens imposed on national products.
Dr Higazi went on, saying, "If we look at measures that were adopted by the Government to control the economic performance, we will see that they were lacking. The Government's policy for handling the shortage of US dollars has also led to a rapid drain of foreign exchange reserves that brought the Central Bank's reserves down from $ 22 billion to $ 14.6 billion. As a result of its failure in managing the dollar crisis and its feeling that the public opposed its policies, the Government pumped foreign exchange reserves into the market. It has withdrawn Egypt's share from the IMF and the Arab Monetary Fund.
Mohammad Farid Khamis, Chairman of the Shura Council's Industry Committee and prominent businessman, indicated that the main reason for the stagnation of exports was that Egyptian industry was incapable of competing with its counterparts in other countries, as Egyptian productive units were small in size and production costs in Egypt were much higher than the costs of production in foreign countries. "Egyptian industry is also burdened with taxes, customs duty and costs of importation of raw materials," he said. "Industrial countries, on the other hand, have large production bases, which lower production costs, while their industries do not carry heavy burdens like those impeding our industry. Suffice it to say that I alone sustained losses totaling two hundred million pounds due to the instability of exchange rates.
He continued, saying, "We, businessmen, call on the Government to plan well for Egyptian industry by lifting the burdens that impede the industry's ability to forge ahead with production of different goods, so that we may acquire a competitive advantage that would place us in a better standing among world countries. This policy is different from modernization. It complements modernization, and it is necessary for boosting productivity, which will impact on Egyptian economy as a whole."
It is unbelievable that at the time when our exports to Europe represent 41% of our total exports that we still deal in US dollars only." "As to investors," he added, "they should improve the quality of their products, show punctuality, use better packaging materials and pay more attention to examination of foreign markets, either by themselves or through the help of Egyptian commercial representation offices abroad." Dr Samir Tobar, former chairman of the National Democratic Party's Economic Committee, said, "The Egyptian economy has been suffering from a cash shortage and a state of recession for two years, and the dollar's exchange rate should not have been hiked in such an exaggerated manner just because the country was affected by the events. This is a mistake that has cost the country six and a half billion pounds as a result of the difference between the old and new exchange rates of the dollar.
He also called for creating export industries that would revitalize the market, increase incomes and improve the quality of local products.
A crisis emerged in the way of the implementation of measures to convert economic bodies into companies because the Ministry of Finance insisted on getting back the proceeds of the government-owned assets with those bodies. This was, however, objected to by most economic bodies on the pretext that the government used to get the proceeds of such bodies throughout the previous years.
In a bid to put an end to such differences, it has been decided that a committee be constituted from the two ministers to take stock of the airports assets and to determine the volume of the government expenditure on their infrastructure and to create alternatives to repay the value to be agreed upon.
A report prepared by the sector on the performance of the export sector said that Egypt possesses enormous capabilities that enable it to expand its exports while some countries have less natural resources and policies that hardly differ from those adopted by Egypt but could raise the level of relative importance of exportation. He pointed out that exports in Egypt represent only 4% of the GDP, which is a low rate that goes down to 2% if we exclude exports that do not produce direct revenues to the private sector like petroleum.
Within the framework of the financial policy, the report uncovered the Egyptian government efforts to increase the budget resources through levying taxes thus loading the Egyptian producer with heavy burdens in the form of extra duties, thus increasing the cost of the export-oriented product.
The deficit in trade balance hit LE24.5 billion during the period from January to September 2001, LE11.6 billion up compared to the same period of the previous year.

ALGERIA: A READING IN THE NEW YEAR'S FORECASTS
Despite the significance of the call to the referendum on a new constitution, it does not claim the same public interest as the date of the forthcoming parliamentary and local government elections, which are no less important than those whose results were annulled in 1991, dragging the whole country into a quagmire of violence in which blood and tears mingled together. The 2002 elections will be an indication that Algeria has recovered its political health and stability, which it has started to get back since Bouteflika assumed power as president of the country.
Although the party contains an elite set, most of which were leaders of the Liberation Front and won the elections after defeating everybody else, the current behaviour of the party leaders indicates that they may not lose much sleep if they went down to second place. There has been some talk backstage that the National Grouping Party has made a deal with the Liberation Front Party for forming a coalition government.

Arrangements for an expected meeting of the donor countries next February were the decisive leg of pressure brought to bear on the government and the CBE. to get access to the sum it needed. Egypt has two options - either it completely floats the pound or it lets its rate decrease to the black-market rate and relaxes the administrative grip of monetary authorities on the central rate of the US dollar. In other words, the banks are given a moving margin far from the 3-percent ceiling so that they can not be emptied of foreign exchange. However, the second option appears to be more acceptable up till now.
The report prepared by Shura Council's Economic and Financial Committee pinpointed the decline in foreign reserve in Egypt by almost 50% during 5 years. It went down from about $22.5 billion to $12 billion.

Al-Mussawar, a weekly magazine, dialogues with Arab League (AL) Secretary General Amr Moussa. Excerpts run to the following effect: 	If the US severs its contacts with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), they should not deal with it because, this way, the US will not be totally fit for playing the role of a mediator or a sponsor of peace, Moussa says.
This absolute bias to Israel and giving it all that it wants is a political formula that destroys the interests of all parties in the Arab region, Moussa says.
In light of the current conditions, it is not allowed to return to the negotiating table because all that Israel wants is a security agreement, Moussa says. Any talk about negotiations is a kind of political deception only.
"Simply, I compare what is going on to a factory that produces violence, murder and destruction and this factory is supported by the Americans, who provide weapons as well as moral and material support. They want one result - the Palestinian, or rather, the Arab surrender.

In the ill-fated Alexandria conference, which was held almost secretly when it was finally made public, it denounced resistance acts, ignoring Zionists' crimes turning a deaf ear to Israeli shelling of the hearts of the occupied land and winking at the fact that martyrs' corpses are being dismembered, houses are being demolished and an entire people are being exposed to genocide and displacement.
Sheikh Al-Zifzaf started with denying reports about his attendance and then withdrawal. He emphasized that he had not been to Alexandria adding that only Dr. Tantawi and Dr. Ali Assaman attended the conference.
He wondered what real motives spurred such acts.
By the same token, came the voice of Dr. Yehya Ismail Habloush, secretary general of Al-Azhar Scholars Front, who doubles as professor in Al-Azhar, bewailing the Arabs' fortunes and enumerating the disadvantages of the ill-fated conference such as investing a tinge of false legitimacy with the Jews' acts in the holy land and Al-Aqsa Mosque.

ISRAEL'S PROPHECY OF ARMED "TRIPARTITE MILITARY PROJECT"
The Hebrew State has not stopped at opening the Israeli-Syrian front, it has also deliberately dragged Iran into the immediate arena of the Arab-Israeli conflict, setting Teheran up as a target for the probable military confrontations that could result from the story of the Karen A, which was allegedly caught in the Red Sea.
Strategic experts in the region rule out the emergence of such alliance, at least for the time being, because of the myriad political and ideological differences among the three countries that are claimed to be planning for this step by Israel.
He continued, saying, "The possibility does exist that Syria and Iran may coordinate their responses if either party faces a danger or threat from Israel, particularly as both countries sees its relationship with Tel Aviv threatening to go downhill every day and expects treachery and attack from Israel every hour. Therefore, it would be better if there is military and logistical coordination and cooperation, but relations would not reach the degree of alliance at this stage. It is also possible that Lebanon and Hezbollah join this coordination, on the grounds that the latter represents a strong leverage that both Syria and Iran could use against Israel at the right time. Through Hezbollah operations, Damascus can alleviate the persistent Israeli pressures and threats.
The newspaper quoted well-informed sources in Washington that the US had assured Israel that it would be invited to the Tokyo-based conference and that the US would support any decision taken by Israel concerning the formation of its delegation in the conference.

The Muslim world will not desert Syria if attacked by the United States, Iran's Minister of Defence Admiral Ali Shamkhani said, noting that if the US attacked Syria, it would frankly mean the launching of a crusade against the Muslim world.
Queried if it is still calling for hammering out common defence deals with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, Admiral Shamkhani said according to Iran's security policy, a common cooperation point and vision should be reached so these countries should shoulder the responsibility of safeguarding security and stability in the Gulf. Urging for a confidence build-up and reinforced military cooperative ties between Iran and countries in the region, the Iranian minister said such relations will not be at the expense of other countries.
Iran experienced hardships in the Taliban's tenure, a thing which dismisses any reported Iranian cooperation with those members or reports on giving them access to the Iranian territories, he added. Asked if the Iraqi foreign minister's ongoing visit to Iran means burying the hatchet and turning over a new chapter of Iran-Iraq bonds, Shamkhani said his country seeks to secure permanent stability and security and achieve peace in the region. However, he criticized Iraq for taking no earnest initiative in this respect.
MT / Al-Quds Al-Arabi 28/1/2002
Unlike what was announced by the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Iranian sources pointed out that resumption of air flights between the two countries for transporting Iranians willing to visit the Shiite holy sites in Iraq was frozen because Iran had received strong indications from the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan during his recent visit to the Iranian capital to the effect that the international organization will not welcome such a move.
The Shura Council elections of the Islamic Action Front, the political wing of the group, had witnessed some sort of change under the pressure of the party rules, which criticised the leadership refrained from participating in politics after it had boycotted the 1997 elections.

Arafat's article also sends another message, not less dangerous, to Washington.
However, the USA will put more pressure to put such a compromise into effect regardless of the UN Resolution no. 194.

The Russian official called upon the Iraqi leadership to adopt a more rational and balanced policy and avoid provoking America.
HAH, Asharq Al-Awsat, 2/2/2002
Does the ruling regime in Baghdad deserve attack, or does it represent an Iraqi will and is a symbol of Iraqi sovereignty?
They could actually reach logical assessments that support the possibility of the attack, as well as other assessments that America does not intend to hit Iraq but only wants to contain and deter the three countries through threat.
Other solutions for saving the country from the American attack and from the continuity of President Saddam's regime include a popular revolution, a coup d'etat or an Arab storming of Iraq under the auspices of the Arab League for preserving the country's unity and independence and the lives and livelihood of its people.
No Arab should rely on the predictions that the United States will have to send in ground troops to get rid of the Iraqi ruling regime, at which stage the U.S. Marines will be routed and finished off to a man. It is true that the Iraqi Army would be fighting from another perspective when it defends its own soil, so it would not run away from battle as it did in Kuwait. However, there is nothing that could force Washington to send in ground troops on the other hand, and the United States may be content to annihilate Iraqi troops and destroy Iraqi institutions from the air, so that the ruling regime may fall one way or another.
So far, the Iraqi regime has used chemical agents against the Kurds among its own people and the troops of its Muslim neighbour, Iran, during the Iran-Iraq War.
AMERICAN INSISTENCE ON DISMANTLING HEZBOLLAH'S MILITARY WING
He added, "Even if the party laid down arms, and devoted itself to political and social action, this would not relieve it of settling the old accounts." The Lebanese are now in doubt regarding Washington's tendency to take revenge on Lebanon under the pretext of terrorism-combatting. It might even give the green light to Israel to launch a proxy war especially as America and Tel Aviv are totally agreed on the idea that it was Hezbollah who triggered the Intifada and is largely responsible for the currently flaring up war in Palestine and is the master mind of suicidal operations inside 1948 territories due to its long experience gained in South Lebanon. It has also a long military arm that can be employed at any time against the interests of America and Israel in the region and the world.
He thought that Bush "is suffering an inferiority complex as he stepped to power after a judiciary conflict. What he aims at by levelling terrorism accusations is getting the support of the Zionist lobby in America and covering up for his deteriorating economy".
He added, "Resistance will remain resistance even if America calls it terrorism and Israel will remain terrorist even though America entitled it to fight".
STRANGE AMERICAN PROJECT TO CONTROL CHARITY DONATIONS IN ARAB COUNTRIES

Abul-Oyoon added " We admit to an economic problem, which is not as severe as the Argentinian one. In the first half of 2000, all international institutions were certain that the Argentinian economy would suffer a painful fate.
He pointed out that the uncontrollability of the dollar exchange rate increased due to the demand, which grew during the current period thanks to the start of the businessmen importation season and Hadj and Umra season. Abul-Oyoon dismissed as untrue reports to the effect that the number of Hadjis would be reduced during the coming years, which increased currency demand.
Abul-Oyoon affirmed that in spite of these negative impacts, the Egyptian economy managed to reduce the total foreign debts from 28.2 billion dollars in late June 1999 to 27.9 billion dollars in late June 2000. The debts went down to 26.1 billion dollars in late June 2001 due to Egypt's punctual payment of all foreign debts, which was made even before maturity date.

Councilor Ma'moun al-Hudhibi, the group's Vice-General Guide and Spokesman, said that the second and third rounds of the 2000 People's Assembly elections and Shura Council voting farces and then the recent change in the local administration law, which banned any judicial supervision over the local elections, as well as recent security actions against the group members, prove that there would not be any so-called local council elections.

Some, nevertheless, differ over the government safety but what matters is safety as tourists see it. The Takfeer and Hejrah (Heresy and Exodus) group holds the government as apostate and brand other Islamic groups of being heretics. Some even hold everybody else including the Takfeer and Hejrah group as infidels. Tourists have no idea about such differences and are quite helpless before them. That's why their concept of safety should be what matters, in the first place.

A Realistic Vision: Under this "Realistic Vision", the historic leaders said in their research, "It is utterly wrong to take attitudes and give religious opinions without regard to reality and the evidence cited from the holy Koran and the Prophet tradition or any other established source of religious legislation.

Such bloodshed, and wasted funds are to the benefit of the enemies of the faith and the country.
THE EVIL AXIS!
Although Bush talked about thousands of dangerous killers and professional criminals who often received support from illegal ruling regimes, the three countries mentioned in Bush's address had nothing to do with the September 11th incidents as already admitted by American government itself.
To quote Bush's words, those countries as well as their terrorist allies constitute the "Evil Axis" and get arms just to jeopardize international peace!
The new American definition of terrorism, thus, becomes: any activity or attitude that fails to run parallel with the USA's vision of the world.
A diplomatic action is being launched in some Arab milieus to encourage the USA to establish the Palestinian state on the basis of resolutions 242 and 338 in return for passing an Arab summit resolution supporting Israel's security.

Al-Kherisha said, "There have been Palestinian-Israeli contacts in Tulkarm as the citizens' grievances were conveyed to the Israeli army which admitted to its soldiers perpetrating thefts of the Palestinian money. It also returned some effects which had been stolen such as mobiles.
Picking up the line of the joke, Knesset member Abraham Shohat (Labour) suggested that tourists be issued with helmets and bulletproof vests, while his colleague Abshlom Vilan (Mertz), a veteran of the Israeli Defence Forces General Staff, countered with, "And I will volunteer for training the tourists on hand-to-hand combat, ambushes and explosive devices."
MFA, Al Ittihad, 6/2/2002
He described the attempt as a feeler of the willingness of Palestinians and Muslims in general to open Al Rahma Gate, which has been closed since the days of Omar Bin Al Khattab, particularly as the Jews believe that opening that gate meant that they would be able to build their alleged temple. He also indicated that such attempts were frequent and were part of the violations that were committed on almost daily basis against Al Aqsa Mosque and Islamic sanctums in Occupied Jerusalem.
Arab diplomatic sources said that the chain of allusions made by Egypt in the last few days were aimed at urging President Yasser Arafat to take "realistic, articulate and brave stances to restore relations between the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and the American Administration so as to deprive Ariel Sharon of the pretexts he used as excuses for maintaining his war against the PNA and avoiding the return to the negotiating table." The sources observed that President Hosni Mubarak, who called upon the PNA on February 4th to "do their best to stop violence," had criticized on February 5th the way of "missing chances" to end the Arab- Israeli conflict. Mubarak said that the volume of Israeli settlements were limited when the framework of Palestinian solution was laid down within the context of Camp David Accords.
On February 5th, Arafat was handed over a message from Mubarak carried by the Egyptian chief of Intelligence, Major General Omar Soliman.
Leader of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), Sheikh Ahmed Yassin said that the current situation of the Palestinian people makes it incumbent upon all including Hamas, Jihad, and others to stand by the Palestinian Authority with all their potential in the face of the Israeli aggression and close up ranks. In an interview with Al-Ahram, Sheikh Yassin said it was the PLO that would determine who would succeed Palestinian President Yasser Arafat. Hamas did not clash with the PLO in the beginning and would not do so in the end as Hamas strategy is based on the prohibition of shedding Palestinian blood, he said.
The military action, he added, is assigned to the military wing of each faction and there is no coordination due to the fact that Israel wants to liquidate the resistance. " We, therefore, have to work under the ground so that the military wings may not be in a vulnerable position before Israel" In a reply to reports carried by some Palestinians to the effect that the martyrdom operations within the Green Line harmed the Palestinian cause, Hamas leader said that the martyrdom operations were like the F- 16 aircraft for the Palestinians.
This does not mean that fight is not obligatory to all for if a country has one million soldiers, it does not send them all to war in one fell swoop" Hamas and Israel Speaking about reports to the effect that Israel helped Hamas and supplied it with arms at the beginning of the movement, Sheikh Yassin said, " If an imperfect person speaks ill of me, therefore it is a testimony that I am perfect".
If this country has honest people, then we are the most honest people". Israel can never buy Hamas with its money, threats, or temptations.
The Palestinian people have no other option but to resist and struggle to put an end to the Israeli aggression and occupation, he added.
Abdel Wahab Badrakhan wrote:
The most serious aspect of the war in Afghanistan is that it has shown Washington that it has no need for allies and that all it needs is services that it does not want to render itself and facilities that the others would not hold back, be they NATO allies or those who are nominated or aspiring to be allies.
Israel is not interested only in grabbing a few more yards of Palestinian land, but it is also concerned with participating in the arrangement of the regional scene very far from its turf.
So long as the stakes are now high, the weaker enemy must be finished off, or at least shackled and left without any ability to make a nuisance of itself.
So long as Arafat has admitted that there are "terrorists" within the area of jurisdiction of his authority, he has to act to put an end to their activities. Both Israel and the United States understand this issue only from the Israeli perspective, i.e. the Palestinians must be killed and erased from the face of the earth.
This is the "truce" that the Palestinian Authority is supposed to grab, so that it may dismantle the cells of the "lesser terrorism" while the Israelis and the Americans will be busy liquidating the "axis of evil" by settling the old scores with Iraq and Iran.
Speaking at a seminar at Zayyed Centre for Coordination and Monitoring, in Abu Dhabi yesterday evening, Al-Nuaimy said that what US President George Bush said about the axis of evil was a major diplomatic gaffe, adding that Iran has recently adopted a cooperative, anti-terrorism policy. The Emirian Minister called for tackling problems without categorizing "states", pointing out that there are differences as far as policies of states are concerned, but such differences don't justify dubbing states as evil or devilish.

It might be mentioned that Adam had told Al-Alam Al-Youm that Egypt desired to extend the modernization programme span for another additional period ranging between 4 and 5 years as the programme had just started and the allocated funds could not be actually expended during the remaining period.
Bayoumi adds that he does not imagine that the EU had to be reassured by the Egyptian Government that it will provide its contribution to the programme. The financial agreement signed by the Government and ratified by the People's Assembly includes such commitment which makes any new more superfluous because the programme has become tantamount to Egyptian legislation for modernizing industry.

Iranian Armed Forces Chief of Staff, Gen. Fairouz Abadi described the US president stances as being similar to those of the Nazi. Meanwhile, Iranian Revolution Guard Commander, Maj. Gen. Rahim Safawi threatened the American Administration with a severe response in case of attacking Iran.
In an indirect accusation against Pakistan, the committee, nevertheless, accused some neighbouring countries and espionage bodies of being involved in pushing persons to cross the Iranian borders.
There is a great exaggeration in expecting an imminent US offensive against Iran, as there are limits to such American rashness.
The issue, nevertheless, is beyond Al-Qaeda. In a nutshell, the US sees that the independent Iranian decision is the big obstacle faced by the current American hegemony policy in the Middle East. Such Iranian role will gain growing importance with regard to the American intention to strike Iraq and cut it down to size. In other words, this may be considered a development of the double-containment policy drawn up in the era of former US president Bill Clinton. The US wants to change such policy into a "double-undermining" policy for Iran and Iraq. The aim behind all this is to ensure the security of Israel, which currently considers Iran the greatest threat to its existence and hegemony in the region.
IRAN...DDECLARING WAR
We do not know Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's competence limits, neither do we know if he can set Iran's foreign policy through his reform and opening platform, which calls for improving Iran's relations with all countries in the world, especially the neighbors. However, it clearly appears that Iranian cards are regrettably scattered among several parties, with statesmen's duties going confused with religious scholars and borders between the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Revolution Guard disappearing. We can not know who the spokesman for the Islamic Republic of Iran is with whom we should deal, whom we should believe, whom we should neglect and what Iran's genuine official position on the Gulf countries is.

MT / Asharq Al-Awsat, 12/2/2002
The contacts held by Cairo with the American Administration pointed out the gravity of targeting any Arab or Islamic country as part of what Washington called "the Axis of Evil" especially as such accusations have long been expedited by other parties - Israel and its supporting groups thus seeking to expand the confrontation range since the September 11th incidents and started levelling such charges even before the results of the investigations conducted by American bodies came out.
In statements to media men in Cairo yesterday, Maher said that it was not enough on the part of Washington to reject Israeli premier's ideas. He asked America to take measures that would help the peace process emphasizing the importance that Washington should contribute to pressuring the Israeli government to stop its aggression against the Palestinians.

PARLIAMENTARY REPORT WARNS OF SPREADING EXTREMISM AND WEAKNESS OF PARTIES AND RELIGIOUS ESTABLISHMENTS
"Apathy and abstention from involvement in political life and parliamentary elections are due to the fact that Egyptians feel that the individual is not a party to the political arena," the report argued. These circumstances pose a serious menace to the future of democracy in the country, it alarmed.
A binary relative list and individual system may be put in place.
Finally bloodshed and terrorism came to a stop after long years of intellectual lethargy that cost the state billions of pounds in tourism and economic losses as a result of an exodus of investments under the pretext of Egypt's instability, let alone the lives lost on both parties- the group and the police and government members or the imprisonment and detentions suffered by the group.
They believed there are negative points but failed to point out what role it would take up. It is, therefore, an incomplete vision as such efforts, though partially treating certain issues inside an Islamic organization, stopped short of yielding any fruitful results for future generations in light of a corrupt undemocratic political climate which was a potential source of new violence whirlpools with other groups that could be non Islamic. The state would not defuse the crisis by putting an end to corruption and moral degeneration. Neither will the state uproot the origin of the problem represented in the regime's various structures.
Dr. Gamal Habib, who spent years in prison for membership in the Jihad organization and who is closely related with the Islamic group on the one hand and with Abboud Al Zumor on the other, says: Abboud Al Zumor has not rejected the initiative as far as I am concerned.

Islamic writer and thinker Fahmi Heweidi commented on this by saying: "There are two factors, one of them is basic, the authorities have enabled police officers to talk and negotiate with Islamic groups. If the latter succeeded, this would not mean permanent success. It is only temporary as the state's vision has undergone no change. Neither did it grant further guarantees nor freedoms.

Palestinian students participated in the demonstration, which took place on the Faculty of Arts campus, for the first time since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
The Kuwaiti National Student Union, which is controlled by the Islamists, organized the demonstration. Its chairman, Tarek Al Kundori, told reporters that he had handed the ambassadors of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council messages in the name of Kuwaiti students that urged them to provide international protection to the unarmed Palestinian people.
The memorandum stated that there were "strategies for a new confrontation that was created in the wake of the unfortunate events, imposing several threats and challenges on the Ummah, i.e., the Muslim Nation, that should be faced with a similar strategy, through which the Ummah, as represented by its leaders, elites and masses, will shoulder its historic responsibility."
"The leaders should work together for laying groundwork for a preventive strategy of confrontation," it pointed out. "They should set the mechanisms for such strategy and mobilize energies for defending the main pillars and protecting the main elements of the Ummah."
Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Abdel Aziz offered full normalization with Ariel Sharon, the butcher of Sabra and Chatilla in return for full withdrawal from fifth of the Palestinian land, i.e. the Western Bank and Gaza Strip.

KHARTOUM GRANTS UGANDA ONE MONTH TO HUNT DOWN ITS OPPONENTS INSIDE SUDAN
HSS, Al-Hayat, 18/3/2002
Those reports come on the heels of a series of Sudanese opposition ranks alliances with a view to escalating armed action against the Sudanese government.
The Sudanese-Eritrean relations witnessed improvement during the same period. Security and political committees were formed to review the security position on borderlines between the two neighbours.
Dr. Goweili said that the Arab countries do not have a commodity surplus that they can exchange among themselves. Consequently, inter-Arab trade did not score any tangible increase over the last five years although the customs tariffs were cut down by a rate of 50% under the customs reduction agreement between the Arab states at an annual rate of 10%.
He said that the gross domestic product of the Arab World does not exceed 700 billion dollars annually out of a total world gross product of 33 trillion dollars; i.e. the Arab World produces only 2.2% of the total world production. Dr. Goweili said as a result of the deterioration of development in the Arab World the volume of Arab trade with the world is valued at 398 billion dollars equalling 3% of the total world trade which is estimated at 13 trillion dollars; i.e. the Arab World produces only 2.2% of the total world production.
THE COMING STAGE IS ONE OF WAR
Sharon's operations may reach Arafat himself. They may also go beyond this. Any Arab country neighbouring Israel would be mistaken if it believed that its international borders with Israel were secure. Sharon does not read history, nor does he recognize geography. It will be a mistake to trust in any reassurances.

EZZAT IBRAHIM: RELATIONS WITH SAUDI ARABIA AND KUWAIT ENTERED ANEW STAGE
What has been scored in the relations between Iraq and Saudi Arabia on the one hand and between Iraq and Kuwait on the other, is a start of a new stage of ties which will witness noticeable development in the near future at all levels including political and economic aspects, he indicated.
Kuwait "Al-Ra'i Al-Aam" newspaper has held a dialogue in Beirut with Iraqi Foreign Minister Nagi Sabri Al-Hedaithi, which was published on its front page yesterday, where he confirmed that Iraq is for Kuwait's prosperity and independence and also for starting to normalize diplomatic, political, economic and social relations between two brotherly peoples. It was noteworthy that the Iraqi official, in his interview with the Kuwaiti newspaper, took care to emphasize that the Iraqi constant political stance towards Kuwait was its respect of Kuwaiti sovereignty and national security and non-intervention in its domestic affairs and territorial integrity within internationally recognized borders. He, however, emphatically denied Iraq's having any Kuwaiti POWs.
The deputies, topped by Atef Al-Ashmouni, Dr.GGamal Heshmat, Mahfouz Helmi and Ahmed Abu Heggi, put the hard currency figure spared by the state as a result of banning the import of such items, at no less than $750 million.
Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh, Dr.MMohamed Sayyed Tantawi sent a formal letter to Minister of Information Safwat Al-Sherif asking him to deny sheikhs and Al-Azhar scholars access to the T.VV screen unless they get a license from the Islamic Research Academy and the Grand Sheikh's approval.
SPLA FORCES NEAR SOUTHERN OIL AREAS: GARANG
He also spoke about huge losses sustained by the government in the battle, saying that 300 soldiers were killed in the Nial Dew and Pantio road battles, and four vehicles carrying anti-tank canons and guns were seized."
London-based Al-Hayat received information from concerned sources on a "trick" related to changed loyalties, which helped Garang's forces reach the area, from which they were expelled roughly one month back, and the fighting has not yet been decided in the vicinity of the city.
A grace period set by the Group leadership to re-hold this rare plebiscite, is scheduled to end on 31st of the month instant. So, the leadership urged the cadres to express their stands in this regard. Results were announced in some Ikhwan internal divisions while those of other divisions will be announced later.
SAVING THE SAUDI INITIATIVE
The last decision that was made by Arafat and had been approved by almost all Arab leaders only hours before the beginning of the summit meeting on 27 March was to refuse to attend the meeting, as his attendance had a heavy political price that Arafat would have to pay to Israel.
The postponement, or suspension, of the endorsement of the Saudi peace initiative is the right decision to be made today in order to save the initiative itself.
We went into a conflict of wills with Israel over the issue of Arafat's attendance of the summit, and the result was that Arafat was unable to attend.
When Ariel Sharon failed to respond, the United States eased its pressure on him, shifting to another rhetoric that it directed at the Arabs, telling them that what was important was to focus on peace and the endorsement of the Saudi peace initiative, not on Arafat.
ARAB LEAGUE SUMMIT'S WEDDING, OR FUNERAL?
It is not important that the President of Somalia fail to show up for the summit, nor is it important that the President of Mauritania (who is he now, anyway?) does not attend. But the president of Egypt is one-half of the Ummah (nation), and his absence annuls the summit in terms of Arab unanimity, even if the President approves them in advance.
The Palestinians realize that Ariel Sharon does not intend to implement a security or political plan but is only preparing to sweep over the Palestinian territories and destroy the Palestinian Authority.
Therefore, I can only say today that I would have liked all the Arab leaders to attend. Perhaps I would have singled out Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar Qaddafi, for he has done nothing for the Palestinians.
This came in an article by Jihad Al Khazen, former chief editor of Al Hayat.
Maariv quoted Netanyahu while addressing Likud members in Tel Aviv as saying, "We cannot continue the escalating war of attrition.
Maariv also quoted him as saying, "The Saudi initiative came to clear Saudi Arabia from the American accusations of supporting international terrorism."
This was stated by Information Minister Safwat Al-Sherif following the expanded Cabinet meeting held by President Mubarak with the Economic Group, headed by Premier Atef Ebeid, to discuss the new budget draft.

A Muslim Brotherhood representative in the People's Assembly completed the drafting of a bill that would make the position of grand sheikh of Al Azhar subject to election by members of the Islamic Research Academy, instead of the system of appointment that is currently in effect.
The Speaker's suggestion made the Muslim Brotherhood representative prepare a bill that will amend Article 5 of Law 103 for 1961, so that it may explicitly state the selection of the grand sheikh of Al Azhar by the Islamic Research Academy, which replaced the Organization of Senior Islamic Scholars before the passage of the Law on Al Azhar in 1961.

The "17-member group", the Muslim Brotherhood, launched mordant broadside against Radwan, making it certain that the Islamic Sharia prohibits wine and pork. The Sharia should be respected and enforced in Egypt, they demanded, blasting Radwan's remarks as contradictory to Islam.

Industry Modernization Centre will start its negotiations with a number of financing institutions, mainly including the European Investment Bank and the German KFW Bank. The negotiations aim to secure around $54 billion that represent the current cost to modernize and develop equipment and machinery of all Egyptian factories.

However, according to the law, the remainder of the capital had to be put up for public subscription. All the shares were actually subscribed to, and the bids even exceeded the total value of the shares offered. As luck had it, I was allocated 550 share blocks, which translated into 11,000 shares, for a nominal value of $ 55,000.
"These are the most important indications. To be fair, the company did issue a single coupon that was worth 4% of the nominal value of the shares.
Comment: The drop in the value of shares and the distributed profits is a result of the company's performance. Restoring confidence in the shares requires correction of the current state of affairs and showing a clear and transparent picture to shareholders. This can be accomplished by the company's directors, who control 90% of the shares and are undoubtedly keen on showing profit for their investments, particularly as the money they invest in this company are funds contributed by public banks and companies whose money is owned by the people. On the other hand, the shareholders should adopt an attitude of patience, as all projects make or lose money according to local and global economic conditions.

EGYPTIAN DELTA ITERNATIONAL BANK RESUMES NEGOTIATIONS TO BORROW $100 MILLION FROM EUROPEAN BANKS
The bank's success in achieving distinguished indices of performance spurred investors to put up such offers. The surplus of the achieved activity until late September last exceeded 88.4 million pounds against 77.8 million pounds during the same period of 2000. Both deposits and credit activities have hiked by 7.5% and 6.7% consecutively, he pointed out.
The proposal was initially reviewed in a meeting for the bank's board of directors held yesterday under the chairmanship of Minister of Finance, Medhat Hassanin.
Minister of Finance Medhat Hassanin said some 22 billion pounds have been paid to suppliers and contractors and the remaining 500 million pounds in arrears are to be paid soon.
An Egyptian consortium of companies is currently seeking to negotiate with a number of banks in order to form an Egyptian factory for dealing for the first time on the market in the "factoring" activity, i.e. re-purchasing and collecting "bills".
EDB SETTLES DEBTS OF LAKAH While the creditor banks are trying to reach a unified formula to be approved as a base for the settlement of the businessman Rami Lakah's debts - some LE1.8 billion- before entering a new round of negotiation with him, the Egyptian Export Development Bank (EDB) declared that it settled its dues and loans with Lakah that hit some LE24 million.
This came after Al-Alam Al-Youm learned that the Banque Du Caire, which has the lion's share of Lakah's debts due to banks, turned down Lakah's request to drop his LE1.1 billion debts due to it in return for Banque Du Caire obtaining Lakah's dues with the Ministry of Health, Public Sector companies and some other assets represented in real estate and lands.
The report indicated that the issuance of such bonds had diverse economic impacts the most important of which is the increase of Egypt's international reserve to hit $15.7 billion in addition to the decrease of balance of payment total deficit to reach only $853 million in the outgoing financial year against $3 billion in the financial year 99/2000.
On the banking level the issuance of such bonds buttresses the ability of Egyptian banks of borrowing from external markets when necessary in light of the confidence the national economy enjoys, the report added. This issuance would provide much more dollar quantities in the domestic market with a competitive price that contributes to giving momentum to the projects that turn revenues into hard currency.
In his comment on the picture that the deputy was protesting against, Dr Sorour said that he saw nothing but a picture of two girls meeting one another that had no other meaning or implication.
social and psychological specialists said that the conditions under which Palestinian children have lived for a year and a half, brought about considerable changes; the most important of which is the rise in status of martyrdom seekers.

That decrease hit some 1.7 billion dollars in 2001, a decrease of 50%.
While Al-Aqsa Martyrs Battalions affiliated to Fateh Movement was included by the American Administration in the terrorism list, some voices in the Israeli intelligence started to be heard emphsizing the importance of opening a communication channel with Fateh's secretary in the West Bank, Marawan Al-Barghouthi, who is considered to be one of the most outstanding symbols of that movement and the resistance activities which it performs.
The newspaper said that that point was being discussed by intelligence milieus on the one hand, and between them and the security bodies and the political leaderships on the other hand adding that the prevalent opinion currently is the continuation of the policy dealing with that organization as hostile to Israel especially after the American declaration branding it as terrorist.
NASRULLAH CALLS ON ARAB SUMMIT TO PROVIDE THE RESISTANCE AND UPRISING WITH MONEY AND WEAPONS
He added that the "Palestinians want neither Arab forces, planes nor tanks. They want only weapons. The Arab countries do have such amounts of money, experience and strength that it would not be difficult to offer weapons to the Palestinians."
He said, "O Arab rulers, don't allow America to strike any Arab country as it would do the same thing with the rest one by one.
Prominent Lebanese Shiite authority Sheikh Mohammad Hussein Fadlullah warned that what awaited the Arab and Muslims and other elements of the Ummah (nation) was "much more than the partisan and sectarian grudges and battles we see now," pointing out that Sunnite and Shiite Muslims were "targeted by world tyranny" and urging them to unify under Islam, "freeze their differences that come from historical accumulations" and reject the method of branding others as infidels, which had personal causes in most cases and was far from Islam and its authentic concepts.

SPLA leader Colonel John Garang concluded a 2-week visit to the United States with a meeting with Deputy Secretary of Defence Paul Wolfowitz that represented a precedent in Sudanese-American relations.
The Sudanese Government does not approve of the new interpretation of the agreement, as it believes that it signed an agreement which guarantees the protection of oil installations and represents a step towards a comprehensive cease-fire.
He also said that the message delivered by Colonel Garang to the United States had stressed that the Sudanese ruling regime had not changed and was a threat to the people and to regional and international stability and that any political solution should rest on a wide base.
The US Military Intelligence Agency cautioned against a potential all-out war in the Middle East region.
The Palestinian-Israeli conflict could bring further pressure on moderate allies to the US, portending a possible all-out war in the Middle East region.
In the meeting, he said that Sharon and his gang demolish Palestinian houses, murder innocent people, besiege safe villages, uproot trees and attack hospitals. Jihad, according to Islam, means defending all that should be defended, said the sheikh, reiterating that Palestinian acts are "Jihad" while Sharon and his gang's practices are "terrorism".
Besides, the enemy, when ferociously attacking the Palestinians does not discriminate in demolishing homes and destroying schools and buildings between woman, child, or an old man, plant or animal, it is also well-known that the enemy brackets, men and women alike are considered a trained enemy that is on a permanent alert.
He condemned some reports that the martyrdom operation launched by the people of the occupied Palestine are "disbelief or suicide."
In an exclusive to Al-Hayat, he warned against an American scheme targeting Iraq and then Iran following targeting the Palestinian cause.
He said, "What happens in Palestine causes sorrow and bitterness but it also has important positive points, chief among which is full Palestinian national unity between all Jihad (struggle) forces like Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Fateh with the rest of the Palestinian people's sons."
Regarding what Iran could offer in support of the Palestinian people in these sensitive circumstances, Muhajerani called for using all possible diplomatic means including the communications made by President Khatemi with the European Union, the UN and the Arab summit in addition to urgently activating the elite sectors, thinkers and opinion authorities on the Iranian arena, writers, parties, artists, etc.
After they had been finished with Afghanistan, the Americans forgot everything they had declared about the Palestinian state.
"Our support of those (struggling factions) is a moral and cultural one as all Muslims should extend such a kind of support."
The syndicate also emphasized its confidence in the capability of Arab masses that were deeply moved by the atrocities that are being perpetrated without any deterrence and in removing all obstacles that impede the extension of all possible support to the Palestinian people and even participate, side by side, with it in confronting the racist Zionist project, which targets the present and the future of the Arab nation.
The press Syndicate demanded that an overall reviewing of the Egyptian-American relations be made and that a dotting of the i's and a crossing of the t's be also carried out through a legitimate pause with the American Administration.
Meanwhile, heads of investors societies asked for drawing up an Arab strategy to deals with the USA.
Head of 10th of Ramadan Investors Society, Dr. Mahmoud Soleiman called upon the economic community with all its sectors to stop transactions with Israel.
Dr. Hassan Ratteb, head of North Sinai Investors Society stressed upon the necessity of an Arab pause that would be painful, not only to Israel, but to all those who support and encourage it to cause havoc.
Dr. Abdel-Moteleb Mohamed Abdel-Moteleb, Deputy Chairman of Medical Equipment Branch, Cairo Chamber of Commerce, said that it had been decided not to trade in Israeli medical equipment.
Political and military experts said that war against Israel and exterminating it are the only strategic option for the Arabs now especially after Tel Aviv turned down the Arab peace initiative and challenged the Arabs by launching an all-out attack against the unarmed Palestinian people. The Arabs can thus keep the Arab national security.
Al-Mahgoub said that Arab solidarity had to control the situation to achieve victory over Israel and its supporters especially as the Palestinian cause covers the Arab capitals not the occupied land only.
Hafez affirmed that the scenario of the Israeli sweeping of Palestinian towns and villages in the West Bank and Gaza Strip was agreed on by America and Israel together before the Arab Summit.
He added the Arab peace initiative is surrender without price and bears resemblance to the visit of late President Sadat to Jerusalem while he was victorious. The difference between the two things lies in the fact that President Sadat got the price late while the current initiative does not seem to have a price. He pointed out that the initiative caused a serious split in the Arab street despite the Arab government mass media announcing that the initiative enjoyed popular support.
The most important thing about the Israeli military campaign against Arafat and the Palestinians is that, ferocious as it is, even more ferocious than Nazi practices, served to unveil the real American face in Middle East question. It also served to unite Palestinian resistance forces and shattered Arab peace illusions as Arab offering of peace and normalization would only tempt killer Sharon into adopting peaceful intentions.
Never has peace been one of Sharon's goals and Iraq's rejoining the Arab ranks runs counter to Bush's goals. That was why Sharon kept Arafat in confinement as hostage preventing him from participating in the summit to keep the climate inside the Palestinian lands tense enough to trigger more suicidal operations that may be used as a pretext for shattering peace opportunities for reasons that are now quite evident. He had been helped to do so by America which has never been quite sincere in urging Sharon to let Arafat attend the summit and then return home.
EGYPTIAN SECURITY FORCES ALONG FRONTIERS WITH GAZA REINFORCED
Israel may deport Palestinians to Haram area at a width of roughly 40 meters between the two international borderlines, and the Palestinians will have to infiltrate into Egypt via the Egyptian borderline, the source added.
The protesters called for arming the people of Sinai, especially at the areas near the Palestinian territories with weapons in order to defend themselves if Israel tried to broaden its aggression.
The most serious public announcement during that barbarous war came from Israeli minister of war and Labour Party leader, General Ben Eliezer, who is Sharon's partner in the government. He said that such a war would not stop at any geographical borders of Israel, but would extend to Arab neighbouring countries. To be sure, neighbouring Arab countries are: Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.
Would they, for instance, remember boycotting the enemy? Would they remember that 80% of their exports especially oil, as well as their imports are with the West Europe and America?

This system, she added, makes it possible to set the cipher of this satellite and get a receiver system at the lowest possible cost, dispending with importing alternative systems while exporting such projects to the region countries which benefit from the Egyptian satellite.
IMPORT OF "PROVOCATIVE" GOODS MAY RAISE HEATED DEBATE BETWEEN PA AND GOVERNMENT
DOLLAR RATE DIFFERENTIALS TRIGGER CRISIS BETWEEN BANKS AND IMPORTERS IN EGYPT
As a result of such remissness, besides the rise in the dollar rate of exchange, banks found it inevitable to claim businessmen's payment of rate differentials especially as the dollar had risen before the Egyptian pound by 38% over three years.

AMERICA REINFORCES ITS FORCES IN THE GULF TO ENSURE ITS ABILITY TO LAUNCH WAR
An American military official said, preferring to remain anonymous, that sending US extra forces would give Iraq a warning against taking any aggressive acts against its neighbours while America is militarily focusing its attention on Afghanistan.
Nobody knows anything about such an American facility in which there are long tarmacs for planes. Only a sign is hung on which the "An Army Camp" was handwritten.
It is worth mentioning that the number of those Kuwaiti citizens are still unknown. The sources expected a strong parliamentary opposition to this new orientation.
Following the meeting with media men he said, "We hope Iraq will abide by the same mass media principles which we observe."

Sources close to the government say that such an option could be resorted to once the conditions deteriorated and Berber political forces managed to polarize the public opinion in the Qabalia areas and convince them that the elections would be of no avail.
Oroush organizations will go on a strike today (Sunday) and tomorrow (Monday) in response to the government resorting to using force to disperse a popular march that was scheduled to be staged on last Thursday.
TURKEY AND THE MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT
I thought that the Turkish Republic would make use of that close relation with Israel, in addition to the historic relation with the Arabs to try to give momentum to the peaceful settlement even for the purpose of serving its own interests as an Eastern Asian, European and also Middle East country.
The Turks look up to and appreciate their European affiliation but look down upon their Muslim Eastern affiliation and spare no effort to wriggle out of it.
Fourth: the traditional reply which the European Union usually gave to Turkey's attempts to join it basically centers round apparent, rather than genuine, reasons as a pretext for the European evasion of admitting Turkey as an E.UU member.
Nor is Turky alone in that, for many countries in our contemporary world think that the road to the USA heart is its spoilt child in the Middle East, the Hebrew state regardless of all its aggressive practices and expansionist goals.
When they failed to achieve their goals, they resorted to Britain then, for a short time, to France and eventually to the USA.
In spite of successive Turkish statements demanding Baghdad implement Security Council relations and accept the return of committees on inspection and despite apparent attempts to spare Iraq a new American military strike, the matter did not stop there as Turkey again has a special agenda on that matter containing another chapter on the Kurdish cause, whether on regional ambitions and a third pointing out international relations.
Even though I quite agree that Turkey made efforts in Euro- Mediterranean organizations, its vision of the region does not depart from the orientations of Ataturk, with his mysterious origins, controversial ideas and his big role in changing the political map of the Middle East in the twentieth century and his ending of the last Islamic Caliphate.
In his address to the Arab Youth Development Conference in the AUC, which was delivered by Ambassador Masoud Al-Zubaidi on his behalf, Mousa said that it is high time for the Arab governments and the Arab peoples to understand that Israel would not give them back the usurped Arab rights under agreements whether signed or not signed by Israel unless force was used due to the fact that the only language the Israeli entity understands is the language of force. " The Arabs and Muslims should use the language Israel understands", Mousa said citing a saying of the late leader Gamal Abdel-Naser: " What was taken by force can only be restored by force."
He revealed that the recent events proved to the rulers and the ruled all and sundry that the Arab resorting to the UN, the EU, and America under the strategic peace option was a big mirage.
He went on to say " Bush, here are our youth, men, children and women fighting and here are the peoples everywhere in the Arab world raging with determination to uproot the enemies of humanity from their clean national land". He added that in spite of the support given by Bush to the new Israeli Nazism including weapons, men, and arms to exterminate the Palestinians, the Arab nation would continue to resist with high flags and would never surrender or kneel to the enemies whatever the price.
Resist as President Nasser resisted in the 1956 War because you will attain victory, God willing".
Sharon's approach steps up destruction and damage.

The company that will rent Al-Amireya Yarn and Textile is an American company owned by Jews who are closely related to Israel. The negotiator who plays the role of a mediator between the company and the Americans is businessman Ahmed Al-Zayyat who owns the beer company.
COPTIC MELLI COUNCIL CALLS FOR SUPPORTING PALESTINIAN INTIFADA FINANCIALLY AND MORALLY
This is a spontaneous experience by a first year secondary female student that is worth reading:
As more and more students welcomed the idea, we began to take practical steps and decided to raise money to photocopy some leaflets and prepare some posters on which we wrote slogans. I also asked my female students to wear black scarves as a sign of mourning for the death of the martyrs.
The students of another school carrying flags then joined the demonstration and the boy students chanted, "Open the door to Jihad (religious struggle). The Egyptian youth are back again."
Such market capacity can by no means reach LE170 billion rather than the LE17 billion as it, at least, can attain a maximum of LE3.2 billion a year. The minister pointed out that getting rid of some companies is considered an achievement regardless of the low prices because selling represents a good economic feedback as it rids the Egyptian economy of annual losses that it can hardly sustain. Khattab pinpointed that international markets still witness a state of depression adding that the Middle East region becomes so inflamed that it will be difficult to guess how the privatization programme would proceed. In spite of the inability to make accurate predictions, it is expected that half the loss-making companies would be sold out in 24 months' time to specialized investors.
Besides, a Chinese delegation have also visited the oasis recently and offered to cultivate 50 thousand feddans to produce silk worm silk and castor oil in addition to making use of the oasis potentialities for curative tourism for which it is famous thanks to the Chinese tourist delegations within the framework of the agreement concluded during the recent visit paid by President Hosni Mubarak to Peking to boost Chinese tourism to Egypt.
At the beginning of the seminar Dr. Ahmed Al Gharbawi had pointed out the President's interest in to the development of the oasis and the exploitation of its resources in order to become a source of income to Egypt. Such attention has already started with a decision by Premier Dr.AAtef Ebeid to put Siwa on international tourism map.
Regarding agricultural potentials, Dr.AAl Gharbawi added that about 220 thousand feddans could be cultivated there, 20 thousand of which have already been embarked on by the Government. He pointed out that raw olive oil produced by the oasis is one of the best in the world due to its low rate of acidity as it was awarded the price of International Olive oil Board.
HOW UNVEILING!
Little do we look at our own mirrors in order to see our faces well and then wonder whether we really did our duty to promote our efficiency in defending our rights and our future? The efficiency which I mean covers the political structure, economic power and military capability.
A careful look at the mirrors that must be accompanied by an open free dialogue would enable us to reach for the weak points in the Arab situation and whether that weakness lay in the will or in the structure, a step, so far, quite overlooked.
Such indications strongly raise the following question with much doubt: Is the Israeli community really desirous of and willing to have peace?

Addressing reporters in the Pentagon on Friday evening, Franks said the step would provide a precious training experience and forestall any mistakes, in a very clear indication to Iraq.
"We boost or enhance our capabilities at the level of command in all the area that lies under my responsibility."
The Kuwaiti government urged local newspapers to stop the "antagonistic rhetoric" against Iraq, Al-Hayat learnt from well-informed sources. Instructions have been given to official mass media not to use terms like "Iraqi Regime", but rather use "Republic of Iraq".
KUWAITI DEPUTIES CRITICIZE MASS MEDIA PACIFICATION WITH BAGHDAD
In reply to a question about the instructions given to the Kuwaiti press on Iraq, he said, "The matter is left to the local press, but we wish that it would calm down in order to see the results."
All this in the name of diplomacy and for obscure goals and motives which had not been unfolded to our people.
He, nevertheless, did not rule out the possibility of that topic being subjected to public discussion in the parliament.
He also said it was doubtful that a solution to the POWs problem would be reached soon.
The source added that Saudi contracting companies especially the big ones are undergoing a relative recession as they have enormous human and machinery resources that can be rapidly moved due to the geographical proximity of Iraq to seize any emergent opportunities.
It is well-known that the total volume of contracts concluded with Saudi companies and factories and approved by the UN for exportation to Iraq reached about $298 million last year, and $117 million of which for the food products sector , $104 million for machinery and spare parts, $77 million for medical products.
Saudi companies concentrated on the construction and building materials sector especially as Iraq announced that it was going to carry out 12 housing projects comprising 6 thousand housing units, the first stage of which amounts to $400 million in addition to other projects that had been contracted for building 12 hospitals and 90 medical centers as well as thousands of promising opportunities for building schools and housing units.

The schools for boys will have male teachers and will be run by efficient male educationalists, while schools for girls will have female teachers and will be run by female experts."
Political sources told Al-Hayat that such a chain of contact had started a few months before with a view to polarizing Oroush leaderships. They focus on the necessity of participating in the forthcoming elections whose results may change the political map in the Qabalia area.
The Front has taken into consideration the activists' opinions in its base and has consulted other Algerian party figures before taking the decision of boycotting the elections, he added.
If the Algerian parliament voted for the decree considering the Tamazight language a national language and if it also gave thumbs up for partial withdrawal of the national gendarmerie forces from the flash points late April next, it would be a contribution to convincing the Berber of participating in the elections.
This option provides for forming a national unity government and conducting early presidential elections.
However, a well-informed source following up the developments of the Qabalia file said that the government had decided to ban Oroush extremist organizations and arrest anybody who issues statements in their them.
I very much wonder why Turkey, the heir of the Ottoman Empire that aborted the natural evolution march in this region for over five centuries had not played an active role for the service of peace and stability in the region?
First: the modern Turkish state has a legacy of ideas and values that do not stop at secularism but transcends that to another logic that welcomes the idea of a Turkey that represents the rear of the European West rather than the front of the Islamic East.
Besides Turkey being member of the NATO, the accomplishment of other aspects of its European affiliation seems for take the form of an obsession to successive Turkish governments.
According to history and geography, Turkey is part of the Arab Islamic civilization rather than part of the Christian Western civilization that identifies the union.
I'd like here to monitor Turkey's attitude towards the Arab-Israeli conflict on the one hand, and its attitude towards the possibilities of striking Iraq on the other hand.
My contention emanates from my disappointment as I thought that the Turks would play quite a different role. I thought the Turkish policy would play a positive active role in the Arab-Israeli conflict. I also wished, due to geographical proximity, historic depth, social links and religious ties, Turkey would seek an effective fair mediation between the two parties of the conflict in the Middle East. The Turks, however, took another course and preferred to keep away from that role. They contented themselves with formal statements in support of the Palestinian right in general but gave Israel in return every attention, sought every rapprochement and looked forward to further coordination and cooperation.
This leads us to take it for granted that the Kurdish question that represents a coefficient between Turkey, Iraq, Iran and perhaps Syria plays an important role in defining Turkish Policy towards the Middle East and other neighbouring countries.
SHARON IS "DRACULA", BUSH IS "THUG" AND PEACE OPTION IS MIRAGE, MOUSA SAYS
He asked the Arab rulers to go back to their peoples saying, " Go back to your peoples and join forces with them to form one steadfast front in the face of the American and Israeli deception and hypocrisy. He wondered about the position of Arab armies, on which the Arab countries spent more than 600 billion dollars during the outgoing decade only to prepare. " If the Arab armies do not do their role at the moment of necessity in defending the land and honour, then why are they there," he added.
He added, " I would like to tell the US President that if he calls defending the land and honour against the oppressive usurping occupier terrorism, we all in the Arab world are honored to be terrorists".
He added that he sees the heralds of victory looming on the horizons. "Here are the grandchildren of Khalid Bin Al-Walid and the peoples of Saladdin and Nasser revolting against humiliation, to which the nation is exposed, shaking the land under the feet of the Zionist enemy and its ally America to uproot the Zionist entity sooner or later as God promised us in the Holy Quran that we are the superiors and they are the inferiors and God will not break his promise, which they see far but we see close", he said.
Mrs. Suzanne Mubarak stressed that Israel violates all agreements, covenants, human rights, UN resolutions and human principles through its current acts on Palestinian territories.
MUSLIM SCHOLARS RESPOND TO BUSH WITH A FATWA
The Muslim scholars also called upon Arab and Muslim armies and security agencies to support the masses.
In an exclusive statement to Al-Alam Al-Youm Industries Federation Chairman Abdel- Mon'em So'oudi stressed the importance of halting dealing in all Israeli commodities and stopping all commercial activities with Israel.
The sitters-in called for severing all relations with the Zionist enemy and economic relations with the United States, as it is the main sponsor of the Israeli terrorism.

The gathering, which attracted over two thousands of Copts, Muslims, Muslim preachers and priests, said Israel does not have any divine right in Palestine and condemned the violations of human rights committed by brutal Israeli authorities in the occupied Palestinian territories. The church members called for supporting the Palestinian Intifada materially and morally to rebuild infrastructure destroyed by the humanity enemies led by the killer Sharon.
What happened impressed me and delighted me as it gave me hope that there is still hope in our future generations.
Palestine, Palestine we'll support you till the very end!"
In front of a church, a most moving incident took place, a Copt student carrying a Koran and a Muslim carrying a Bible joined ranks and started chanting while hoisting Palestine's flag together," Christian and Islamic, Jerusalem will stay Arab."
Experts of a European Committee that have recently visited Siwa Oasis emphasized that the oasis is a source of organic food which is free of pollution and chemical fertilizers, thus appealing to the taste of the European consumer and meeting the European conditions for a model farm.
For his turn, Al-Said Qasim said that such a seminar came as a prelude to signing a cooperation protocol between the Commercial Representation Authority and Siwa Oasis investors to promote agricultural exports produced by the oasis on international markets in addition to attracting foreign investments to it.
He added that curative tourism came in the forefront of available potentialities that could be exploited through seeking recovery from dermatitis and rheumatoid through burying the diseased parts in the sand, which could also be used for making glass and ceramics.
He added that an olive tree in the oasis produced about 400 kilograms of olive compared to only 200 or 350 kilograms in countries that are famous for planting olive trees.
Not only did the events unveil how capable the Palestinians are of steadfastness and resistance but also revealed Arab political, military and economic capability, which we can safely say is so meager that it would, so far, hardly do anything that may positively affect the stream of events.
All that the Arabs did was that they declared the peace initiative to which the Israeli Premier replied only 24 hours later by beating the drums of war and while the Arabs continued the argument that peace was their strategic option, Israel went on untiringly arming itself to teeth and mobilizing its resources but adhering to its option of war.
They have frequently been witnessed publishing press articles and chanting slogans via satellite channels. When the worst come to the worst, nevertheless, and when peace seemed to turn into struggle and a responsibility, they have just vanished and melted like salt in water. The ugly Israeli face has also been unveiled most disgustingly.
What was unveiled in a manner that would silence those Arab Zionists and their likes was that Labour Party, an essential partner in Sharon's current government. The men who run the genocide battle on both the political and military fronts are Labour Party leaderships, Peres, Foreign Minister, Ben Eliezer, Minister of Defence and Mofaz, Chief of Staff.
I have received the following letter from Ambassador Raouf Ghuneim, former assistant Foreign Minister. It's an expression of many people's thoughts about the current attitude towards Israeli practices that transcend the elimination of the Palestinian Authority and breaking the Palestinian people's resistance of occupation.
The USA also has multifarious interests that are positively or negatively affected by our region. We must, in the first place, defend the future of our children through trying to bring about that effect and through sending the USA a message that we won't surrender to the schemes planned on behalf of Israel. Driven by the conscience of every one of us, we must boycott American products and services and use the national counterparts instead. This would let Washington unequivocally understand that we will resist the scheme that aims at humiliating us and subjecting us to Israeli hegemony.
Sheikh Yassin, then, said that Gaza dwellers have nothing to worry about adding that all Gaza inhabitants, men and women alike are ready for the confrontation and the enemy should know that Gaza won't be an easy prey as we, poorly equipped as we are, are able to set the ground ablaze under the enemy's feet. Resistance and martyrdom are Gaza's spirit, which is stronger than the F16 and the Apache planes. They well know that through their agents and may, therefore, refrain from entering Gaza.
A: Undoubtedly, there is! When I talk about resistance, I do not mean Hamas in particular, but I mean all groups. There is complete coordination and the tasks are distributed to all groups in Gaza axes.
Q: Egypt has declared stopping all communications channels with Israel except for the diplomatic channel in protest against the Israeli massacres.
A: We're undergoing a state of pain and grief and we do not want the Arab armies to fight Israel. We do not want any fund's or medical assistance. All we want is what would enable us to face Israeli aggression ruthless war machine that shows no mercy to old people or children without any discrimination. We want arms and money to be able to resist the slaughtering operations launched by Sharon against us.
Spokesman for Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), Mahmoud Al-Zahhar affirmed that the movement supported the Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's stance rejecting any succumbing to Israeli or American pressure or making concessions that could do harm to Palestinian national interests.
In response to a question about to what extent resistance operations could persist in light of the absence of an active Arab backing and American support of the Israelis in their war against the Palestinians, the spokesman for Hamas movement said, "We have the human element that is capable of maintaining resistance until victory is achieved. It is true that we haven't sufficient arms but our human forces still fill this gap." Why do not Arab countries, then, let even arm traders sell weapons to the Palestinians who are ready to sell all that they own to buy arms in order to defend themselves and their homeland? Al-Zahhar wondered.
They do not want to win Olympic medals or world cups, but aspire after winning martyrdom and resisting the occupiers and inflicting heavy losses on them.
A: They are too many, but I can remember an athletic champion for whom we expected an honourable future in world competition due to his distinguished standard, I mean champion Mohamed Abou-Gamous who visited me in my office in Gaza one morning. When I asked him, "Where have you been?"
Q: Who was the martyr whom you will never forget?
A: After Ayman was granted martyrdom, Othman married his brother's widow to look after his children and lived with her till last December, then he carried out a distinguished martyrdom operation in "Beth Lahya". I saw that hero play volleyball a few hours before he performed the operation.
In an interview with Akher Saa weekly, Maj. Gen. Salah Eddin Selim, an advisor to the Middle East Studies Center, made important and serious remarks, saying that Sharon's ongoing scenario against the Palestinian people and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) was approved last September.
Of course, Israel will be affected so much, if the economic boycott is put into force. Furthermore, the Arab countries, especially Israel's neighbors, are required to reject any attempt to send some resistance members and their families to other countries whether compulsorily or voluntarily.
I do not want to cry over spilt milk, but it is the PNA which should be blamed for this delay as it wanted to restrict what it called "the armed turning of the second Intifada, with some of the PNA members having termed Hamas and Jihad as a menace to the PNA itself.
Q: But, what the Palestinians are required to do in this stage?
Regrettably, some Western parties, especially Britain, support Sharon, while the U.S. Administration is still divided over retaining Arafat as a leader.
It might be mentioned that in the mid-nineties Morocco had relinquished a second degree commercial boycott and permitted importation of some products especially irrigational ones via European or mixed companies.
They said that all Arab countries should close down Israeli economic missions' offices, stop all forms of contact with Israel, review commercial relations with the countries that militarily back Israel and strive for having Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon tried in the Hague-based International Court of Justice on the grounds that he is a war criminal from the day Sabra and Chatilla massacre was committed to the one being perpetrated at present in Bethlehem.
In an interview with the Financial Times, which the newspaper printed in its German issue, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said that a military operation against Iraq would have a negative impact on Arab states that might result in the fragmentation of Iraq and threaten the balance of power in the region.
In a hint that Baghdad might agree to receive international observers, Ivanov said that there were indications that the Iraqis would show willingness to comply with United Nations resolutions.
However, a Russian businessman with interests in Iraq told the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs that Russian companies were deeply concerned over the possibility that matters might take a turn to the worst, adding that Moscow should not allow itself to be deceived by American promises of compensation.
He added that his country was ready to expand that cooperation and had actually prepared a long-term program to that effect but Moscow had not signed the proposal as a result of the attitude of some quarters in Russia.
Israel collects customs duties and taxes from Palestinian citizens, but shares their proceeds with the PNA upon the Paris Agreement signed between both sides in April 1994, which regulates Palestinian-Israeli economic relations.
Among other economic sectors which Israel claims to have been affected by the Palestinian Intifada are agriculture and construction which are basically reliant upon Arab labor who have been reluctant to work in Israel for 18 months.
100 TAHRIR PARTY ACTIVISTS ARRESTED
Their relations with the party's headquarters in Germany, Britain and Austria have been monitored, in addition to their receiving financial support from abroad, especially from the party headquarters abroad.
Two days ago, Israeli forces killed an Egyptian youth while trying to infiltrate into Gaza through Saladdin gate which is close to Rafah border pathway.
The sources added that the youth had been transported alive to Al-Arish hospital where all attempts to save his life failed.
"He who does not do so betrays his religion and homeland."
The USA showed discontent with the content of Friday sermon delivered by Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh, Dr. Mohamed Sayyed Tantawi in Al-Azhar mosque two days ago. The American ambassador, David Welsh conveyed his government dissatisfaction with the views the sermon expressed. He added such views undermined his country's current efforts to stop violence, encouraged a climate of hostility to the Jews and justified what he called as "terrorism."
CONTROVERSY BETWEEN AL-AZHAR GRAND SHEIKH AND AL-QARADAWI
Al-Qaradawi called for opening the door to Jihad (holy struggle) for volunteers from all over the Islamic world to fight side by side with their brothers, the Palestinians, and face killer Sharon. He emphasized that Jihad, in light of the current conditions, is an obligation to every Muslim who must join the struggle whether by fighting and sacrificing his soul or by contributing to scoring victory over their enemies.
Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh added that boycotting goods must be left to the specialists. He wondered, "How can I approve of boycotting any commodity if that will do harm to the country and fellow countrymen?"
THE IMPUDENCE OF THE ISRAELI EMBASSY: WE WILL ONLY LEAVE CAIRO TO SINAI!
CAMP DAVID ACCORD "HAS NOT ACHIEVED SECURITY": EGYPTIAN MINISTER
EGYPTIAN-ISRAELI TRADE AND ECONOMIC RELATIONS FROZEN SINCE OUTBREAK OF INTIFADA
It has become impossible for the Egyptian-Israeli Joint Committee to hold meetings and arrange visits by Israeli delegations to Egypt, he added.
Al-Alam Al-Youm learnt that the ministry's Regional Economic Cooperation Unit, which was in charge of following up the dossier of regional economic cooperation between Israel and Arab countries, has expanded its activities to focus on other dossiers such as G-8 following the shelving of the regional economic cooperation dossier.
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES START BOYCOTTING AMERICAN BANKS
The Syndicate Secretary General, Dr. Mahmoud Abdel-Maqsoud said that the volume of pharmaceutical trade in Egypt hits 5 billion pounds. "The campaign aims at depriving the American banks of such money."
The Egyptian tourist sector has entered a very critical stage in the light of the goings- on in the region. Officials concerned should seek to tide over the situation as early as possible in a bid to shun fresh burdens following the aftermath of the September 11 events, which caused the sector over 2.5 billion U.S. dollars in losses.
Experts monitored a number of factors which negatively impacted on Egyptian tourism as a result of the Palestinian events. Direct effects:
-	Tourist influx from Israel to Egypt decreased by 67.3 percent on average from April 2000 to January 2001, but sharply went down to almost 17 percent in the past two months.
According to available data with Al-Hayat in Damascus, the tension between Egyptian and Syrian governments is still on without any steps being taken so far to ease it. Some official directives, however, seek to keep it implicit to avoid any harm done to Arab solidarity.
According to an official statement, Syrian vice president, Abdel-Halim Khaddam in his meeting two days ago with Lebanese Premier, Rafik Al-Hariri, emphasized that "Arab countries must take measures to sever every form of relations with the Israeli enemy." Syrian Foreign Minister, Farok Al-Shareh also stressed that the Arab summit resolutions would have to be implemented, including severing relations with Tel Aviv. The non-implementation of that summit resolutions has prevented Al-Shareh from participating in the Arab Ministerial Council emergency meeting after the Israeli sweep of the West Bank.
Observers believe that some political reasons have caused the dispute between the two parties.
AN EGYPTIAN EXPERT UNCOVERS SHARON'S BLACK SCENARIO
Major General Salah Eddin Selim continues his surprise and says, "Sharon thinks that if he returned the 22% to the Palestinians, they would seek to claim the conditions of the 1949 armistice signed in Rhodes island or the 181 division resolution passed by the U.N. in 1947.
"Israel now acts according to a strategic plan," added Major General Selim. "This plan extends for five years from 2002 till 2006 with 3 main objectives: Firstly, the abolition of the Palestinian resistance, the destruction of the Authority's infrastructure and the division of the West Bank and Gaza into eight divisions with civilian administrations in coordination with the Zionist state and the imposition of a long armistice that would extend to over 3 years before reaching a final settlement in Palestine.
Under the above heading, Al-Wafd Board Chairman No'man Gomaa writes a front- page article to say:
They have been relentlessly moving to prepare their force to intimidate the "Red Indians of Arabs" in order to notch up their goal; control over the Arab region from the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf.
Nor will we trust their talk on peace unless they agree to live in a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, where Muslims, Christians and Jews live on the same footing.
Therefore, we are forced to halt the strategic peace state as long as the other side does not accept it.
Barring Israeli planes from landing at Egyptian airports and Egyptian planes from landing at Israeli airports.
Transferring the Israeli diplomatic mission headquarters to another place which should be less provocative to public opinion and Cairo University students. THIRD OPTION IMPOSES ITSELF
Although such a tendency was required by international financial institutions to fulfill their promises towards Egypt, the banks were worried and had to procure what they wanted through resorting to the unofficial market or to the role of direct mediator between their clients so as to strike a balance between supply and demand through the current operations they carry out everyday.
Differentials of rates of exchange may lead to the previous increase without actual growth in the figures of such assets in their currencies - dollar, euro or pound sterling. Rather, such differentials may cover up for a limited retreat. Subsequently, presenting these assets in the Egyptian pound can play a deceptive role, he added.
In a press conference on April 9, Dr Medhat Hassanein, Minister of Finance, pointed out the features of the largest budget in Egypt's history.
Budget net deficit is estimated at about LE17.2 billion, or a rate of 4.2% of the GDP. This deficit is to be financed through bonds and bills issued by the State public budget, Hassanein indicated.
Current revenues from the surplus of the Suez Canal, oil, Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), shareholding companies and the four government-owned banks are to hit LE25.4 billion in the new budget, with a rise of 1%. Total increase of sovereign and current resources will amount to LE97.6 billion against LE94.3 billion in 2001\2002 budget, thus achieving an increase rate of 3.5%.
Agricultural crops prices, he indicated, will be subsidized with LE612 million against LE512 million last year. Moreover, pharmaceuticals, health insurance and children milk powder will be subsidized with LE350 million, an increase of LE40 million against last year.
Expenditures and interest of the external public debt hit LE2.4 billion against LE2.3 billion last year, which is the differential of exchange rates rather than an increase in debt, the minister said.
In its meeting chaired by Prime Minister, Dr Atef Ebeid, on April 7, the Cabinet approved the State public budget bill for the fiscal year 2002/2003 in its final form as a prelude to referral to the People's Assembly and Shura Council.
Minister of Finance, Dr.MMedhat Hassanien said, "The per capita share of direct and indirect subsidies in the State budget for this year reaches LE175 annually. The per capita subsidy for education reaches LE1126 and for health services LE123. The citizen's share of public spending as a whole hits LE2083 while the average per capita tax reaches LE600 annually."
During President Mubarak's era, Egypt has witnessed an over-all revival in all development fields, stressed Dr Mohamed Ibrahim Sulaiman, Minister of Housing, Utilities and Urban Communities.
Investments of potable water and sanitary drainage projects have exceeded LE50 billion as more than 30 thousand km of pipes and sanitary drainage networks were set up nationwide, he added.
Total free zones projects increased to 817 till late September last, announced Dr Mohamed Al-Ghamrawi, head of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones. Our exports to external markets amounted to about $975 million during last year, Al-Ghamrawi said. More than 75,000 job openings have been created, he added, indicating that the free zones play a major role in supporting the national economy.
In its monthly report published on its own website, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) announced that the foreign reserves of Egypt went down to $13.81 billion during last January against $14.08 billion in December 2001.
Minister of Public Enterprise Sector, Dr.MMukhtar Khattab admitted that the proceeds of selling public sector companies so far equals only the expenditure in 45 days in the public budget of the Egyptian government even though the 1993 government estimates amounted to LE500 billion. The proceeds of the sales of about 190 companies amount only to LE17 billion. Such humble proceeds compared to the stupendous expenditure in Egypt due to the repayment of public property quota was attributed by the minister to the state of recession and the inability of markets to absorb the companies. Such market capacity can by no means reach LE170 billion rather than the LE17 billion as it, at least, can attain a maximum of LE3.2 billion a year.
In a meeting organized by the Egyptian Swedish Businessmen Association under the chairmanship of Eng. Onsi Sawiris, Ghali pointed out that the achievement of the exportation strategy aimed at saving time, efforts and money together with granting export incentives so as to encourage different commodity sectors. The achievement of such a strategy also requires enhancing production capabilities in order to meet domestic needs and increase exports, he added.
Within the framework of the exporters tax repayment program implemented by the Ministry of Foreign Trade, Foreign Trade Minister Youssef Boutros Ghali said that the figures and indicators reveal that the companies benefiting from the tax repayment program and the back-up system of Egyptian exports achieved a higher rate of exports compared with the previous years. He added that the sectors covered by the tax repayment program are represented in ready-made clothes, upholstery, yarn, food industries, vegetables, fruit, citruses, and charter flights.
The household upholstery exports went up to some 22 million dollars within less than two months and the yarn and textile exports amounted to 4.1 million dollars within less than two months.
The number of companies benefiting from backup and tax repayment program reached 71 including 18 companies representing the upholstery sector, 10 companies representing the yarn and textile sector, 12 companies representing the food industries sector, 7 companies representing the vegetables and fruit sector, and 3 companies representing the citruses sector in addition to some companies doing different activities.
He said in order to have the cash the exporter must present all the documents proving the completion of export operation mainly including bill of lading, customs certificates and other relevant documents.
Experts and investors in Egyptian information and software industry warned against the international companies controlling some 95% of the local market. They also warned of the difficult conditions impeding the development and growth of national industry, which threatens some 350 Egyptian software companies with liquidation and hinders the implementation of ambitious program for raising software exports to two billion dollars during the next five years, compared with about 50 million dollars now.
Such talented youth can Arabicize the various international applications.
He highlighted the necessity of cancelling or reducing high taxes, which hinder the enhancement of national software competitiveness. Banking facilities should be granted along with medium-sized loans at half the applied interest rate to faltering companies with periods of grace, he said.
The Egyptian software companies have great potential that qualifies them to compete internally and externally especially in the field of Arabicization and amendment according to the customer's needs.
Assets and obstacles: At local level, the study says that Egypt has stupendous potentials in the field of software that qualify the IT industry to contribute over 50% of the country's annual exports, explaining that the total of software production reached about $ 30 million in 2000 while exports generated by design of electronic circuits totaled about $ 90 million. The study points out that developing countries lack an essential requirement of progress in the IT field, as advanced countries have about 95% of the computers in the world, which leaves developing nations, including China, with only 5%. The study also reveals that there are some problems that impede the advancement of the information technology industry in Egypt, widening the gap between Egypt and advanced countries in this domain. The most significant problem is the low budget of research and development, which is not more than 0.3% of the country's GDP at $ 300 million, at the time when the R&D budget in the United States is in the region of $ 171 billion.
"ARTHUR ANDERSEN" EGYPT MERGES WITH "PRICE WATER HOUSE"
He added that the merger contract had been signed between the two parties several days earlier and the merger operation would be carried out within the coming weeks in order to bring about the biggest international accounting office in Egypt and the Middle East.
The seminar will be attended by the Romanian Commercial Counsellor in Cairo and the members of the Egyptian-Romanian Business Council. It will discuss the most significant problems that obstruct Egyptian exporters.
The two sides probed the possibility of travel and tourist agencies in both countries preparing joint tourist programs at competitive prices in order to attract more tourists, mount international fairs in the two countries, cooperate in the field of training human cadres, study the launching of joint marketing and promotional campaigns and boost aviation movement between the two countries.
Chairman of Modernization Committee and Undersecretary of Federation of Egyptian Industries, Mr.SShafiq Baghdadi stated that this came within the framework of the Federation's efforts to provide the necessary funding for developing the Egyptian industry. These external soft loans include $300 million from the Korean Development Bank and $150 million from the Japanese Development Bank.
They are the National Program for the Modernization of Industry and Modernization Program, which will be carried out in cooperation with the EU through the EU-Egyptian Partnership Agreement that would last for a specific period.
The report included the value of the industrial production that hit LE168 billion in 2001, an increase of 229% compared to 1991.
BAN ON EGYPTIAN CITRUS EXPORTS TO CHINA LIFTED
Qassem highlighted the importance of the Sino-Egyptian Business Council. He demanded the quick formation of ad hoc committees and their agendas to help them form concepts of development in different areas.
It might be mentioned that GAI Chairman, Dr. Mohamed Al-Ghamrawi has received the Indian commercial attaché in Cairo along with representatives of the Indian company and a number of representatives of Egyptian companies operative in the field of IT during their participation in a workshop organized by the GAI to consider the establishment of joint projects pertinent to the majors of the respective company as follows:
About 100 Egyptian companies participating in the 4th round of the Egyptian products exhibition in mid-April current in Baghdad plan to conclude fresh deals with the Iraqi party valued at over 300 million dollars in the fields of land and maritime transport, pharmaceutical manufacture, auto industry, foodstuffs, household devices, electric appliances and railroad carriages.
On the other hand, a delegation representing the Egyptian Industries Federation visiting Iraq on the exhibition sidelines will discuss the implementation of a number of projects with the Iraqi party including two joint land and maritime transport companies. Cooperation will also be sought in the field of medicine and medical supplies and developing means of detection and analysis. In addition, vistas of available cooperation in the sectors of petroleum, agricultural pesticide, electricity, railroads and housing will be considered. The delegation will also discuss ways and means of doubling the volume of trade exchange between Cairo and Baghdad this year to 3 billion dollars against 1.7 billion dollars last year.
Italy is still considered the biggest market for the Egyptian exports within the EU. Egyptian exports to Italy during this period hit some 333 million dollars.
Such studies will be submitted to the Austrian Federal Chamber of Commerce to present Austrian businessmen and investors with them, said the Authority Chairman, Dr. Mohamed Al-Ghamrawi.
EGYPTIAN PHOSPHATE COMES BACK TO ASIAN MARKETS
A joint delegation from the World Bank and African Bank for Development has started consultation with the Egyptian government and met with Premier Atef Ebeid and members of the economic ministerial group.
Mass media coordinator with the Bank in Cairo Hanan Deweidar, said that the delegation would meet representatives of the private sector, donors and academics in order to get an overall view of development issues.
He added that should the programme set by the government with the World Bank be approved, its steps would be put into effect following the elapse of about two months after starting the implementation of its steps. He added that $2 billion would be put at Egypt's disposal next autumn.
EGYPTIAN EXPERIENCE IN PLANTING RICE TRANSFERRED TO 14 AFRICAN COUNTRIES
She said that this training programme aims at enhancing the experience of the representatives of the participating countries with a view to benefiting from all modern techniques in the field of growing rice, increasing its productivity and being acquainted with the Egyptian advanced experience in this field, especially that rice is the main staple in these countries.
The complaint also included the measures taken by two Egyptian pharmaceutical companies which withdrew their assets accounting for 5 billion pounds from one of such joint banks due to such a campaign, which has quickly spread among members of Medical Professions Union, Medical Association and Pharmacists Syndicate who, in their turn, called on the two companies to forge ahead with such an action. The campaign has proceeded to the extent that 20 senior depositors have withdrawn their funds hitting 7 billion pounds within the framework of this very campaign.
The committee pointed out the default of four American factories operative in the industries of foodstuffs, garments and car spare parts in an industrial zone due to an unprecedented decrease in their sales.
GAMAA ISLAMEYA ENTERS A NEW STAGE AFTER IDEOLOGICAL RECONSIDERATIONS AND PLANS TO ESTABLISH A POLITICAL PARTY
The Islamic group would thus try to found a party away from well-known names as it would be declined by considerable sectors of the Egyptian society, let alone the state that rejects the establishment of any parties on religious bases according to previous government statements.
The editorial article on the front page is under this heading and it is written by Dr. Refaat Al-Said, the chairman of Al-Ahali and the general secretary of the Tagamo'h Party. He says:
IRANIAN'S QUOTA IN MISR IRAN DEVELOPMENT BANK TO BE INCREASED
The Iranian Foreign Investment Company, which is owned by the Iranian government, is currently contributing 20% to the MIDB capital. The remaining percentage is shared out between Bank of Alexandria and Misr Insurance Company by 40% for each, Omar pointed out.
It might be mentioned that the government had offered in May 2000 the sale of its quota in MIDB and had received only one bid by the aforementioned Iranian company. However, the bid was turned down at that time under the pretext of being the only offer, something that runs counter to the specification documents. Besides, the prices were not appropriate for the evaluation prepared by the Central Auditing Agency, the supervisor of such deals.
Looking into what is going on at the moment, Israel has certainly backtracked on the peace process and scrapped Madrid terms of reference and Oslo accords, he said. If the Arab world fails to reconsider such conditions, it will find itself before two options: becoming economic "hirelings" to this industrialized country in in the middle of the Arab world or making preparations for the military option once more, he said, adding that there is no compromise.
"Resistance is a legal right to every occupied people and 'martyrdom' operations are an integral part of this right," said Mrs Arafat.
Regarding Arafat's condition, she said, "Contacts are difficult between me and Abou Ammar, and most of these contacts are made through the mobile when possible. Praise be to God, his health condition is good and reassuring.
During his meeting on April 12th with a delegation from Arab Press Association's General Secretariat, Al-Hariri wondered how the EU parliament meeting could take a decision about European countries' relations with Israel while the Arab states have heard nothing in that regard.
Powell's statements synchronized with reports delivered by the French diplomacy in Beirut to Lebanese senior officials voicing serious concerns over the Hebrew state preparing for a military strike against Lebanon including Syrian targets in it.
The Pentagon suggested favourable response to Jordan's request to buy a sophisticated radar that would allow Jordan to monitor Iraqi land and air movements and would enable Jordanian air forces to enable Jordan's vital centers to hold before a sweep until allies' reinforcements reach the battlefield. The Pentagon emphasized that "Jordan is threatened with a hostile neighbour."
"It added that selling Jordan that radar "A.N.F.SS 3 D" to the value of $22 million could promote military relations between the U.S.A. and Jordan which has a strategic position in the Middle East and has been a constant ally to America for over 30 years.
The Jordanian Finance Minister announced his country's intention to cancel the subsidy of the currently subsidized commodities. This means that prices of bread and all fuels, save benzine, will go up.
AN ORGANIZATION CLOSE TO AL-QAEDA CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY FOR JERBA SYNAGOGUE OPERATION
BOUTEFLIKA VOWS TO USE FORCE AGAINST ANYONE WHO IMPEDES ELECTIONS
He had also been secretary general of the Ministry of Public Justice when the incumbent Prime Minister, Ali Bin Felis, was minister of justice in 1992.
The President said in a directive that was promulgated by the Presidential Office on 17 April that the Ministry of the Interior had been assigned a number of tasks. The most important task was the treatment of nomination files from the perspective of compliance with law, particularly where provisions related to illegibility were concerned, the directive said, in a direct hint to those who were banned from running in the elections by the law, such as members of armed Islamic groups who have laid down their arms within the context of the arrangements prescribed by the civil concord law.
The leaders are believable in one thing only: they can not confront Israel. The Arab armies are not ready to fight against the enemy for they were not formed for this purpose. Just like police forces, the Arab armies are principally dedicated to preserving national security and the regimes in the end. But, even this limited task is not left for the armies but for the security agencies controlled by the ruler's close allies.
A few days back, a Saudi girl proposed in an interview with the Qatari Al-Jazeera satellite channel that a single pilot from each Arab military move to attack Israeli positions and help lift the siege laid to the Palestinian people.
Spain and the U.S.A. have signed an agreement for military cooperation under which the former acquires several military privileges such as American weaponry and information about the countries it considers as future enemies, while the latter achieved its central goal by expanding Rota base at the Cadiz province in South Spain and acquiring the right of American intelligence bodies to practice activities in that European country, which was considered by some political and non-governmental organizations as undermining Spain's sovereignty.
The most important advantage Spain has got out of the new agreement is that the Spanish army would get access to sensitive data about the neighbouring countries within the framework of the data exchange between the two counties.
In the meantime, the agreement included allowing the American intelligence bodies to act on Spanish territories, which makes Spain the first European country to give Washington access to such a privilege.
SUZANNE MUBARAK LEADS A MARCH IN SUPPORT OF THE PALESTINIANS AS FAR AS EGYPTIAN RAFAH
The sources referred that a big pavilion would be set up at Rafah border crossing point to mount a massive conference in support of the Palestinian people.
In his Friday sermon which he delivered in the holy mosque, he said that "the nation must search for its resources of power" as material power lies in the preparation of what means are required by self-defence in order to achieve victory. Such preparations, he added, do not necessarily, mean the declaration of war, but rather prevent it. He described such preparations as "armed peace".
He added that, "The true mettle of nations and their right to enjoy freedom and safety from degradation can only be demonstrated by the valour of its men as well as the order of battle it prepares for the time of war. If a nation has both valour and prudence no body will dare to do it wrong."
Two months back, Orascom Telecom won an international tender in Tunisia, in which several Arab and foreign companies took part, as it put in the best offer of 454 million U.S. dollars. According to informed sources, Orascom Telecom was supposed to pay 50 percent, or 227 million U.S. dollars, of the deal value to the Tunisian ministry of communications ahead of signing the contract, with the remaining sum to be paid before the end of this year. But, the delay aroused several worries to the extent that other companies may do the job in place of the Egyptian company.
The company's problems at several Arab company, especially the Algerian and Syrian ones, may lead to the same fate it faced at the Tunisian market, the sources added.
In a message to the People's Assembly on the agreement Foreign Minister, Ahmed Maher said that it included cooperation in four fields which are the basic and applied researches in atomic energy peaceful applications, considering installing, operating and amending nuclear power stations and research nuclear reactors, as well as surveying and prospecting for uranium fields and manufacturing nuclear fuel elements and joint development of newly devised reactors technologies.
American companies and their consumer and luxury goods have been facing extensive pressure on Gulf and some other Arab markets, the strongest of its kind since bilateral trade relations were established amid American concern that such pressure might extend to some highly consumer Islamic markets. This has urged a big number of American companies and their representatives in the Arab region to organize mass media and propaganda campaigns to minimize such pressure.
Gulf currencies, furthermore, are linked to the dollar.
Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the UAE 	According to American official statistics, there are three Arab countries, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the UAE that account for 80% of American goods to the Arab marekts to the value of $12.3 billion. Such countries have witnessed strong popular campaigns calling for boycotting American goods in solidarity with the Palestinian people and their markets are dominated by invisible American exports.
Israeli forces, therefore, have deployed scores of snipers along the borders to prevent infiltration operations.
One of Rafah inhabitants said to Asharq Al-Awsat on a telephone call, "It has become normal these days to be suddenly stopped by a youth in the street who would ask you how to infiltrate into Palestinian lands or to help him attain that end."
EGYPTIAN PILOTS REFUSE TO FLY TO ISRAEL
It is preferable for the time being to cancel such flights for mere economic reasons.
A big number of pilots have voiced indignation about EgyptAir insistence on its flights between Cairo-Tel Aviv.

BUSINESSMEN: 5-POINT STRATEGY TO BACK PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE
In a statement the EBA chaired by Said al-Tawil said it would take the following three immediate actions:
First: Trying the passive resistance weapon through requesting every Palestinian and Arab citizen in Israel to go on strike until the Palestinians can restore their rights, with paying an appropriate amount of money to those who respond to the call. If this action continues for one year, then it will cost around 2 billion U.S. dollars per year. But, if it is put in place, Israeli economy will incur serious losses.
Fifth: Stopping the Arab governments' purchases of U.S. weapons, civil planes and food products such as wheat so that the U.S. economy should know it is paying for the total American bias towards Israel.
Vatican or Catholic Patriarch's representative in Egypt John Qalta rejected any distinction between Al-Aqsa Mosque and Nativity Church as both of them are holy places for billions of people. Israel, he maintained, attaches no importance to the whole world and does not consider holy sites or other religions for it does not recognize them originally. Rather, it recognizes only the language of force and pays no heed to religious feelings since it knows very well that we live in a world that respects only economic, military and political force.

Amalgamation is considered a means used by stockbrokerage firms to face up to the sharp dearth of resources.

EBEID: EGYPT READY TO FIGHT FOR $ 100 BILLION
The Prime Minister invited those who demanded an Egyptian move against the aggression on the Palestinian people to provide Egypt with a hundred billion dollars, saying, "Let the Arab World set aside a hundred billion dollars of the Arab money in the banks of the world and tell us that this is a confrontation budget for Egypt, the leader, for starting the action."
Forget all about it. Egypt can defend itself, but sending the Egyptian Army out of the Egyptian borders is out of the question. No Arab country is capable of military intervention at present."
The sources said that the message from the Egyptian people that the Star-of-David flag on top of the Israeli Embassy was a cause of severe provocation for all members of the Egyptian people had been received loud and clear by the Israeli diplomats, making them feel the extent of popular rejection surrounding them.
They added that the Egyptian Army was capable of defending Egyptian territories against any dangers that emerged and that the Egyptian Armed Forces would not wait for any foreign material support to achieve that mission.
Major General Salah Eddin Selim, strategic expert, denied that the Egyptian Army could be a bunch of mercenaries that might be hired for defending the Arabs. He affirmed that the strategic missions of the Egyptian Armed Forces included defending all the Egyptian soil and being ready to support sisterly Arab countries according to Egyptian national interests.
He wishes that Egypt was ruled by a strong government headed by President Hosni Mubarak that would be aware of the dimensions of strategic planning and inspired by the objectives and interests of Arab national security, so that it might prepare for an inevitable confrontation with the Zionist enemy and a next round that would certainly come first with Syria and Lebanon and then with Egypt, or with Egypt alone, under circumstances that Israel was waiting for.
Restricting the confrontation with Israel to Egypt is an escape from the responsibility of Arab states for the Palestinian cause.
Q: Anyone who examines the map of political parties in Egypt will see representation of all political groups.
A religious agenda, or ruling in the name of religion, divides the country and fuels rifts.
Q: Excuse me, Mr Prime Minister, but there is an experiment of hardline religious parties in Israel, where these parties practice a political role.
Q: But they have political agendas.
It is against the interests of the community.
Q: There might be foreign quarters that fuel the sectarian rift in Egypt.
I saw in university that once the religious identity began, bigotry started.
They would have a book which they say they believe in and there is nothing but it.
A: Because you wouldn't allow the other opinion to be expressed and that is all. Because you would classify the community into believers and unbelievers.
Any non-political classification remains doctrinal.
"This aid has hurt Egypt," Dr Hassan affirmed. "We have given much in return for this aid, and they (the Americans) have benefited more from it than we have, for the assistance funds spent on their advisers and spies are more than what is spent on the good of this country.
The Chairman of the Egyptian Businessmen's Society, Said Al Taweel, will voluntarily retire next month, after 25 years in this position, during which he led the society in battles against five successive governments until it now has a say in the economic situation and circulates its recommendations to all government and private bodies.
A: Unfortunately, the situation is not reassuring. There is a state of frustration within the community, and commercial activity is still more sluggish than before. A new thing has emerged, too: there is a loss of confidence between the citizen and the businessman on one side and the Government on the other. This has eroded the morale of the people in general, which makes it imperative to find the reasons and reach a solution quickly.
A: Yes. We businessmen have gone through very difficult moments over the past years, but what we are going through at present increases the fear that treating the country's economic situation may extend for years, which would lead to an economic congestion that rarely happens.
Q: How do you see economic cooperation with Israel?
A: We signed an initial cooperation agreement, but it did not serve its purpose because of Tel Aviv's negative attitude towards the Middle East peace process. I am revealing now, and for the first time, that several delegations from Israel tried more than once to meet with members of the Egyptian Businessmen's Society last month, but to no avail. I support economic relations with Israel, but only at the right time, and according to our desire, not theirs.
A: I believe that taking such action suddenly may do the Arabs more harm than it would serve their interests. If such action has to be taken, things must be considered carefully and with everybody's participation. Economy does not need emotion; it needs reason and wisdom.

Sharon is the one who lost the battle as the Israelis themselves have recognized.
Palestinian communications network will be linked to the Egyptian network using a special code as it will be separated from the Israeli network.
Certainly the Palestinian resistance has suffered a lot as a result of the Operation Defensive Wall. Israeli Chief of Staff Shaol Mofaz has admitted to the arresting of 5000 elements including 1400 primary activists.
In light of all this, we can safely say that the Operation Defensive Wall not only blasted the theory of the "Palestinian safe resort" but also transcended that to crushing all military efforts accumulated over a year and half as such operation did not use to take place before the establishment of the Palestinian Authority or even when the escalation was at its peak in the aftermath of the Ibrahimi Shrine massacre operations and the operations in retaliation for assassinating martyr Yehia Ayash.
At the military level, Haartez newspaper quoted Israeli Minister of Defence Benjamin bin Eliezer as saying "It is impossible to uproot the terrorist structure.
There can be no 100% solution."
The new thing demonstrated by the Operation Defensive Wall is the martyrdom heroic sense created by the Jenin epic in particular.
What happened will constitute or rather has already constituted, for all the material and human losses incurred, a victory for the concept of resistance which would take root in Palestinian as well as Arab and Muslim conscience. This will make any backtracking from it or falling back on Tenet or Mitchell miserable options for instance a rather difficult option indeed except in the context of political suicide, which seems unlikely, except in one case only - a successful American strike against Iraq, even though it is not deterministic and even if it officially proved to be a success, the popular awareness would reject it so that steadfastness and heroism would continue.
In addition to the dearth in water supplies and the Israeli forces draining water resources, Palestinian water authority has pointed out that drainage water are being pumped into the underground wells used by the Palestinians who find it difficult to get it, let alone its great salinity and high nitrate rates, which cause serious contagious diseases besides their dangers to agriculture.

MEDIA PLAN FOR EXPOSING ISRAEL'S PRACTICES BEFORE INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC OPINION FROZEN

It is to be mentioned that Ben Hagg has been spending 12 year-sentence since 1991.
"By doing these acts, the United States has breached every treaty between itself and the Muslims, because Muslims are of one and the same covenant (the Believers are but a single brotherhood).

Israel asked the USA to greenlight it to strike 12 sites inside Syrian soil.
It might be mentioned that Bush's Administration had informed the Syrian leadership in high-ranking contacts in the last few days of a strongly-worded warning. It considered that Israel had the right to respond with the means it sees appropriate to any military or commando operations launched from the Lebanese territories or to any escalation in the activities and operations launched by Hezbollah against Israeli sites.
Q: The Zionist massacres are on while Arab and Muslim rulers declare they are powerless and can only warn and denounce.
They prove that we sympathize with one another and therefore I openly call for further demonstrations everywhere in the world as one of the degrees of jihad (holy war). Q: if you see it as jihad, do you think that anybody no matter what position he occupies has the right to prevent a Muslim being martyred, as that is the highest rank of jihad?
Q: You described the demonstrations as volcanoes erupting throughout the Islamic nation. How can such rage be exploited and directed in favour of the Islamic nation? A: It can be exploited through economic jihad by boycotting American and Israeli goods and know that every piastre paid for an American or Israeli product turns into bullets in the chests of our brethren Palestinian people and that what we buy is not only religiously impermissible, but one of the major sins.
Why don't all oil countries follow the suit of Iraq or at least cut down their oil production by 50%?
Martyrdom operations resist occupiers, a hero blowing himself up for the sake of his country, honour and people. He is therefore a martyr while the other sacrifices the plane passengers who entrusted their lives to him. The occupiers, on the other hand, had authorized him to kill them through their presence on his land. Both the means and ends are different, therefore and hence the September 11th incidents were denounced by most scholars.
In a strongly worded oration transmitted by the Saudi television, Sheikh Assudeissi stressed that the Arabs should bid farewell to peace initiatives with the Jews whom he described as "the dregs of humanity, killers of prophets, and grandsons of apes and pigs".

ANKARA CONCERNED OVER "SECRET DIALOGUE" BETWEEN WASHINGTON & IRAQI KURDS

The banker, who preferred to stay unidentified, pointed out a deposit withdrawal operation that took place when clashes between Hizbullah fighters and the Israeli forces were at their peak on Shebaa Farms and when disputes popped up between power centres.
The banker, nevertheless, added, "If the Israeli-Palestinian crisis eased up, Lebanon might benefit from Arab investors and holidaymakers boycotting pro-Israel countries or even the countries sympathizing with Israel."
The scenario was also discussed in a meeting between Bush and Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdel-Aziz on April 25. One day earlier, the U.S. plan was discussed in Cairo during recent contacts between U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, President Hosni Mubarak and Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher.
This U.S. suggestion was the focus of recent talks between Prince Abdullah and Bush in his Texas ranch, with the conference to be devoted to discussing the recognition of a Palestinian state following a timetable for marathon talks and negotiations between the Palestinian and Israeli sides, which should not exceed 25 weeks at most.
In a statement to the Agence France Presse (AFP), an Arab official who requested anonymity said, "The recent American pressure on Israel came as a result of the firm attitude expressed by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah to President George Bush during their recent meeting, during which Prince Abdullah gave a promise to put an end to martyrdom attacks in return."
The document presented by Prince Abdullah lays down the groundwork for a political process that would follow the Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territories that Israel has reoccupied since 28 March this year. It also calls for "abandoning violence."
Meanwhile, Jordanian King Abdullah revealed, for the first time, a serious Israeli attempt to replace Palestinian President Yasser Arafat that had been aborted, affirming that Israel had worked for isolating the Palestinian leadership and installing a substitute one.
Suicidal operations are just launched from time to time by Palestinians whom the Israeli occupation has driven to the point of despair of the political process. This takes us to the second question, which is, to what extent these operations affected the Palestinian struggle against the Israeli occupation?.
We are saying again here to all those who plan for operations that target Israeli civilians: Stop this pattern of action, because it is very harmful to the higher Palestinian interest and gives Sharon and his government priceless material to use against the Palestinian people in international fora.
As we went to meet the Patriarch Nicola of the Greek Orthodox Church in Egypt and the Patriarchal head of the affairs of the church's Arab Community, those present in St. Nicholas Church in Misr Al-Gadida were raising their hands in prayers to God to save the Church of the Nativity. We put these questions to him:
Q: How do you see the Western-American silence toward what is happening in the Church of the Nativity?
A: This whole matter needs to have its foundations clarified. In the days of the Byzantine Empire the emperor was the protector of the church. With the fall of this empire there was no emperor and the church no longer interfered in matters of politics but its positions on worldly affairs became based on ethical and humanitarian bases. While the Catholic Church had the Pope as head of the Vatican and as head of state, the Orthodox Church has the patriarch as a religious and not as a worldly head.
Every rule, however, has exceptions. Hence, the American position on Palestine generally and the holy places, whether Islamic or Christian, differs. The American position stems from a feeling of the arrogance of power. It is the sole and absolute power without any humanist perspective on what is going on in the world. It only looks at what it sees from the perspective of its interests without realizing that its interests reside in being a part of the human entity as a single great power.

Establishing relations between the two countries is brought about as per a general rule in the international law on the basis of agreement and satisfaction between the two parties while severing relations is done individually, he said. The provision of the peace treaty signed in 1979 are subject to UN and international law principles in this regard.
There are many legal pretexts on the basis of which the Egyptian decision-maker can take the decision of severing relations, he indicated.

The government gives priority to selling loss-making companies in 2002 as some 57 companies would be put up for sale, of which 49 companies are salvaged ones, said Minister of Public Enterprise Sector Mukhtar Khattab, who added that this act was aiming to boost the efficiency of those companies through transferring their ownership to the private sector, which, in turn, would pump new investments so as to improve quality and increase production.

The procedures also include increasing the Egyptian partner's share in the production, so as to increase the quantity of the product available for exportation through rationalization of investment expenditure and the operation costs recovered by production companies in foreign currency. As a result, these costs have gone down by 12% due to the maximization of the role of national companies in these projects, the rationalization of expenditures on required commodities and services by the committees that had been formed for that purpose and the employment of the stockpile database in all the subsidiaries of the petroleum sector to reduce imports.
Al-Sae'di pointed out that the total production value of projects in governorates amounted to one billion and 652 million pounds at investment costs hitting one billion pounds.
HUSSEIN EIDID: FUTURE OF SOMALIA IN AFRICA, WE WON'T BE AN ARAB STATE
"We believe that the Somali people are African rather than Arab and that Somalia is only a member in the Arab League. The Somali nation by no means belongs to the Arabs or Arabism," he said.
He claimed that the Arab funds, which go into Somalia, did not help reconstruct it but rather escalate the civil war and destabilize the situation.
High-ranking Palestinian sources said that Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Abdul- Aziz was contacting Hamas and Islamic Jihad movements to invite their leaderships to Riyadh and persuade them to renounce martyrdom operations once and for all and support the Palestinian chairman's authority.
They went on to say that the Palestinian President's reply was not positive as he rejected the tripartite meeting as that would mean that Fatah movement could be treated on par with the other groups. He said that any meeting of the Palestinian groups is a purely domestic affair that should be left to the Authority itself so that it would tackle it as it used to do in the past.
This question has been a bone of contention among the Muslim countries since the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) member countries, which failed to settle this issue and reach a certain definition of terrorism.

AMBASSADOR TAHA AL FARNAWANI: RESISTANCE IS THE SOLUTION
"Faced with Israel's strength and viciousness, there was nothing that Arafat could do but accept the proposal, in a bid to win a respite for regaining strength.
Until this recognition happens, the resistance will continue in such a manner that seriously affects the security of the Israelis until they finally pressure their government into accepting the establishment of the Palestinian state."
CAIRO CRITICIZES AMERICAN "BLUNDERING", URGES ARAFAT TO "CONTROL STREET"
An Egyptian delegation headed by Foreign Minister Ahmad Maher and Presidential Political Adviser Dr Usama Al Baz had held talks with President Arafat in Ramallah on 5 May.
They also said that they believed that the "blundering of the U.S. Administration, particularly between Secretary of State Powell and National Security Adviser Rice, undermines the possibility of success of the efforts for calming the situation and reaching a total, enduring and just peace."
The Committee issued a statement, urging the US to pressurize Israel, which challenges the world in its entirety.
During the visit, the Egyptian delegation, which included Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher and President Hosni Mubarak's Political Advisor Osama al-Baz, asked Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to choose either the Intifada or the peace process, adjust his positions and rearrange the Palestinian house from within and abroad, the source told Ashraq Al- Awsat.
The chief editor of Al Gomhouria, Samir Ragab, chose this title for his weekly article, in which he said:
If such a case had existed, the whole world would never have rid itself from occupation, bar Palestine, which has resisted and resisted and will continue to do so until the Will of Allah is done, so that an independent, sovereign Palestinian state may exist or a violent resistance becomes even fiercer, and let the despicable go to hell.
It was Ariel Sharon who bulldozed the noble bodies of children in Jenin; it was him who took the lives of countless men, young and old alike, in Nablus, Bethlehem, Qalqiliya, Ramallah and many others.
On June 10, the Egyptian State Council's Commissioners Authority is forecast to settle a dispute over the trial of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and a number of incumbent and former Israeli officials on a charge of mass murders against Egyptian and Arab POWs in the 1956 and 1967 wars.

They mentioned that Welch had offered extending American aid to complete some service projects in Giza, the execution of which had been interrupted due to lack of financial allocations. He also pledged to encourage American investments on Cairo-Alexandria desert road.

In an important interview with Al Osboa, the Prime Minister, Dr Atef Ebeid, denied the claims that he had asked for a hundred billion dollars as a price for Egypt's adoption of the military option.
Q: Was it for this reason that you said that all countries, including Egypt, would not be capable of military intervention?
Was your talk about taking care not to send any Egyptian troops out of the country's borders related to the restrictions imposed by the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty?
Q: Why do you insist on saying that there is not a country in the Arab World that is capable of military intervention?
It is very easy to outbid others and be a slogan monger, but it is wise to see the real situation and all its aspects and speak accordingly.
Egypt has signed a peace treaty that we respect and abide by.
Q: But some might counter by asking why you are asking the Arabs to invest in your country if your economy is advanced and strong. What is your comment to that?
"The Palestinian National Authority's (PNA) acceptance of placing some of its personnel under international protection is a matter that affects the world's respect of us. By so doing, we have given the world community reasons for convicting the Palestinians under an international umbrella, at a time when we have not heard about questioning Israel about its crimes in Jenin, something that exposes Arafat to many questions by different Palestinian forces," he said.
In a dialogue with the members of the Egyptian Writers' Union, Dr. Al-Fiqi said during its latest aggression on the Palestinians, Israel achieved great successes that would lead to a state of disability for the Palestinian resistance capabilities for some time. Israel wants to live in the Arab region, control it and establish relations with the Gulf States, he said. The current Saudi role should be placed in the framework of the Israeli desire to have the (other) Gulf States move towards it and to have them play a role in the future of relations with Israel. The Saudi initiative is part of this long-term Israeli concept of how to deal with the region, Dr. Al-Fiqi pointed out.
The repugnant images and dirty crimes, which are unprecedented in history, have started to reach the Western public opinion, even though the Western media do not transmit except what serves Israel's purposes. Therefore, Israel has started to lose a ground on the propaganda side after it had gained a lot after the Second Camp David in 2000 when it made the world believe that it made big concessions to the Palestinians, who did not accept them, despite the fact that there were no specific matters rejected by the Palestinians.
Mohammad Abul Hadid, deputy chief editor of Al Gomhouria, wrote:
It is certainly a view that we reject, but exists all the same, and what Sharon has done and is trying to do are executive steps for imposing it, by force if necessary.
The Israeli decision, which was blessed by both right and left, was to confront this Palestinian attitude with all force.
The existing points of reference for peace, i.e. UN Security Council resolutions 242, 338 and others and the Madrid Principles, are not holy script; the only holy thing is Israel's security.
He has succeeded in putting President Arafat under siege, but he has not succeeded in eliminating him; he has even turned Arafat from a Palestinian symbol into a national Arab hero in the eyes of all Arabs.
Second, he tried to persuade Washington not to adhere to the existing points of reference for peace and accept only Sharon's point of reference.
-Pressuring moderate Arab States into accepting that, while pressuring the non- moderate Arabs into refraining from objection.
Jihad Al Khazin, former chief editor of Al Hayat, wrote: So long as there is occupation, there will be resistance.
However, he also affirmed that the Islamic resistance had not lost its effectiveness and was still well and would replenish its losses and grasp the initiative again.
However, the Palestinian stand, i.e. that of Yasser Arafat, and the Arab position continue to deal with settlement although its elements are not ready yet," he explained.
Meanwhile, the response of Arab peoples to the resistance has been magnificent and continuous in his view. He believes that the resistance did not go out of Jenin or Nablus in defeat, and therefore there was no reason for Ariel Sharon to dictate his conditions, "as if we were Japan and Germany at the end of World War Two."
Egyptian-Israeli trade sharply dropped in 2001 as Egypt's export to Israel hit 194 million U.S. dollars, down 75 million U.S. dollars compared to 2000, while imports amounted to 18 million U.S. dollars, a nosedive of 6 million U.S. dollars, Egyptian governmental reports said.

He stressed the importance of chasing and seizing commodities of unknown origin, which are mostly from Israel.
The Interpress Service Agency cited Gabi Bar, the director of the Israeli Ministry of Industry's Middle East Department, as saying that the political situation in the region raises the fears of businessmen.
Samiha Fawzy, an expert with the Centre for Economic Studies in Egypt, told the Interpress Service Agency that economic relations with Israel are not really important for the Egyptian economy and, hence, a boycott can easily be enforced.
"However," he went on, "there is not even one bank in Egypt now that finances any operations related to Israel, out of patriotism and awareness of the magnitude of the crimes committed by the occupation forces against the Palestinian people."
Moreover, the Chairman of the General Division of Exchange Company Owners in the Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Mohammad Hassan Al Abyad, affirmed that all exchange companies had declared a full boycott of transactions in Israeli shekel.

On May 16th, the Cabinet decided to ban the selling of Sinai-based investment companies either directly or through putting up their stocks in the Stock Exchange unless a prior permit was got from the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAIFZ).

Gamal Tayeh of Rose Al-Youssef Magazine wrote an article to the following effect, only in part: No one at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expected that Ann Kroger, US Commissioner at the IMF, would object to the Egyptian demand to obtain credit facilities. Kroger used the right of veto to obstruct these credits until Egypt fulfilled all the stipulated conditions related to the rate of exchange, devaluation of the Egyptian pound, repairing the balances of payments and trade, and fixing the budget deficit.
But under the pressure of several questions he started embarrassingly to answer. Abdul-Shakour said, "Egypt did not make any demands to the IMF and it did not ask for the IMF interference to execute new programmes. This means that Egypt does not need any new counsel from the IMF and all the indicators show that Egypt is moving steadily according to the economic reform programme which had been signed with the IMF at the beginning of the nineties. Egypt is also punctually abiding by foreign payment commitments." Egypt's reserves of hard currency did not plummet considerably, but Egypt would have to accelerate the execution of its privatization programme and convert all its big public projects into private ones.
This request is rejected by America which put hurdles in front of it in order not to be put into effect." "I am upset because of the tricks that are done to exert political pressure on Egypt. The tone of "misleading figures" presented by Egypt about its economy before 1998 is frequently stated.
Therefore, the IMF is putting pressure on Egypt to move its exchange rate and devalue the pound claiming that it (IMF) is going to give Egypt loan facilities.

The Prime Minister, Dr Atef Ebeid, once again resumed the issue of his "problematic" interview with the Qatari Al Watan newspaper, which was criticized by the Egyptian press and opposition parties.
"Touching these relations is like a red line that nobody should cross," he said. "Those who read my interview upside down and in light of their own whims and ill intentions adopted the same view and line of thought of the Israeli newspaper Maariv, which interpreted the interview just like they did, which was to link the hundred billion dollars to the return to the military option by Egypt.
The Prime Minister concluded by saying that he had talked about the hundred billion dollars as investments for reinforcing the Egyptian economy, thus boosting Egypt's position and moves at political level, pointing out that he had not requested that amount as grants or loans.

They pointed out that the political leadership was aiming to hold early elections under the partisan list system to strengthen political parties and boost democracy, indicating that the only issue that the political leadership was trying to get over and get done with during the remainder of the parliamentary session was the passage of an urgent law that would insure the constitutionality of list elections while preserving the right of independent candidates to nomination. They also said that the Government had complained against the deputies' lack of partisan commitment when they had run in the last elections under the individual nomination system.
"Failing to mention the professional syndicates in the unified labour bill doubles the impact of the tragedy that will fall upon the members of free professions in the future," he said, calling for representation of the professional syndicates in the Supreme Council for Employment, the Supreme Council for Wages and the reconciliation and training committees that would come into existence as a result of the new bill.
The minister also launched a slashing attack on the professional syndicates, saying that they were nothing but societies that defended the turf of their members and had no relation to the defence of the work contract, which was the responsibility of the trade unions.
It does not make any difference," he told Asharq Al-Awsat. On the modification of syllabi at Al-Azhar schools and university and whether it came in compliance with relevant U.S. demands, Tantawi said the modification has nothing to do with reports that it came in response to relevant U.S. demands under the pretext that Al- Azhar syllabi advocate extremism and terrorism.

ARAFAT'S IMPOSSIBLE MISSION
Restructuring the Palestinian Authority to Sharon's measure and on the ruins of the Palestinian national forces, as per the orders of CIA Director George Tenet, is an extremely dangerous action that could lead to Palestinian infighting that Ariel Sharon, and Benyamin Netanyahu before him, failed to ignite despite the repeated attempts that both of them made.
What is required is that the Palestinian security organs be unified in one organ to be headed by a single person.
An Israeli report submitted to Bush alleges that European Union fund have been used to finance the activities of about 500 Palestinians responsible for operations against the occupation.
These intentions are summed up in the avoidance of taking any decisive actions or taking any position on the future of the occupied territories.
AMR MOUSSA: THE PROPOSED PEACE CONFERENCE IS A NEW TRAP FOR THE ARABS
He added that the current reports about the conference indicate that there is a desire to negotiate about how to negotiate to keep that vicious circle on forever thus encouraging mere sophistry and giving Israel a chance to put forward its faulty ideas which might go to the lengths of cancelling the land for peace referential as Israel would not abide by the resolutions which the conference might pass because it knows in advance that it would get away with all its crimes.

The Spanish newspaper El Pais said in a news analysis on this topic that Algerian President Bouteflika had met with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar three times over the past couple of years and that the last meeting between the two leaders had been on the margins of the Euro-Mediterranean summit in Valencia on 23 April 2002.
El Pais explained that all cooperation agreements between Spain and Morocco were on hold, while the agreements with Algeria had been extended and giant joint ventures were being considered, including the gas pipeline that would run along the coast from Oran in Algeria to Almeria; southeast of Spain and a submerged electrical cable across the Mediterranean, indicating that such projects reflected the strategic dimension that relations between Algeria and Spain were taking.
Large-scale broadside was launched against the Moroccan government for importing Israeli farming produce. However, the government remained silent.
The dispute over importing Israeli farming produce reached the Moroccan parliament after the Islamic trend accused the government of carrying on normalization of economic ties with Israel in spite of Rabat's decision on the closure of the Israeli liaison office there.
The boycott lists argued that by buying such products, we pay the price of a Zionist bullet aimed at the heart of a Palestinian child and a tank shell against Palestinian houses, mosques and churches.
The idea of the exhibition, which was scheduled to be launched in the second half of the month instant, is proposed by a group of Saudi industrial companies led by "Insulators" Company specialized in manufacturing all kinds of insulators.

Kroger used the right of veto to obstruct these credits until Egypt fulfilled all the stipulated conditions related to the rate of exchange, devaluation of the Egyptian pound, repairing the balances of payments and trade, and fixing the budget deficit.
But under the pressure of several questions he started embarrassingly to answer. Abdul-Shakour said, "Egypt did not make any demands to the IMF and it did not ask for the IMF interference to execute new programmes. This means that Egypt does not need any new counsel from the IMF and all the indicators show that Egypt is moving steadily according to the economic reform programme which had been signed with the IMF at the beginning of the nineties. Egypt is also punctually abiding by foreign payment commitments." Egypt's reserves of hard currency did not plummet considerably, but Egypt would have to accelerate the execution of its privatization programme and convert all its big public projects into private ones.
This request is rejected by America which put hurdles in front of it in order not to be put into effect." "I am upset because of the tricks that are done to exert political pressure on Egypt. The tone of "misleading figures" presented by Egypt about its economy before 1998 is frequently stated.

Dr Mohammed Rafat Osman, member of Islamic Research Academy and Dean of Al- Azhar Sharia Faculty in Cairo said that Anis Mansour's argument is neither historically or religiously true. We, as Muslims, know for sure that Mary's son, Christ, was born through a divine miracle.

Accordingly, does he have the right to receive rewards and allowances while another member or an "office boy" at parliament signs for him in the attendance roll?

The parliament deputies have, therefore, made early preparations to face that document called, "A World Worthy of Children."
Meantime, the parliament deputies hailed the opposition of 24 international Islamic organizations and the Vatican to the document which the deputies emphasized must be banned in Egypt as well as Arab and Islamic countries especially as the document entails the conversion of its items into local laws to be enforced in those countries.

A: We cannot say that only obstacles exist, for there are positive points, including the willingness of the Korean Government, business organizations and companies to boost economic relations with Egypt on progressive basis at this stage. Besides, the different business organizations in Korea are interested in familiarizing themselves with new economic developments in Egypt and how they can benefit from them for importing Egyptian products. These organizations include the Association of Foreign Trade Agents in Korea (AFTAK) and the Korean International Trade Association (KITA).
There are also many non-customs obstacles in Korea, particularly the restriction on Egyptian agricultural exports. In addition, Egypt does not participate in the expositions, fairs or other events that are organized in South Korea every year, not to mention that the Egyptian- Korean Business Council has yet to be activated. There are no programs that explain the opportunities open to Korean companies for launching operations in Egypt, either.

AMERICAN TRADE REPRESENTATIVE VISITS CAIRO TO HOLD TALKS ON FREE TRADE ZONE
During President Mubarak's recent visit last March the American Administration refused to discuss the issue of free trade zone. Before the visit, Washington had officially told Cairo how important it was to set up the free zone pointing out that no tangible progress could be made in light of the obstacles that hindered signing the agreement especially those related to standards of the structure, employment and intellectual property rights.

AT THE BEGINNING OF INDIA'S YEAR IN EGYPT: AGREEMENT ON ESTABLISHING ADVANCED SILICON VALLEY AND PLANT FOR PRODUCING THREE-WHEELERS
In this symposium Dr Al-Saidi said that the volume of trade exchange between the two countries does not reflect the reality of the developing relations with India as it hit 536 million US dollars in 2001 on par between Egypt and India. This volume, however, should be continuously increased through setting up joint investment projects. He pointed to the possibility of manufacturing three-wheeler cars, in which India is distinguished, to be widely used in Egypt particularly in tourist places and Upper Egypt.

Arab sources said that the softening of the Syrian position in the Arab micro-summit held in Sharm El- Sheikh on Saturday, came in return for the Arabs sponsoring the Syrian point of view regarding the peace conference promoted by both Washington and Israel.
According to an Arab diplomat, who refused to identify himself, Syria keeps pacifying America and avoiding any confrontation with it. It has been among the Arab countries that showed absolute opposition to terrorism in the aftermath of September 11th incidents.
It is an advance that might tempt us to approach the negotiating table, he said.
The features of such a role, then started to crystallize more when the summit sponsored the Crown Prince's initiative.
The most prominent of such features is what the New York Times called the new strategy of the peace process ensuing from an understanding between Crown Prince Abdullah Bin Abdel-Aziz and the American President.
Another feature also is the fact that Saudi Arabia is a direct active party in deciding the form of the negotiations international conference and the bases on which it would be built.
The alliance relationship between Saudi Arabia and the USA is completely free of any impurities of doubt or burdens of unilateral need.
All this invests the Saudi role with a degree of credibility in the face of the Israeli era and gives it a sort of detachedness that should be exploited in a way that allows it to grow and develop proportionately with its weight, thus giving it a different tinge but complete integration with the other roles especially the Egyptian one.
The question now is, "Will Saudi Arabia succeed where Egypt has failed?
Saudi Arabia has to give momentum to the liberalization of the peace process so that it might become a balanced political process.
The American administration reasserted its commitment to the Palestinian state, opposition to the settlement policy and rejection of the idea of having Arafat replaced.
A Saudi government official told Asharq Al-Awsat on May 13 that his country had taken anti-money laundering measures through forming new agencies to control financial institutions in Saudi Arabia, which will undertake full cooperation with an independent monetary agency currently represented in the Financial Investigation Agency.

Meanwhile, sources at the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait declined to comment on the message, telling Asharq Al-Awsat that it did not know anything about the message or the sender, saying that "it is baseless".
Islamist MP Nasser al-Sanea warned against listening to such reports, saying that the Islamic trend expressly announced "its neutrality regarding any matter related to the ruling family.

The branches existing in Egypt are nothing but Egyptian sale outlets as their products are national ones and the personnel working there are Egyptians, the company indicated.
In the first elections that have been held in the Kingdom of Bahrain for 45 years, the results proved that the moderate Shiite trend represented by the Society of Islamic National Reconciliation, was the most popular among Bahraini political forces.

The hardline Shiite trend, who declined to take part in the election and called on their advocates to boycott them. Such a trend, however, turned out to be rather rare in the Shiite milieus. What bears evidence to this is the fact that the turnout in some Shiite constituencies reached 80%.
Urging American companies not to cooperate with those Arab governments and organizations that would boycott Israel, Washington renewed its warning that American companies would be subjecting themselves to the sanctions stipulated by U.S. laws for American individuals and organizations that supported any boycott measures imposed by foreign governments on Israel.
The poll, conducted by the official Yemeni News Agency upon a request from Bagamal himself in the first anniversary of the government formation, showed that 64 percent of the respondents saw that there are no aspects of financial or administrative reforms in Bagamal government and 60 percent saw that the government is lacking in harmony, with half of them calling for cancelling six cabinet ministries; the ministries of Human Rights, Information, Tourism and Environment, Higher Education, Immigration and Culture.
A dossier of thorough assessment of the incumbent government, conducted by the official Yemeni News Agency, was published by Al-Iktisadia magazine under the rubric of "After One Year, Can the Government Say Checkmate to Corruption?"

Port Sudan Harbour is of a high importance on the part of Ethiopia because it is near its northern, western and south-western areas. Besides, it is better equipped than the Djiboutian small port, which was used by Ethiopia after it had left the Eritrean Asab Harbour following the outbreak of the Ethiopian-Eritrean war.
Amman had often advised Baghdad to seek as much rapprochement as possible with Saudi Arabia and to offer capitulations in that context including refrainment from declaring of war against the Crown Prince's initiative. The Jordanian view here is that a harmony with Riyadh would hit several birds with one stone as it would ensure its rejection of hitting Iraq, making such a step technically and politically difficult.
The recommendations made by a working group that discussed the Tamazight question in a symposium organized by the Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights rejected the phrase of "Arab Maghreb" now that it is derived from "imperialistic nomenclature that contributes to obliterating the Tamazight identity of the region in return for concentrating on its Arab identity."

Chairman of Peace Society Movement, Mahfouz Nehnah toured on foot some of the capital popular districts.
REFORM MOVEMENT LEADER: WE'RE AGAINST VIOLENCE AND USE OF FORCE
Q: Do you think that your party has the chance of preserving its seats in the parliament (11 deputies)?
A: On the contrary! This is logical and legitimate ambition.
Regarding the Front of Islamic Salvation leaderships, it's up to them and their options as individuals!
We know that rigging the elections has become a policy and a system for which all the state's potential is exploited.
If opposition parties are unanimous about confronting the deteriorating current position, we will be able to reach the results I expect.
A: I'd like to show reservations concerning your description of him as leader of the majority party as our community knows that that party was based on election rigging and that its 1997 win and its stay in power since then is based on rigging.
Therefore, we held the constituent congress during or just after the presidential elections campaign.
Several observers, however, think that the Islamic trend parties no longer have a career as the war against them would be ferocious.
This has been evident in its clear call for changing curricula by omitting the subjects that have any thing to do with the Islamic religion and creed.
I won't rule out the possibility that, in one way or other, that movement was involved in those incidents that shook the whole world.
Why don't they let the nation express itself democratically?
A: If you mean Osama Bin Laden's role in Jihad in Afghanistan against Russia, he should be given credit for that, as he was a role model in sacrifice and struggle in the cause of God sacrificing money and soul, but if you mean what he did later when he founded an organization that adopted the principle of using force to change, we, in light of Islamic jurisprudence, think it is wrong as we believe that any inappropriate act is wrong.
To my mind, what happened in Afghanistan has already refuted the experiment of using force for change and also disfavoured the Taliban theory for building an Islamic state.

The weighty parties in cities, which have big electorates, could avail themselves of the first kind of election and, consequently, the remaining number of votes will make such parties decide the suspended seats. This way, the major weighty parties in cities especially the opposition parties constituting the Democratic Bloc (the Socialist Union of the Popular Forces, the Independence and the Progression and Socialism) could benefit from this system. As for the second kind, it can benefit the parties centered in the countryside constituencies that have a small electorate. Had the "highest rate" system been endorsed, such constituencies could have been equaled with the urban ones that have a large number of voters and, consequently, the current opposition parties (the Constitutional Union, the Popular Movement and the National Democratic Party) constituting the 'reconciliation alliance' could have won a good position thanks to their weight in the countryside and mastery of tribal action.
Making a unique election paper substituting the old one that was the reason for buying votes, on condition that it responds in its form and content to all that could enable the voter to practise his constitutional right.
The law tightens the penalties over election violations through raising up the value of fines and the period of imprisonment, something that conforms to what was said by Jatto before the parliament while the law was being drafted. He said that the administrative body with all its levels would follow the legally assigned competence to the letter.

Only 25 percent of the flat's price is paid by the person as a first stage and then the remaining installments are to be paid off in 10 or 20 years' time.

Experts voice concern that such a hope may not be achieved and that the banks will find themselves before reinforcing concrete mortgaged to them in case the investor as well as the buyer are defaulting.

Although the American companies are banned from entering Sudan, the Sudanese cooperation with American intelligence on the heels of the September 11th attacks may lead to American giant companies entering Sudan in the future.

14% IMPROVEMENT IN THE BALANCE OF TRADE IN THE FY 2000/2001
In comparison to imports, the payments retreated by 8% to hit 16.4 billion dollars, a thing that led to a retreat in the deficit of the balance of trade by 18.5% to stand at 9.4 billion dollars.
The report stressed the necessity of adopting an objective estimation for cars depending on the qualitative analysis of the export sector which is determined in accordance with a number of factors foremost among which are the promotion of such sector, its ability to provide job opportunities, existence and continuation on markets, entering new markets and the efficiency degree of the Egyptian exporters to manufacture and market either individually or collectively.
He also announced that the costs of projects implemented in North Sinai over the last two years of the current five-year plan had totaled LE 948.5 million, including LE 382.51 million in FY 2000/01 and LE 566 million in FY 2001/02.
The second stage of the railway, which is 125 kilometres long, will be built, together with 7 stations at Al Tilool, Al Roda, Al Midan, Al Arish, Al Raisa, Al Sheikh Zuwayyed and Rafah. The bifurcated tracks that will run up to the East Port Said will also be built. The total costs of the whole project will reach LE 800 million."
Development, witnessed by the sectors of Commercial Representation, the Exhibition Authority, the Anti-Dumping Body and the Export-Import Control Authority, helped in increasing exports and removing hindrances facing exporters with the objective of boosting Egyptian exports via a five-year and clear-cut strategy, he says.
The Post branch in Alexandria has promoted 28 Egyptian products on the world markets through the Internet and trading posts, said the Alexandria-based International Trading Post director Eng. Mohamed Al-Sheiwi. Such products included mineral oil products, soap chemicals, car fuel tanks, filters, pet fishes, leather, preserved foods, phosphate, cement, natural sand, aluminum pots, organic fertilizers, rice, macaroni, dates, furniture and shaving razors, he said.
Al-Antely said that financing exports is one of the most important finance activities at the banking level as it allows the banks to ideally invest their deposits in foreign currencies and the foreign proceeds and commissions on external deposits and finance.
The administration of the bank is scheduled to put forth this increase before the members of the general assembly in their meeting on 8 June next for approval.
The extraordinary general meeting of the Misr America International Bank (MAIB) late last week approved the increase of the issued and paid-up capital of the bank to 100 million pounds, an increase of 17.5 million pounds, and increase of the authorized capital to 200 million pounds.
CEMENT COMPANIES PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED WITHIN NEW CAPITAL MARKET LAW
One of the characteristics of that provision is that it allows the Capital Market Authority to protect the interests of small shareholders whose rights are wasted in the absence of a representative of them. One of the most important problems raised by cement companies shareholders is the objection of those having minority rights in Alexandria Cement Company and Portland to the purchase offer tendered by a foreign company to buy 100% of the company's shares for LE19.5 per share.
The study mentioned another problem which is the decision of South Valley Cement Company to repurchase its shares from the shareholders through the Stock Exchange following the suspension of the project for certain reasons. The company also took a liquidation decision because it failed to complete the project due to economic conditions and the change of exchange rate. Shareholders, however, did not agree to sell their shares, but preferred to continue in the company pending its liquidation.
Head of the Investment and Free Zones Authority, Dr. Mohamed Al-Ghamrawi greenlit the establishment of an investment complex under the special free zones system for Itaco Petrochemicals Company to produce petrochemicals out of natural gas and petro-products in Damietta at an investment cost of 1.4 billion dollars.
During the meeting, Al-Ghamrawi approved the establishment of an investment venture at the general free zone in Alexandria for assembling and manufacturing the equipment required for petroleum activities especially the equipment used in the treatment of land and sea pollution.
The report warned against the expansion of issuing licenses to set up new pharmaceutical companies before referral to the Investment Projects Committee at the pharmaceutical sector or before being endorsed by the sector's supreme council. The project should suit the domestic market's requirements and exports so that it could achieve a new additional technology along with encouraging investment in the fields of raw materials industry, genetic engineering and medical requirements.
WHERE DO EGYPTIANS SPEND THEIR MONEY?
LE56 Billion on Food A Central Agency for Mobilization and Statistics lastest report said that the Egyptians spend LE56 billion on food and drink representing 40% of the family income in urban areas and 50% in rural areas.
This is due to the high demand for snacks that also consume one billion pounds annually.
Egyptians consume 7 tons of coffee annually.
LE6 billion has been spent on mobile calls in just one year as the number of mobile users amounts to four million people.
Despite all those objective reasons, Dr.MMohamed Youssef thinks that the volume of using that invention had gone beyond all expectations in a society that is basically low- incomed so much so that it has turned into a luxury consumption even for the low-income categories whose real needs hardly need a mobile.
TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES OF COMBINING BROKERING & POLITICS IN EGYPT
The worst prime minister in Egyptian history is playing with fire, making matters worse instead of solving them. Instead of looking for the reasons for failure, or resigning, he should have busied himself with national issues, like other Egyptians do, losing sleep and peace of mind over the woes of their country. This devilish combination between the roles of politician and broker has dragged Egypt in this unenviable position, in which its prime minister is not concerned over a danger that looms over his country along the eastern border, let alone that he has dealt nonchalantly with the acute economic crisis in which the country lives.
Economic development has failed; job opportunities are scarce; wealth has become concentrated in the hands of a spoilt minority; the scope of poverty is widening to engulf more people, amid masses that suffer deprivation; the ability to protect national security no longer exists, and the community is not prepared to defend itself if it falls under an aggression that, according to reports, is expected any minute, as it is connected to the widening circle of the Israeli military campaign that has come to be a part of the America military effort in the so-called war against terrorism.
This way, the road will be open to Sinai, which is demilitarized, unpopulated and dependent on touristic investments that have no ability to resist, defend or protect, thanks to the Camp David Accords and the restrictions imposed under American aid, not to mention the terms and conditions for using arms. This done, Arab governments will have discharged their role to the hilt, enabling the Zionist state to realize its Torah Dream, which will be complete with the partitioning of Iraq.
It has been proved throughout the Zionist invasion of Palestinian territories that the media play a serious role that is no less important than other roles. But for the efforts of Arab satellite channels and national newspaper and other media, the events in Palestine would have been shrouded in a media blackout. This publicity has helped in mobilizing Arab public opinion in Arab countries and foreign countries alike. Patriotic intellectuals and media persons should never tire of sounding the alarm against what is coming.
No foreign parties have something to do with the question of reform and reshuffle, he said. A change will be made with a Palestinian perspective and in accordance with the correct understanding of our aspirations and expectations, he said.
Asked about how to deal with threats by the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) against him due to alleged connivance with Israel, the Palestinian official said, "It is not alarming to me.
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has a firm position on these operations.
RAJOUB DENIES CHOOSING EGYPT AS OPTIONAL EXILE
Palestine is my only exile and permanent stay."
According to the Central Agency for Statistics, 2,250,000 Palestinians live under the line of poverty and about one-half of the total number of Palestinian families have lost more than one-half of the income they had before the outbreak of the Intifada.
This part of the survey derives its importance from the fact that it was made just before the Israeli storming of the areas under control of the Palestinian Authority since 28 March 2002, as the living conditions of families are expected to have worsened as a result of this Israeli onslaught.
The survey also shows that 23.2% of the interviewed families have adopted a complete boycott of all Israeli products, at 26.7% of the families in the West Bank and 15.8% of the families in Gaza Strip.
The sources emphasized that director of Palestinian Preventive Security System in the West Bank, Colonel Gibril Al-Rajoub who left the Palestinian territories two days ago as an envoy of President Arafat, had met director of Jordanian Intelligence Field Marshal Saad Kheir and discussed with him cooperation mechanisms between the two parties especially the administrative and organizational aspects where Jordan could offer its expertise to Palestinian security system.
On the other hand, well-informed Egyptian sources unfolded that the Palestinian President had recently received a message from Cairo urging him to effect a comprehensive change operation in the PNA system "on clear bases". They also urged him to bring about the change before it is too late.
The Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad movements denied being invited by any Arab country to partake in a "conference" to which Palestinian resistance factions will participate. Hamas political leader, Abdel-Aziz al-Rantisi unveiled that such forces were about to announce a "unified document" stressing "the Palestinian people's right to repulse occupation and keep on resisting."
In response to a question whether Hamas was ready to partake in such a conference, Rantisi said, "When we are invited we will ponder on the conference's items to take our decision. But I emphasize that there will be no stoppage of martyrdom operations.
As regards the nature of pressure to which Hamas is exposed to stop operations especially those carried out within the Green Line he added that in addition to such pressure there were also assassination and liquidation attempts. In case of being annihilated without exception, we will never waive our right to repulse the occupation, as relinquishing such right is worse than being killled, he said.
Rantisi, however, uncovered that an inter-Palestinian dialogue including national as well as Islamic forces was about to announce a "document" that had been prepared during the last few weeks, bolstering the Palestinian unified stance concerning " the Palestinian right to keep on repulsing the occupation."
Noone has asked us to stop resistance, either," he said.
The founder of the Islamic Resistance Movement strongly denounced the announcement made by Palestinian officials that martyrdom operations within the Palestinian territories that had been occupied in 1948 were subversive, pointing out that martyrdom operations against the Israeli occupation would continue until the liberation of Palestine was complete.
We fear change to the worst:
Hamas leader continued, saying that he refused Arafat's replacement at the current stage, so that Arafat might not be replaced by a worse substitute, adding that reform from the American and Israeli point of view was reform or redeployment of the security services and unification of control over them in the hands of only one man and elimination of those elements within them that had backed the Intifada. "Therefore, we expected them to bring in the worst character, so as to preserve Israel's security and stability.
Sheikh Yassin also pointed out that the Church of Nativity was a precedent that could be repeated. "He who handed in the freedom fighters today will surrender them tomorrow and give up a right that is protected by law and heavenly religions. Nobody can banish a Palestinian from his homeland. Giving up this right is giving up strategies," he concluded.
However, Islamic Salvation Front leaders living abroad had previously called for boycotting the forthcoming legislative elections, saying in a communiqué they released on 28 March 2002 that participation in elections under the prevalent circumstances was "perjury."
The Interior Minister's decision, which was announced in a press conference in Algiers on 22 May, came a couple of weeks after the minister's decision to ban 256 candidate lists that contained a majority of the tabooed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) activists who, according to Zarhuni, had been banned from running in the elections after the Government had received complaints from the families of "terrorism victims."
The minister quoted the number of voters at over 17.9 millions, expecting the turnout to be over 50% and pointing out that the turnout in the United States did not exceed 30%.
For the first time Libya started the implementation of a plan giving foreign investors access to directly invest in the country.
The projects Libya put up for foreign investment include the development of maritime and air transport sectors through foreign capital contribution to the implementation of 17 projects for developing the ports infrastructure and 10 projects for developing the navy.
"Such manoeuvres will, furthermore, make us test our capabilities to face up to emergencies."
The new tasks concentrate on the possibility of providing factors of stability and peace and pushing ahead with dialogue especially among Mediterranean countries, he said.
However, the success of such contact in the future depends on the political will of the Algerian authorities, he said.
Russia and Algeria have agreed to continue talks at expert level on modernization of the latter's inventory of military equipment of Soviet vintage, which comprises the majority of weapons systems in the Algerian Army.
"The military and technical cooperation between the two countries had an absolutely legitimate nature and did not violate any arms control agreement whatsoever be confirmed."
Saidal Complex has explicit policy in developing pharmaceutical industry in the country based on a strong will to establish integrated relations with Arab countries, he said.
The Indian labour are concentrated in the training field. They started to appear in the Egyptian software market three years ago when Egypt organized an international sport championship in Cairo and sought the help of such Indian labour to set up the computer- controlled screens, he said. To their surprise, the Indians found that the Egyptian wages in such a sector are higher than those in India, while the Egyptian companies found that the wages got by the Indians are less than those got by the Egyptian specialists, not to mention the skillfulness and the international expertise gained by the Indians in the field of software industry and marketing, he added.
EGYPTIAN INDUSTRY SUBJECT TO FORTY KINDS OF TAXES
Debate revolved around such an issue in a symposium held by the Egyptian Society for Management Sciences and Technology under the title, "Industrial Technology Reasons for Retreat and Hopes of Progress", involving former head of the Egyptian Federation of Industries, Dr. Adel Gazzarin, Shura Council's Industry Committee chairman, Mohamed Farid Khamis, former minister of industry, Dr. Ibrahim Fawzi and Egyptian Federation of Industries head, Abdel-Mon'em Se'oudi.
Customs shortcomings In the course of the privatization programme until the current year 2002, five major industrial companies operative in the spinning, weaving and engineering industries sector have been sold.
"The question now is: Why has not the Egyptian industry developed itself especially as we have 45 industrial zones, each zone has at least 500 investors?
In addition, there are exaggerated taxes especially the sales tax imposed on capital commodities, which are considered the biggest obstacle to the assimilation of the world production technology.
A glance at the banking conditions, we find that bankers are interested in lending the importers of consumer goods due to the immediate repayment of loans with a high interest rate. As for lending the industrial investors, it is unlimited problem. Many months may elapse to get the funds required for a project. The bank almost gets exaggerated guarantees that ensure the repayment of its loans.
Dr. Abdel-Mon'em Se'oudi said that the Industries Federation had paid due attention to such historic mistake. It started cooperation with different research bodies in order to reach that kind of technology that can lead to decreasing the production cost, a step that was crystallized in the signing of an agreement with the research centres in Cairo University to attain this end, he pointed out.
EGYPT EXPORTS 386,000 BALES OF COTTON
The actual cotton-cultivated area hit around 730,000 feddans, with the 2001-2002 season production forecast to reach 6.273 million metric kantars, or 313,000 tons, the reports said.
An official source said that the State bodies provided many facilities for tourists coming to Egypt.
The Passport Authority has started to apply new facilities to attract more tourists from Federal Russia, Ukraine and East Europe in coordination with the Ministry of Tourism.
The indicators affirmed that this exaggeration occurs despite the policy announced by Dr Medhat Hassanein, Minister of Finance, which provides for the Tax Administration accepting any tax return as it is as long as all its expenses are registered in official documents relevant to the activity
Al-Ahali reveals that the Sawiris family has obtained about 3 million square metres in Taba at the Aqaba Gulf area with investment costs of 200 million pounds and around 2 million square metres in northern Hurghada at investment costs of 250 million pounds.
Ashraf Marawan got 378 feddans in the new communities for the Qattamia Golf project at investment costs of 1.4 billion pounds while Shafiq Baghdadi, Abdel-Moneim Se'oudi, and Safwan Thabet got 2550 feddans for the Beverly Hills project in the 6th of October City and 315 feddans in the new urban communities.
Abul-Enein adds that to achieve development in the area of tourism the government sells the square metre of land at one dollar at a five year installment payments. In the field of agricultural development the feddan of land is sold at 100 pounds at a ten-year installment period.
He points out that between 40% and 44% of the area of the project's land is converted to roads and squares when the zoning is complete and the building is conducted under state conditions. Building is then undertaken on the remaining 50% of the area taking the costs to up to 150 pounds per metre at a time when the Chinese Company in the Gulf of Suez sells the square metre at 35 pounds; the loss will be 115 pounds per metre.
The case of Al Nasr Company for Castings has caused extensive argument in the Egyptian street ever since it was announced by the public prosecutor in a press conference. The accusations included 20 defendants starting with the board chairman, down to most sectors heads. It was as if the company was a focus of corruption from beginning to end. The first defendant, Dr Usama Abdul Wahab has occupied his respectable position for about 16 years.
The rumours, in a nutshell, say that the whole matter is an attempt to liquidate a national successful company for the interest of importation tycoons. The story started with President Mubarak inaugurating the biggest complex of castings in the world on March 31st, 1988 with contributions from Dr Usama Abdel Wahab whom the President awards first order badge. The company started exporting cast iron pipes since 1991, but the locally produced pipes were not to the liking of the Ministry of Housing, Construction and New Urban Communities and broadsided the company, accused it of spoiling Al Kraimat-Giza water line, which had cost LE159 million due to its technically faulty pipes. Investigations, nevertheless, proved that it was the contractor's fault as he had taken delivery of the pipes three years before and that bad storing accounted for the faults. As for technical faults, they turned out to be confined to 6 pipes only or rather 2 in every 10 thousands of the project length.
The Holding Company, nevertheless, defaulted on payment and Al Nasr for Castings, therefore, had to file lawsuit no.188 for the year 2000, Giza against it to claim the debts!
In press statements he said that Egypt, as a prioritized country, got soft loans from the Japanese official development aid programme valued at 22 billion pounds. It also got a technical cooperation aid at a value of 1.5 billion pounds and non-refundable grants valued at 4 billion pounds. "There are many projects that have been achieved thanks to the economic relations between the two countries such as the Opera House, the infant hospital affiliated to Cairo University and Suez Canal bridge."
The Canadian Aid Agency decided to embark on a new program for financing and extending aids to the small and medium-sized projects in Egypt, said the development advisor with the agency, Iman Omran, who doubles as the supervisor of the program. She said there are six projects in this field to be financed by the Canadian aid at costs of 80 million Canadian dollars.
It has recently been reported that EgyptAir will close down its route from Cairo to Sydney due to the losses it incurs. This, consequently, urged the representatives of Egyptian businessmen in Australia to immediately contact all export bodies and the Chambers of Commerce Federation to arrange meetings with officials to explain the harm that would ensue from the cancellation of that route which is considered the only link between Egyptian expatriates and their motherland. It would also shatter hopes in boosting Egyptian exports to Australian markets.
He added that for all that we hear of closing down EgyptAir route to block the way before Egyptian businessmen and exporters and deprive them and Egypt of exportation returns.
The KFW and the European Investment Bank agreed to extend an LE 1.4 billion loan to the Ministry of Public Works and Water Resources for implementing a number of hydraulic projects to improve navigation and tourist services on the River Nile.
In a related statement, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Public Works and Water Resources, Eng Hussein Al Atfi, said that the projects for which the loan had been acquired were part of a comprehensive plan for improving services, upgrading river transportation and coping with the increase in the numbers and sizes of river transportation units on the Nile, particularly floating hotels.
A report by the Ministry of Foreign Trade affirms that 2001 witnessed a significant development of Egyptian exports to some countries that had not represented traditional markets for Egyptian exports before but have good potential for absorbing high volumes of Egyptian exports.
The United States represented the second-largest export market, again despite the decline of exports to it by 14% to $ 341 million during the reported period, against $ 397 million in 2000.
BIG POTENTIAL FOR AUTO FEEDING INDUSTRIES BETWEEN EGYPT AND INDIA
According to the investment law, India participates in 46 joint investment projects in Egypt. The Indian contribution to the capital of these projects is estimated at 26% out of their issued capital, equalled 142 million pounds. Dr. Al-Ghamrawi reviewed with the Indian delegation the advantages offered by the guarantees and investment incentives law no.8 for the year 1997 and the policies adopted by the government to develop the investment environment in addition to the export chances available to free zones projects and the internal investment with a view to making use of the economic agreements between Egypt and the economic regional blocs such as the COMESA agreement, the Partnership Agreement with the European Union, and the preferential agreements with a number of Arab countries that increase the export opportunities of the companies operating in Egypt.
He pointed out that the free and special economic zones in the Northwest of the Gulf of Suez had been put up for Chinese investment within the framework of the government current tendency to expand in those zones now that the People's Assembly has passed a legislative framework for them recently.
This policy, he said, had many positive results such as the increase of trade exchange volume between the two countries to 935 million dollars, the increase of Chinese investments in Egypt, inauguration of new Chinese cultural center and chinese school in Cairo in the coming period, cooperation in the fields of medicine and medical equipment industry, and the arrival of the first Chinese tourist batch to Egypt early this month.
Egyptian imports from Korea fell 23.8 percent in January-March 2002, while exports to Korea rose by 186.3 percent in the reported period compared to the same period last year, according to statistics of the Ministry of Foreign Trade.
Prime Minister Dr Atef Ebeid received in his office on 3 June Dr Ahmad Bahgat, Vice- president of the African Development Bank, who said after the meeting that he had discussed with the Prime Minister the current phase of the ongoing program of cooperation between Egypt and the bank for financing some of the infrastructure projects that Egypt planned to launch within the context of its comprehensive development plan.
The meeting touched upon Egypt's participation in the insurance project implemented by the bank with a view to guaranteeing stable prices of a number of main crops in the African continent with cotton at top.
EGYPTIAN-UGANDAN BUSINESS COUNCIL TO HOLD FIRST MEETING
Al-Alam Al-Youm learnt that the establishment of an Egyptian company to implement infrastructure projects in Iraq was being considered.
INVESTMENT SERVICES COMPOUNDS TO BE ESTABLISHED IN 4 STAGES
The fourth stage will involve the establishment of offices for the Investment Authority in the remaining new cities.
- Rendering the investment services that fall within the jurisdiction of the relevant ministry.
Article 4 stipulates that the heads of relevant authorities and organizations shall issue, as appropriate, decrees delegating authority to the representatives of their authorities and organizations in investment services compounds covering the following:
- Taking delivery of investors' applications for acquiring investment services that fall within the jurisdiction of the relevant authority or organization, together with the necessary enclosures, samples or models of different kinds, and receiving payment of the necessary charges, then sending the applications and their enclosures to the relevant authority or organization and following up the rendition of the requested services on time until they are delivered to investors at the investment services compounds.
The Arab 7th financial seminar will start its meetings on September 9th with the participation of over one thousand investors, businessmen, government officials and academic experts from 32 Arab and European countries and the USA.

A glance at the banking conditions, we find that bankers are interested in lending the importers of consumer goods due to the immediate repayment of loans with a high interest rate. As for lending the industrial investors, it is unlimited problem. Many months may elapse to get the funds required for a project. The bank almost gets exaggerated guarantees that ensure the repayment of its loans.
Dr. Abdel-Mon'em Se'oudi said that the Industries Federation had paid due attention to such historic mistake. It started cooperation with different research bodies in order to reach that kind of technology that can lead to decreasing the production cost, a step that was crystallized in the signing of an agreement with the research centres in Cairo University to attain this end, he pointed out.

Investigations, nevertheless, proved that it was the contractor's fault as he had taken delivery of the pipes three years before and that bad storing accounted for the faults. As for technical faults, they turned out to be confined to 6 pipes only or rather 2 in every 10 thousands of the project length.

They demanded that such deeds be confronted. This committee is headed by the unknown Egyptian lawyer Maurice Sadek who emigrated to the USA two years ago and it issued a statement containing many lies. This statement said that Palestinian Muslims have no right in the land of Israel and that they have an inherited bias against Christians and Jews. The statement dealt with the recent Israeli siege of the Church of the Nativity saying that a "group of Palestinian terrorists attacked and occupied the Church of the Nativity detaining monks and priests as hostages."
The Muslims are our brothers and we are linked to them by the unity of destiny . Nothing of what he mentioned happened whether in the Church of the Nativity or the churches of Saint Paul or Saint Mary. These are lies and fabrications." He repeated his call to the statement's writer to fear God.

"Skepticism about certificates of origin in case there was a foreign trademark on the commodity is one of the main problems that impede trade flow," Aboul-Enein indicated, adding that the ratio of the national components to the commodity (at least 40%) is what is determined to be granted the exemptions provided in trade and customs agreements. He requested the respect of origin certificates issued by both countries, tightening of penalties in case of manipulation and use of the certificate of origin issued by the Great Free Zone until work on the comprehensive origin rules with the Arab League is completed.
He noted that the NBE has more than one time received bids but they turned to be unsuitable at a time the Libyan party was aiming at purchasing this share since September last.
The agreement had been signed in March 1998 and put into effect in March 1999 so that a free trade zone between the two countries would be set up at the end of 2007.
Egyptian exports also slumped down in 2000 to $40 million against $54.7 million in 1999. The Egyptian imports from Tunisia hiked in 2000 to $34.5 million versus $26.5 million in 1999.
The study had uncovered the fluctuation of the value of Egyptian exports which rose from $31.5 million in 1996 to $46.5 million in 19997, then went down to $41.4 million in 1998, i.e. Down 11.2%. They, then, hiked up in 1999 to reach $54.7 million, i.e. 32.5% but declined in 2000 when they reached about $40 million.

The path of legitimacy had been blocked for years before the National Democratic Rally was created as a political cover behind which the military establishment ran its candidates in the 1997 election. The military is preparing to have the majority of the seats in the People's National Assembly to their grouping in the present elections, so that it may run the country's affairs.
This insistence was evident in the assassination of the number-three man in the FIS, Abdul Qader Hashshani, who had opposed the civil concord project, and the refusal to issue licence to Al Wafaa Party that was established by Dr Ahmad Talib Librahimi, under the pretext that it would serve as a cover for the FIS.
This line of thinking could be justified, not for military reasons, as the armed Islamic groups are weaker than the government forces, but because the social environment that served as a breeding ground from which the FIS emerged in the 1980's is more fertile today, as demonstrated by the violent reactions to the floods that swept the Algerian capital last November.
AFOURKI ACCUSES ARAB POWERS OF TRYING TO EXCLUDE ERITREA FROM REGIONAL AFFAIRS
The Eritrean President denied the existence of tension in his country's relations with Yemen, saying to Al Hayat correspondent, "I was surprised at the questions made by reporters about tensions and troop mobilizations that occurred only in the imaginations of those reporters."
But I am telling them: leave us alone, because a publicity-oriented action against Eritrea cannot be used as a cover-up.
There is nothing that sets Eritrea's relations with Israel apart. I have always said that if the Palestinians have relations with Israel and if they selected self-rule by meeting with the Israelis, and if Egypt and Jordan have relations with Israel, our relations with Israel are nothing out of the ordinary, they are normal diplomatic relations."
We wish for a unified initiative in that country, so that there may be a solid ground for solving Sudan's problem."

WHAT DOES ISRAEL'S LAUNCH OF OFEK-5 SPY SATELLITE MEAN? Major General (retired) Hossam Sewailam wrote:
2- There is no doubt that Israel's success in implementing its plan for launching the Ofek-series spy satellites, which consequently gives it the advantage of availability of space reconnaissance assets around the year, supports the Israeli strategy of deterrence, particularly in its nuclear dimension. The spy satellites that Israel can launch in times of tension and crises can pinpoint the locations and movements of Arab forces, including elements of the five services, namely the ground, air, naval, rocket and air defence forces. They can also monitor the maneuvers and other activities of these forces in the different theatres of operations, as well as those of strategic and operational command and control posts and military infrastructure objectives to the very last moment before Israel delivers high-accuracy strikes to them with conventional and unconventional weapons.
Given that Israeli annual exports of weapons and military equipment total $3 billion, which equals 25% of total Israeli exports, we can see that selling spy satellites at $190 million apiece will bring high economic gains to Israel.
In a frank talk before members of the Permanent Bureau of Arab Lawyers Federation, Al-Assad said that American pressures had forced the three Arab leaders Bashaar Al-Assad, the Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Prince Abdullah to hold Sharm Al-Sheikh summit in order to declare an anti-violence stance towards violence.
The Syrian President complained that the Arab World did not know exactly what Washington wanted. He criticized the Arab regimes' submission to the American agenda without discussion, argument or any attempt to be effective. He added that the catastrophic position of Arab-American relations reached the point of obsequiousness so much so that Arab governments not only carry out the American instructions and directives but also take the initiative of contacting the Americans to remind them that their instructions had not reached them yet and ask about them without trying to be effective.
Al-Assad uncovered Saudi-Syrian differences over the initiative of Prince Abdullah. He added that the Syrian pressure helped to improve the initiative items and conditions. He pointed out that it included the borders of June 4th, the refugees' issue and laying down conditions for normalization with Israel.
The plan was handed over to President Arafat on May 26. According to confirmations from the Palestinian side, the U.S.-supervised reform plan includes two parts. The first part is related to political reforms, including a date for reshuffling the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to comprise 11 in lieu of 31 cabinet ministers at present and 5 instead of 13 ministries, introducing over 10 new figures to PNA power centers. It also provides for holding three Palestinian elections as of next September; local and municipality, legislative (next February), and presidential elections (next April), opening the door of candidature for rivals to vie with Arafat in the presidential voting.
Palestinian sources in Cairo laid bare that the four-party agreement document on political and security reforms includes a number of U.S. promises, guaranteeing a personal protection of President Arafat and allowing him to freely travel to other countries, including his expected tour of Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia next month. The U.S. Administration should also abjure its opposition to Arafat's policies and PNA's performance, open a new chapter of mutual confidence and cooperation between the PNA and President George W. Bush and solve all disputes through a dialogue committee to be formed out of the U.S. secretary of state, his aides and a senior Palestinian to be nominated by Arafat, with a Palestinian security and political team to undertake contacts and coordination with the U.S. Administration.

This came in a speech delivered by the minister in a seminar organized last week by the Istitute of National Planning on the future of development in Egypt. He said that it is no longer useful for the government to say that the rate of investment is still holding at 25%.
Speakers in the seminar pointed to the failure of the policy of exemptions and facilities that the government insists on in the area of attracting foreign capital. They said that the level of foreign investment fell from 1.6 billion dollars in 1999 to only one billion dollars in the year 2000 and then to merely 500 million dollars in 2001.
"The 11 September events had many negative impacts not only at the level of Egypt and the Middle East but also at the international level as they resulted in liquidation of works of giant companies, in addition to nonachievement of peace in the Middle East region. For all that, some 1580 new investment companies have been established in 2001 at investments totalling 21.8 billion pounds", Al-Ghamrawi said. During the first five months of this year another 535 fresh investment companies were set up, he said, pointing out that those companies, which actually started production, provided 35,000 job openings in 2000 and another 51,000 in 2001.

"This matter is not so easy, because the Arab funds abroad are invested in multinational companies but we call upon Arab contributors to pressurize these companies to open new branches of their own in Egypt especially as the volume of Arab funds abroad hover between 800 billion and 1000 billion dollars. The existence of Arab funds in Egypt will prove to be more secure for them," he said.
"PROGRAM ON FINANCING ARAB TRADE" TO COMPENSATE SLOW FLOW OF FUNDS FROM DONOR COUNTRIES
The government is expected to reach a new agreement with the Program to grant it facilities to the Arab markets' exporters. The Export Development Bank in Egypt is expected to be in charge of directing these facilities to the exporters.

EXTERNAL TRADE COMPANIES LOSE HALF OF THEIR CAPITAL
About 55% of the total stockpile is concentrated in 4 companies, namely the Public for Engineering Works, Public Trade and Chemicals, Misr External Trade and the Ploughs and Engineering. Most of such stockpiles are commodities for sale, comprising typewriters that were imported at quantities more than the marketing capability, commodity requirements that were purchased at quantities exceeding the production requirements and equipment and spare parts of old makes.
Some of these companies resorted to overdraw due to the insufficiency of long-term financial resources and to fund all their fixed uses.
Some other companies expanded in granting credit facilities for the clients with an average recovery period that doesn't suit the average repayment period for the suppliers at most companies.
Kamal Al-Shazli, Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, affirmed that the Constitution gives parties, not NGOs, the right to practise political action.

The group urged all Arab and Muslim peoples and rulers to do their duty in supporting the Kashmir people and Pakistan.
The leap achieved by the new economy related to the information technology, software and hardware industry drew every body's attention. It was expected that such a new economy would lead the Egyptian society into broad vistas that could absorb thousands of job opportunities annually, especially in light of the optimistic growth rates IT achieved, particularly in the field of software. However, foreign labour, especially those coming from India who got into the software field about 4 years ago, threaten about 10 thousand Egyptian developers and programmers with early retirement and frustrate thousands of trainees and graduates whom the Egyptian universities and institutes pump into the software sector every year. In addition, software companies may be exposed to a very serious problem through marketing copied programmes in return for dirt-cheap prices that consecrate the piracy crisis to which the Government squares up in order to attract fresh investments in this sector.
No fear of the Indian labour especially in the field of training because in this case they will develop the national software industry, he said, pointing out that the most important thing in the Indian training techniques is that their problems are similar to those of Egypt.

The Vatican turned down such an Israeli order which was also rejected by the Egyptian nun who informed her family on the phone that she would not come back to Egypt even on a visit until a final agreement is reached between the Palestinians and the Israelis. She feared that if she left Bethlehem, Israel would not allow her to return again. Fayza reassured her family about her conditions and was also reassured about them. She pointed out that her role in the Nativity Church was similar to that of any Palestinian struggler at this critical stage of the Palestinian people's history.
This phenomenon does not astound head of the Scientific Research Academy, Dr. Fawzi Al-Refa'ei as taking out a patent on an invention has nothing to do with the nationality of its owner or his country. The most striking phenomenon is the attempts made by some Egyptian scientists and researchers to have their inventions patented in Israel's Patent Office to protect their inventions, a tendency he hopes to increase in the future. "Like the Israelis, the Egyptians register their inventions through "patent agents," he said. The registration process does not usually require the researcher or the scientist to go to the country where he wants to register his invention or device.
Sometimes, the rejection may be related to national security reasons. The State has the right to reject any invention that might do harm to the people's health or does not suit our customs and traditions, he added.
A new crisis popped up between the American ambassador to Cairo, David Welch and the Republic's Mufti (religious opinion authority). The crisis was caused by his fatwa (religious opinion) supporting martyrdom operations. Welch visited Dar El Ifta (Religious Opinion House) a few days ago claiming that it was just a protocol visit. Al Tayeb, however, has unfolded the aim of the visit. The American ambassador urged the Mufti to declare martyrdom operations as religiously impermissible.
Referring to what was published in your newspaper, 'Al-Osboa,' in its previous issue under the headline, 'American Impudence!', I'd be grateful if you correct it.

The case of Al Nasr Company for Castings has caused extensive argument in the Egyptian street ever since it was announced by the public prosecutor in a press conference. The accusations included 20 defendants starting with the board chairman, down to most sectors heads. It was as if the company was a focus of corruption from beginning to end. The first defendant, Dr Usama Abdul Wahab has occupied his respectable position for about 16 years.
The rumours, in a nutshell, say that the whole matter is an attempt to liquidate a national successful company for the interest of importation tycoons. The story started with President Mubarak inaugurating the biggest complex of castings in the world on March 31st, 1988 with contributions from Dr Usama Abdel Wahab whom the President awards first order badge. The company started exporting cast iron pipes since 1991, but the locally produced pipes were not to the liking of the Ministry of Housing, Construction and New Urban Communities and broadsided the company, accused it of spoiling Al Kraimat-Giza water line, which had cost LE159 million due to its technically faulty pipes. Investigations, nevertheless, proved that it was the contractor's fault as he had taken delivery of the pipes three years before and that bad storing accounted for the faults. As for technical faults, they turned out to be confined to 6 pipes only or rather 2 in every 10 thousands of the project length.

Jihad Al Khazin, former chief editor of Al Hayat, wrote: The Islamic resistance believes that the reform proposed in the Palestinian territories is an American-Israeli recipe whose first priority is security and whose objective is the abortion of resistance.
"Security reform is meaningless without a parallel political reform," he said. "From the point of view of Islamic factions, the required reform is one that aims at ending the occupation, not joining in a long-term phased plan or launching another round of futile negotiations."
Brother Mash'al pointed out that one of the axioms of reform is that those who demand or implement it must be good. However, the reform process proposed according to the American concept will end up in benefits to corrupt people whom the people do not want.
But this prominent Hamas leader does not expect a confrontation between the Palestinian people and the Palestinian Authority. "The people is capable of solving its domestic problems without violence or clashes. It has done that under similar conditions before," he said. "Moreover, the Palestinian Authority is not facing just one faction; it is facing Hamas, the Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front For Liberation of Palestine, and the Democratic Front for Liberation of Palestine, as well as Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, which belongs to Fatah and believes that stopping the struggle is an illogical act."

Powell declined to reveal either the place or date of the international conference which he would head this summer until Bush announces his settlement or prospective plan only shortly but not this week.
He added that the Israeli Premier, Sharon knows well that we do not agree to his attitude that we should not work with President Arafat. Powell said the decision on Arafat would have to be left to the Palestinian people.
Firstly, President Mubarak told the American newspaper that the Palestinians now could accept what they had refused a year and a half ago, i.e. in Camp David and Taba negotiations. He talked about the establishment of a Palestinian state on part of the West Bank and Gaza Strip leaving other issues like the future of Jerusalem and the borders of that state to later negotiations, which is the essence of Sharon's project for settlement that he had, for more than one occasion, put forward giving emphasis on phased-in and long term solutions.
Fourthly, Sharon has visited Washington for six times in less than a year, but the Palestinian President, the cause representative, has not visited it even once and what is even worse, the American President announced that the Palestinian President did not deserve his respect.
What we'd like to say is that we are being dragged into an Israeli solution which the USA is seeking to give a tinge that is Arab-European or perhaps international as a prelude to imposing it on the Palestinian people.
The besieged, humiliated, threatened and torn out Palestinian Authority is not fit for taking a strategic decision in the name of the Palestinian people, nor is it authorized to deputize any Arab leader to speak on behalf of Palestinian people, no matter who that leader may be!
It is noteworthy that Bush urged Mubarak to extend his visit to Washington as a prelude to holding a tripartite meeting with Sharon attending. However, Mubarak stipulated Israeli government approve of the Egyptian moves as a condition of holding a meeting with Sharon.

It, in actual fact, transferred it to the category of risky assets in the National Investment Bank budget, if such a description was feasible and which is sometimes used when the bank finds it difficult to collect its money which had been offered in the form of credit facilities and loans as is the case with commercial banks.

FSPECULATION EXTENDS TO EUROPEAN CURRENCIES AFTER DOLLAR
Moreover, several local banks failed to fulfill the demands of clients particularly those dealing with countries dealing in the euros.
He added that banks extend foreign cash liquidity only in the case of travel, treatment, and travel allowances. As far as dealers are concerned, their documentary credits are covered.
He added that the demand is aimed either to cover credits or keep them to be sold later in light of the steady rise of these currencies against the US dollar.
He said that most foreign debts are in the US dollar and their installments are paid back from reserves investments abroad.
Director General of the Egyptian-Saudi Financing Bank Salah Attia who is also the manager of the bank's branch in Heliopolis underlined the same tendency.

RECENT CBE REPORT: LE314 BILLION VOLUME OF DOMESTIC LIQUIDITY

Concerning the relative distribution of these assets according to the economic activity sectors, the industrial sector comes first. By the end of March 2002 it benefited from such facilities by 32.2%. It is followed by the service sector by 24.6%, trade sector by 22.5% and the agricultural by 2.2%.
Deposits with the banks apart from the CBE registered a new record as they hiked to 324.9 billion pounds by the end of last March of which 199.6 billion pounds are deposits in the domestic currency and 75 billion pounds are foreign deposits, a thing that reflects the preferentiality given to the Egyptian pound as a coffer for saving.
"We hope that this step will be executed next October at most," he said, pointing out that Egypt exerted many efforts to strike its name off the list of the countries that don't cooperate in combatting money laundering. Among these efforts is the issuance of an independent law that criminalizes these illegal operations and pursues them, if any.
Abul-Oyoon said the delegation familiarized the members of the group with the steps taken by Egypt since it was listed among the non-cooperative countries in May 2001 up till now.
Egyptian economists and bankers voiced their resentment of not removing Egypt's name from the list of uncooperative countries in the field of combatting money laundering issued by an international institution which is responsible for that sector in different countries.
Commenting on the decision of the institution, former head of Banks Union Mohamed Abdel-Aziz told Asharq Al-Awsat that impeding removing Egypt's name from the list of uncooperative countries in the field of money laundering is considered a continuation of the foreign pressure on Egypt, pointing out that banks adopted several measures to prevent money laundering cases. One of these measures is the principle of "Identify your Client" which has been generalized in the other financial sectors including insurance.
A bank official said that due to those losses, the general assembly in its recent meeting asked that the bank capital be reduced to LE22.4 million and then increased through new stocks from old shareholders as a step towards structural reform.
If the capital increases kept within the prescribed quotas for individual banks, the board will stay as it is unaltered unless there is a change in the quotas for then the board of directors will have to be altered in accordance with the new contributions.
However, the net returns rose up to 12.9 million pounds, up 11.1 percent, banking commissions and service costs registered a growth of 15.3 million pounds, revenues of other operations reached 1.03 million pounds and financial investment revenues were estimated at 0.7 million pounds.
Head of Banque Misr Dr. Baha' Helmi explained that 19.8 billion pounds worth of those facilities were extended to industrial projects in foreign currency in order to ease the importation of their needs of equipment, raw materials and intermediate commodities.
Former minister of industry and technological development Dr. Mostafa Al-Refai emphasized that there should be technical bodies affiliated to banks in order to study and evaluate industrial projects and enjoy dealing with related governmental bodies and entities, which have a large amount of information through the industrial map that includes an inventory of the existing industrial installations (20,000 in number).
INDUSTRY MINISTER: EGYPTIAN BANKS UNQUALIFIED TO SERVE INDUSTRY
The Supreme Council for Industrial Coordination has been formed, he said, pointing out that it included the Ministry of Military Production, Arab Organization for Industrialization and the Ministry of Industry and would comprise the ministries of finance and planning later on.

Next year, these exports are forecast to rise by 15 percent and then 30 or 40 percent annually in the following years, he said.
The latest report of the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics said that the value of Egyptian exports rose from LE4.418 billion during the period from January to March in 2001 to reach LE5.241 billion during the same period this year 2002, a rise of 18.6%.
Chairman of the statistics Agency emphasized that on the other hand, there was a retreat in our imports of some goods during the same period. Our imports of timber and its works declined from LE533.1 million to 494.9 million, a decline of 7.2%; petroleum products imports from LE783.1 million to LE416.2 million a decline of 46.9%; different types of alloys in elementary forms from LE405.7 million to LE335.1 million, a decline of roughly 17.4%. Ehab Elwi points out that we have thus managed to reduce the value of Egyptian imports of the goods that have domestic counterparts.
The decline hit roughly 50 percent in the first six months of this fiscal year 2001-2002.
Foreign investments far from the Egyptian stock exchange retreated by 45 percent hitting 260 million U.S. dollars last year in lieu of 472 million U.S. dollars in the previous year.
Meanwhile, domestic debts rose up to around 246 billion pounds on account of governmental borrowing of around 30 billion pounds from general and commercial banks last year.
STD Chairman Mahmoud Mohamed said a package of facilities has been in place, including the cancellation of compensations given in such cases equalling the value of the the tax and the possible payment of taxes through monthly instalments.

The STD will also be reconciled with those who sued it in exchange for cancelling such cases and paying tax dues, he added.

In addition, there is a plan to be implemented in the FY 2002/2003 to replace and renovate the electricity grids feeding the sectors of production, services, and housing in the cities and villages that have been earlier supplied with electricity.
He explained that all the equipment and input of the program would be produced by the sister companies of the electricity sector and the investment companies in order to broaden the use of the local product.

Meanwhile, Minister of Finance Medhat Hassanain condemned the opposition's accusations against the government posing more burdens on the public debt through issuing bonds in hard currency (the U.S. dollar).

The representative of the CAA spoke to the People's Assembly to express the authority's disappointment after it failed to get detailed information on the spending of the loans and grants offered by international funds and banks by the USA government, and by some Arab funds and governments.
The CAA said that the amendment-21 introduced to that category on June 4, 2000 led to financing the subsidization of the states public budget and the financing of the salaries, bonuses, and budgets of employees at the Ministry of International Cooperation and the Finance Ministry beside other bank deposits from some quarters whose returns are used to finance their activities without those activities being specified.
The report attributed the big growth rates of investments that were witnessed by this sector to the increase in the volume of the Egyptian communications sector due to the retreat in the number of mobile users in Egypt in comparison to the number of the population that hit 67 million souls. Therefore, the three million users of mobile phone constitute a ratio of less than 5 percent.
The possibility of the growth of the cellular phone Communications and the extension of the fixed phone networks is still high, the report said, pointing out that although the two mobile phone companies have achieved rapid growth in the 1990s, this growth continued in 2000 and 2001.

MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS CRITICIZES CALL FOR BOYCOTTING US PRODUCTS
Opposition blocs at the Egyptian parliament announced their opposition to the state draft budget, development drive and new five-year plan just a few hours before the parliamentary session on the drafts on Monday.
In response to the members' criticisms, the minister said "There is no country in the world which does not count on loan funding in its investments. The banks' task is to attract deposits and then inject them as investments."
The lawsuit filed by the committee chairman Dr Moustafa Kamal Helmi against the Islamic Labour Party was based on the pretext that the latter had modified its platform and goals according to which it had been founded without notifying the committee in accordance with the law provisions.

$1.2 BILLION INVESTMENTS OF COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SECTORS
To elaborate, out of a total of 6 million lines, the current usage only hits 10 percent, the report said. Last year, the new lines increased by 25 percent. So, the Government expects this sector to be an important source for investment, employment and income. To prove the priority given by the Government to this sector, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology has been set up in 1999 to lay down a national plan for communications and information technology with a view to developing this sector.
The current available growth rates point out that competition between the two cellular phone companies could be boosted especially as a third company is about to provide the same service. This will make both of them concentrate on increasing the number of subscribers through providing more innovated and improved products at more competitive prices.

Lawyer, Naguib Gebrail said, "We're worried about the implications of that ruling which the Copts reject especially as their wounds had not healed yet.

There is a belief prevailing among a number of economic, security, and political circles that the current stability in the rate of exchange of the pound against the dollar is brittle. It has come as a result of security and administrative measures and as a result of the restriction of imports particularly of consumer goods and not as a result of increased resources of foreign currency through the development of exports and the improvement of the country's economic competitiveness relying on Egyptian materials and input.
Where did this money go?
Egypt got 59.2% of these funds in the period from 1995 to 30 June, 2000 when the CAA conducted its follow up.

As for the investments pumped into the IT sector, they hit 250 million pounds, according to a report specialized in the investment atmosphere in Egypt issued by the Consultation Agency for Arab Communications.
The first step taken by the ministry was the deregulation of this sector in 1998 when the mobile phone service branch at Telecom Egypt was privatized and sold to French, Egyptian and American investors.
Liberalization of communications sector The aforementioned step was followed by a major one, i.e, liberalization of the communications sector through the fixed lines and denationalization of Telecom Egypt with the target of enhancing its competitiveness in a liberalized atmosphere, as the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology planned in 2000 to put up the company's stocks for sale at the Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchange so as to procure funds required for filling the technological gap in its network and enhance the poor productivity that ensued from untrained workforce that receive low wages. However, the negative circumstances witnessed by the domestic as well as the international markets especially as far as the retreat of the international communications companies' stocks were concerned together with their high rates of expenditure on developing a third generation of mobile phones put off the Ministry's plans sine die. Telecom Egypt, nevertheless, is currently urging an anchor investor to purchase a big strategic quota in the company.
Tackling the current position, the report highlighted that the Government had become convinced that Egypt had been qualified to be a pivot for the IT field in the Middle East due to its geographical location amid the optic fibers network that links the Middle East with other world countries.

Al-Magali's casual remarks are certainly void of any political innocence as the man is a well-seasoned veteran and has started his campaign early through giving impetus to his contacts, interviews and even lectures, which indicates that he started to sense the approaching elections and began to prepare for them especially after he frankly said that the first week of next month (July) might witness the passing of a decision regarding the expected elections in his country.
Al-Magali would, therefore, very smartly shift from a role often classified as anti-new regime symbols to the role of a pragmatic charismatic personality willing to play a role on behalf of the royal regime, discourse and options relying on sophisticated pragmatic sense, which Al-Magali has often proven throughout several years that he was quite adept at exploiting.

A: By no means! It is rather a logical understanding of the national, regional and international reality. We know ourselves and do not have the tools that would enable us to deal with practical reality in the world of which our region constitutes a part.
Dr. Osama Al-Baz, the Political Advisor to Egyptian President said that the American President George Bush would announce his plan for peace next week.
Regarding Sharon's latest statement that America adopted the Israeli point of view, Al-Baz stressed that, "Sharon's talk should not be taken seriously as he is interested in forcing America to adopt a certain attitude but the American viewpoint would be announced next week. I do not believe that such a viewpoint would depart from the idea that the Palestinian people have a right to choose their representative, thus admitting to the legitimacy of the Palestinian leadership that represents all brackets of Palestinian people."
Al-Baz pointed out that President Mubarak's selection of persons should be suitable for the coming period. The proper person should be interested in public issues and should contribute to political issues and ought to be well known to the people.
A report of the Commercial Representation Body indicated that the body has succeeded in contracting to export five clover seed containers worth 200,000 U.S. dollars to Algeria.
SUEZ CANAL AS SECURITY FOR EGYPT'S DOLLAR BONDS HOLDERS
According to that item, the bonds hitting one billion and a half dollars in value, yields 8% interests on documents which will be mature in the year 2006, and 8.75% on the documents which will be mature in 2011.
Dr. Medhat Hassanein said he had expected the day when the agreement would be discussed. He also suggested lifting the security item, but was surprised to find out that such a step would raise the interest rate due for dollar bonds holders. Finally, Hassanein left the People's Assembly while repeating a phrase that signifies indignation as some other minister must have been responsible for that agreement. Due to that endless controversial talk about the agreement, the Speaker Dr. Fatehi Sorour referred the matter to the Committee on the Plan and Budget to find out the truth.
A single drop of natural gas and oil can not be exported to Israel, which is killing Arab Muslims and Christians, MP Badri Farghali said.
EGYPTIAN PARLIAMENT TURNS DOWN INQUIRY FROM IKHWAN ABOUT AZHAR
The majority resolution on blocking the inquiry is a precedent in the history of Egypt's parliament and part of political manoeuvres by the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) members to abort the Ikhwan's 200-document memo.
The deputies, with a great majority, favoured a proposal by Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Kamal al-Shazli, the government representative at parliament, to refer the documents to a joint panel of the committees on Religious and Educational Affairs, and Plan and Budget for discussions. However, the government is ready to fully cooperate to reach concrete proposals, the minister said.
Some NDP leaders are concerned that these moves will result in removing them or reducing their power especially as Minister of Agriculture Youssef Wali, who is also the NDP Secretary-General, recently said that the NDP reshaping would be discussed during the NDP general congress and would be within the NDP grass roots rules only.
The assembly also discussed 31 draft laws, 128 financial bills, 78 proposed bills, 53 agreements and one presidential decree, the speaker said.
Hardly had Al Azhar turned down a Muslim Brotherhood deputy proposal that would make election rather than nomination the basis of occupying the position of Al Azhar Grand Sheikh when the crisis re-emerged between Muslim Brotherhood deputies and the Government. Ikhwanite deputy, Ali Laban prepared a new statement explaining why he objected to Al Azhar reply to his bill. He called for a debate between him and Premier, Atef Ebeid in his capacity as Al Azhar Affairs Minister.
PARTY LEADER FORETELLS DISASTER IN ISRAEL ON SEPTEMBER 11
HIGHER EDUCATION MINISTER DENIES AMERICAN INTERFERENCE IN EDUCATION AFFAIRS
WASHINGTON INFORMED EGYPT AND ISRAEL OF BUSH'S STATEMENT OUTLINES
Firstly, President Bush's support of establishing an independent Palestinian state with full sovereignty over the "A" Zone, which is under full control of the Palestinian Authority and the "B" Zone which is under administration control of the Palestinian Authority, but under security control of Israel. The state will be internationally recognized and have a seat in the UN,and will be the recognized negotiator.
The international meeting will aim at laying down the procedures required for starting to execute the security, political and economic reforms and setting a schedule wich should be agreed upon beforehand.
In response to a question on the Arab attitude after the issuance of the American expected statement and whether a comprehensive and emergency Arab summit was necessary, the source said that Cairo preferred to wait until the American attitude is announced. Should it turn out to be balanced and understanding of the demands offered by Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the other parties to the American Administration, there would be no need to hold a summit.
In response to these statements, Abdel-Aziz Al-Rantissi, member of Hamas Command in Gaza Strip, told Asharq Al-Awsat that the Palestinian reality "makes such statements unrealistic." "The Palestinian resistance has been unleashed in response to the existence of an Israeli occupation that weighs heavily on the Palestinians, confiscates their land and desecrate their sanctuaries," he added, stressing that Al-Yehia statements "would be logical only if the occupation came to an end."
He admitted to the Palestinian people and its national and Islamic forces failure to dictate a national priorities table that was supposed to be set via reforms within the authority's bodies." He also pointed out that the Palestinian people and its national forces hoped that the reforms would aim to provide all potential for helping the Palestinian resistance square up to the occupation till its elimination.
Israel has got three diesel submarines equipped with sea missiles capable of carrying nuclear heads, giving Israel a nuclear weapons triangle in its land, air and sea arsenal, the sources said.
Israel also possesses short and medium-range nuclear weapons, nuclear bombs launched from jet fighters and Harpoon missiles launched from warplanes and warships.
Since the beginning of April 2002 up to the middle of this month, the occupation authorities have arrested 27 Palestinian women, the ages of most of them range between 15 and 25 years. They belong to the youth generation - schoolchildren or university students. The arrested girls showed readiness to make military operations like stabbing soldiers, trying to carry out martyrdom operations or helping in the resistance operations.
Next week, an Israeli channel will start transmitting in Arabic through satellites to promote Zionist propaganda.
27 PALESTINIAN YOUNG WOMEN DETAINED IN ISRAEL AS SUSPECTS OF POSSIBLE COMMANDOS OPERATIONS
"The Role of Parliamentarians in Supporting Palestine" was the rubric of the first conference of parliamentarians supporting the Palestinian cause on Tuesday. The meeting, which was held at Meridien Hotel in Beirut, Lebanon, was attended by President of the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies Nabih Berri, Ali Akbar Mohtashimi, the head of the delegation of the Iranian Shura Council and chairman of the the International Association of Parliamentarian Supporters of the Palestinian Cause, Lebanon's Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, and Palestinian National Council member Maher al-Taher.
"Our martyrdom operations will not cease and we will continue struggling until our territories are liberated. Talks about settlement is poppycock," Taher said.
ALGERIA: OUYAHIA AND NAHNAH FREEZE THEIR PARTIES MEMBERSHIP
NEW ALGERIAN GOVERNMENT: NO CHANGE IN SENSITIVE POSTS
He was replaced by former presidential legal advisor Mohamed Sharafi as minister of justice.
For the first time in decades, the number of cabinet ministers has risen to 40, conducting reviews of such sensitive sectors as economic recovery, privatization, finance, prison reform and family.
The cry, even though in a moment of anger, uncovers the sharp water crisis in Algeria especially as the accident that took place last week did not happen in a remote area, but in one of the most affluent areas in the capital and in the vicinity of the premises of the Cabinet Headquarters Palace, the Ministry of the Post and the National Library, which was until recently a symbol of the wealthy class in the community.
It is no longer strange to see trucks carrying water tanks through the streets of capital districts marked as "unfortunate" and numbering 70 popular areas which have no access to water supplies.
Observers emphasize that the crisis would not have aggravated if the authorities had acted to solve it on time.
Many Algerians used to talk about the "Great River" cynically but today they talk about it with envy and bitterness.
He only said "there is a lack of coordination about the two countries exploitation of underground water on joint borders." Such words are considered a clear indication to the "Great River" sources which had been thought to go deep into the Algerian soil.
The number of the rich in the Middle East increased by 3.6%, hitting 290, 000 in the year 2001 with their total wealth amounting to one trillion dollars approximately.
As for the senior rich, they are those whose financial assets exceeded 30 million dollars.
Ghorab regarded the effects ensuing from this agreement concerning the medicinal sector as most dangerous on developing countries,especially on low-income ones. When this agreement is put into effect, medicine prices are expected to hike over four times, he said, pointing out that drugs are now sold by single tablets rather than boxes and that an ampoule used in genetic engineering treatment is sold at some 1200 pounds.
FUEL OIL AND MISSILES
Colin Powell's recent tour in the Middle East had sent the situation in the Shebaa Farms front back to normal and it is no more secret that he told Damascus to necessarily control "Hezbollah" or Sharon would be let to take revenge.
The reverse reading of the series of fresh warnings supposes that Sharon seeks to extend his war in the north to guarantee the "destruction" of the conference first and foremost in spite of its weak goals, and blackmail Syria again through involving it in a corner called in Israel "double-dealing" to reassure the Americans of Israel's support for the U.S.-led war on terrorism and instigate Palestinian organizations like Islamic Jihad to launch attacks on Israelis.
Syria is preoccupied with the opponents of gradual modernization, while Lebanon is engrossed in the battle of cancelling "fleet of fuel gas cars".
A new Palestinian statehood should be established and the Palestinians have to elect new leaders unstained with terrorism (like Sharon, for instance). When the Palestinians have new leaders, establishments, security and constitution, when a Palestinian parliament with full legislative power is elected, when a financial reform with transparency and a full supervision mechanism is carried out, when an efficient judicial system is created and when Palestinian security agencies are rebuilt, then they can rely on us to build a provisional Palestinian state.
The U.S. and Israel regarded themselves as arbiters for the implementation of these difficult conditions.
As an Arab citizen representing himself only, I can say that the speech is an insult to both Palestinians and Arabs, or a "trickery" and Sharon's position coats poison with the sugar of a Palestinian state side by side with Israel, while destroying all possibilities of a Palestinian state.
Egyptian ambassador in Brussels Solayman Awad, said that the current period is witnessing an increase in Belgium investments in Toshka and Sharq (East) Owaynat projects.
He pointed out that the coming period would witness a boost in Egyptian agricultural exports to Belgian markets.
Search is underway to find an Egyptian bank whose creditworthiness is categorized first-class (AAA) through which the group's money would be injected into the real estate market.

Al-Damati said that contracts had been concluded regarding 30% of the production capacity of the first stage for exportation to the Arabian Gulf States, America, Italy and some African countries. He added that a work group had been set up to go on promotional tours around the world markets to boost the exports of the project trageted to reach 50%.
Existing dealings between Egyptian and Israel were restricted to Egyptian and Arab donations to Palestinian people, informed sources said.
It had not also signed any deals so far to export gas from Egypt to Israel.
Meanwhile, the minister announced that Egypt has conducted oil negotiations with Palestinian officials to prospect for gas and oil in the territories of the Palestinian Authority. He said that huge amounts of gas were discovered off the Gaza coast but that the Intifada and the Israeli-reoccupation obstructed the extraction works.
"Total investments in Egyptian industry sector hit LE144 billion during the last two decades, LE84 billion of which are in governorates and LE54 billion in new communities," Minister of Industry and Technological Development, Dr Ali El-Saidi announced.
The Holding Company for Engineering Industries decided to offer the Egyptian Copper Company for sale to key investors within the framework of the privatisation program.
At its last meeting, the general assembly of the holding company approved the division of Al-Nasr Auto Company into two companies. The first will go under the name of the Engineering Company for Car Services and Maintenance and the second will go under the name of the Engineering Company for Land and Tourist Transport Services.
The division decision was taken in an effort by the Holding Company for Engineering Industries to facilitate the privatisation of Al-Nasr Auto Company after the failure to sell the company in its current state to an anchor investor.
2 MILLION EGYPTIAN WORKERS ABROAD
The Central Bank of Egypt has revealed in its recent report presented to the People's Assembly a 4.9% retreat in the GDP's growth rates during FY 2000/2001 against 5.1% in FY 99/2000.
122% RISE IN NUMBER OF RUSSIAN TOURISTS VISITING EGYPT
They spent 252 thousand and 891 tourist nights, a growth rate of 62%. Russian tourists came fourth on the list of the first ten countries that send tourists to Egypt in June 2002. The number of tourists heading from the Russian market and the Commonwealth of Independent States reached 183 thousand and 56 tourists during the period from January to May this year, a rise of 66%.

The report, which was prepared by Foreign Trade Sector, indicated that the total exports surged 2% hitting 1.152 billion dollars due to increase of non-petroleum exports by 15%.
Economic sources laid it bare that local markets would witness a rise in the prices of a number of main commodities foremost of which are meat, milk, drugs, detergents and poultry.
They also pointed out the Central Bank of America's tendency to decrease the dollar interest rate with a view to increasing exports to foreign markets, something which affected the countries dealing in dollar in addition to the banks raising of 4-percent commission for securing foreign currency for clients who apply for opening import credits in euro.
The report showed that some companies raised the prices of their products directly while other companies pegged the prices reducing the net weight of their packages to keep the volume of demand stable.
The report pointed out that the GDRs of "Lakah Group" were the most dwindling ones in terms of price among nine companies that floated GDRs. Lakah Group's GDRs declined from 8.69 dollars upon floatation to 0.275 dollars or 97 percent. Meanwhile, the certificates of "Al-Ahram Beverages" were the least decreasing ones as they slightly declined from 15.5 dollars upon floatation to 8.050 dollars.
The report pointed out that the Bank of New York, in which Lakah Group's GDRs are deposited, declared earlier that cancelling Lakah Group's shares from the Stock Exchange introduction doesn't necessitate cancelling its global depository receipts.
At a meeting attended by Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) Governor Mahmoud Abul-Oyoon and the chairmen of Banque du Caire, Banque Misr, National Bank of Egypt and Arab Contractors Company, an initial agreement was reached on a financial restructure of the Arab Contractors, granting it financial lines that guarantee the launching of projects inside and outside Egypt.
The company could win new contracts and bids worth 515 billion pounds in the first six months of this year, in addition to under-execution projects valued at 4.8 billion pounds, thus granting the company a great boom in the coming two years, he said.
The agreement was signed by the Production Sufficiency Department Chief Mohammad Hilal who represented the Egyptian side and director of the GTZ in Cairo who represented the German side.
The report revealed that the German exports to Egypt included chemical substances, equipment, machines, cars, foodstuffs, and iron products while the list of Egyptian exports to Germany included garments, cotton products, oils, and aluminum products.
Trade exchange hit 95.4 million sterling last January and then dropped 72.5 million sterling last February and then 58.5 million pounds in March, said the report, compiled by Taher al-Sharief, the secretary-general of the chamber in London.
Egyptian ambassador in Brussels Solayman Awad, said that the current period is witnessing an increase in Belgium investments in Toshka and Sharq (East) Owaynat projects.
He pointed out that the coming period would witness a boost in Egyptian agricultural exports to Belgian markets.
Search is underway to find an Egyptian bank whose creditworthiness is categorized first-class (AAA) through which the group's money would be injected into the real estate market.

Existing dealings between Egyptian and Israel were restricted to Egyptian and Arab donations to Palestinian people, informed sources said.
He added that the registered industrial installations with the private sector hit 25,200, of which 21,830 installations had started their activities over the last twenty years.
An official source at the Ministry of Public Enterprise Sector stressed that the capital of the company amounted to 55 million pounds distributed among 2.750 million shares at a nominal value of 20 pounds per share.
The authorised capital of each company hits 20 million pounds and the issued one stands at one million pounds, which will be raised at the value of the fixed assets at the book cost on June 30th this year through finance by Al-Nasr Car Manufacturing Company via the Holding Company for Engineering Industries.
INVESTORS BLAME REINFORCING IRON CRISIS ON AHMED EZZ
An official statistic estimated workforce in Egypt in 2002 at some 19,666,000 workers against 18,617,000 workers in 2000. On the contrary, the number of the unemployed hiked from 1,482,000 in 2000 versus 1,780,000 in 2002. The recent report issued by the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMS) revealed that men labour force recorded 15,412,000 whereas women labour force reported 4,254,000. The former unemployment figure was 850,000 while the latter is 930,000, the report indicated.
The report ascribed this regression in GDP's growth rates to the drop in the growth rates of some sectors yielding returns for the GDP particularly Petroleum and Hotels sector.
Minister of Civil Aviation Ahmed Shafiq gave the stamp of approval to a request put forward by Minister of Tourism Mamdouh Al-Beltagi under which Russian TU 135 aircraft used by Russian charter airlines for transporting tourists would be allowed to land in Egyptian airports particularly as a number of European airports had issued a decision not to allow them to land due to the noise they cause when taking off and landing.
This market comes third during the reporting period whether in terms of the number of tourists or the tourist nights following the German and Italian markets. The sources added that the policy adopted by the Ministry of Tourism in this market was behind this rise including the international relations campaign mounted by Minister of Tourism through several meetings with Russian tourist and political officials and representatives of the public and tourist media let alone the marketing promotional campaign carried out in this market through the international company, which is specialised in this field.
The report said that free zones exports totalled about 534 million dollars while their imports hit 421 million dollars. Meanwhile, the total imports went down to 2949 million dollars due to decline of medium-sized commodity imports by 40%, investment commodities, 14%; consumer goods, 20% and petroleum ones by 3%.
The sources ascribed that rise to the hike in euro exchange rate in the last few weeks, thus impacting directly on the commodity prices as the Egyptian markets import about 30% of their needs from the European markets.
It is worthy to mention that the latest report issued by Cairo Chamber of Commerce confirmed the increase in the prices of some foodstuff and consuming commodities by 20% the year instant against last year prices.
The report indicated that the price increase wave included pesticides which rose by 5.1% and detergents in addition to the remedies of some diseases which rose by 135% like diabetes, cold, cough, blood pressure, heart diseases and analgesics.
The report, prepared by the Investment and Securities Policies Sector at the Ministry of Foreign Trade, said that through the sector's following up of the local shares equivalent to these GDRs during the comparison period it was found that there was gradual decrease in the prices of shares of these companies in the Stock Exchange and that the most dwindling share prices were those of Lakah Group, which means that there is linkage between the local shares and the global depository receipts.
Issuing global depository receipts to the Egyptian companies is meant to drag the local companies into the international investment community and markets.
High-level bank sources told Al-Alam Al-Youm that the agreement to be officially and finally signed next week includes disposing of unproductive real estate assets worth 86 million pounds at the Arab Contractors, and returning the contributions of the Arab Contractors to investment or joint companies to banks, which are estimated at around 271 million pounds.
EGYPTIAN-GERMAN AGREEMENT TO SUPPORT INDUSTRY MODERNISATION PROGRAM
Following the agreement, Minister of Industry Ali Al-Saidi said that a national system for vocational training would be applied to fulfill the actual needs of the industrial community through the use of the state-of-the-art technology in cooperation with German authorities and experts specialised in this field.
The value of Egyptian exports to Germany amounted to some 256 million euros last year while the value of German exports to Egypt amounted to about one billion and 598 million euros.
Trade exchange amounted to around 226.4 million sterling in the first three months of this year, it said. The drop is due to a decline in Egyptian exports to Britain from 137.7 million sterling in the first quarter of 2001 to 109.9 million sterling in the first quarter of this year, it added. British exports rose from 104.9 million sterling in 2001 to 116.5 million sterling this year.
As for the second half, which amounts to 180,000 tons, it will be French red wheat at a price ranging between 106.89 and 107.49 dollars per ton, which is 13 dollars less than the American red wheat.
The sums were obtained by principal banks of development and agricultural credit in order to hand them out in turn to farmers.
Many Ugandan merchants present worthless cheques when they receive goods from exporters, the report said.
Importers emphasized that some 70% of dealers with the European Union (EU) resorted to importation in euro as the EU is Egypt's first commercial partner.
Eng. Hassan Al-Shaf'i, board member of both the Businessmen Association and the Chamber of Commerce in Giza, said that 70% of importers who import from the EU countries resorted to dealing in euro due to the dearth of the dollar.
27 PALESTINIAN YOUNG WOMEN DETAINED IN ISRAEL AS SUSPECTS OF POSSIBLE COMMANDOS OPERATIONS
Since the Al Aqsa Intifada, Israeli occupation forces have escalated their violations of the right to education in the Palestinian territories, which has resulted in the martyrdom of 276 children and injuries of more than 3,000 pupils. In addition, 4 schools were converted into military barracks, while 161 schools were damaged, including 47 beyond repair, 6 others were closed down by military orders and another 25 schools were stormed and some of them turned into detention camps during the sweep of the West Bank.
Israeli occupation troops and settlers deliberately aimed their guns at innocent Palestinian pupils over the months of the Intifada, in violation of all international declarations, treaties and conventions, particularly the Fourth Geneva Convention.
The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights pointed out that that sort of crimes was carried out by elite units of the occupation forces that was called Special Units or Death Squads, and sometimes the Arabized Units, which comprised Israeli soldiers dressed as Arabs. Israeli occupation forces used different tactics to assassinate their targets, including:
-Shooting the target from one of the military posts of the occupation forces.
President Bush completely rejected the Egyptian proposals that President Hosni Mubarak carried to him with regard to the idea of a temporary Palestinian state, as he does not want to commit to any timetable that would set a date for the establishment of this state, just like he refused to give Palestinian President Yasser Arafat a one-year "test period."
Is this situation the first step towards dumping of the Arab initiative and reinstating the Saudi initiative, with its main features that stipulated full normalization in return for full withdrawal, without making any mention of the Palestinian refugee issue?
The normalization flag that was waved around by Prince Saud Al Faisal to Ariel Sharon will run into every sort of resistance by the Saudi people first of all Arab peoples, because this people will not accept the existence of an Israeli flag and Israeli goods in its country, even if the land of Palestine is liberated.
We are facing a serious conspiracy against the Muslim Nation and its sanctums in Palestine, a conspiracy that involves Arab regimes that are standing on the brink of collapse and popular rejection.
On 19 June, the Syrian Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Hassan Al Turkmeni, signed an agreement in Ankara covering the fields of training and exchange of military experience and technology between Syria and Turkey.
It is interesting that the Turkish President, Ahmet Necdet Caeser, who had returned from a visit to Teheran on the night of 18 June, received the Syrian guest in his palace, where they held lengthy talks on the prospects of Iraq and the Middle East situation. The Syrian delegation also met with the Commander of the Turkish Gendermerie, whose efforts had led to the current breakthrough in Turkey's security relations with Damascus.
A source that had participated in drafting the declaration and organizing the conference, which will be held this evening in western London, said that over 120 of the figures that would attend the conference had already signed the declaration document. "The signatories are from different areas and represent different political and ideological trends," he pointed out.
The declaration stipulates the demands of Iraq's Shiites as follows:
4-Respect of all nationalist and religious identities without exception.
8- Respect of human rights.
"The Role of Parliamentarians in Supporting Palestine" was the rubric of the first conference of parliamentarians supporting the Palestinian cause on Tuesday. The meeting, which was held at Meridien Hotel in Beirut, Lebanon, was attended by President of the Lebanese Chamber of Deputies Nabih Berri, Ali Akbar Mohtashimi, the head of the delegation of the Iranian Shura Council and chairman of the the International Association of Parliamentarian Supporters of the Palestinian Cause, Lebanon's Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, and Palestinian National Council member Maher al- Taher.
"Our martyrdom operations will not cease and we will continue struggling until our territories are liberated. Talks about settlement is poppycock," Taher said.
FREE TRADE ZONE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND JORDAN
National Democratic Rally and Peace Society Movement decided to freeze their membership in the National Popular Council, First Chamber of the Algerian Parliament, pending a ruling by the Constitutional Council in the appeals against the legislative elections held on May 30th where National Liberation Front won the majority of seats.
On June 19th, French President Jacques Chirac receives the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Armed Forces Chief of Staff, Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who is paying a three-day visit to France spearheading a delegation including Information Minister, Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed; Emirian Guard Commander, Sheikh Nahyan Bin Zayed; UAE Land Forces Commander, Staff Brigadier Sa'id Khalaf Al Romaythy and others.
NEW ALGERIAN GOVERNMENT: NO CHANGE IN SENSITIVE POSTS
He was replaced by former presidential legal advisor Mohamed Sharafi as minister of justice.
For the first time in decades, the number of cabinet ministers has risen to 40, conducting reviews of such sensitive sectors as economic recovery, privatization, finance, prison reform and family.
The cry, even though in a moment of anger, uncovers the sharp water crisis in Algeria especially as the accident that took place last week did not happen in a remote area, but in one of the most affluent areas in the capital and in the vicinity of the premises of the Cabinet Headquarters Palace, the Ministry of the Post and the National Library, which was until recently a symbol of the wealthy class in the community.
It is no longer strange to see trucks carrying water tanks through the streets of capital districts marked as "unfortunate" and numbering 70 popular areas which have no access to water supplies.
Observers emphasize that the crisis would not have aggravated if the authorities had acted to solve it on time.
Many Algerians used to talk about the "Great River" cynically but today they talk about it with envy and bitterness.
He only said "there is a lack of coordination about the two countries exploitation of underground water on joint borders." Such words are considered a clear indication to the "Great River" sources which had been thought to go deep into the Algerian soil.
The number of the rich in the Middle East increased by 3.6%, hitting 290, 000 in the year 2001 with their total wealth amounting to one trillion dollars approximately.
As for the senior rich, they are those whose financial assets exceeded 30 million dollars.
Ghorab regarded the effects ensuing from this agreement concerning the medicinal sector as most dangerous on developing countries,especially on low-income ones. When this agreement is put into effect, medicine prices are expected to hike over four times, he said, pointing out that drugs are now sold by single tablets rather than boxes and that an ampoule used in genetic engineering treatment is sold at some 1200 pounds.
REGIONAL ARAB UNIONS
Globalization is sweeping over the whole world to establish the power of the big, including countries and corporations, devour the small, including economies and cultures, and marginalize the roles of the weak, including peoples and communities.
My belief in built on the following reasons:
-There exist popular organizations that can be a nucleus for such an effort, such as the Arab National Conference or the Islamic National Conference.
Under the above heading, Zuhair Qossibati of Al-Hayat writes an article to say: The Israeli campaign against Lebanon under the cover of "war on terrorism" to the extent that rumours have it that Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri extends donations to Al-Qaeda organization after U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld accused Iran of "exporting Al-Qaeda terrorists" to Bekaa Valley via Damascus, and then claims by diplomatic sources through U.S. press on missile shipments from Tehran to Hezbollah as well as information on the build-up of Iran's Revolutionary Guard forces in Bekaa "in preparation to attack the depth of Israel, possibly within days", mean nothing but boosting sensationalism to give Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon free rein to attack Lebanon.
Syria absorbed the message and thereupon the Farms area was calm for time was not suitable for the Israeli premier who was busy with the "Operation Defensive Wall", a thing which was, of course, put in Israeli- U.S. calculations.
After all what took place under the "Defensive Wall", can anyone in the region rule out another, possible fiercer, round of Sharon's war at another theater, which may take the Lebanese and Syrian tracks to a completely different stage just as the first round, which could encircle the Intifada in the interest of a Palestinian state that will remain just a motto for several years to come?
Jihad al-Khazen, the former chief editor of Al-Hayat, writes an article to say: President George W. Bush's much-awaited speech was a totally Sharonite one, including their Middle East peace vision.
However, the 3-year period of a provisional state starts only when the previous difficult preconditions, laid down by Sharon with U.S. additions, are met, with the issues of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees to be discussed in the future.
I think that no Arab citizen can trust their intentions.
"PROVISIONAL STATE"...WWHY NOW?
The more important push to Sharon's program came on Monday (June 24) when Bush announced his much-awaited "provisional state" vision, which was not different from this program in terms of details, including the tougher demand for a new Palestinian leadership, which is merely aimed to blackmail Yasser Arafat personally.
This will surely take place even if the final agreement negotiations last for a further 20 years.
Relevant articulate indications were involved in Bush's speech.
BELGIUM WILL INCREASE INVESTMENTS IN TOSHKA AND SHARQ (EAST) OWAYNAT
The ambassador said that that came within the framework of keenness on the part of Egyptian and Belgian governments to raise the volume of Belgian investments in Egypt currently amounting to $100 million.
Al Alam Al Youm learnt that an Arabian Gulf group has shown willingness to pump $2 billion into the Egyptian real estate market to energize the real estate finance activities on which a special law was passed a year ago.
He noted that a presidential decree concerning the establishment of the fund through which such projects would be subsidized has not been issued yet , wondering in whose account shall we deposit this LE1 billion!
EGYPTIAN-SAUDI PROJECT FOR JUICE AND DAIRY PRODUCTS
The second stage will witness the setting up of new lines for the production of food cans and yoghurt which are 100% export-oriented. It is expected to start at the end of this year.
Existing dealings between Egyptian and Israel were restricted to Egyptian and Arab donations to Palestinian people, informed sources said.
It had not also signed any deals so far to export gas from Egypt to Israel.
Meanwhile, the minister announced that Egypt has conducted oil negotiations with Palestinian officials to prospect for gas and oil in the territories of the Palestinian Authority. He said that huge amounts of gas were discovered off the Gaza coast but that the Intifada and the Israeli-reoccupation obstructed the extraction works.

Some believed that this performance and opinions by Islamic Group leaders over some Sharia-political issues and previous stances of the Group did not conform to their ranks inside the Group, nor did they conform to the long years they spent in Egyptian prisons, as they exaggeratedly criticized the Group's previous stances and policies and refrained from directing any criticism to the Egyptian Government's policies whether in the past or at present.

The question now is: what should the Sudanese government and Egypt do?
However, in the coming six years, the Khartoum government is required to spur the southerners to agree on a united, or even a federal, state.
The Sudanese government is now keen on maintaining relations with America and we also want good ties to continue between Washington and Khartoum. However, Washington's genuine intentions are unknown and unclear but we can conclude what Washington wants.

Although the conference where former generals in Iraqi army discussed the future of a post-Saddam Iraq and the role of the military in it was over and issued its resolutions, the relations of the Hashemites with the Iraqi throne and the talk of their return have not stopped.
In that axis, Western commentators said that Prince Hasan tried to improve his image in the eyes of the Americans and prove that he was better than his nephew.
These arrangements, covering another two provinces, are being made with American back-up in the context of bilateral cooperation.
The U.S. has been showing increasing significance to Djibouti since the September 11 attacks thanks to its strategic position between the African continent and the Arab Peninsula at the entrance of the Red Sea.
Different Islamic blocs in the Kuwaiti Parliament started their election preparations due to the nearing date of parliamentary elections in Kuwait. It is officially scheduled that the fifth complementary parliamentary session will be completed next June. In this regard, reports are circulated to the effect that the date of elections could possibly be put forward to avoid holding them in the summer taking into account the high temperature in Kuwait at that time. This matter may prevent the candidates election campaigns, which include symposia and rallies from being conducted at opportune times particularly after the experience of the summer elections in June 1999 when the Kuwaiti Parliament was constitutionally dissolved due to a government protest against what it described as parliamentary arbitrariness in using the right to question ministers.
Different parliamentary sources said that liberal and government parties agreed on common action at the end of the summer holiday that seeks to bring the issue of granting women political rights up to the parliament. They pointed out that the women rights supporters got a government promise to strongly support this tendency. They now feel that the executive power is more credible at that time more than any other time.
He said that the constitutional movement welcomed his call, but he noticed that the Salafi popular rally neither accepted nor refused his call.
Commenting on the recent visit of the U.S. Undersecretary of Defence, Paul Wolfowitz, to Turkey and his consultations regarding the situation in Iraq, Al-Ahram Al-Arabi published the following analysis:
Second; Ankara does not feel at ease concerning American contacts with Iraqi Kurdish groups. These contacts included talks about a federal state in Iraq, comprising a Kurdish entity in the north whose capital is Kirkuk.
Third; Ankara stressed the necessity not to ignore about one million Turkmen of Turkish origins who live in north Iraq at a percentage of one to three. It also warned against the seriousness of Kurdish groups' ignorance of the rights and ambitions of those Turkmen, whom Ankara views as suffering from racial discrimination pracitised against them by Iraq's Kurds.
IRAN IS WAITING FOR DEATH GAME IN IRAQ Under this headline, Talib Al-Ahmed from Tehran, wrote an article, some excerpts of which run to the following effect:
The second option rejects all kinds of cooperation with American schemes on Iraq's future. It thinks that if anything of the sort took place, the credibility of the Islamic Republic in the Islamic World would suffer negative impacts.
The third option calls for Iran taking a neutral attitude towards what would take place on the Iraqi theatre of events when the expected American campaign against Iraq starts just as it had done at the outbreak of the Desert Storm in 1991.
Political Advisor to President Mubarak Dr Osam Al-Baz criticised pro-Israel American position, indicating that the U.S. helped Israel continue with perpetrating war crimes against the Palestinians when it justified such crimes as "self-defence."
Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) said that its leader Dr. John Garang had conducted a "primary evaluation" with the Egyptian leadership over Machakos Protocol which the SPLM had signed with the Sudanese government. Garang also received a message from Libyan leader Mu'ammar Gaddafi supporting the protocol.
Erman declined to uncover the details of the discussions held with Cairo. However, observers made it probable that Cairo has informed Garang of its fears and concern over the self-determination of South Sudan that was stated in Machakos Protocol, which was signed between the SPLM and Khartoum late last month.
MINISTER OF IRRIGATION: THE HIGH DAM LAKE WATER STOCKS MEET THE NEEDS OF EGYPT AND SUDAN
He pointed out that the Irrigation Ministry was making periodic predictions about flood features and referring them regularly to the Nile Input Committee which controls the water output and levels.
A few days after the Egyptian Supreme Court-Martial had issued its rulings in the case known as the Muslim Brotherhood Group (Ikwan) "professors" organisation, which included 16 leading figures, Asharq Al-Awsat learnt that the Group had addressed its deputies in the People's Assembly (the 17-member group) to launch a parliamentary campaign calling for cancelling courts-martial for fear that another number of its members might be court-martialled.
The Ikhwanite efforts come at a time when court-martial rulings have been issued against some 115 of its members since 1995. They have been included in 4 cases, two of which were in 1995 and 1996 in which 82 members were involved; a case in 1999 in which rulings were issued against 15 members while the latest of which included 16 members.
It might be mentioned that eleven countries - namely, Fiji, New Zealand, Colombia, Uruguay, Canada, Australia, Norway, Italy, Hungary, France and USA - participate in the peace-keeping forces known as MFO whose number hits 1836 soldiers.
It was also announced in Khartoum that there were no official arrangements for a meeting between Mubarak and his Sudanese counterpart Omar al-Bashir who left Khartoum for Malaysia to participate in the "smart partnership forum" in Kuala Lumpur. On his way back, Bashir would stop in Sharja, UAE.
HUDHEBI: MARTIAL RULINGS MAKE US MORE PERSISTENT IN PUSHING AHEAD WITH OUR CALL
We hoped that the opponents of our ideas would oppose us with their thought as we also hoped that the age of confronting thought with courts-martial had gone away."
A PRECEDENT IN COURTS-MARTIAL HISTORY: A DEFENDANT ALLOWED TO CONTRACT HIS MARRIAGE IN COURT
The court asked the defence panel to prepare their pleadings in the next sitting about a number of defendants in the case accused of committing crimes of establishing and running an illegitimate group with a view to encroaching upon public freedoms and rights enshrined in the Constitution to citizens, carrying out acts of monitoring in a prelude to assassinate security men and public figures and sabotage state-owned establishments and institutions and possessing unlicensed arms and explosives.
The defendants' relatives were not allowed to attend the hearing.
They also gave care to individual promoting of the call and complete the group's administrative structures and every thing needed for reactivating the group's regeneration. They took care to periodically review and appreciate such schemes and programmes. They did all that with one personal objective in view and an ultimate goal, which is stepping to power. In a statement, the group said, "The verdicts pronounced by the court-martial against honourable Egyptian university professors, thinkers, and professionals represent solid evidence exposing the policy adopted by the Egyptian government vis-a-vis freedoms and human rights and the Palestinian cause.
The report pointed out that the new natural gas discoveries made Egypt look for new markets for exporting natural gas.
Palestinian Assistant Undersecretary of the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation Jihad Khalil al-Wazir said total losses incurred by the Palestinian people due to the ongoing Israeli aggressions were estimated at around 10 billion U.S. dollars. The losses included the destruction of infrastructure, projects, plants, municipalities, general and branch administration buildings, excluding people's property and bulldozed farmland, he said.
Political Bureau chief of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), Khalid Mesh'al said that Hamas would not give up its line of resistance, steadfastness and sacrifice, threatening Israel of severe retaliation to Gaza massacre.
"Unless you (Arabs) defend Iraq, Palestine and Intifada, you will be the first to lose."
Addressing a ceremony at the Libyan Omar Mokhtar University on the occasion of granting him an honorary doctorate in geopolitics, he spoke on potential Israeli nuclear bombings in Lake Victoria, which may thwart water supply to northern and central Africa when Israel's existence is endangered.
The general mentor of the group Abdel-Majid Zunaibat told a press conference in Amman yesterday that the position of the three ministers aims at stopping Palestinian resistance to Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He added that "the axis which is most frustrating is the position of the Jordanian foreign minister especially his attack on holiness of martyrdom and martyrdom operations. His position served occupation purposes and responded positively to the American and Zionist fierce campaign on martyrdom operations."
Well-informed British sources said Sudan's debts could be cancelled. I might also aid to develop its infrastructure. The move comes in the context of the peace process in south Sudan.
The northerners should not grumble about the inflow of such aid to the southerners as the latter need a lot of assistance to resettle those who escaped war.
Egypt was not ignored and its role is required in this stage, the Sudanese veep said.
WHAT HAVE THE NEIGHBORS PREPARED FOR THE BATTLE?
The most important question, raised at this very moment, is: "What have the Arab governments done in preparation for the military, political, media and humanitarian problematics of the coming battle?"
Will Jordan be able to absorb more people?
These precautions are based on a serious probability that within a few months we will witness the biggest operation of change in the region that heralds great risks, most prominent of which is the conflict over the rule in Iraq, especially as the opposition is unable to create popular bases to support it inside the country.
Yesterday (July 29), sources of Al-Qaeda Organization responded to statements, mentioned by well informed sources and published by Asharq Al-Awsat, on the possibility that Osama Bin Laden, Leader of Al-Qaeda, might have been killed, especially as he has not showed up since the heavy American raids on Tora Bora.
These sources, which e-mailed this information and said it is exclusive information to Asharq Al-Awsat, declined to give more details about the operation and whether it would target the American forces inside Afghanistan or any other place in the world.
"Sheikh Bin Laden is alive and will appear on a recorded video tape after the implementation of this operation to affirm that he is alive and that he will continue fighting the US," the sources said.
Within the framework of the constant American pressure against Egypt, Al-Arabi learnt that there is a tendency inside USAID to stop financial assistance offered to the Ministry of Justice within the framework of the programme of Egyptian judiciary development in what seemed like a punishment for sentencing Ibn Khaldoun Centre Director, Dr. Saad Eddin Ibrahim.
In return, the Bar Association would contribute to what the sources called "the plan to expand democracy." The sources point out that the decision to suspend the aid to the Ministry of Justice had been met with objections inside a sector in the USAID bureau in Cairo. Some think that it represented heavy damage to the American interests in Egypt and would accentuate feelings of hostility to Washington in the Egyptian street.
According to the Party Law, the committee will respond to the request in three months' time whether in refusal or approval provided that two sessions are held with her to discuss the party's platform.
The October 12th next was also set for considering the petition filed by the New Nile Party against the Committee on Political Parties which has earlier turned down its establishment.
This is a mistake which is similar to the one made by the Iraqi regime when it killed a British reporter and entered into a confrontation that ended in the occupation of Kuwait.
But if it sought to turn this role into a blackmailing tool with threatens, evade commitments or destabilize the region, it would become an enemy.
According to today's prevalent theory in Washington, the nature of the incumbent regimes in Egypt and other Arab countries are responsible for the September 11 crisis.
According to present thinking, the optimal way to achieve this end is to establish centers and institutions such as Ibn Khaldoun Center for Developmental Studies, run by Dr. Saad Eddin Ibrahim, and to encourage civil society organizations and liberal trends in general. So, the campaign against Ibrahim is deemed a war on the essence of the U.S.-West project for change in the Arab world.
This clash could be understood if the issue was related to the dignity of Egypt and Arab nation and legitimate Arab rights in Palestine and others.
EGYPT: IKHWAN FACES THREE CASES AT STATE SECURITY COURT
The defendants will be brought to justice according to the emergency law, and will be unable to challenge potential court rulings.
The referral of the 101 members of the Muslim Brotherhood to court was a thunderbolt to the group's lawyer Abdel-Mona'em Abdel-Maksoud who was taken aback by the referring of this large number of Ikhwan voters to trial for just seeking to cast their votes, terming the referral decision as "political".
NDP's provincial office grassroots elections last July and August led to the removal of around 650 parliamentarians representing the NDP in the People's Assembly and Shura Council from leading positons in the NDP.
Meanwhile, reliable sources in the NDP said NDP leaders also started to show firmness and rigidity against members' threats to the extent that they could resign from the NDP.
Al-Hayat learnt from a Lebanese ministerial source that the Iraqi Vice President, Taha Yassin Ramadan had confirmed Baghdad's willingness to receive inspectors and cooperate with the UN or any international body to examine its weapon arsenal.
KUWAITI RESEARCHERS & POLITICIANS CALL FOR CONSOLIDATING RELATIONS WITH IRAQI PEOPLE
The presence of a democratic system in both countries is the only guarantee of stability, they said.
According to Egyptian statistics, most Israeli tourists prefer Sharm El-Sheikh, Nuweiba' and Taba in Sinai because they are near the Egyptian-Israeli border and strictly secured in a way that no Palestinian commandoes could infiltrate.
To the Egyptians' joy, 45 persons from the Israeli diplomatic families have left Cairo. The Egyptians attributed this step to the growing hatred for everything pertaining to or coming from Israel and popular pressure.
Shpeilat added, "Minister Hamad's statement is no secret to be whispered but is said in public." He added that that was why he refused to close down the Zionist commercial bureau when the Arab summit decided severing relations with Israel.
RIYADH AND TEHRAN FORCE BAGHDAD DOWN THEIR THROATS
During the visit paid this week by Saudi Foreign Minister, Saud Al-Faysal to Tehran, bilateral discussions stressed the seriousness of conditions facing the region due to American threats and urged Iraqi government to implement United Nations resolutions and abort the justifications Washington uses as pretexts to carry out its anticipated military campaign.
What consecrates the Iranian fears is the call made by a number of American congressmen for adopting "Iran first" option and changing the priorities in the declared war against the axis of evil countries through making Iran, rather than Baghdad, the next target of the American campaign.
It is noteworthy in this context that political forces in both the Reformist and Conservative trends in Iran do not feel contented about the statements made by the government officials on rejecting the American strike and changing Saddam Hussein's regime at America's will. On the contrary, they call for extending bigger support to the Iraqi Islamic opposition based in Iran or urging it to be involved in the American project for change in Iraq.
It is noteworthy that Iran and Saudi Arabia do not have the ability to prevent the U.S. from going ahead in its prepared project for Iraq, as is the case with other countries in the region. The most they can do is to try to delay the project through pressure cards that are not effective in the basics of the game.
The protocol also included the formation of the presidency of the state and its competence, the parliament, the cabinet, the judiciary, the government of South Sudan and the governments of the other provinces.
The project, nevertheless, does not compel either of them to make other parties take over ministries or state posts and only urges them to form a national unity government with wide grassroots that reflects the need for national integrity and unity.
The southerners will be given 33 percent of the parliament's seat and 40 percent of the Provinces Council's seats.
The statement, a copy of which together with a copy of the charter has been received by Al-Hayat, said that, "an elite of political forces, representatives of the civil society and intellectual and cultural personalities had discussed the "National Honour Charter", suggested by the Muslim Brotherhood group as a base for national action for building modern Syria dominated by plurality, rotation of power, institutions and the law; a state where justice and equality prevail, a state where human rights are respected and man's dignity is preserved.
The signatories saw in the "privacy of the Syrian-Lebanese relation" an approach to further solidarity between the two brotherly peoples that would ensure mutual respect between the two countries to build a close relation on proper basis away from the spirit of arrogance, possession or domination.
It added that Islam constitutes "a civilizational referentiality and an identity for the nation's sons. Our country's affiliation to its Arab system is considered a basis for building a futuristic political strategy."
The charter under item "The Third Goal", provides for confronting the Zionist project considering it with its military, political and cultural dimensions the gravest danger threatening our nation and country, thus urging rallying forces and mobilizing capacities to face it.
The charter was signed by 25 writers, doctors, engineers and researchers as well as others who are mostly Islamists but including independents and one communist (Ahmed Shahin) and one Marxist (Sobhi Al-Hadidi).
The participants regarded the London meeting as a starting point for constructive national dialogue to coordinate efforts and close up ranks in order to build Syria, a free, strong and impregnable country.
General Mentor of Muslim Brotherhood, Lawyer, Ali Sadreddin Al-Bayanoni inaugurated the conference sessions. He said that absence of national dialogue for 3 decades had cost the Syrian people the most important components of national unity as well as its freedom and dignity and a dear part of the homeland, by which he clearly meant the Golan Heights.
Zuheir Salim, a Muslim Brotherhood leader in Syria, said that the London conference had achieved a big success as the participants had transcended many points of differences during the meeting.
Among the participants were former minister Ahmed Abou-Saleh and a representative of Syrian Kurdish Party as well as other national and Ikhwanite personalities.
There are two important projects in prospect; the first relieves political tension between the two parties and tasks the Engineers Syndicate to technically supervise an ambition government project aiming at ridding the government of the pay of government headquarters and institutions through building a big series of government buildings. The second contains much policy as it employs the syndicate for constructing the oil pipeline between Amman and Baghdad, a giant pipeline with strategic implications.
What is now certain is that no genuine political reform can take place in the country without Muslim Brotherhood. More significantly, their exclusion from the game under the pretext that they are hard-liners is a voluntary response to the opinions of people who have nothing to do with reform, harbour ill will for the country and seek to deter change, but lack enough courage to announce attitudes that run counter to the royal palace instructions and therefore content themselves with poisoning the climate by harassing the tools and symbols of reform mainly the Islamic trend.
All of a sudden, the compass hands have changed directions and contacts between government ministers and professional syndicates intensified. The current Minister of Works, Hosni Abou-Gheida, who is former chairman of the Engineers Syndicate played a role in that direction, thus relatively redeeming status to those institutions which practically lead (due to the Islamists) the general political activity in the country ranging from demonstration and marches to seminars and committees.
THREE STANDARDS
Can anybody imagine for a moment that a US delegate will applaud the flow of concrete in the foundations of a nuclear reactor in one of the Arab countries even if it was a US friend just as Mr. Jack Brichard did when he recently attended the party in North Korea?
Even the Iranians did not escape the US watchful eyes. Washington has been continuously pressuring Russia to freeze its nuclear program with Tehran.
What are the indications of the agreement reached by Washington and Pyongyang some years ago under which the western consortium undertook the establishment of nuclear reactors in North Korea while the Arabs are roughly and decisively banned from developing nuclear energy sources?
The mania for striking Iraq may be evidence of a fourth standard exclusive to one country of the whole world!
The sources pointed out that all this notwithstanding, the type of cases and the timing of their coming to the surface indicate a notable effect on the cases and type of defendants by the political conflict inside the NDP between the new generation who leads reform represented by Gamal Mubarak (son of the President of the Republic) and the old guard of the NDP.
An Egyptian study revealed that many male Mps were positively more interested in woman's rights than female ones through putting up ideas and proposals to defend woman's rights in the society.
The study added that one of the negative impacts of the "khul'a" law is woman's loss of her material rights in case she resorted to it. On the social level many people see that the "khul'a" law was a reason behind the decay of Egyptian family particularly when some wives quickly resort to it due to small differences with their husbands.
The plaintiff in his lawsuit claimed that despite the end of the Ottoman suzerainty over Egypt in 1914. Although Egypt was declared a British protectorate in that year, it kept paying tribute to Turkey from 1915 until 1955 without legal right. President Nasser was the first to notice that as he asked the then FM to assess these sums in gold coins. The levied tribute (23,174,984 gold Sterling pounds) were estimated by a chartered accountant in light of current prices at LE6.628 bn.
Ikhwanite deputy, Hussein Ibrahim had passed the three questions to Ebeid, Al-Sherif and Khedr more than a week ago, but none of them took the trouble to answer them in writing in accordance with the procedure followed during the recess of parliament. This made him announce determination to interpellate the Government when the parliamentary session starts.
Ikhwanite deputies accused the government of declining to uncover the scandal of importing "bad wheat" and its infiltration into the country's internal markets. He refused to uncover the names of importers or prepare a black list of their names so as to avoid dealing with them. Neither did he cancel their importation licences nor suspend their membership in the importers department of the Chambers of Commerce General Federation.
NEW MONETARY RESERVE COLLAPSE
The report noted that net foreign assets with banks have been affected by the international monetary reserve retreat. They decreased in turn as total assets hit about LE16.8 billion, down LE6.1 billion over 8 months.
The rise of deposit volume is attributed to deterioration of the Stock Exchange conditions, thus driving investors to divest their shares and deposit their capital in banks which they regarded as safer and not vulnerable to hazards, let alone the high interest rate they will get, the report added.
Israeli sources on Sunday said the effects of "lukewarm peace" between Egypt and Israel seemed to be obvious in the World Summit for Sustainable Development, which kicked off in Johannesburg, South Africa on Sunday as Israel and Egypt offered no joint projects. Both countries are not engaged in any joint ventures at present, they said.
Ministry sources told the paper that Israel has no joint projects with Egypt to offer to the summit for cooperation with Egypt has been suspended since Egypt announced its position on the Palestinian issue. There are no regional joint economic projects with Egypt whatsoever.
To the surprise of everybody in national and Islamic milieus inside the Green Line in Israel, it transpired that 10,000 thousand Arabs joined the ranks of the rightist Likud Party with the end of the admission campaign launched by the ruling party in Israel.
It is worth mentioning that 600 out of 5,000 representing the total population of Ain Mahel village, Nazareth, currently hold the Likud membership cards. This rush to join the Likud Party ranks was attributed to one person who recruited 400 villagers to the party setting a new record of loyalty to the party leaders after they appointed him headmaster of the village's school.
Israeli academicians who have good command of foreign languages can join the UN next year according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry.
The movement leader said during a visit to Arbil where the Kurdish administration is headquartered, that the movement supports the party with all its power in the face of the fierce campaign launched by the Turkish government. The movement stands by the party against any external threat.
Ihsan Abdel-Aziz said that he told the officials that the movement is ready to receive an American or European delegation in order to find out facts about allegations against the Islamic trend particularly those related to the presence of Al Qaeda members or chemical labs in Iraq's Kurdistan.
An Arab diplomat involved in mediation between the Syrian government and the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood Group stated that Damascus did not impose a "political veto" on the group.
The source expressed his belief that the Muslim Brotherhood discourse in exile contributed to pushing ahead with the mediation and asked for giving the Syrian government some time to ponder on the Ikhwanite file.
The group will hold a conference on 23 August that will be attended by a variety of the political spectrum whether from Arab and Syrian personalities; independents or partisans to discuss the draft "National Honour Charter" that organizes the mechanism of political action on the Syrian arena and leads to a "responsible conversation that discards the language of violence".
He added that the association had recently supplied the Iraqi side with 300 generators of a capacity of 250 kv/amp and would supply another 148 high-voltage transformers to back up power distribution plants. Cooperation between the two brotherly countries in different commercial and industrial domains was increasing, he concluded.
Egypt's access to the World Forum for Natural Gas Producers and Exporters will allow the country to participate in decision-making and putting up thoughts and proposals to increase prices and bring benefits to both producers and consumers, he said.
The Investment Authority intends to agree to the construction of three new projects in the field of natural gas under the special free zones system in Beheira.
Dr. Ghamrawi approved the establishment of a new project under the general free zones systems in the field of providing oil services in the general free zone in Alexandria.
A PLAN FOR MODERNIZING MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM AIR FLEET
He added that that comes after the new petroleum and gas discoveries which are being developed to be placed on the map of the Egyptian production in the coming stage, in addition to the growing demand for prospecting for oil and natural gas by specialized international companies.
The ministry had registered a logo and trademark for Egyptian cotton abroad to prevent adulteration, forgery, and pretence that other kinds of cotton not grown in Egypt are Egyptian.
Cotton Exports Federation report confirmed that companies exports reached 575 thousand kantars against 809 thousand kantars exported last year (2000/2001 season).
Italy topped the list of cotton importing countries.
The index A price declined to 38.65 cent/libra. Brand index B also went down.
Premier, Dr Atef Ebeid announced that the Government would bear the differential between the price cotton sales to spinneries and the international prices for a period not exceeding three years starting from this year.
The premier added that in order to facilitate exportation, the new system of immediate release and "drawback" would be put into effect in a few days' time so that exporters' dues could be reimbursed at the Customs regarding imported production components of export-oriented goods.
During the tour, the Premier said that the Government had prepared a five-year plan for developing Egyptian harbours at a cost of LE2.6 billion adding that maritime transport had witnessed big developments in the last twenty years where the state investments reached more than LE6.4 billion so that the number of Egyptian harbours rose from 6 to 11 at an actual assimilation capacity reaching 60 million tons per year.
Tayel had given excessive credit and loans to a group of leading and shareholders iron merchants as well as companies in which his son was a shareholder, in violation of the law on banks and credit.
In an urgent memo to Prime Minister, Dr. Atef Ebeid, the Federation of Investors' Societies' Executive Committee called on him to issue a bold sovereign decision compelling banks to reschedule the debts of the defaulters who live in Egypt after marginalizing interest. They asked that such debts should be paid off in a period ranging between 7 and 10 years after a grace period of 6-12 months according to each case.
In its memo, the Committee stressed the importance of concentrating on supporting insolvent investors inside Egypt because they are worth caring for another than those who escaped abroad.
Misr-Romania Bank manager, Abd Errahman Baraka agreed to the previous opinion emphasizing that the bond-issuing banks must have a clear vision that would define how to employ the ensuing liquidity. He pointed out that the state of recession the market is currently undergoing requires of banks to be cautious before rushing into the issuance of bonds and putting them on the market. He added that the fact that bonds had dominated a considerable percentage of market dealings and some banks' success in the issuance of bonds recently can not adequately justify excessive issuance of other bonds. Before taking such a step, there should be coordination with the Capital Market Authority and the CBE as well as a specialized consulting firm in order to ascertain how far the market would assimilate the prospective bonds.
She added, "We've asked the Government through the People's Assembly's Economic Committee to review the financial policy, pointing out that ever since 1997 up till now there has been a considerable disruption in expenditure items against annually collected revenues.
Abou El Futoh used to occupy the position of deputy managing director of Misr Exterior Bank since last May.
Chairman of the General Tax Authority, Talaat Hammam said tax proceeds this year hit 25 billion pounds out of the targetted 29.6 billion pounds, a rise of 1.5 billion pounds against the proceeds of last year, in spite of the commonly known deteriorated economic conditions. This is a natural result of the good treatment of taxpayers, light resorting to challenge committees and consequently courts, and settling legal disputes between taxpayers through reconciliation committees all over the country, he said.
Some 4000 tax evadors were uncovered and referred to public prosecution in the fiscal year ending in July 30, 2002, Hammam said, pointing out that 95% of these evadors had been reconciled, but the rest are still uncertain whether to reconcile or to continue disputing till the matter is referred to the judiciary.
The price per ton rose from LE1420 to LE1960 because of one company monopolising that type of iron, namely Ezz El-Dekheila Company run by MP Eng. Ahmed Ezz.
They, together with three public companies, filed a memo with Premier, Dr Atef Ebeid against the monopolizing practices exercised by Ezz El-Dekheila Company. These companies are Super Gas, Sakr Factory for Metal Products, an affiliate of the Arab Organization for Industrialization, and the Nagma for Metal Industries. They emphasized that the recent rises in prices were motivated only by a wish to earn more profits and exploit the retreat in Egyptian Iron and Steal Company production and its division into two companies as a prelude to putting them up for sale within the framework of the privatization programme, and the imposition of dumping duties on imports of tin iron which used to be obtained from the Ukraine and Russia.
He added that the study presented by the Industries Federation to the Government demanding the cancellation of the dumping duties on the foreign product and allowing importation once again, which, in turn, posed a threat to monopolisers who decided to calm the situation for fear of clashes erupting with the officials. This means that price speculations might possibly come back anytime in the future.
According to such a study, measures will be taken by the Industries Federation in co-operation with the Egyptian Government to restabilize the market.
Eng. Moharam Hilal denied the rise in metal products prices by 40%, emphasising that they did not exceed 5% regardless of the rise in tin iron prices. The demand for products did not rise either due to the current recession and depression.
Last year, German investments in Egypt hit about LE739 million. The trade balance deficit between the two countries went down due to an annual increase of 6.9% in Egyptian exports to Germany.
EGYPTIAN PROMOTION DELEGATION TO HUNGARY NEXT MONTH
The Egyptian government has almost settled the controversy on a gas deal with Turkey, with Egyptian Ambassador in Ankara Fatehi al-Shazly officially blasting Turkey for putting on the back burner Egyptian-Turkish talks on the implementation of a protocol inked by the Egyptian and Turkish oil ministers in February 2000. According to the protocol, 4 or 5 billion cubic meters of Egyptian liquefied gas should be exported to Turkey on a yearly basis.
On Egyptian natural gas, Shazly said Turkey is looking forward to being an energy passageway following political stability, transferring it from the Caspian Sea to Europe. It poses itself as an alternative transferring the Caspian Sea resources so as to be at the world's disposal via Ceylan Port on the Mediterranean Sea, he said, crossing his fingers that Egyptian gas would be exported to Europe via Turkey.

EGYPTAIR'S DIRECT LINE BETWEEN CAIRO AND TOKYO TO BE OPERATED
INDIAN AMBASSADOR: A FULL AGENDA FOR ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH EGYPT
Q: What is your estimate of the activities proposed by the Foreign Trade Ministry for the celebration of India's year in Egypt?
A number of other activities and events are also underway.
India is one of the biggest importers of Egyptian cotton and Egypt also imports some kinds of cotton yarn from India.
