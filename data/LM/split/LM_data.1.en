This reorganization move, which affected 25 diplomats abroad, is the first of this size since the Gulf War in 1991.
Mohammad Al-Douri, the former dean of the law school in Baghdad, was appointed to replace Barazan Ibrahim Al-Takriti.

The letter came after the British "Sunday Telegraph" Newspaper published an article headlined, "Egyptian Police Crucify, Rape Christians."

But it was learned in Bern that the application will apparently be considered positively "unless new events develop."
Iraq's mission to the United Nations in Geneva denied that Barazan Al-Takriti had dissented, as the Iraqi opposition has inferred.
By Harvey Clair - Euro Launch Golden Opportunity for Counterfeiters
With the start of the Euro circulation on the first of January 2002, currency counterfeiters will have two ways to hone in: - Currency counterfeiters may take advantage of a period, which may extend for six months, for exchanging national currencies with Euros, in order to pass the largest possible amount of the counterfeit currency, part of which may have already been in existence, since checking procedures will not be strict due to the vast amounts of money that will be exchanged in a short period.
Experts find themselves facing a dilemma with regard to the campaign's start date: If the campaign starts very early, currency counterfeiters will be the first beneficiaries of the information it provides, and will go to work immediately. However, if the campaign is very late, people will not be able to recognize the counterfeit notes.
The European Central Bank intends to print 30 billion pieces of the Euro's banknotes in 11 European countries.
The White House added that Clinton will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat "and will address both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples speaking about the significance of the Wye Plantation Accord and the need of continuing to support the peace process in the Middle East."

In an interview published today by the Jordanian "Al Arab Al Youm" Newspaper, Al-Takriti denied press reports which said that he was thinking about not returning to Iraq.
Al-Takriti, who arrived last Sunday in Amman, said that "my kids (who remained in Switzerland) need me more than at any time before because of the absence of their mother, which makes my absence from them harder for them, but despite that, I decided to ignore my feelings and my kids' needs to have me next to them and decided to return to Baghdad immediately to put an end to this nonsense that hostile media outlets are spreading rumors about."
Press reports indicated that Al-Takriti had been refusing to return to Iraq because of his bad relations with Oday Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi president's eldest son.
On the other hand, Al-Takriti warned the United States from the consequences of her policy on Iraq and said, "We acknowledge and know that America is capable of igniting a fire anywhere, but is she capable of extinguishing it whenever she wants?, and is she able to limit the size of the fire to its place without spreading to the neighborhood?"

Asia 2000: Lebanon Plays match of a Lifetime and Extracts a Tie from Iraq
This is Lebanon's first point in the championship after it lost 0-4 to Iran while Iraq increased its points to 4 by beating Thailand 2-0 last Thursday.
The Lebanese team that started the match today was a different team from the one that played the opening game and lost badly to its counterpart Iran (0-4). The team began in better shape, although it was two goals behind Iraq, with skilled passes and clear technical dexterity, which thrilled around 30 thousand spectators crammed onto the stands.
The Lebanese came down with all their weight after the goal and had many chances in the first fifteen minutes; their game was measured and they reached the Iraqi goal easily.
Lebanese pressure continued and the attacks against the Iraqi goal came from various sides. Louis Fernandez aimed a header to the left of the right post of goalkeeper Hashim Khamis (15) and Qahtan Jathir responded to this with another to Saqar's right (17).
Newton nearly tied it when he turned round and followed a corner kick ball but it hit the body of one of the defenders (44). As Iraqi errors increased in front of their goal, Jadir Morgenstern attempted to take advantage of one of these with a header into the goal's right-hand side (45).
The Iraqi team gathered itself and began its incursion into the Lebanese side, by its star Jaeer who passed the defenders from the left and hit a weak ball within Saqar's reach (63).
The Iraqis hit back with a counter attack that reached Jathir who broke through from the right and aimed, but Halawa converted it to a corner kick (88). Jaeer almost snatched victory in overtime when the ball reached him as a result of a joint defense mistake between Halawa and Jadeer on the left side and kicked powerfully but Saqar was ready for it.

Some informed sources suggested that al-Fahad should carry on  running the soccer structure based on the wishes of most club and federation members who believe distancing him from the leadership of this highly popular game would be a great loss to Kuwaiti soccer, which has witnessed tangible progress under his leadership: the national team qualified for the finals in the Olympic Games in Barcelona in 1992 and for the current Sydney Games, as well as winning the title of Gulf Cup Champion twice, in 96 and 1998.
Some consider that al-Yousif is the most entitled and most competent to become president of the federation, should al-Fahad decide to resign, since he has the clubs' confidence, especially since he has been a member of the federation for years. He started work as a member, then became treasurer when Sheikh Fahad al-Ahmed was appointed president of the federation, then vice-president in the 1992 elections after the tenth Gulf Cup in Qatar. He still retains his post through consensus of the 14 clubs in recognition of services to Kuwaiti soccer.
The federation has had seven presidents to date including al-Fahad who are Jassim al-Qatami, Eissa al-Hamed, Ahmed al-Sadoun, Sheikh Silman al-Hamoud, Abdulazziz al-Mukhlid, Sheikh Fahad al-Ahmed and Sheikh Ahmed al-Fahad (current president).

If he has forgotten, we will not forget that scene, God willing, as long as we live, and he must know that his lasting freedom that he drawls about has eradicated entire villages in Qandahar near Jalalabad in Afghanistan; entire villages were completely eradicated. The matter was not carried out in pursuit, but was intentional.
How would those who supported these criminals avoid Prophet Mohammad's (Peace Be Upon Him) words: "Earth's extinction is easier on God than the death of a believer without cause."
If the mothers of these people are keen about their children, they must ask them to leave the Arab Peninsula, because the ground beneath their feet will become a fire, God willing.
Finally, I address the American Secretary of State, who doubted our previous statement, and underestimated what we said about thousands of Muslim youth, who aspire to die, and that a storm of planes will not stop, God willing.
Glory be to God, His Prophet and the believers, but the disbelievers do not know.

Despite Russian President Vladimir Putin's expression of his readiness to withdraw Russian peacekeeping forces deployed in Abkhazia, with the condition that Tbilisi guarantees security in this separatist region in Georgia, hundreds of Georgian and Chechen fighters continued their attack Saturday in the direction of Sokhomi.  They were able to achieve a breakthrough in the area of the Kodor Mountain passes, approximately 15 kilometers from the capital of the separatist territories.
In response to Abkhaz officials who spoke of the possibility of asking for military help from Moscow, he confirmed that Russia would not be dragged into a conflict outside its national borders, because "to us, the Abkhazian-Georgian conflict constitutes a political problem for Georgia, and Russia does not intend to be dragged into it."
UN aid agencies were unanimously agreed upon the warning of the repercussions of war on Afghanistan and its neighboring countries. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson warned of a new tragedy "similar to that that occurred in Rwanda."

Robison explained that "more than seven million people are in danger" in Afghanistan, and renewed her call, which she made on Friday from Dublin, and which said that the United States must stop the raids on Afghanistan for a while to allow humanitarian aid to reach this country.
He confirmed the necessity of delivering "14 thousand tons of food within one month, and in extreme cases before the end of November" to the areas of Baghdashan Afghan and Pamir Valley.
Therefore it is necessary to go up to Kyrgyzstan in order to reach Ishqsham.
He noted that one of the sad ironies is that the food trucks are currently passing through Tajikistan to deliver the food shipments to the northern areas of neighboring Afghanistan and that "one million hungry people in Tajikistan follow the trucks with their eyes as they pass through their country without stopping."
It quoted an official in Khurasan Governorate, Mousa Yadi, as saying that Iran also sent 15 trucks loaded with approximately 1,020 blankets, food, water tanks, and insecticides to the Harat province.

A journalist working in the project confided:
As for Osama bin Laden, he did not back down from his talk against Zionism and Crusaders, until he got to a point, after the terrible September 11th, where he threatened America with grief and destruction, and that it must never dream of its security "before it is lived in reality by Arabs in Palestine."
The request was referred to the competent departments for study.

He called on industrialists to register all their workers in social security, and revealed that only 56,000 workers, out of 140,000, were registered in social security.
Minister Afram spoke about the basic accomplishments achieved by the Ministry of Industry with government, ministerial and administrative cooperation, especially the canceling of customs on raw materials and intermediary goods not locally produced, decreasing port fees and costs, decreasing fees for participation in social security, in addition to subsidized and direct loans related to starting an industrial modernization project, and working to discover modern industries.
3. Provide industrial land at low or nominal rates.
He considered that if the successive governments did not give the productive community any importance "It is now time, now that we are in the third millennium, for the government to consider its first responsibility the creation of areas of work for citizens, and we must adopt the issuance of monthly indications of unemployment rates, the number of new work opportunities, and the number of immigrants."
He explained that the line has been hanging over the networks for over 30 years "and its disconnection caused disorder on the Al Jeeh - Al Jamhour line."
It must be pointed out that last June, the line that links Tyre, Al Zahrani and Armoun was inaugurated.
International Monetary Fund Delegation Concludes Consultations ahead of Final Report Figures Reflect Government "Marketing" of Lebanon: Improved Reserves, Increased Deposits, Conversion to Lira
There is no doubt that the American events were a turning point with regard to the Lebanese situation, even if its effects did not result in a change in the structural problems that the Lebanese economy suffers from, namely the general debt and deficit, but it opened gateways for alternative solutions.
- First: Currency market relaxation and the easing of pressure on the Bank of Lebanon, which allowed it to enhance its foreign currency reserves again more by entering the market as a buyer, not seller, of dollars.
- Third: The return of banks to subscription to long-term treasury bonds, amounting to a volume of two thousand billion Liras.
Despite the importance of these indications, banking sources are still reserved with regard to them on the basis that any positive aspects must be built on structural not circumstantial solutions.
Intermediaries that met the delegation said that the Fund, which believes that Lebanon has overcome important dues, is still reserved awaiting the crystallization of procedures that the government promised as part of its framework to deal with the financial, banking and economic situations.
2. The Fund's satisfaction with the draft budget for 2002, and its contents of commitment to its advice with regard to reducing spending and enhancing revenues. But the stand of the Fund remains subject to the government's ability to implement, especially when what has been achieved as of the middle of July (the date of the publishing of the delegation report on July 11, 2001) until today does not agree with the security program in place (especially in the field of privatization).
We also saw true cooperation aimed at avoiding world economic depression.
After repairing the urgent breakdown at the Al Jamhour Station last Saturday, feeding resumed to the program that had started implementation early last week, at the rate of 21 hours out of 24 hours daily in most Lebanese areas.
He declared that the Ministry is currently working on three priorities, which are the reduction of interests on loan, providing operational capitol for industrialists, revising the prices of energy and oil derivatives, and providing industrial land at nominal cost.
Elie Kahwaji wrote: The obsessions connected to the mystery surrounding the international situation prevailed in the currency market in Beirut last week with the start of the Anglo-American military strikes in response to the terrorist attacks that targeted the United States last September 11th, which have been so far limited to the sites belonging to the "Taliban" movement and Osama bin Laden's group in Afghanistan, with the possibility of geographically expanding the area of military operations to include other countries in the Middle East suspected of harboring terrorist groups whose members are being tracked.
Union leader of the "Ojero Association" Tony Hanna said that approving article 50 came in contradiction with the assurances representatives of the Association had received as a result of their contacts with parliamentarians, and wrongs the right of the employees to continue work, dismissal compensation, ambiguity of date of privatization of sector and insuring the necessary guarantees for those transferred into the sector.
The committees of air, marine and land transport and the tourism committee at the International Chamber of Commerce called on the government to start communications with insurance companies, to reduce the additional fees of the dangers of war imposed after the events of September 11th, "as Lebanon does not fall within the area of war activities, and the incoming or outgoing ships and planes do not pass through the war zones."
While it was expected that the Syrian response to Lebanon's request to extend the acceptance of Lebanese insurance companies' insurance contracts when Lebanese cars enter Syrian territories, it became known that President of the Insurance Companies Association Abraham Matosian was informed last Saturday evening by President of the Board of Directors of the General Syrian Association for Insurance Suleiman Al Hassan (appointed approximately two months ago instead of Ghassan Baroodi, and whose name was accidentally omitted day before yesterday, Saturday) of Damascus's agreement to the additional three month extension, until 31/12/2001.
It was confirmed that, as of 1/12/2001, it would start inspecting these institutions to check the required implementation, with the possibility of taking the appropriate legal measures.
President Bush reiterated his support for the creation of a Palestinian State, and stressed the need for implementing Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 in order to reach a comprehensive, just and final solution for the Palestinian cause.
He reiterated, in answer to a question, that "this state has Jerusalem as its capital as it is today, with no need to divide it or make it one city and two capitals. Instead of dividing Jerusalem, Jerusalem can be made bigger and its area expanded, while the specific proposals can be discussed in time."
That is why Europe did, in reality, become without borders after it moved from politics to economy.
In reality, there is no longer what is called the national economy, it is national poverty, and he does not understand why some insist on controlling the economy if it is a poor economy.
And when?
It is obvious that it is Eastern Jerusalem, the West Bank, Gaza, the Golan Height and Sinai.
Some information indicates that the United States is exercising pressure on Sharon's government to accept the creation of a Palestinian state with Eastern Jerusalem as its capitol, and find acceptable solutions for the other issues in return for Arafat's declaration of a waiver of the rights of return for Palestinian refugees into the Green Line. It also indicated that Norway, the European countries, the United States and Canada pledge and guarantee to offer compensation to the Palestinians affected by the right to return, and that calls are under way with Arab countries to discuss hosting a number of Palestinian refugees.
The demonstration in the Arab East only acquires legitimacy when it is allowed by ruling regimes, and Arab streets rarely witness demonstrations except in the cases of displaying collective hostility against Israel and the United States, no one else.
This silence reflects indications of repression as much as it carries reflections of rationalism, and it is in both cases an omen of a tear that could lead, as long as the war on terrorism goes on, to a split in the streets and internal conflicts.
If these regimes allowed their streets the minimum level of democracy, then the streets would not be afraid to express, even if their expression was extremist. But, these regimes worked for about 50 years to repress this expression and loaded it with radical thoughts and a unilateral rigid faith with no place for anything except hostility towards Israel and America.
For in the capitals of the Western alliance striking Afghanistan, vast demonstrations against the war are taking place, in as much as they reject terrorism.
The spokesman for the State Department Richard Boucher declared that "we have no plans for a new initiative."
The competent diplomatic sources feel it is likely that these climates will comfort the US Administration, despite their denial of them officially, as they reflect the seriousness of the US commitment to the US President's declaration of his support of a Palestinian state, and the need for Arab peoples and regimes to take this commitment seriously, while remaining at a distance from them for the time being, awaiting an appropriate time for the US moving definitively in this direction.
But is there really an American initiative?
- "The United States is truly serious in taking measures to put an end to the violence between Arabs and Israel.
- The report of Senator George Mitchell remains the preferred mechanism for the United States to push things forward, but the report is not a document that can implement itself by itself.
This was the aspect confirmed by the US State Department spokesman, who wondered "why do people look to the United States for peace proposals?" the door closes to exaggeration in talks of an American initiative and its details. That is to say that Washington's position has not changed regarding the mechanism that must be implemented first in the occupied territories, and the need for succeeding with this mechanism before moving on to the other stages, namely the return to negotiations, as the Mitchell report states.
Remnants of Pictures II, III, and IV
The picture has not changed completely, that is true, and perhaps those pictures that recorded the crashing of the two hijacked places into the Twin Towers, and then the collapse of the buildings one after the other, will remain in our minds for a long time.
The biggest mistake was in believing that the picture is necessary for social interaction with a political event.
The moral might be useful to the publishers of some Arab newspapers who forgot the trade rule that advises avoiding pictures of atrocities, not just out of respect for the reader but also for the pictured victim.
The Organization "Correspondents without Frontiers" dedicated an extensive report on this phenomena and to the direct and indirect methods of monitoring used in this directive. It seemed to them, as it seemed before that in many of the published investigations in European newspapers, that the reason behind the absence of pictures of victims goes to more than just respecting the famous ethical trade rule.
In the new war, commenting is on the civilization of pictures.
More correctly, we should say heard.
Even the television screen in turn changed; it became closer to a computer, but without the possibility of give and take.
"Al Jazeera" is not better off, despite the presence of its two teams in Afghanistan.
The West that is in love with Arab exceptions wants "Al Jazeera" as an exception.

"Al Jazeera" camera is the most active with regard to rare pictures taken from the battleground, which Al-Jazeera has been without parallel in presenting on the screen, under a title that is special to Al Jazeera, in addition to the distinguished effort of its correspondent in Kabul, Tayseer Allouni, who appeared a star with no competition, taking advantage of his strong ties with Taliban men, which contributed a great deal to the success of the media coverage that was supported by several interviews with senior leaders of the ruling movement in Afghanistan. "Al Jazeera" transformed into a forum from which they can address the Arab and Islamic worlds, gaining the sympathy of the Islamic street that has started to boil. That led the US government, through its ambassador in Qatar, to ask the station's administration more than once to diminish its campaign and its tone, which it considered directed against it and an instigating factor to ignite emotions.
Will Al Jazeera succeed in its satellite battle, or will its fate be subject to what happens in Afghanistan? Will it have the same fate as the Monte Carlo radio station, which became famous during the second Gulf war, and was the first victim of the US victory over Iraq?
As for the reason that led the French to go to such places, it was their escape from the latest events, such as political scandals, economic corruption, and social anxiety following the Sedan defeat, which reflected negatively on the workers and officials.

She moved from one front to another accompanied by Maurice Chevalier and managed the musical shows before the appearance of Catherine Baker, who dethroned her.
Hollywood shows us an American president who is a supernatural man, as skillful in beating eggs as in resisting the Soviets and doing sleight-of-hand works at the same time.
Kevin Costner plays the leading role.
But we see him in another movie trapped in a chalet because of a snowstorm, giving orders through the phone to prevent a third world war.
As for the movie "Nixon", also by Oliver Stone, it presents the personality of a president obsessed with authority, a liar, sadist and masochist.
We also see Jack Nicholson in the movie "Mars Invades" as a strained president, obese, good-hearted, and fond of men from Mars.
As for the second series "This is My President Bush", it describes the behavior of President Bush as the village idiot, who drinks beer with his friends. Timothy Potover plays this part.

Palestinian President Yasser Arafat intends to take the opportunity of the beginnings of an improved relationship with the United States to score points on the diplomatic level with British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Monday in London, which is considered a main ally for Washington, especially confirming the refusal of the Palestinian authority to negotiate the borders of the Palestinian state and warning of the dangers of the Israeli policies after the renewal of assassination operations by the Israeli army.
The fear of this infectuous disease spread to many countries allied with the United States allied countries, chiefly Britain, France, Italy and Israel.
Resumption of American Air Strikes and "Al Qaeda" Warns the United States and Britain that Bush is Planning for a Government to Succeed "Taliban" Amid Indications of a Split Inside the Movement Raids Bush
He confirmed that the first phase of the raids were successful.
At least one bomb exploded at 17:00 Greenwich time, half an hour after electricity was cut off from the capitol, which usually precedes raids.
It said it was likely that the missiles hit residential areas in the eastern half of Kandahar, and that at least 2 people were killed and 4 others injured in the New Al Qishleh, and the city was drowned in darkness. It added that the American planes bombed targets close to the front line between "Taliban" forces and the opposition forces, and Kheirkhana province north of Kabul.
For the first time since the start of the raids, officials from the "Taliban" accompanied journalists to Qadam village near Jalalabad east of Afghanistan which was destroyed in the American raids Thursday-Friday night, and where 160 of its people were killed, according to officials of the movement.
The United Arab Emirates was one of three countries that recognized the "Taliban", but had severed diplomatic ties with it after it refused to hand over bin Laden to Washington. Pakistan is now the only country that recognizes "Taliban" after Saudi Arabia also severed its ties with it.
"We know he is guilty" of the September 11th attacks.
He was asked did Bush participate in such meetings that were first revealed yesterday by the New York Times, and he answered: "yes (...) I know about them."
It reported a senior official as saying that Bush wants to avoid repeating the presence of a government that is a haven for "terrorism", which is the accusation he is directing at "Taliban."
Calls on Musharaf to take the opportunity to crush the power of fundamentalists are also increasing.
The Pakistani-Afghani Defense Council, which includes 35 fundamentalist Islamic groups and political parties, including the Islamic Scholars Association, the Islamic Group, the Army of the Sahaba, and others, had threatened Saturday evening to break into the Shahbaz Airbase.
The authorities preceded that with arrests of all religious parties' local leaders Saturday evening.
Police arrested approximately 400 protestors.
It is not expected that the intensive procedures undertaken by Musharaf will be successful in calming the situation.
There is no doubt that Musharaf will seize the opportunity of Powell's visit to reconfirm his demand that the American war is "short", and that moves towards preparing for the future of Afghanistan after the "Taliban" are quick.
He confirmed that the former King Zaher Shah will be accepted by Pakistan, and that his country will support the presence of UN peacekeeping forces in Kabul.
Musharaf does not only need economic aid, but also quick success of the difficult military operation undertaken by the US and Britain.
He is Abbas bin Fouad Abbas Hamiyyeh bin Hamdan Hamiyyeh Hamiyyeh.
He was nice to the farthest extent, forgiving, humble, and optimistic. He never failed to rescue a person in need, extend a helping hand when someone needed it, or general service he was appointed.
On my last visit to him a month ago, I hesitated to open a subject with him which he had promised me. I said to myself: He will remember me on another visit, and he will give me the historical documents any man like myself would like to have.
A wave of happiness inundated us immediately upon hearing the news item of the appreciation by the French and Canadian governments of Professor Falah Maroun, as France bestowed upon him the French National Order of Merit and the Canadian government the Canadian National Order of Merit with a rank of Knight.

Maronite Patriarch Yousef Altienne officiated at the Lady of the Mount Church in Deir Al-Qamar at an oath swearing ceremony during a holy mass, as a result of the conciliation between Prince Basheer Al-Shihabi and Jiryes Baz, the young Lebanese leader. The basis of the conciliation is the two leaders respect of the new agreement between them, under the patronage of the Patriarch, forget the past and abandon rancor.
One of the Sheikhs of the Al-Atallah in Eir Dara was aware of the conspiracy. So he wrote a word to Sheikh Jiryes Baz, in which he warned him of the Prince's treachery.
When they entered, the Prince closed the door on them and stood himself guarding it and wielding his sword.
So an atmosphere of anxious silence prevailed at the entire Deir Al-Qamar.
This abominable treacherypained Patriarch, Yousef Altienne, had himself attended the oath swearing at the Lady of the Mount. So, he decided to sever every relation with the Prince.
From Tony Frenjieh to Danny Chamoun, the Maronite leaders were absent.
Until this collided with that and the basic structure of the regime cracked and the temple collapsed on whomever was inside it.
* A solution to the question of Doctor Sameer Ja'ja' cannot be found in isolation of interference by the President of the Republic, who alone has the ability to adopt a special amnesty, in the way of which stand three obstacles. The first is the absence of any initiative by the adversaries of Ja'ja' to drop their personal charges against him, even in form, after the issuance of legal verdicts against him. This will make it easy for the President of the Republic to take a position regarding the special amnesty. Mr. Dory Chamoun's call for forgiveness would not be enough at the time when the National Liberal Party had acted at the same time as personal prosecutor against Ja'ja', in addition to Mrs. Tracy Chamoun and the Abdul Noor Family.
* As for the third obstacles, it comes from Mr. Michel Al-Murr, who survived an attempt to assassinate him, but has not licked his wounds yet because nobody has helped him to recover from them.
Paris ? "An-Nahar": Colleague Pierre Atallah autographed his new book "French- Lebanese Friendship", published by the "Beirut Sur Seine" and the "Coalition of French-Lebanese Professionals".
The new 2002 edition of the international encyclopedia "Guinness" (288 pages, large format) was published. In its chapter on "Books and Magazines", on page 154, it carries an article about the Lebanese youth, Randy Ghazi Nahleh as the "youngest writer of serialized novels in the world."

"Racism Between Durban and Beirut" is a seminar organized by the "Insan" Foundation, in cooperation with Amnesty International ? the Lebanese Groups, at the United Brothers School, during which Bishop Gregoire Haddad, Sheikh Muhammad Al-Hajj and Colleague Adnan Mousa spoke.
The seminar was narrated by Muhammad Al-Dhanawi and introduced by Mousa with an intervention that focused on the "United Nations third World Anti-Racism Conference," held in Durban (South Africa) recently.

He suggested a number of solutions to get rid of racism, such being adorned with the great virtues, such as belief in God and in man's ability to develop and love.
The "Insan" Foundation identified the objective of the exhibition as "looking into the pictures in a critical investigative way in order to learn a lesson. We should not be satisfied with what the pictures reveal unto us in terms of facts and information, because what they hide is truer and more realistic."

So, greetings to those colleagues and greetings to the club that has gathered them and gathers us tonight. My hope is that this club will play a larger role, especially during the upcoming stage, as it prepares to open a vital center, which will become the meeting place for Lebanese and non-Lebanese journalists and politicians. Thus, an essential forum will be added to our forums, through which a large number of intellectuals and politicians will appear to enrich Lebanese political life with their opinions."
Therefore, our position, especially in Lebanon and along our side Syria and the region generally, advanced and I believe that everyone now has gone back to thinking about it and to be committed to its basic elements.
He noted that "the situation has started to take dangerous and different directions and that everything goes back to what we have previously warned against before the beginning of the operations.
And what are the stations that we will pass by or live through in the context of this open confrontation against terrorism?
We should not be influenced by that and when we talk about Lebanon, we talk from a unique position.
Sidon ? "An-Nahar":
Of our efforts. The cry that His Highness has launched emphasizes commitment to the Nation's causes.
Minister Ghazi Al-Areedhi delivered a speech in which he denounced what happened in Washington and New York and stressed the importance of Arab solidarity.
The Deputy Head of the "Amal" Movement, Ayyoub Hmayyed, considered that "the Israeli threat constitutes a danger, not only at the local level, but also at the international and global levels, because this arrogant state does not hold any weight for international and legitimate resolutions and is an oddity at the global level."
He was followed by Qabalan, who said: "There is an opening of old time-worn files.
Bizzi said during a eulogy celebration at Harees Town on behalf of the Movement: "The problem with the west is that it adopts a policy of double standards," and wondered "Why has America not put the Zionist Movement, which we consider to be terrorism personified, on the list of terrorism and why has it not sought to issue a resolution by the Security Council that binds Israel to implementing international resolutions?"
He added: "This new project relies on three headings, which have constituted and still constitute the basic principles of the party and which summarize its struggles, namely: independence, freedom and justice.
Berri: Terrorism of Individuals Is the Product of Terrorism of the State and Solving the Palestinian Cause Needs Deeds
Berri received yesterday press correspondents in the Nabatiyyeh region and touched on the subject of what is being said about the intention of the United States to solve the Palestinian cause.
He said: "Israel has not implemented any international resolution since its establishment, even Resolution Number 425 was implemented partially as a result of the will of the resistance.
It is a religion that starts with peace and ends with peace. It is also a religion of peace between man and his Lord and between man and his surroundings in the absolute. It is a mercy to the worlds and not any other thing at all."
Thank God, most of the Arab policies revolve in the American orbit."
Berri had received the chairman of the "Nasserite Popular Organization", deputy Mustafa Sa'ad and his brother Osama.
He was afraid that "the authority, by doing so, is repaying pre-issued invoices for the Americans at the expense of the citizens and their interests."
The Legal Opinion Office commemorated the anniversary of the Isra' and the Mi'raj with a celebration attended by Minister Asaad Diab, representing the President of the Republic; Deputy Adnan Arakji, representing the Speaker of the House of Deputies; Minister Fouad Siniora, representing the Prime Minister; Prime Ministers Saleem Al Hoss and Rashid Al Sulh; deputies Walid Eido, Bassem Yamout, Mohammad Qabbani, Nasser Qandeel, Mohammad Birjawi and Qassem Hashem; the Mufti of the Republic, Sheikh Mohammad Rashid Qabbani; the Deputy Chairman of the Higher Shiite Islamic Council, Sheikh Abdul Amir Qablan; the Deputy to the Sheikh Al-Aqel of the Druze Sect, Sheikh Bahjat Gheith; Bishop Khalil Abi Nader, representing the Maronite Patriarch Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Butros Sfeir; spiritual and military figures and a number of ambassadors.
All that is in plain view of the entire world and with international blessing and limitless support from the American Administration.
We refuse to accept American fate and destiny, we refuse to be led as the unjust policies desire, and Arab and Muslim leaders must be on the level of these dangerous expositions and they must adopt positions and measures in the manner that preserves rights and regains honor and dignity."
We will not accept that innocent Muslim people are being slaughtered at the hand of the United States in Afghanistan and in plain view of the world on the pretext of eliminating terrorism.
And what values are these that the civilized world preaches us?
The Muslim and Christian Lebanese have all agreed unanimously to adopt civilized dialogue and religious coexistence as a model for confronting the challenges the world has entered.
"We must extract the means to address the Western mind with the language it understands to explain our rights, history and Islamic and Arab values, for this is the world that we deal with on a daily basis and that must not be left prey to Zionist media while we remain its victims."
But the Muslims are not negligent and their Islamic law is justice, humanitarianism, tolerance, brotherhood and reciprocal treatment."
Qalawiyyeh Tower - by Ismail Sabrawi:
The last was Colonel Timo Eikdal, who served from June 4, 2000 until the present day.
It was possible to count more than 10 thousand soldiers who did their duty in keeping the peace.
That is why we constructed this monument inside the center.
He asked Mrs. Pascalaynen to unveil the monument.
It is also nice that the danger has passed.
The answer, as His Eminence, Mr. Ali Al Amin, told me: "As long as you respect my right, then you are my brother, whether you believe in God or in stone."
Memorial gifts were then distributed. The first was for Mrs. Pascalaynen, the second for Brigadier Yahya, the third for Colonel Raad and the fourth for Father Abu Haidar.
Discarded War As Unlikely to Include Arab Countries Dalloul: What Is Said About American Lists Is Aimed at Pressuring Officials and Diverting Their Attention
It is unfortunate that American officials act in a way that derides people's minds and intelligence."
He expected that the American war on Afghanistan would be long, but he discarded as unlikely that it will expand to include other Arab countries.
We saw what happened to the spiteful policy from the year 1998 to the year 2000.
At the beginning of his address, the Deputy President of the Francophone Pharmacists Syndicate, Ziyad Mansour, wondered about the future of Francophonia and stressed that "Francophones are capable of preserving Francophonia and enhancing it through perseverance and cultural dialogue, and it remains the only guarantee for cultural identity and for not falling victim to the ferocious monster represented by the market economy."
She urged young pharmacists to participate in this rally.
The "Expanded Secular Meeting" decreed "the necessity of supporting the Afghani people and the inadmissibility of allowing America to infringe upon it."
The participants issued a statement at the end of the meeting that said:
It must be clear to everyone that we do not have a problem with the American people, and that we regret the killing of innocent members of it. We call upon it to stop its rulers from going to extremes in wronging people, robbing their wealth, and supporting the usurping entity, for that is the real reason behind the vulnerable peoples' hatred of America.
The participating scholars demand the rulers of Islamic States not to respond to American pressures and to refrain from joining it in its unjust war. In this regard, the scholars praise the wonderful positions of Syria and the Islamic Republic in Iran, which have not offered any facilities for America, as well as all those countries that took similar positions. In this regard, the scholars consider that the closing statement of the Organization of the Islamic Conference was below the level of the circumstances and below the expectations of the nation.
Hariri had received on Saturday the delegation that participated in the Ninth Lebanese Pharmacists Conference and the International Day of Francophone Pharmacists that was held in Beirut under the chairmanship of the President of the Lebanese Pharmacists Syndicate, Dr. Ghassan Al-Amin and President of the Arab Pharmacists Union.
Yesterday, Berri received press reporters in the Nabatiyyah region and spoke about what is being mooted about the intention of the United States to solve the Palestinian issue.
Al Mukhtara - "Al Nahar":
Yesterday, the town of Abbadiyyeh - district of Ba'abda witnessed a step towards dedicating the return, represented in two occasions: the first was the pastoral visit by the Pastor of the Beirut Maronite Parish, Bishop Boulos Matar, which was called for by the Waqf committees in the town, and his officiating at the First Mass at the Saint John the Baptist Church.

Qalawiyyeh Tower - from Ismail Sabrawi:
Yesterday afternoon, Israeli military aircraft violated the airspaces of the districts of Bint Jbeil, Marjeyoon, Hasbayya, and Western Beqaa all the way to Sidon.
* Former Deputy Rasheed Al Khazin postponed his press conference, which was scheduled for today at his home at the Qlei'at until a later date "for health reasons."
More American Pressure to Revive the Settlement Has the Countdown for Sharon's Government Started?
He added that his party supports pushing the course of the peace process with the Palestinians, but in case Sharon continues to hinder that, then the days of the government coalition will be numbered.
He added: "In the war against fundamentalist Islam, Bush uses the old style of "divide and rule ", and is trying to introduce many elements into his forces, generally from most Islamic countries and especially from Arab countries.
And it seems he believes that the weaker element in this conflict is specifically the Palestinians."
He added: "In these days, we are faced with big changes after September 11th.
Attending the celebration were Deputy Nabil El Bustani, and the representative of the Chairman of the Progressive Socialist Party, Nasser Zeidan, who is also the Deputy for the Party's Interior Department at El-Chouf, as well as a number of dignitaries and community members.
In a noted absence of the political attitudes of the "Free National Current" and the abstention of General Michel Awn's from issuing his weekly political statements, the "Current" celebrated the anniversary of October 13,1990 with a mass at The Lady Church in Sin El Feil last Saturday at seven in the evening.
At the conclusion, Poet Morris Awwad delivered a speech inspired by the occasion and then the candles were lit.
The Syrian Nationalist Socialist Party, headed by Antoine Abi Haidar, saw that the "Zionist intrigues" are what instigated the Americans after the events of September 11th "in an attempt to portray the Muslims as a backward civilization."
Mubarak Receives Arab Journalists Union Karam: Arabs Are Not Terrorists
Karam said: "In the face of the immensely dangerous crises, you find us in a state of hesitation, which must pass away and we must pass through it to the oasis of stability.
Why?
Against the land, against humans, against the unarmed, whose chests are bare except for faith in a land and in a human being, in a citizen and a homeland, in a city-dweller and a city?
And does America understand - and we must direct ourselves to her, especially today, to tell her frankly that unilateralism dictates on its owner and practitioner a big responsibility - Does America understand that it will not be truly unilateral unless it is truly just and unless it has a unilateral vision that lifts unilateralism out of the neighborhood of the I?
Not to think that might alone, especially military might, is the way.
The Permanent Bureau of the Union convened a meeting, during which two papers prepared by Karam were read, on ways for invigorating the International Organization of Journalists and the circumstances of emigrant Arab journalists and the attempt to embrace them so that they become more effective in professional giving in cooperation with the Federation.
Karam called for the inevitability of the Federation's role in lifting the suffering of the Arab information effort, including distortion and misleading undertaken by international Zionism.
Minister of State for Administrative Development Fouad Al Sa'ad expressed his view that "public administration in Lebanon suffered from an indigestion in legislation and regulations and that it was time to deal seriously and objectively with the issue and to exert pressure on the political administration to expedite passage through legislative channels.
The second issue has to do with the ethics of the public job, accountability and monitoring systems in public administration.
De Mistura's Appeals for Halting Air Violations Will Not Prevent Israel from Continuing Them
They said that De Mistura's efforts did not stop, because he considers the repetition of the violation not only a violation of the "Blue Line", but also constitutes provocation.
They believed that De Mistura's calls are necessary, but will not be met with any Israeli response, and that the number of air violations will not deter the Israeli leadership from sending fighters on reconnaissance missions of "Hizbullah's" movements.
The last scenario it made up was considering that listing Imad Mughniyyeh on the list of the 22 terrorists published by the FBI last week will prompt "Hizbullah" to try initiating an all-out war against it, because the operations executed by Mughniyyeh in the eighties were done with the support of the party and Iran.
The Antonian Order of Monks, the families of Fathers Albert Shurfan and Suleiman Abi Khalil, and their friends commemorated the 11th anniversary of their disappearance from their Mar Yohanna convent - Al Qal'ah - Beit Meri after the 14th of October 1990. The Supreme Head of the order, Father Sam'an Atallah, assisted by the organizing fathers, priests and monks, conducted a celebratory mass at Deir Mar Antonios - Ba'abda. It was serviced by the "Father Albert Shurfan Choir", managed by Father Emanuel Nakhleh, and in which a number of municipality heads, a group of families and friends participated.
In the name of these values and in the names of our unjustly-absent brothers, we come to declare our continued resistance with means that indicate our resolutions and civilization, not with violence and terrorism, but with the violence of love and commitment to the civilization of right, because right alone can free and give life."
We ask them to give everyone his right, or else they should allow us to tell them: It is not like this that justice is respected and that the dignity of people is maintained, and that the right is preserved (...).
He concluded: "We promise them and all those oppressed like them, that we will, as long as we live, demand the respect of human rights, every human, and work towards solidarity with every subjugated, wretched, poor, and oppressed person, and with everyone whose rights have been taken away from him, on all levels, and in all fields. We will remain serious, hardworking seekers of every right that has been lost and taken away. When we find it we will invite our friends, family and neighbors, to be happy together and rejoice.
At the Deir Doreit (Al Shouf) a family-political meeting was held at the invitation of former president of the Lebanese Mariamite Order of Nuns, Father Sa'ad Nimer. It was considered an additional station and a practical interpretation of the "Mukhtara Meeting" two months ago that brought together Maronite Patriarch Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Butros Sfeir and President of the Progressive Nationalist Party, Deputy Walid Junblat, in which the closure of the chapter of the "Mountain War" was declared.
"The aim of the invitation today, to Leader Walid Bek Junblat with members of the Struggle Front, the Bank of Lebanon Governor, the President of the Displaced Fund, the sheikhs, headed by Sheikh Ali Zein Eddine, and all our friends, is to confirm that the one family in the mountain has not lost the nobility it was built on among all the sects, especially among the Druze, Christians and our Muslim brothers in general."
But the internal ties stayed, and this invitation today after the Patriarch's visit is a witness to the love that binds us always and that no one can remove, not from the hearts, and not from the families. We saw those relations with the sheikhs and Walid Bek and between the Christians in this mountain. The visit is not a political visit; it is a family visit.
He did not find it strange that the first ministerial reshuffle would include him.
He added: "As a minister of state, if you ask me what my responsibility is I don't know.
We received the following explanation from the Army Command - Guidance directorate:
As for the rest of the requirements, they are procured from local markets through public tenders and in accordance with regulations and based on the public accounting law."
Dahrouj started the meeting by saying that "what is going on in the world is a result of the extremely dangerous events, and their repercussions will be varied and long." He added "the horrific tragedy witnessed by the world on September 11th, shocked not only the American people, but the peoples of the world and all the States. All powers keen on peace condemned these events." He wished that "this shock would be an opportunity for the American Administration to correct its policies, because the bigger shock is represented in what is going on in Afghanistan."
He was of the opinion that "reassurances, which indicate that this campaign would not affect some countries are false and not true" and confirmed "the military operations will reach these countries in various forms." He called on "our people and the Arab brothers to stand in the face of the unjust war that the Afghani people, who have suffered terrorism more than any other country, are being subjected to."
And we have no trust in their promises and statements."
They were accompanied on the tour by the Director General of the Ministry of Works Fadi Al-Nammar.
The delegation visited Andaqat, where Minister Miqati inspected the rehabilitation of the Qibbayat-Andaqat road, a distance of 3 kilometers, where work will last approximately two months.
They headed afterwards to Bibneen, Jibrayel, Tekrit, and old Akkar.
As for the matter of emergency works, he said: "It is natural that the Ministry of Works checks the danger in the cracked wall in Abda and rehabilitates it within the required time. We will give an order to start that as soon as the necessary administrative work is completed.
And in answer to a question, he said that "having just been to the underprivileged areas is part of the policy of the government and that was included in the ministerial address, and maybe Minister Fuad Siniora spoke of lowering the numbers in the budget in all the ministries by an average of ten per cent.
On the American Ambassador's statements about Lebanon's cooperation in a positive manner, he explained "Lebanon deals with all accredited embassies and all countries without distinction, especially with regard to extraditing individuals or pursuing others within the concept of sovereignty."
He reminded of the continuing work in the Mahallet Al Khunnaq, on the second bridge in Tripoli, and announced a solution to the Turk Building problem, through supporting it at the expense of the Higher Commission for Aid.
It is natural that the prime suspect of this attack stands behind these failed attempts, along with a gang of distributors in the various parts of the world, groups and individuals, funded by an enormous wealth placed at the service of the goals of the movement and its protectors, of the likes of the Taliban and those moving in its orbit.
And we seize this opportunity to confirm our desire for the necessity of pursuing the Christian elements as well, whose involvement in terrorism is proved, on equal footing with the rest of the criminals.
The second is giving the issue of prosecuting those accused of the New York crime extreme care to avoid more innocent victims, whatever group they belong to.
This Hadith is enough to restrain religion traders from their transgression, as they pass through it like arrows from the bow, with the necessity of openness to others and cooperating with them to pounce on the locations of crime and terrorism wherever they are, in order to prepare for living in peace with all the peoples that believe in friendship and love as a way to salvation.
But what happened in the Falange in the direction of finding a unified formula enhanced with absolute speed and discipline to achieve election dues, was not paralleled with finishing the arrangements for regaining the "Forces" license, which contributed to indications of a possible slowdown in giving the license to those who demanded it.
A new element was added to what was referred to earlier on the belonging of Falangist George Kassab to the new administrative board of the "Forces", which is the participation of a member of this commission, George Alam, as a voter in the elections of the Falange.
But, is the State thinking of granting a general amnesty that will benefit all those, and before them Ja'ja'?
Hubaiqa, who continued after the Intifada of 1985 to issue his statements entitled "Lebanese Forces - Executive Board" until he established the "Wa'ad" party, confirms that he supports Malek in regaining the license, but he points to a Forces group that has existed since 1975 and matured intellectually and politically since that time, and has a role and a right in the "Forces".
From here, it seems that the two sides are in a race against time to win the right of owning the "Forces" card, despite the fact that Hubaiqa has not said he wants to be the leader of these "Forces".
President of the Republic Emile Lahoud received, at five in the afternoon, yesterday, at Baabda Palace, the Prime Minister, Rafiq Al-Hariri, and reviewed with him the general situation in the light of recent developments regionally and internationally.
Ministerial and parliamentary circles had informed "An-Nahar" that they ruled out reaching an understanding shortly between the pillars of governance on the subject of administrative appointments, which was raised anew following the acceptance by the Constitutional Council of the parliamentary appeal against the law, which adopted a new mechanism for appointments, thus necessitating a return to the old mechanism and what usually accompanies it in terms of implicit agreement on sectarian distribution and administrative "shares".
As to the subject of the other administrative appointments in the first and second categories, discussion is still focusing on making the administrative appointments all at one time, even if it takes more than one Council of Ministers session to study each file separately and acquaint the ministers with it, or to make these appointments in different batches, so as to free each batch on which agreement has been reached. But, this understanding will not be achieved unless it falls below the ceiling of the set principles and criteria, because the coming stage presupposes, in view of the internal and external conditions, the establishment of a competent administration that can cope with the steps of this stage.

The additional grace period granted Wednesday by President of the Conference Qatari Minister of Economy, Finance and Trade Yousef Kamal to the presidents of the six main work groups contributed to overcoming the obstacles that were still present especially in the portfolios of agriculture, environment and textiles, after doubts had risen yesterday afternoon regarding the success chances of the conference, with India expressing its resentment towards some aspects of the closing statements, which prompted European Union negotiators to offer it to refrain from joining the clauses it supports.
As for the matter of the agricultural portfolio, about which contentions have continued for a long time, until they were exhausted and became limited to the translation of one word, the European Union finally obtained what it wanted by avoiding a commitment to completely cancel subsidies allocated for exports, and sufficing with gradual decrease (Phasing Out).
The Europeans also obtained what they wanted regarding the agreement to launch negotiations in the matter of the relationship between trade and environmental standards immediately, with reservation on prejudging the results of these negotiations.
Japan and South Korea finally obtained what they wanted with the United States finally accepting to list measures of fighting flooding in the negotiations related to systems, provided that the negotiations take place in two phases.
American Trade Representative Robert Zulick said: "Today the members of the World Trade Organization sent a strong message to the world.

The resolution permits the President to give instructions to the Secretary of Defense to establish a special military court where alleged terrorists appear, and targets "every non- American" that belongs to the "Al Qaeda" Network or was a member in it and every person that contributed to or sought to contribute to terrorist activities or helped terrorists.
A senior official at the American Administration said that "it may be very difficult to try an important terrorist like Osama bin Laden at an ordinary court in the United States and provide the safety of the concerned in this trial", besides that "it is easy for military courts to protect information sources in the investigations as some of the documents could be very sensitive."

American dollar offers resurfaced in the currency market in Beirut in demand for the lira with the aim of underwriting in the treasury bonds amid airs of comfort towards the direction the developments on the international level are taking.
Moreover, the issuance of retail sales figures in the United States that showed an increase of 7.1% last month, the highest since 1992 compared with a decline of 2.2% in September, exceeding expectations which likened their increase of no more than 2%, had a positive effect on the dollar as much as this development will reflect in terms of the expected revival in economic activity.
On the other hand, it became evident that the unemployment rate in Britain rose last month to 3.2% of the total working population compared with 3.1% in September after approximately 4,300 people lost their jobs, in a development that disappointed investors especially after the "Bank of England" declared that economic growth in its country will slow down next year before it improves as of the year 2003.

The Nikkei index closed high at 56.20 points over 10,086.76 points.
A celebration for the occasion was held on board the ship "Yakamon River" anchored at Beirut Harbor - Dock 8, and was attended by American Ambassador Vincent Patel, Director General of the Grains and Sugar Beetroot Office Antoine Khoury, representing Minister of Economy and Trade Basil Fleihan, Director of the American Agency for Development John Preisler, Director of Grain Silo at the Harbor Jean Tuma, in addition to representatives from the "Mercy Corps" Institution.
He declared that the program "is offering help to the office of the Ministry of Administrative Development to establish a national geographic information system that allows experts to utilize a unified map of the geographic sites in their projects", reiterating that "the national geographic information system will be placed at the disposal of the Geographic Affairs Directorate at the Lebanese Army."
The Industrialists Association was puzzled in a statement yesterday by "the United Nation's rejection of a number of Lebanese trade contracts signed with Iraq during the latest visit by the Lebanese delegation headed by Ministry of Industry George Afram to the Baghdad International Exhibition, on the pretext of the double use of many Lebanese products, at a time when it is approving the same goods for other countries."
The Tripoli Traders Association elected for its office board Maamoun Adrah as president to succeed former association president Jamal Kirhani whose term lasted 50 years.
The delegation included Pakistani irrigation expert Akhtar Ali and Director of the "EKARDA" Research Station in Tirbil - Lebanon Munir Zughayyar, with President of the Agricultural Consultation Department in the south Dina Mansour and President of the Water Distribution Department in the southern area Bahzat Amin attending.
The initiative was announced in a celebration held the day before yesterday at the "Venicia" Hotel under the patronage of the Prime Minister, represented by Minister of Communications Jean-Louis Qordahi, and in the presence of a crowd of representatives from the communications, education and higher education sectors.
So the correction was required.

Jisr spoke yesterday at a dialogue luncheon organized by the International Chamber of Commerce branch entitled "Justice and Business" at the "Metropolitan Palace" Hotel, attended by Secretary General of the Chamber Dr. Louis Hubaiqah, former director general at the Ministry of Finance Habeeb Abu Saqer, Merrill Lynch Office Manager in Beirut John Dagger, and a group of individuals from the judicial sector, businessmen and bankers.
While he confirmed that justice suffers problems all over the world, pointing out that Lebanon is among the countries that seek to protect people's rights, he presented the problems that litigated businessmen and others suffer from, and listed of them the slowness in judicial proceedings "which is a certain injustice and creates an environment of skepticism towards the courts", and arbitrariness in using the right to prosecute or litigate "under the slogan of the right to holy defense."
He believed that arbitration requires spreading an arbitration culture specifically between businessmen, which helps them provide for arbitration in contracts, and also helps in resolving their conflicts more quickly, in addition to decreasing a large load off of the courts in the future.
He concluded by reiterating that "the problem is not impossible as some try to picture it", and explained that the country has actually started to take the road that will lead to solving these problems, the evidence being the statistic issued by the Judicial Investigation Association comparing the judicial years 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 that show the percentage of increase in resolving by litigation, despite their increase, "and we believe that will lead, if the matter remains at the same level, to a balance between the incoming litigation and those resolved by the end of the year 2002.
A celebration for the occasion was held on board the ship "Yakamon River" anchored at Beirut Harbor - Dock 8, and was attended by American Ambassador Vincent Patel, Director General of the Grains and Sugar Beetroot Office Antoine Khoury, representing Minister of Economy and Trade Basil Fleihan, Director of the American Agency for Development John Preisler, Director of Grain Silos at the Harbor Jean Tuma, in addition to representatives from the "Mercy Corps" Foundation.
Khoury hoped that "this program achieves its goals with joint cooperation to help southern Lebanon and provide scholarships for students who do not have the ability to provide their tuition at universities."
The program is aimed at reviving local economies and activating them in the villages of those areas that are the most impoverished and underprivileged in Lebanon, by meeting their urgent needs, which doubles economic opportunities, activates agricultural production and protects the environment.
It must be pointed out here that the total quantity of granted wheat was sold on the July 19th, 2001 to a number of mills that included Al Taj Flour Mills, Middle East Industrial Company, Al Dourah Flour Mills, Al Shahba Flour Mills, Major South Mills, Modern Lebanon Mills, Al Assaf Modern Mills, Jabal Amel Mills, Middle East Mills, Leitani Mills and Al Biqa Flour Mills.
The discussions concentrated on expanding the port of Tripoli.
The delegation conducted a field tour of the port to review the hopes achieved in the last two years to develop it and to examine the extent of meeting international standards, and reviewed what the port's administration plans to do in the coming year. The Bank considered that the state's contribution is available and decided to fund the second part of the project estimated at forty million dollars.
He pointed out that the Bank's approval yesterday to fund a part of the work to develop Tripoli port "is evidence of the European countries' commitment to Lebanon and to continue funding projects in it."
He considered that "the movement in the port of Tripoli this year, compared with last year, was positive but limited.
We, as a government, are offering the development network for movement, and the private sector must, parallel to that, activate the wheel of the cycle and activate it.
We divided the plan into two parts, each part for a period of five years.
President of the Republic General Emil Lahhoud received at the Baabba Palace yesterday President of the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development Sheikh Abdul Latif Yousef Al Hamad, accompanied by Director General of the Leitani Water Works Naser Nasrallah.  The projects that the Fund is funding in Lebanon with long term loans were presented to him, the last of which was an agreement for a loan in the value of 31 million Kuwaiti dinars signed the day before yesterday, to contribute to funding a project for transferring the Leitani waters to the south.
As for Nasrallah, he in turn explained "the project of supplying the south with Leitani water for irrigation and drinking will benefit 99 villages and towns where more than 140 thousand people live, and it is expected that their numbers will increase to half a million people in the year 2030".
Al Hamad and Nasrallah had visited before noon former Prime Minister Dr. Salim al Hoss, Minister of Culture Ghassan Salameh who gave a banquet in his honor with President Al Hoss in attendance, and Director General of Archeology Frederick Al Husseini, and President of the Tripoli Municipality Samir Shaarani.
The Association will also discuss the annual report that will be presented to the assembly.
The names put forth for the presidency of the Association are divided among: President of the Arab Banks Unions, President of the Board of Directors of Lebanon Credit Bank Dr. Joseph Tarabay, former president of the Association, President of the Board of Directors of Byblos Bank Dr. Francois Baseel, and President of the Board of Directors of Beirut Bank Salim Sfeir.
It seems that the ambiguity, even the contradiction stamp the reading of the German position on "Hizbollah".
We understood from this phrase that the German Chancellor meant America and not Lebanon as he went back to recover the question on the American position alone.
Here we ask: Is it possible for Germany to consider "Hizbollah" terrorist, and consequently Lebanon a harbor of a terrorist organization if not a sponsor of it, while at the same time the first official in it goes out and declares a position supportive of Lebanon in the economic aspect (the partnership and Paris-2) and committing to setting a date for the first and a time horizon close to the second?
Here, our evaluation meets with what we heard from a senior German diplomat concerned with German politics in the Middle East, as he separated between the American and German positions on the matter of lists, and considered that these "issuances" can embarrass Europe, which is holding on to its alliance with America in its war against terrorism as well as with the Arab World, where Germany is playing a mounting role specifically in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
American congestion towards Lebanon requires going to America's European partners, namely France, Germany and Britain, and digressing to the European Union to achieve two goals: The first is calming the American position and rationalizing the reactions issued from Washington.
In conclusion, Lebanon can only invent an active foreign policy to capitalize on relationships with the international community away from speech that seems, up to this moment and in some cases, as if it were not directed at this international community as much as it was directed inward so that the (international community) pardons it of "the troubles" of paying attention to this "small friend" and its privacy...
There are those who say they hope that these statements are based on information President Hariri gleaned from his meetings abroad.
And that the activity of this party depends on the withdrawal of Israel from the last inch of Lebanese territories, and that the success of the war on terrorism is related to reaching a solution for the Middle East crisis.
It was noted that the call of President Hariri on the Lebanese to refrain from making the issue of the relationship with the United States their occupation and from making the exchanged conversation in this regard give an impression that there is a confrontation between Lebanon and the United States is an invitation to stop the discussion of the subject and leave the handling up to the Lebanese authority with the information it has to take the appropriate position, because Lebanon has no interest in political and media escalation and so it remains far from problems it does not need and consequently has no energy to handle their effects.
The higher interests deem agreement even if on a minimal program that includes the basic matters, while maintaining the opinions, positions and thoughts of every team or party, to avoid continuing the policy of harassment and political heresies, so Lebanon returns to being the hospital of the Arab World and a center of science, culture, and investment in various fields.
Many expected Lebanon's extinction and end, but their expectations did not happen. The Lebanese proved their liveliness, initiative and ability to survive, spread, and overcome difficulties. What is needed is putting an end to damaging internal conflicts and providing political and security stability so that significant Lebanese money returns from outside into Lebanese, that waits among others for the improvement of the internal situation and the reestablishment of trust in it.
Yes, we find no better expressive word than the word "misfortune", maybe because the defeated in Afghanistan are prisoners of stumbling blocs, and how many there are, which defeated them in life before the "smart missiles" defeated them militarily, and maybe because the victorious in Afghanistan, and we are not talking here about the "Northern Alliance" but about America specifically, are prisoners of the stumbling blocks, and how many there are, which defeated them politically in several places in the world, before the events of "Black Tuesday" on September 11th and its many internal and external effects affected them with the ugliest civilization defeat.
There is a pressing need to go back to this "new McCarthyism" that is not merely practiced on an internal level in the United States of American, but also practiced on an external level with almost all the countries of the world.
McCarthy stepped on the values of democracy, freedom and human rights with his feet on the pretext on maintaining the safety of the nation from the communist's danger, and there are indications now that the "new McCarthyism" went far in this road on the pretext of fighting terrorism after September 11th.
Reviewing company records.
There are articles in respected American magazines and newspapers that speak of the necessity of torture as a method to serve truth and justice, and there are those that do not object to overlooking the "moral calendar" in the work of justice.
Lebanon had never before aroused in the diplomatic circles especially bewilderment and severe criticism that remained hidden in private meetings away from the media, as much as it aroused by the announcement of the meeting between the American Secretary of State, Colin Powell, and Syrian Farouq Al Shara in New York on the sidelines of the proceedings of the General Assembly of the United Nations, in order to discuss the issue of "Hizbollah".
The least that can be expected with the heading of a Lebanese diplomatic delegation to New York is requesting to meet Powell to clarify Lebanon's point of view and become clear on the essence of the American position and its considerations, or refraining from participating in the meetings of the international organization if it is going to endorse the important meetings to a third party on behalf of Lebanon, despite the fact that refraining from participation is not in Lebanon's interest, which is absent from foreign policies.
It would have been possible to hold a meeting between Powell and Hammoud as with Shara on an equal basis.
But the political circles do not believe that the possible Lebanese efforts related to the United States would have worked.
Will "Terrorism" Return Turkey's Role?
Second, Turkey's care based on the referred to connections to "inform" the international community and its unilateral leader the United States of its ability to play a principle and important role in that region that will lead to its stability and at the same time safeguard the international interests, especially the Western ones.
What is the effect of the war America started on the Taliban and Bin Laden terrorism after what it was subjected to last September 11th on Turkey?
But this first reading does not seem to be giving the true picture.
And it is also making certain to obtain the support of the United States for the role Turkey is ambitious to play in middle Asia especially in the countries whose peoples come from Turkish origin.
And its knowledge as well that the United States is its only hope, especially the "Pentagon".
And third it was a move aimed at encouraging people of the secular belief in middle Asia through implying to them that Turkey is ready to help them protect their non-religious systems from the fundamental threats that have lately increased or to establish such systems.

Al-Ibrahimi presented Tuesday a plan of five points to establish an interim authority in Afghanistan.
Berlin - from Ali Hamadeh:
It is noteworthy that from this talk two reading were issued: The first sees that Germany does not agree with Lebanon in its view of "Hizbullah" and the second linked the answer of the German Chancellor to the reasonable context of the question which is related exclusively to Germany's calendar of the United States' position without any reference to Lebanon.
He also promised his support to reach a partnership agreement between Lebanon and the European Union next week.
He said that Lebanon refuses to send its army to the border because that would guarantee the relief of the occupation at a time when our goal is to push Israel to sit at the negotiations table.
The fourth ministerial conference of the World Trade Organization in Doha succeeded in launching a new round of negotiations to liberate trade exchange after it was able to reach settlements yesterday on sensitive portfolios, including agriculture, environment, and textiles, which was considered a great accomplishment and a ray of hope in reviving the world economy that is suffering a depression, and restoring the dignity of the Organization after its failure at an earlier conference in Seattle in the year 1999.
The white smoke did not rise above the "Sheraton" Hotel where the conference convened in Doha until after Indian Minister of Commerce, Murasoli Maran, announced his country's joining of some of the points of the statements it was reserved over.
* In Brussels, a statement by the President of the European Commission Romano Prodi said that the agreement "focuses well on the creation of balance between liberating trade and organizing it."
Paris - by George Sasseen:
Widely informed French sources said the day before yesterday that the American administration is preparing for an important declaration on the Palestinian - Israeli conflict sponsored by Secretary of State Colin Powell and outlines the political features of the future American course in the region.
But what is the nature of the efforts exerted and their political limits?
This settlement that the French diplomats call "the appropriate exit" starts with the declaration of a viable and peaceful Palestinian state, provided that the declaration is the fruit of consultations of the "negotiations table" Chirac hinted at and includes aside from the parties of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict the United States, Russia, the European Union, Egypt, Jordan and the Secretary General of the United Nations.
This "appropriate exit" takes into consideration "the obvious reservations" shown by Bush towards Chirac's idea to convene an international conference, and as a result the organization of a "negotiations table" on the basis of the United Nations and Security Council resolutions and the results of the Madrid Conference might be within the accepted "general framework" at this stage in which the American administration opposes any attempt of actual pressure on the conflict parties, especially the government of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon for three reasons: first, Washington's waging of war in Afghanistan to destroy the "Al Qaeda" network headed by Osama bin Laden and hosted by the "Taliban" movement.
And therefore the prevailing trend in the American administration is waiting for resolving the election merits inside the "Likud" bloc at the end of February when Sharon wages a decisive battle against his arch rival former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The merits said: "It became evident that the defendant Raed Suleiman was living with his grandmother Srourah Saeed Omar, sixty four years old, at her home in Safsaf neighborhood in Ein Al Hilweh since his mother died when he was a child. His grandmother raised him until he was twenty, and had saved approximately 18 million liras she had deposited at a bank in a joint bank account in her name and the name of his sister witness Umaimah, who accessed the account and acted with it, provided the balance after her grandmother's death would revert to her, her defendant a brother and another brother, and that Umaimah used to give her brothers small amounts of the grandmother's money every once in a while.
He threw in the corridor leading to that room, in front of her door, a hand grenade whose explosion led to several severe injuries that resulted in transferring her to the hospital where she died upon arrival.
It became clear that the defendant stated before the detachment that he had eight grenades, and traded two of them for bullets and gave three to Ibrahim Saleh in return for one hundred bullets, and gave one to Amer Shreidi and kept two.
It became evident that the house of the murdered woman had a main entrance of iron that consists of two shutters, each shutter having at the top a window forty centimeters wide and thirty centimeters high with iron bars in them but not equipped with glass, so that it was possible to put a hand inside or through a hand grenade through it to the inside of the house. The house consisted, on the inside, of a six meter long corridor leading to two rooms: the door of the first at the end of the hall opposite the entrance door, and the door of the second, which is the room the defendant and the murdered women slept in at the far right of the corridor, and the house consisted of a kitchen and bathroom that can be reached from the latter room.
It became evident that this court had taken responsibility of this case in accordance with the court of cessation ruling to transfer the case from the South Criminal Court for security reasons to one of the chambers of the Beirut Criminal Court on 1/25/2000."
Army command warned "some suspicious elements related to the Israeli enemy and its agents, fleeing from justice" at Ein Al Hilweh Camp, of "going to far in their provocative actions", confirming that it "will strike back with the means it deems necessary."
Two grenades were thrown yesterday at dawn at the army checkpoint at the northern entrance of the camp, in the third such happening in less than two months.
Additionally, it issued a verdict to imprison Khalil Ibrahim Abboud nine months for enlisting in the enemy army and entering it's country.
An unknown person threw a hand grenade in the direction of Palestinian Khalil Tahhan in the Safsaf neighborhood inside Ein El Hilweh Camp, which led to the injury of Tayseer Hijazi (16 years old), who was transported to Jerusalem Hospital.
The Union President informed the members of the election of Board Member Bassam Jammal as a permanent member in the Permanent Office of the Arab Lawyers Union for four years.
The "Emergency Committee on Traffic Affairs" announced the injury of 9 persons in Halat, Zahleh, Rashaya, Saadnayel, and Akkar.
When Bassam was asked for an explanation, he said that the gun belonged to his cousin, martyr Abdul Kareem Qasem Qansou and that he did not know its source.
The fire resulted in damages, even though the car was empty.
As a result, units of the Fire Brigade headed to the site of the fire and worked on isolating the fire that was raging in the Shudeirat and prevented it from spreading to the fuel tanks and the building itself. They put it out in cooperation with the civil defense."
Two masked individuals robbed Abboud Othman El Kurdi in Sheikh Abbas town (Akkar) of 335 thousand Liras, a licensed gun, and a cellular phone, after giving him a sound beating.
Upon searching them, a quantity of heroin was found inside the two bags. The heroin was placed in packets and arranged in three layers, weighing 12 kilograms and 490 grams.
The court dismissed a misdemeanor charge by virtue of Article 72 Weapons for incomplete evidence because on the date he committed the crime, he had obtained a license to carry a military weapon of various kinds, whose validity expires on 7/31/2001.
After joining the Human Rights Association, he committed himself to its goals.
They are ignorant, and Islam disowns their crimes. With their criminal act, they assault Islam first, because they violate the teachings of the Quran.
He, who does not believe in the Messiah is a disbeliever and shall be punished by God with a grievous punishment.
God said: "Surely I will send it down unto you, but if any of you disbelieves after that, I will punish him with a penalty such as I have not inflicted on any one anyone among the nations." The Almighty God said what was true.
The hand that attacks a church or kills a Christian without guilt is a satanic hand that must be amputated, because it is a Zionist hand.
The Penal Court of Cassation Dismissed a Request by the Military Prosecutor for Expanding Investigations in the Hindi File
The verdict included the following:
It has also been established that the Military Examining Magistrate had ruled on 10/17/2001 to rest his case in the investigation and to refer the papers to the Public Prosecutor for the perusal of merits.
Whereas the relevant submission referred to in Article 78 is not intended to include petitions submitted by the Government's Commissioner to the Examining Magistrate that are related to any administrative or investigative procedures, which he is asked to adopt during the investigation, e.g., appointing an expert or hearing a witness.
Whereas the appeal submitted by the Government's Commissioner is not, in view of the aforementioned argument, valid in the light of the restrictive stipulation of Article 78 of the Military Judicial Law.
Second: To Waive legal expenses from the current review.
The ink was barely dry on last week's article ("Azrar" 225), which said that Lebanon is "a small country," but it is not a "homeland that is not small," when one of our politicians ("An-Nahar," Saturday 3rd November) surprised us with a statement on an occasion that took place in one of the towns that belong to him, in which he said "it is true that we are a small homeland, but we have a big role among the countries in the region."
Meaning, in both cases, there is no geopolitical significance in "Lebanon the homeland," and no favor preference for "the house of the father of politics" in its radiance and glories.
How many of our politicians know Paul Moran's saying, "Sidon and Tyre embodied in one day all the history of the world?"
Even if France asked to be annexed to you, you should refuse."
Do our politicians and the claimants to politics in Lebanon, who hover around them, and with them those, who raise havoc over globalization, know that opposition to globalization starts with awareness of our history, our influence, and our glory, before they drawl with ignorant, frivolous talks that makes us "followers", "attachments" and "secondary", while we, with only two cities of our own (Sidon and Tyre) were once all the history of the world?
On its sixth day, the French Book Fair "Read in French and Music", held at Beirut Hall, was chosen as a designation by a group of school students, who came especially to acquaint themselves with new concepts in culture and dialogue.
The simplicity of the lines we see is influenced by the lights and sounds that seek to capture the entire reality during that particular moment which the painting exhausts.
Communication is a recurrent subject.
In another place, Venus Khouri Gata signed her novel "Privileges of the Dead", published by Dar Balan and exhibited in the Pavilion of Le Point Library.
However, the man of whom we dream is always absent or hides himself from the sight of his surroundings.
He also wrote his opinion about women in selections, which were read out by Khater.
The French Governmental Agency organized a meeting at the pavilion for handing the writer her award.
Parallel to the signing ceremonies, Claude Lorieu delivered a lecture about his recent work "Christians of the East in the Land of Peace" and Francoise Tudorovitch spoke about "Psychoanalysis in Aldous Huxley's Works".
"A letter was published in issue 21106 of the esteemed "An-Nahar" Newspaper, which we honor and respect, on page 19, entitled: To the President of the Republic from Three Students, signed by Messrs: Joseph Sa'b, Mazen Kurdi, and Husam Al Rassi.
It is noteworthy that the program has provided Lebanon with about 460 holders of doctorates to this date and they are the best of the scientists and academicians working at academic institutions in Lebanon.
1. This year, 228 male and female students applied to the scholarship program, 54 of whom were classified as meeting the criteria set by the Council's regulations according to a mechanism that includes the special conditions for the scholarship program, the criteria for evaluating the scientific files, and the slate of scientific priorities approved for this year.
Those who received the Council's scholarships this year had grades exceeding 68 out of 100 in their license (for students of the Faculty of Science at the Lebanese University), and 13 out of 20 and above in their advanced studies and their Masters degrees.
And it was not possible to give preference to the complaining gentlemen over their more proficient colleagues, which is the only criterion used by the Council to grant scholarships.
The celebration was held at the UNESCO Palace in the presence of the representative of the President of the Republic, Minister Ghassan Salameh, Maronite Patriarch Bishop Khalil Abi Nader, Beirut Metropolitan Representative for the Roman Orthodox Church, Father Boulus Wahbi, and the President of the National Council of Information, Abdul Hadi Mahfouth.
Allouf then spoke to say that the award is not only an appreciation of his work, but also and encouragement and a token of friendly reception and honorable tribute. He stressed that his main concern in scientific research is trying to know just a small part of the components of life for the sake of health and prevention.
Beirut International Exhibition of Books, Television and Communications in the Age of Globalization; "Shaherazad Said" that on Thursday and Friday Nicola Ziyadeh Receives His Readers at the Book Exhibition
Arab problems, just like the conflict between Arab regimes and the internal policies of these regimes and their concept of civil liberties and the freedom of the press, seem to pose a big obstacle in the way of developing Arab communication.
Rafiq Nasrallah said in his speech: "Dr. May's book, inasmuch as it constitutes a quantum leap in approaching all these coups, constitutes a coup against the academic approach, which is conventionally taught here and which needs a state of mutiny against it because it is an approach that is steeped in the patterns of the 1960s, where stereotypes are safeguarded."
In the framework of the traditional shows presented by Maha Ne'meh to school students under the title "Shaherazad Said," the exhibition was visited by 633 students from the following schools: Al Amiliyyah, Mar Yousef the Maronite, Al Sadeq, Mohammad Khaled Institutions, and Al Kawthar Secondary School.
The fist book in the Arabic language of the "Atlas Series -- Philosophy" will be autographed in the presence of its translator, Dr. George Kattourah, between six and nine in the evening today (Thursday) at Pavilion of Eastern Library.
Captain Joseph Ni'meh will autograph his book "Deir Al Qamar - Capital of Ancient Lebanon" in the presence of his son Staff Brigadier Adnonis Ni'meh, between six and nine tomorrow evening (Friday) at the Pavilion of Eastern Library.
Mouselli, Khoury and Iskandar Speak About "War and Terrorism;" Unilateral Oppressive Features after September 11th; an Economic Recession Is Likely to Expand; Khoury - Iskandar
He noted that "there is justification of the idea of oppression, instead of lessening its control, we find that the United States is entering a tunnel of militarizing the regime."
He concluded that "Samuel Huntington started to change his opinion and to find that the world is on the verge of an important crossroads, we either head towards dialogue or an oppressive American war and oriental terrorism."
He concluded, "Firstly, of security and the recommendations of the security forces in America in the framework of a "new McCarthyism," democracy and freedom do not merely subject Americans to the applications of Marxism, which has collapsed and went bankrupt, but it also subjects the entire world to a perplexed unilateralism with dictatorial thought that can only ignite the force of terrorism everywhere."
On this subject it must also be noted that the future expectations are based to a great extent on the sabotage that might take place and cause the US or other industrial countries a lot of damage."
Verification procedures at US borders are delaying the movement of goods and limit exchange with countries that deal mostly with the Unite States, Canada and Mexico.
Literary seminar at the Lycee Francaise and the Launch of the "Francophonic Young Writer Award"
Conditions for participation are that the participant's age is between 15 and 25 years, and that they submit a text whose size ranges between 5 and 40 pages typed in two copies and sent to the following addresses:
The principal of the school, Guy Dreiche started the meeting with a welcoming word in which he introduced the visiting writers and explained the title of the seminar: "What Does the Dialogue of Cultures Represent to the Lebanese Student?" He said: "These writers are in Beirut for three important events: Firstly, to participate in the French Book Fair, secondly, to hand over the "Young Francophonic Writer's Award" (the second award) to the Lebanese national Nadine Khouri for her novel: " " and thirdly, to hand over the "Five Continents Award" for the first time in the framework of the fair."
The President of the Republic stressed that he is "reassured that Lebanon will continue to be far away from the repercussions of the events of last September 11th in the United States for many reasons, the most significant of which is the unity of the Lebanese stand in confronting these developments and the stand taken by sisterly and friendly states to its side in confronting continuous Israeli attempts to harm it."
He expressed Lebanon's thanks for "the support it has always received from France, which emphasizes the depth of the historical relations that bind the two friendly countries and their mutual belief in justice, rights and peace."
He expressed his belief that the United States, after the events of last September 11th, must "change its view of the current conflicts in the world, especially the Arab-Israeli conflict and to hasten to participate in finding just solutions, thus preventing the detonating fuse from being always cocked, because the world economy cannot stand any more explosions."
They emphasized the "urgency of going ahead with the economic processes, especially now that the developments and events in the world make addressing and confronting the matter more than necessary."
Lahoud also received the Chairman of the Syrian National Socialist party Jubran Arabji and the party's deputy chairman Mahmoud Abdul Khaleq, with whom he reviewed the general situation in the country in the light of recent developments.
Lahoud reviewed the general situation is Lebanon in light of the recent developments with Mr. Mahdi al-Tajer.
The Administration and Justice Committee has reviewed a project, referred to by the Government and aiming to establish branches of the Casino du Liban in the different regions.
This followed in-depth discussion of all the possibilities and aspects addressed in the Casino du Liban Ordinance and of these branches, if and when the Council of Ministers decides to open them and the Company accepts the decision with a view to encouraging investment, especially that many hotels with five or more stars, if we want to encourage them to come to invest in Lebanon, sometimes impose the condition that the Casino du Liban approves this subject.
Some points were clarified so that if the Casino du Liban Company is licensed by the Council of Ministers to open branches, it is the Company that decides and that shows the economic feasibility. Nothing is imposed on it.
*  It was reported that the Casino du Liban Company would not agree to establish branches in the region?
"That the Company did not ask, in the first place, to open any branch. Secondly, whether we give it the right to open a branch or not, who owns the Company?
He cautioned that the possibility of controlling the branches would be very limited, bearing in mind that these branches may fall under the influences of local authorities.
Celebrating the 70th Anniversary of Nationalist Party Areiji: The Alternative to Parties is Sects
For seventy years the Syrian Nationalist Socialist Party has not abandoned its distinctive features.
Seventy years in challenging political, social and intellectual ignorance in order to entrench citizenship in thought and deed. Seventy years of challenging modernization with thought, literature and creativity, in search for the certitude of the answer to the question "Who are we?" Seventy years of struggling, generation after generation, and being imprisoned, persecuted, exiled, and sentenced to death. Seventy years of dogmatic practice, partisan organization and struggling efforts. After seventy years, are we still in need of a lease on life, where some assault with the question: Are we still in need of political parties, specifically the Syrian Nationalist Socialist Party?
The meeting between Lebanese parties and forces and Palestinian factions called for "the absolute rejection of American dictations and instructions, because it is the beginning of declaring war on the Arabs and Muslims."
Prime Minister Al Hoss followed and said: "If Lebanon accepted categorizing Hizbullah as a terrorist organization, it would condemn itself for liberating the Lebanese lands from Israeli occupation.
America has assumed this mission itself without going back to the United Nations.
He asked: "How will the US Administration respond to Lebanon's official position that refuses unjust measures?"
The meeting issued at the end of its deliberations, a statement that said: "The participants confirm their support of the Intifada and their absolute rejection of American dictations that categorized resistance forces and the Intifada in our nation as terrorist forces. The real terrorism is what has been exercised by the Zionist entity since its establishment through the occupation of Arab lands, and practicing massacres and vicious crimes against our people in the Palestine."
The President of the Republic confirmed that he is "comfortable with the fact that Lebanon will remain distant from the repercussions of the last September 11th events in the United States for many reasons. The most important of these reasons are the unity of the Lebanese position in confronting these developments, and the support of brotherly and friendly countries by its side in confronting the continued Israeli attempts to harm it."
That is why they dealt with it calmly before the eruption of the political exchange with the American Ambassador Vincent Battle. Then, they went back to dealing with the list calmly with the aim of finding out how determined the Americans are regarding their demands, away from the language of threats and intimidation, which do not reflect, in reality, the American position on Lebanon at the present time.
But mystery is surrounding the German position on the United States categorization of "Hizbullah" as a terrorist organization.
Amaki gave a speech in which he expressed his delight for his appointment in Lebanon "especially during the time the Middle East is going through with regard to reconstruction", and hoped "that Lebanon will regain its economic and cultural role in the Middle East region."
Lebanese Position Has Not Convinced Washington and Chirac's Support Creates Comfort
They said that Washington was not convinced with the Lebanese position, which is being subjected to fierce attacks, the last of which was by National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice.
Therefore Washington's current approach to the issue of fighting terrorism is intertwined with reactions as well as plans.
But they wondered at the same time what Paris's position will be inside the committee for implementing resolution 1373, and what the position will be inside the committee when the American delegate presents the identity of "Hizballah" to the committee which, according to its internal system, must vote unanimously.
The Speaker of the House of Deputies, Nabeeh Berri, stressed yesterday the necessity of fortifying the internal situation in the face of challenges and future requirements, as well as the need to address the economic situation and improve the administrative situation.
He called for paying the money due to municipalities, especially those recently elected, from the independent municipal fund.
The "National Agency for Information" reported from New York, that the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants, Mahmoud Hammoud, focused in a meeting with Arab foreign ministers Tuesday night on "the invariable national Lebanese policies and the Lebanese position regarding the settlement process, especially in relations to the resistance."
He also met the Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Vidovin, who dealt in his talk with the situation in the region and the Russian position thereon and acquainted him with the results of Russian-European-American contacts, drawing attention to an American position, which American Foreign Minister Colin Powell will curse after two weeks in relation to the region and which will be detailed before he visits the region shortly.
It was natural that the "Taliban" should fall, whether by means of the American war or by another, or without it. For, a movement that adopts backwardness and ignorance as common sense is outside this age, and it is not acceptable that it has a place in the world in the twenty-first century.
Did the leaders of the Taliban movement, "which pitched its head against the Buddha statues on the pretext that they are idols, believe that they are better believers, worshippers, religious or Islamic than the Muslims who conquered those countries during the Umayyad era, or those who successively ruled those places and were not provoked by the statues?
And does the doctrine of Islam, any Islam, and in any society, even the strictest, have that way in treating women?
It is not right for any regime seeking power to raise the flag of Islam and show more extremism than others, to arouse instincts so that it becomes a representative of a group of people and licenses itself to rule all people.
Progressive Party: Standing by the Side of "Hizbullah" and Question About the Truth of Rice's Statements
"First: Emphasizing what has been agreed upon during the joint meeting of the Leadership of the Party with the brethren at Hizbullah on 12/11/2001, the Council calls upon and all Lebanese to stand firmly on the side of Hizbullah and all the nationalists, who contributed towards resistance and liberation, to consider that what has been accomplished so far is the property of the entire Lebanese people, based on the principle of the unity of Lebanese territory and the right of its people, in accordance with international codes, to resistance to liberate every atom of soil occupied by a usurping enemy, whose crimes, massacres and the consequences of his aggression are still looming before us today, and where Lebanon is still paying the price of Zionist aggression, materially and morally until this moment. We emphasize that enhancing the unity of the position of the Lebanese at this stage is the natural reply to attempts at confiscating Lebanon's independence, sovereignty and dignity.
Three: We call upon the Lebanese Government, especially after the publication of different statements, the last of which was by the Advisor to the American President on National Security, Mrs. Condoleezza Rice, to hasten immediately to summon the American ambassador to ask him about the truth of the statements in view of their gravity and because they contained a threat to annihilate the Lebanese entity in case it did not give in to the American conditions. On the basis of the American reply, the Lebanese Government would then have the freedom to adopt the positions, which its dignity and the supreme national interest dictate upon it, and consequently to submit the matter to the Security Council because of what it contains in terms of the gravity of insolence against the entity and sovereignty, which the United Nations Organization have been keen on safeguarding, especially that Lebanon is a founding member of the United Nations."

He appealed to the "Israeli authorities once again to put a limit to these air violations and to regard the Blue Line with complete respect."
Tens of trucks transport tifinol from around this post to other posts inside occupied Cheb'a farms to qualify them for confronting the winter season.
He was asked during his weekly seminar about the background to the new American threats against Lebanon. So, he replied: "There is no doubt that the new American threats try to activate the economic file one way or another, which is a matter the Americans talked about recurrently, especially just after the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, in accordance with the rule, for which they have plotted and adopted as a heading for their policy against Lebanon, whose gist is that Lebanon will get to the stage of economic growth unless Israel feels it felt that its security conditions in the south have been achieved, in the forefront of which is disarming the resistance."
Opening of a Vital Statistics Bureau in Jouya and Resignations Bring Down the Shihabiyyeh Council Ashrafiyyeh Development Council Launched Recommendations for Demands and Far'oun Supports a Municipalities Law that Reflects Beiruti Concord Bshirri: Demand for Planning Repeated Tripoli: Pave the Road Before Operating Traffic Lights Jouya: Inauguration of a Vital Statistics Bureau Shihabiyyeh: Resignations Bring Down the Municipalities

The Civil Aviation General Directorate's forecast predicts that it will not rain until tomorrow evening with no significant change in temperatures, which will range between 16 and 26 on the coast, between 14 and 20 in the mountains, and between 15 and 30 in al-Biqa'.
The word "if" was accidentally dropped from the interview published by "al-Nahar" yesterday with Minister of the Interior and Municipalities Elias Al-Murr, which distorted the meaning.
There was a presentation of the overall situation, of the domestic, regional and international developments which "require that the national stance be fortified by means of genuine cooperation among the authorities, the establishment of the people's unity despite their diverse political classifications, and the urgent necessity of giving absolute priority to dealing with security and economic matters and healing the disquieting social rift."
An Iraqi delegation arrives in Beirut today, headed by National Council member Khalid Amin al-Nasiri, to take part in the symposium being organized by the House of Representatives entitled, "Achieving Sustainable Development in the Arab Homeland."
He said in a statement yesterday:
What the draft law proposes is the appointment of a single governor for the provinces of Beirut and Mount Lebanon.  In this connection, we affirm that each of the two provinces will retain its own independent character and boundaries, despite the fact that the Minister of the Interior referred to "merging" the two provinces in his statement to "al-Nahar" newspaper yesterday, Wednesday.
Patronized the signing of the reconciliation agreement in Ghaboon Hamadeh: Our unity is a response to the statements made about wars of religion Mus'ad al-Damur
As we reinforce national unity through the steps we take today, we know that this unity is that which provides never-ending protection from all dangers.  It is the response, if even within our small sphere in al-Ghaboon, indeed, on the mountain, indeed, in Lebanon with its great significance, to claims, which we hear these days about wars among religions, cultures and civilizations.
Of course, His Excellency the Minister has worked on the al-Ghaboon file in a concentrated way, and we are also working with him on the Kafr Salwan file, which we expect to be signed within a month, God willing, in order for us to move on to the last two files in Burayh and al-Shahhar."
George Karim delivered a speech on behalf of the returnees in which he stated, "Today we are not signing a peace treaty.  Rather, we are renewing a covenant with ourselves to be brothers in good times and bad.  We ask the honorable officials to come to our aid in all areas for the sake of developing our village, the only village on the mountain whose people reside in it year-round."
Hamadeh delivered a speech in the beginning of which he delivered greetings from Junblatt who is out of the country, saying, "I cannot reassure anyone about the prosperous economic situation, for it is not that, nor about the country which has escaped pressures, occupations and acts of aggression, for alas, it is not that.
Is Yasser Arafat still a genuine participant in the dialogue with Israel, or should it look for a replacement for him?
When Menachem Begin was president of the government, it was suggested to him that he assassinate Arafat, but he refused despite the fact that he saw him as a new embodiment of Hitler.
In spite of this, it is not true that Israel intends to liquidate Arafat.
The debate in Israel focuses around whether Arafat wants to do this, with the majority believing that he does not.
Quite probably it will, but it is also possible that it will be a great deal better, though not immediately.

Avoid driving your car today and stay home because you are in dire need of some tranquility.

Also, they discussed "the Arab request presented by the Arab group in New York to convene an emergency session for the Security Council as the international body is responsible for international security and peace, to discuss a way to control the deterioration in the occupied Palestinian territories."
He said that Egypt agrees with holding an Arab meeting at the Foreign Ministers level as soon as possible to study the situation in light of the international developments.
* In Manama, approximately nine thousand demonstrators, who started from the Ras Al Rumman area mosque in the capital Manama, raised Palestinian and "Hizbollah" flags, and shouted anti-Israel slogans as well as slogans condemning American support of the Jewish state.
As for Ajaweed, he commented in Ankara: "It seems, unfortunately, that Sharon's tendency to get rid of Arafat is real."
Tens of Thousands Demonstrated in Tehran in Support of Intifada on "Jerusalem Day"
A memorandum that was read to the protestors said that Israel is "a cancerous tumor in the Middle East," and that "fighting Israel is fighting terrorism."
He added: "As Israel does not have enough (people and soldiers), arrogance granted her non-traditional weapons, as well as chemical, nuclear and mass destruction weapons."
They believed that "there will be no peace and stability in our region without the return of Jerusalem to Palestinian sovereignty."
Two American soldiers were injured during a battle to seize a position held by "Al Qaeda" elements, and the US Defense Department, the "Pentagon", declared that it is still uncertain about the whereabouts of Bin Laden.
She said: "It seems unlikely that an independent and fair trial will take place in that country to try a man in these
He believed that any person that doubts its truth only adopts "a weak excuse to provide support to a man who is evil beyond reason."
Amid wide anti-globalization demonstrations and bloody confrontations with Belgian riot control police, and coinciding with the circulation of the first unified European currency the "Euro", presidents and heads of governments of the European Union started yesterday at the Laeken Palace near Brussels a summit that will last two days to discuss the future of Europe and reforming joint institutions, as well as the situation in the Middle East and Afghanistan.
An official at the Jordanian Civil Defense Department, Lieutenant Mohammad Abdullah, said that "the passengers in the bus, all Egyptians, failed to get out of it when it overturned outside the coastal road and crashed into several containers inside the port, which led to a quick fire that prevented saving them at the right time."
Egyptian authorities sent a Hercules-type military aircraft to transport the bodies that were placed in a refrigerated truck.
Washington -WAS- Sources at the American Administration denied that President George Bush directed criticism at the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, in answer to what was published by Israeli media that said he attacked Saudi authorities when he received seven major Jewish contributors to the Republican Party.
He described the mission they are charged with as "sensitive", saying that he "cannot reveal their objective."
He described this occasion as a "time when traditions dictate that people extend their hands out to the needy."
And the Americans are working with several countries to provide food, medicine and clothes for the people of Afghanistan."
Afruze stated last week that an attack by airplanes was planned on the Indian Parliament, the British House of Commons and the Rialto Towers in Melbourne, Australia, on September 11th.
He believed that any person that doubts its truth only adopts "a feeble excuse to provide support to a man who is evil beyond reason."
Former Attorney General Richard Thornberg noted that Bin Laden "clearly indicated being familiar with the act and having earlier detailed knowledge of it... the number of people whose death he predicted."
In Dearborn, Michigan State, where about 20 thousand Arab Americans live, Lamia Hazimeh (32 years old) said: "I don't know much about Bin Laden, but I know I don't like him."
Bin Laden spoke clearly as if he was a person with prior knowledge of these attacks."
But the London "Guardian" Newspaper was skeptical of the tape, which would have constituted decisive evidence of Bin Laden's involvement if he "had boasted of that before September 11th , not after it."
As for the spokesperson of the "Islamic Scholars Association", Riyadh Dorani, he said "this tape is not enough" and "the Americans made it up after failing to find any evidence against Osama Bin Laden."
The Malaysian opposition concluded that the tape is American propaganda.
Shaima' Jamil (35 years old) said: "From the start, it was obvious to us that these problems came from Osama and his friends the Taliban (...) We hope that the Americans do not blame the Afghani people more for what happened."
In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, newspapers highlighted Bin Laden's saying that the kidnappers did not know what was going to happen.
Afghan fighters opposed to the "Taliban" Movement, supported by American Special Forces and air strikes tightened the noose more and more on the fundamentalist "Al Qaeda" Network led by Osama Bin Laden, fortified in the Tora Bora mountainous area near Jalalabad.
He said that his troops are surrounding a number of "Al Qaeda" fighters at the Tora Bora plains, amid unconfirmed reports of the likelihood that Bin Laden may be among them.
An eyewitness said that two American soldiers and an Afghan fighter were injured during the battle to seize an "Al Qaeda" position at Tora Bora.
He added that they were able to come down to the foot of the mountain, and from there they were transferred to a nearby town for treatment.
The spokesperson for the American Defense Department, the "Pentagon", Victoria Clark, said: "We do not know exactly where he is (...) We have different information, some of which may lead us to believe that he is in the Tora Bora area (...) But we do not know the exact location."
The Afghan "Islamic News Agency", based in Islamabad, reported that the American Special Forces landed Thursday night in Tora Bora and at Jalalabad Airport.
Hundreds of heavily armed "Marines" deployed in the Qandahar airport to secure the airport and its buildings.
The Navy infantry are surrounding the area from the north and the east, from the desert to Qandahar, and then up to a distance of 20 kilometers southeast of the airport.
New Delhi Accuses "Asaker Attaybeh" of Attack and Demands Pakistan Ban Two Islamic Groups "Technical Evidence" "Asaker Attaybeh"
New Delhi accuses Islamabad of supporting Islamic activists in Kashmir.
He added that "strikes like these strengthen our demands of fighting the demon of terrorism.
The spokesperson for the "Asaker Attaybeh" group quickly stated that the Indian government's accusations are "lacking in truth", and held the Indian intelligence responsible for the attack, saying, "this entire tragedy was planned to hurt Muslims in Kashmir and to implicate Pakistan."
American President George Bush offered Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee the help of the Federal Bureau of Investigations, the "FBI", and the experts in fighting terrorism at the US State Department, during a phone call on Thursday to express Washington's solidarity with India in its crisis.

The magazine's Editor in Chief, Sarah Mahoney, says: "I don't think that the national tendency will ever mean the same thing for any person that thinks about it (...). This experience (...) changed to a certain extent the way the Americans view themselves in a truly positive manner?
Studies by the National Center on Addiction at Columbia University in New York revealed that Americans went back to smoking after giving it up for a long time, or they are drinking more alcohol now, but they are re-examining themselves.

She said: "It seems unlikely that an independent and fair trial can be set up in that country to try a man in these circumstances," in reference to the climates that followed the September 11th events.
His lawyer, Donald DuBoulay, who was appointed by the court, justified that by saying "he does not want to participate in anything that has nothing to do with him."
The charges directed at him are terrorism, air piracy, destruction of planes, use of weapons of mass destruction, murder and destruction of property.
A plaque, on which the name of the Islamic Resistance Movement "Hams" was written, was found in his apartment with a red mark put around the date September 11th on a calendar.
Amid wide anti-globalization demonstrations and bloody confrontations with Belgian riot control police, and simultaneously with the introducing the first unified European currency, the "Euro" in circulation, the presidents and heads of governments of the European Union, yesterday started, at the Laeken Palace near Brussels, a summit that will last two days to discuss the future of Europe and reforming common institutions, as well as the situation in the Middle East and Afghanistan.
It is also expected that the Union will take the first step that will make it a military power, by declaring the creation of the first elements of a rapid deployment force consisting of 60 thousand men.
He expressed his satisfaction with this "precedent" in the history of the European Union and added: "Thus, Europe achieves the largest amount of progress."
Spain for example has pledged to contribute 500 men.
He concluded: "It was decided that a letter must be presented to the Israelis concerning their behavior and to the Palestinians on what we expect of them."
We said clearly, and more than any time in the past, that Arafat should tell the Palestinians clearly that the armed Intifada must stop."
The demonstration had proceeded for approximately four kilometers with relative calm, with only limited incidents such as breaking glass, windows at a police station, according to concurring sources.
The summit coincides with the introduction of the first "Euro" coins for circulation.
The "Euro" will not be circulated at the popular level, until the first of January 2002, but the initial sets are being sold in all the "Euro" zone states, totaling 12 states,  to help the public get ready for the dawn of a new currency era.
I am a Lebanese citizen, entitled at least to pose the following questions:
The tragedy of the quarries is spread over the slopes of our mountains, which have become like hanging deserts, instead of being green paradises that restore to Lebanon to its green history and the glory of its forests, which shoes timber lofty edifices, temples and palaces.
Who is the one who is to penetrate these destructive environmental deals that fill the pockets of the few to lead the majority into sickness and slow suffocation?
At the top of these taboos is the exploded land that throws on us the dust of stone.
In addition to the existence of Beirut's temporary-permanent slaughterhouse, and its non-adoption of international environmental standards.
Al Asmar added, "all these factors contributed to the existence of a region that is environmentally polluted to the maximum limits.
The participants concluded with laying down transitional solutions that are based on organizing work in the garbage plants, raising the level of chimneys, and organizing work in the slaughterhouse and the markets within sound environmental and health criteria, which guarantee for the port, its workers and all the people of the region, their safety and ability for production."
"Scientific study, with environmental and economic benefits, whose implementation will provide a comprehensive solution for the problem of olive jift and zibar waters that afflict Lebanon annually, and will lead to adding its name in the list of countries that present advanced research."
President of the Independent Enterprises and Private and Public Institutions Union Bshara Al Asmar confirmed, as president of the union of the Beirut port employees and workers, "The north-eastern suburb of Beirut city has witnessing severe suffering for over 20 years on the environmental level, symbolized by chronic garbage disposal which has turned into invincible mountains in the region.
Each student also planted a sapling that was given a special name.
The "Lebanese Coalition for Protecting the Environment", which consists of several environmental associations, including the "Environment Council" in Akkar and the "Environment Supporters" in Al Dhaniyyeh", issued a statement in which it declared that deforesting Cedar trees in the Sheer As-Sanam region of Akkar has continued for more than a quarter of a century, and considered that the Coalition had previously warned that the "Akkar forests specifically, and the Al Dhaniyeeh in general, are subjected to the ugliest form of assaults in illegal haphazard construction, cutting, overgrazing, agriculture, stone quarries and sand quarries, and arsons ... And we have warned that the long-living Cedar tree is being sold in the markets of Tripoli for one hundred dollars.
Mousa had patronized a signing ceremony of the book "The Environment and Air Pollution" by Dr. Robert Hanna, at the Antonian Sisters School - Mar Tekla at Al Hazmiyyeh, in the presence of former deputy Mahmoud Ammar, a representative of the Army Commander  Colonel Joseph Ghneim, the chairman and members of the Hazmiyyeh municipality council, and a number of educational and social associations and friends of the writer.
Director of the Faculty of Education - Second Branch, Antoine Al Sayyah, declared that the Ministry of Agriculture provided the forest saplings, while the municipality provided the land intended for forestation, with trees, provided the Faculty provides the workforce.
That is how Professor Na'eim Oweini summarized the project, on the achievement of which he collaborates with his colleague Samir Mudawwar, a group of doctors from the Lebanese and Holy Spirit Universities and a number of students, and which is expected to find the final treatment for olive by-products, including olive peat and industrial water, instead of haphazardly discarding them in fields and rivers and causing severe damage to the underground water.
As a result of this ban, the presses started discarding the peat in nature, which led to the pollution of the soil, because the decomposition of the olive peat chemically needs at least 3 or 4 years, while the industrial waters leaked into the underground water and polluted drinking water.
Because olive oil is a source of animal fat in fodder, it constitutes an alternative to corn and soy.
The complete study of the project requires four years, according to what Oweini said. "We are about to finish the work for the first year, which was preparatory, and the work was divided between four groups, each working on gathering available information in French and American data banks on the best ways for solving this problem.
On a question dealing with the laboratories or special centers, with which cooperations are going on to make the project successful, he referred to the continued cooperation with Canadian, Italian, Spanish, French and Japanese centers and organization, and with the "Center for Development and International Research in Egypt", which is currently supporting studies of projects to transform peat in Jordan, Tunisia, and Morocco.
"We are all responsible," Your Excellency, the President.
Your responsibility, on the contrary, is to tend to accountability.
So who is responsible in the Lebanese State, and where is he?
Enter Lebanon's merriment."
And he tells the third, who did not trade with the one weight, but went and buried it in the ground, "What a bad and lazy citizen you are.
The support he received from Russia, the European allies and China in his military campaign against Afghanistan was not enough to take into consideration his partners' reservations in the campaign on terrorism and go back on his intention to withdraw from the treaty, in which Moscow, Beijing and western European States see the cornerstone of strategic stability in the world.
The European allies were not successful, nor were Russia or China, in changing Bush's determination to withdraw from the treaty before finding an alternative to it that guarantees the strategic stability, creates an international balance, and prevents the launch of a new arms race that will exhaust the budgets of these states.
And the borders of the former Soviet republics are open to American soldiers.
In reality, Bush's goal is to entrench a world order where America is comfortable with regard to its interests, without taking other people' interests into consideration, even if they were the closest of allies or new friends whom America wants to include to a larger extent in her care, like what happened with Russia for example. It is the one now taking positions that are stricter towards the Palestinians than Britain's positions, which is the closest ally of the United States.
That is why the disposal of the ABM was necessary, so that the Russian nuclear power, the source of the only threat to the United States, can be neutralized.
As for claiming that they constitute a danger in the future on America's internal security, that is necessary media exaggeration to justify the United State's work in spreading missile shields that will designate it the only military power in the world.
As for after the September 11th attacks, the voices of opposition grew fainter or were completely silenced after the American President was successful in making the issue of fighting terrorism a priority that controls the interests of the Americans and the Europeans, and is aided by Russia and China.
It seems that the recent events and developments in Afghanistan have not weakened the great majority of non-complaisant supporters of the Taliban and "Al Qaeda". These are exerting tremendous efforts to incapacitate their shock in them. The matter did not stop at merely wagering on their victory, the ceiling was raised to the level of toying with the "ABC" of military sciences and reasonable calculations. And so the analyses and expectations arose, speaking of tactical withdrawals that will be followed by a war of gangs that will turn Afghanistan into a quagmire for Americans. Some even were not stopped or deterred from promoting America's dimwittedness about the "ladenite" nuclear abilities.
Russian viewers stand in line every day at the "Gallery-Moscow" pavilions to look on twelve paintings designed by two famous artists, who selected a main theme for them entitled: Vladimir Putin in his Vacillating Moods.
President Putin believes that the year 2002 represents the pinnacle of his political, security and economic victories, considering that he achieved what he aimed to achieve through the American military machine and the interference of its NATO allies.
They are formations that play the role of mediator - or so it should be - between the people and the State.
David Apter considers that the presence of political parties is the result of the need for a political institution built in an organized fashion so that it can bring together social groups and their various interests to attain a sublime end.

David Apter considers that the presence of political parties is the result of the need for a political institution built in an organized fashion so that it can bring together the social groups and their various interests to attain a sublime end.
Political parties, in this regard, play the role of mediator between the citizen and the State.
3. The modernity theory: It gives little attention to the political aspect and much attention to the social and economic aspects in society.
Parties, in his opinion, are the organized political structures that can deal with the various classes and groups and their needs.
In terms of the existence of political parties, Lebanon as a developing country is considered to be a multi-party system.
But thanks to the civil war, some of these parties entered the Lebanese parliament with a strength that does not reflect their size at the popular level, but as the militia of the status quo.
That is why political parties have proved a clear incapacity to attract supporters or play a significant role in the political arena, except for a minority of sectarian parties.
Here, the law did not distinguish between the party as a political forum with its institutions and branches, and the association, which might also itself be one of the party tools.
The Director General of the Ministry of Finance, Dr. Alan Beefani, spoke yesterday about the tax on the added value to students at Hagazian University in Ras Beirut, describing it as "one of the intelligent taxes in the world", pointing out that the advantages of this tax are that "it is a general tax on consumption, not on savings, and does not affect investment."
The circular said: "Before the Chairman asked the Secretary to read the Board of Directors' report, he acquainted the Assembly with the comments related to changing the company's name despite the widespread good reputation of the current company name "Lebanese Turabah Company", in particular that "Holsim" will be the new name for the Holderbank Group to which our company belongs.
Whereupon, the Chairman declared that he is at the disposal of the shareholders who would like to comment on the comments given and the report distributed to them.
The Chairman answered that the change is free (...).
And if we read the résumés of the directors, whose terms have expired, they are much grander than the résumés of those recently appointed.
He hoped "that the eligibility of the newly-appointed appears in the duties assigned to them."
It would have been possible to hear of more competent names present in Lebanon, such as the banking and university sectors."
The same applies to "Ideal", if feasible projects were studied or implemented.
Fleihan: Shopping Month to Promote Image of Lebanon Friendly Tourist Reception for Arab Visitors at Airport Lecture by Qerem on Economic Future Iyanian Repeats: Value Added Postponed Until the Year 2004
Arrivals through Beirut Airport recently noticed a group of young women representing the Ministry of Tourism at the Ministry's information office, receiving arrivals and welcoming them, and offering them Lebanese sweets and nuts, in addition to special brochures and booklets on tourist sites in Lebanon.
He said: "We demand the implementation of the value added tax in the year 2004 so that the implementation coincides with its implementation in Syria, with whom we have wide-ranging economic and trade relations, in order to avoid smuggling. We also demand simultaneous implementation with the Arab countries, but Lebanon should be the last to implement it in view of its bad economic and trade situation."

Is the Problem in the Director of Social Security or is it somewhere else?
The underling factor for posing this question today, following the Council of Ministers' failure to reach mutual agreement on a candidate, is attributable to the reason that stands behind this failure and goes beyond the dimensions of "allotment" in the basket of appointments to present the future of the Fund and the role anticipated for it during the next phase in the light of the current reform pursuits in its direction.

Company organizes the first Hospitality and Food Services Exhibition in the Region - "Horeca 2002" at the new exhibitions center "Pial" - in Beirut's commercial center, next April 9-13.
However, in the new exhibition, they will be able to benefit from two exhibitions held at the same time, each focusing on different needs."
More specifically, this objective targets supermarkets and independent food and drink outlets, as well as independent food suppliers and organizations.
It is to be pointed out that this year the exhibition attracted around 230 exhibitors from nine countries, representing more than 700 trademarks, in addition to 13,500 specialists in the hospitality, food and drink industry.
University President Dr. Jean Khanijian, a number of professors and a crowd of students attended.
He then touched on the draft, which was adopted by Parliament this month and will become valid on February 1st, 2002.
We aim to improve revenues to guarantee their good distribution."
It stressed the necessity of forming a committee to assess the necessary compensation due to unloading contractors and owners of machinery "in order to avoid the previous error that occurred with the Dubai Ports Authorities."
Also, the statement indicated that the Association had been notified of Decision No. 53, dated 11/15/2001, issued by the Council of Ministers, calling for the abolishment of the Joint Marine Operations Chamber (Oscar Charlie), now that the security situation has stabilized, so that all ports come under the supervision of the State, provided the implementation of the decision starts immediately after its publication.
The statement said that the Association circulated the final version of the Settlement of Taxpayers Affairs Law and the Value Added Tax Law among the members.
The statement of the Ministry said "the total treasury payments (budget and other treasury operations) as of the end of November for the year 2001 amounted to 8032 billion compared with the amount 9020 for the same period last year, a decrease in the amount of payments by 988 billion, while the amount of the total treasury revenues as of this November totaled 4125 billion, compared with 4380 billion for the same period last year, a decrease in the total revenues totaling 255 billion from the total in the same period last year. Based on that, the total deficit for this period in the current year totaled 3907 billion, which equals a deficit percentage of 48.64 compared with the total deficit for the same period last year, which was 46,390, or 51.44 percent. With that the achieved deficit for this period of this year has decreased by 732 billion compared with the volume of deficit for the same period last year. It must be pointed out that the total initial surplus achieved during this period of the current year totaled 43 billion, in comparison to an initial total deficit of 746 in the same period of last year, an improvement of 789 billion.
On the other hand, the total decrease in revenues in the first eleven months of this year compared with the parallel period of last year totaled 87 billion, while the decrease in customs revenues in the same period totaled approximately 185 billion liras, which means some improvement in the total of tax and non-tax revenues during the first eleven months of this year by approximately 98 billion liras compared with the same period last year.
The discrepancy was clearly evident between the volume of "Hizbollah's" celebrations of "Jerusalem Day", and its sound, language, and messages, and the position of the Lebanese state: the official Lebanon asking for "protection" and seeking to Lebanonize "Hizbollah" to protect it and to protect all of Lebanon.
Enough to allow us to ask about the wisdom in continuing the strange coexistence between the reasoning of the state and the reasoning of the revolution in Lebanon even if some of its lands are still under occupation.
But what we witnessed yesterday was more than a message to America, to Israel and to some Arabs.
But we in return cannot but disagree with its reading of its role and duty, especially when all of Lebanon is concerned with the results of this role and duty and their repercussions on it, in all of its elements, areas and groups.
There remains a core question that needs explanation: Does "Hizbollah" want to contribute to the massacre of Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian Authority?
The visit of Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs William Burns to Beirut, as part of a tour in the region that included a number of Arab countries, paves the way for dialogue and communications with American diplomacy coming straight from Washington, away from slogans and public positions that have governed the positions of both American and Lebanese capitols until now.
Being careful to refrain from going into details in this matter and handling matters with calm and reasonable dialogue is the card that Washington prefers to play at this stage, which it seems to be doing now.
Concerned diplomats say they are not trying to impose anything on the governments of the concerned countries, but are seeking to reach a mutual ground with them to work together regarding this subject, including resolution 1373, which they consider aims at offering technical support to governments to explain methods of dealing with terrorism at the international level, which focuses on halting the funding of terrorism, while others went far in explaining this resolution.
- The United States realizes the difficulty of obtaining positive results immediately.
While Washington does not deny it is focusing on Arafat and the Palestinians in particular to expand the margin of going back to before the last Intifada 15 months ago, it says it admits the responsibility of both sides, the Palestinian and the Israeli, for the deterioration of the situation and holds both sides responsible for the duties that lie on them to end the violence, despite that the reality of the matter, according to American statements that take on a specific echo in the Arab countries, only shows the side of pressure on Palestinians as opposed to Israel.
Those who watched the video aired by the American Defense Department that said it convicts bin Laden in the September 11th attacks, noticed they are faced with a group of people whose culture and the culture of those they represent is dominated by visions and dreams.
And two present people but not seen in the picture tell in the their voices of a similar dream.
Here comes the series "Hajj Mitwalli Family".
What situation is this, and what do we hope to achieve through it?
Arab and Islamic peoples were surprised by the media and political campaigns directed against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from the American administration and the political and media circles in Washington.
The Arab and Islamic peoples were surprised with the improvement, however slow, which prevailed over the relations between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran since the latter's establishment in 1979 and its first fierce war following the occupation of the American Embassy in Tehran and the imprisonment of its workers for a long time, due to the violent war waged by the Americans on Iran in all international gatherings, to which the Iranians replied with a similar war in various methods and arenas.
Because senior officials in the former always noticed Saudi silence as well as deficient responsiveness when they discussed with their Saudi colleagues the backgrounds of what happened and its motives and identity, or the identities of its undertakers.
One of the factors that increased the said flaw in the relations is that the American media began pointing accusatory fingers at Saudi Arabia.
And of them as well Riyadh's need for Washington to stand firm in the face of internal fundamental challenges that seem to have moved lately from words into action when it tried, unsuccessfully, to assassinate a senior official persona in the Kingdom, and when this attempt was repeated without success as well.
These issues, though complicated, are solvable.

At the height of the French mandate, the High Commissioner did not dare to treat us like the American Ambassador, or to direct at us what Condoleezza Rice directs at us, for example.

And where were its values, traditions and live conscience for almost twenty years?

If his latest book "Let Meryl Streep Suit Herself" has not been translated yet, five books so far have been translated into several languages, including English, French and Spanish.
Her carefully-studied characters are the product of a reality charged with contradictions, and no example of it is absent from the novel.
How should one walk in the parade of connected word groups in the human's funeral, embracing one voice in a mourning throat, and forget about the universe behind the words, and the exciting relationship between the essence of life and what is behind it, between the exposed and the hidden?
She calls death ashes so that the tone of mourning does not go higher: "May death carry me and drown me so that it liberates me from the homeland of shadow, and with the blink of a wing I leave."
As for the scientific books written by her and the articles she published, they did stand between her and poetry, that language with which she corresponds with her heart branded with pain, and those verses she aligns as an army to fight the memories and the silence of the coffins,

Confessions of a Poet in Abdullah's Cell [II]

I told you before I am the president of "my pain" committee in my village!
I am stronger than them.
God on your mighty mountain! Shows me all of the land of the people
Oscar Wilde's imprisonment made London ashamed of itself.
Is there something from you in the face of her children?
She alone is our daring cat.
Your silence, sir, tires me.
I forgot, oh Abdullah, what I said in my first confession.
She was absent, and paths have not been absent from me
The doors - firewood - I fear that my children will be cold.
Love threshing floor.
My injured shoes await me at the gate of the prison underneath!
I am shy of you!
Violin Prince made the homeland of shadow - her homeland - the obsession of her pen for thirty years, as if she were from there, where she thinks, concludes and evaluates, not liberated from it despite her challenges and revolution to leave its destructive fields, its high towers that are higher than marble and the death of time engraved in it.
so that it liberates me from the homeland of the shadow
Science calls to her, and her specialization got her to become an information technology professor at Paris' universities and a doctorate degree holder in social psychology.
And now I draw with different colors
The poet is standing at a window overlooking nothingness, burning, topped with flames, wilting ashes on the ground, and from its flames a universal glow soaring in the Icarian legend, as if it were made of wax dough, that survived from the prison of life to rise with two fragile wings towards the actual melting in the wide range.
We are acquainted with the gravity of the human and his seriousness in pain, in the revolution, in the meaning of life and its frivolousness, and we discover especially how it is the ally of time when she speaks in the voice of the past, and within herself a betrayal of the following crisis:
She is a witness, not bowing or surrendering, for her message that she preferred to write in poetry is a sublimation act for defeat, for emptiness, for the harsh smile in destiny.
Her expressions do not fall on the paper like dead leaves, like melted things.
And where Violin's word descends there is an idea, and a prescription and a betrayal, a complaint that roars in the conscience with its immature ringing that has a soft, compassionate, and pained marrow.
Suddenly we perceive an expansion launched from this nucleus to include an entire world that becomes silent in the palm of her hand as she counts time "this time that loans souls."

No one whispers in my pain / the land is crazy (...)."

In its streets horse carriages, in its squares the faces of love.
It is a lean-bodied island in this metal existence.
His last day in the German city of Strahlen, cold breezes, a sky that promises rain, on the branches of a pear tree behind the window a large black bird pecking the fruit, he wishes it were like him, no memory to torment him and no tomorrow to worry him, but the time, ah the church clock announces the time.
She left the exceptional to the other characters of the novel. Hence, each one of them emerges as a model set apart by war or peace, or both alternately, clear in characteristics and familiar in our surroundings and observations.
They are all here, their behaviors pointing towards them and their dialogues betraying their allegiances or their mindlessness, which the novelist captured and distributed to guide us to the stage in which they were found in the nineties and to the occasion.
All resemble Don Quixote, struggling with the dust and changing not a matter of fact.
Cousin Hisham has benefited from the war to become rich and more perfect in peace with political leaderships.
Our youth are the youth of talk in her novel. They struggle by hurling accusations against the other in order to feel that they do exist. Perhaps they feel that the only existence is to be fortified behind viewpoints which time will bypass, but they try to prove that they are right in justifying the correctness of what the party to which they belong has done during the war.

Ramadan is Historic and Serious on "Al-Manar's" Screen
The superior performance, be it in the scenography or the acting, was convincing. Perhaps, the matter is linked to the development of the Iranian dramatic art, where interest in details and particulars is not less important that interest in the main dramatic plot, which is what we notice in all the episodes of the series, even in selecting the Iranian actors with Arabic facial features that are the same, to a certain degree, as those of the actual characters.

He considered that "the United States' mad zealousness against resistance groups such as (the Islamic resistance movements) Hamas and Islamic Jihad and Hizbollah and the accusation of terrorism directed against them is a result of the determination of these groups to act against violations by the Zionist regime."
*In Madrid, Spain's Foreign Minister Josep Pique, whose country currently holds the European Union's rotating presidency, stated on Wednesday night that the European Union "would work away from of President Bush's declarations which we respect and take into consideration [...] but the European Union will work normally with Iran and will make decisions it regards as appropriate [...] we will do this in an atmosphere of friendship and close alliance with the United States but at the same time taking into consideration our own approaches concerning the European Union's common foreign policy."

Al-Shar' on Ben Aliazar's offer: ploy to pressure Palestinians Nahlawi
During his meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Israel's Defense Minister Benyamin Ben Aliazar had expressed his government's readiness to resume negotiations with Syria immediately and without pre-conditions but linked this to an end to Syria's support for Hizbollah.
Commenting on Israel's demand for Syrian support for Hizbollah to end, he repeated his country's refusal to end resistance to Israel in view of the continued occupation and said "it is not acceptable for resistance to be called off while the occupation continues."
He pointed out that Israeli-Arab peace negotiations, launched in Madrid in 1991, were "based on the precepts of international law and the principle of land for peace and Israel must abide by these precepts if it is serious in its intention to resume negotiations."
New Delhi responded to Pakistan's accusations of its support for his kidnapping as "silly."
Treasury Assistant Secretary Kenneth Dam who is to visit Islamabad next week will urge the Pakistani government to secure the journalist's quick release.
It hinted at a "real war on Americans" who "will taste the flavor of the death and destruction we have been exposed to" in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
The journalist's French wife Marianne told American television network CNN in Karachi that she had not lost hope.
This is highly regrettable."
The American president appeared to be sending a launch signal from Congress for the second phase of the American war against terrorism and its new aims after Afghanistan while the Lebanese assembly appeared to be taking on a task that the government dares not carry out in case it loses its last raison d'etre, in other words to prepare public opinion and ready it for further severe crises.
The urgent session held yesterday morning, to allow the council of ministers to make decisions to lower some custom taxes and cancel others in order to lighten the burden of value added tax which comes into effect today, might be the last example of the remedy applied by an edgy leadership trying to eliminate the consequences hours before they occur.
For on the same day and at the same time that the president expressed his certainty that Lebanon faces no external threats, with the priority being to fight "the mentality of corruption," and criticized "over 90% of politicians," the president of the United States placed Hizbollah on the axis of his war objectives; so what does it all mean?
The only truth is that internal battles still erupt to order however many slogans are chanted and so it is of no importance who remains as the saving hero and who volunteers for the role of victim.
But here we are faced with the kind of joviality that can launch droves of giant missiles to wipe out tens of thousands of "evildoers," from the southern Philippine archipelago to northern Iran via Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and, of course, Afghanistan!
Whatever the case, the scene could only bring to mind Saddam Hussein, George Bush's archenemy, entering the council of ministers or making a speech to his people, and all the American sight needed was an exchange of civilian clothes for a military uniform, not least because the ideas sprinkled about are more in keeping with such a uniform.
Talking about the presence of tens of thousands of terrorists trained in Afghanistan, who Bush said were "time bombs ready to go off without warning," and about "international underground terrorism" by organizations such as Hamas, Jihad, Hizbollah and Mohamed's Army, can only place this region in the position of a decisive and axial confrontation with America.
Maarif held a long interview with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, excerpts of which were published yesterday with the entire text to be published in today's edition.
And with this, he is prepared to consider him a partner in negotiations if he complies with all the measures demanded by Israel.
It did not reveal the identity of this party but since Habiqa had previously announced his intention to testify in the case against Sharon, this makes Israel the prime suspect.
It indicated that politicians in Israel are concentrating their efforts on international support against the three-pronged threat posed by Iran in the form of its call for Israel's destruction, its support for Palestinian and Lebanese terrorism and its attempts to acquire a nuclear arsenal and long-range missiles.
News concerning the discovery of a plot to attack a nuclear installation America accuses Iran of sending "terrorists" to Bakaa
He added: "I hope these countries make the right choice and I believe that some of them have chosen to follow the right path," in all probability a reference to Pakistan which is now a nuclear power.
In his State of the Union address to Congress on Wednesday, Bush had described Iraq, Iran and North Korea as the "axis of evil" which harbors terrorism and tries to acquire weapons of mass destruction.
He said the warning Bush sent Iran on Wednesday "is without ambiguity."
He did not want to reply to a question about an "imminent" military operation against Iran.
The head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Robert Muller said he believed there were "sleeper cells" awaiting orders to carry out the attack and that the United States was at a high level of alert.

It was a strange sound.
What was this unique sound?
But an informed source confirmed that this vocal phenomenon was somewhat more complicated.
We asked the informed source.
We stopped the interview at that point.
The new invention is not just a huge development in the notion of visual democracy because, over and above its political advantages of which the Arab interior ministers are aware, it has economic features which take the edge off the market area which all Arab countries are moving toward.
On contacting him by telephone to check on his health after the bout of laughter he was afflicted with, he said the chuckling started during the Arab meeting when a member of the host delegation began to explain the third section of the experiment to the honored guests.
Sami Qasir
In the end, lowering customs tariffs on certain goods was killing two birds with one stone: on one hand, the reduction is an attempt to absorb dissatisfaction about other price increases which primarily concern gas and various goods and, on the other hand, it represents a social-political approach aimed at giving the government a measure of support to allow it to get through the experiment of a new tax with a reasonable political cover.
They said that the Minister for Tourism Karm Karm objected to lowering the tax on tobacco and asked for it to be increased to discourage it.
As for the chamber of representatives, the tone of the discussion today, on the fourth day of the budget sitting, was no different from other days in terms of the merging of economic and financial matters with political matters, a feature of most of the interjections which in practice turned the session into a general discussion on government policy.
As for president al-Husseini, he criticized the lack of implementation of the Taif accords and the constitution in which "there is no text empowering the head of the legislative authority or the head of the executive authority or the head of state to reduce the number of institutions."
The closed meeting, chaired by president-elect Karim Baqradouni and attended by members of the party, is dedicated to the party's planning situation focused on examining the "new role of the Phalangists with the purpose of establishing a new structure suited to this role, in addition to exploring the best methods for reviving Phalange presence throughout Lebanon and abroad."
The session was opened by the head of the American sector Joseph al-Haj from Miami (Florida) who he stressed "the need for a complete mobilization of expatriate Phalangists to help the mother nation overcome its current crisis in every way, whether through diplomatic contacts abroad or through social aid."
After this, three papers presented by the sector's secretariat were examined, the first concerning the Lebanese presence in the United States and relations between Lebanese groups as a whole, on the one hand, and between the Lebanese and the American administration and institutions on the other.
The closed meeting will issue recommendations to be announced at a dinner in one of Detroit's hotels.
They said the warning is a new one and amounts to threatening those countries, including Lebanon, though he did not name it, because Bush's new slogan, after his slogan of "whoever isn't with us is against us" after September 11, directed at weak governments who harbor terrorism, is "if they don't act then America will."
They pointed out that the Americans, at the administration level and through their representatives and senators who visited Lebanon, acknowledged that the security authorities had proven their seriousness in fighting terrorism in remote areas but insisted on the need to put a stop to Hizbollah's armed wing and a number of those accused of carrying out assassinations on Americans and of exploding the embassy buildings in Ayn al-Marissa and Awker.
But the danger is that the American position is now like the Israeli position because it has engaged in the issues of Hizbollah and the Hamas and Islamic Jihad Movements and there is fear that Bush's speech conceals military plans to be implemented against countries regarded as harboring terrorists or allowing their training without arresting them or putting them on trial. America would then take on this role thus breaching the Security Council's anti-terrorism resolution number 1373 and breaching the solutions put forward by United Nations member countries on how to fight terrorism.
They said that Bush's speech contained paragraphs and expressions reminiscent of press releases by his National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice who leads the fundamentalist branch of the administration and does not heed State Department moderation.
In its exceptional meeting yesterday, the cabinet of ministers strove to remove the last of the legal obstacles to applying the law on value added tax today by issuing the remaining implementation procedures taking into account the council of state's observations

Reno and the accompanying delegation had previously visited the district commissioner for Jazeen and examined requirements there.
Increased security measures prevent youth march from reaching American embassy in protest against Israeli practices against Palestinians "the police are more than us"
Amidst all this, Awker was placed under a security blockade which closed off all roads leading to it and rerouted traffic to other roads, causing a bottleneck, with a security presence along all routes leading to Awker.
In the face of this heavy security, demonstrators shouted "move, move soldiers, we want to go to Awker" and "we have come to say what we think and the police are more than us."
This is what is civilized.
Ali Murad of the Communist Students read out the demonstrators' manifesto in which he said: "Israel kills and destroys, blockades and cuts off Palestine and Jerusalem and no one objects or calls it to account.
We support the Palestinian issue, an Arab Palestinian State, Jerusalem, Gaza, the Golan and an Arab Lebanese State.
At a quarter to four, the march died down and the demonstrators left quietly.
In the minds of many and in the media, Arab and foreign, the Palestinian Intifada has almost turned into a question of numbers.
What is the outcome?
Material losses are in the billions of dollars.
All its acts are terrible, and the most terrible is this group punishment imposed on three million Palestinians in the Bank and Strip in the form of checkpoints which close off the points of entry to all towns and villages.

Is your culture so devoid of people?"
The important thing is that documents, references and archives are generally available."
Then our group memory will be taken up with propaganda and become a mere museum image.
The recent book entitled "Landmarks in Lebanon's Memory" published by the National Archives Institute could have been a serious start to an official task concerned with gathering the group memory and preserving it but the issue is not as simple as that.
In our role as Lebanon's administrative and official archive, it is not reasonable to store our heritage without having separate and (sanitary) buildings to preserve the artifacts, in addition to people who want to make use of them such as researchers."
This does not mean it was stolen but everyone who has written about it has taken their archives with them." The institute is now in negotiations to recover copies of these archives from France, Austria, Turkey, Britain and Egypt.
He explained that the Institute would not take possession of any of these artifacts and that they will remain with their owners; all that will happen is that a record of them will be made at the Archives Institute.
Some of these departments are currently resorting to the Archives Institute to complete their missing files.
For those who know how to look, Israel has had the characteristics of a world power for a long time.
He met President Salim al-Hus who had previously called for the necessity of a return to the people to shake off the political, economic and social crises the country is embroiled in. He was supported by President Omar Karami through a democratic "troika" consisting of three leaders calling for new electoral laws. Al-Husseini said its objective must be "to strengthen national unity and consolidate living together" after the flawed electoral laws which emerged from Taif (1989).
In spite of this, the half-brother of King Fahed, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's monarch, believes that if the kingdom wants to be part of the modern world, it will have to gradually implement changes and advances on a political level before it can achieve this.
Hong Kong researches Lebanese market: Cooperation possible through fairs and film-making to make up for huge deficit in trade budget
This was the image presented in Beirut by Tzak F. Ang, the Middle East area manager for the Hong Kong Trade Center, and marketing director, Lebanese-born Ali Faqha, on a three-day visit aimed at a close study of the Lebanese market and its growth over the past few years and to survey  areas of cooperation in the "near future."
In spite of the efforts made by Lebanese exporters, who have been active on an individual level, the number of Lebanese exports to Hong Kong rose to 7 million dollars in 2001 versus 62 million worth of imports (61 million through re-exports), bringing the volume of exchange to 69 million dollars.
As the exploratory visit did not define the exchange channels guaranteeing outlets for Lebanese sectors in Hong Kong, the Center's Middle East area manager believes it is important to continue exchanging ideas and looking into methods of cooperation to lay out the means to break into the Hong Kong market "which the Lebanese hope will guarantee them outlets in other markets, even if they are in the Arabian Gulf region."
With these words, the Center's Middle East area manager ended his first visit to Beirut. He told the press delegation he met at the Le Meridian-Commodore Hotel yesterday that he hoped to come back again "when the opportunity arises" because of the Center's increased volume of trade in the Arab countries, in keeping with its basic mission of easing trade cooperation between Hong Kong companies and their world trade partners.

Bashara said that there are raw materials used in bread making which are not exempt from value added tax such as electricity, oils, maintenance and that these make up 45% of costs and bakery owners can not afford them. This led to a review by the Ministry of Finance which corrected the matter within 15 days.
These complaints concerned the non-issuing of all implementation procedures, on the one hand, in order to make it possible to understand the mechanism of application, and applicants not receiving their application certificates to allow them to start implementation, on the other.
We think we can write anything these days.
Speculating on whether we can now write about everything with an erotic theme is cause for laughter.
More explicit, without a doubt, is the devotee of literary rarities and lover of boys who can find the full works of Tony Duvert in any good bookshop, that writer who reveals his love of boys over the age of six years and is published by a publisher who does not keep any secrets at all.

The "anguish" of Safa' Dhiab, the illusions of exile and its defeats
In this collection, the poet at times adopts a strange style of writing because he resorts in some verses to expanding the image in a footnote, which in turn becomes a poem, with the upper and lower verses either merging into one, or to be read separately without one affecting the other.
These are towns erased from my memory, extinct in the morning, glowing brightly at night among red expanses laid bare between the gardens of our planet, towns that have rejected the gift of dawn."
Safa' Dhiab is haunted by emptiness and mirrors are a metaphor for the emptiness of a time and place that are bottomless with only the illusion of an inner space and the illusion of a surface.
At times, he leaves it, other times it flees him and disperses far away from him.
Or Safa' Dhiab writes like one who "brings down scattered appeals on rainy days."
The exhibition brings to a close a series of events in several parts of France to commemorate the centenary of the artist's death (1864-1901).

Palestinian officer sentenced to prison for killing fellow citizen in political dispute
The court justified the ruling to reduce the defendant's sentence "as the result of the absence of a private case and the lack of security at Ayn Hilwa Camp and difficulty in controlling it" in accordance with the findings of the ruling which showed that the case was transferred from the Criminal Court in the south to one of the Criminal courtrooms in Beirut in order to safeguard public safety, follow correct trial procedures and preserve security.
He was then transferred from Armed Resistance to Fatah movement's central sector where served in Burj Alshimali, Jouya and Albazouria in 1981. After this he was transferred to the Yarmouk Forces in Alaishia where he stayed until 1983 when clashes took place between Abu Ammar's Fatah movement and Abu Moussa's Intifada Fatah movement, which he then joined.
The ruling added: "After he left prison, he fled to the Ayn Hilwa Camp and joined Abu Ammar's Fatah movement where he was put under army official there Muneer al-Mukaddam. He rose through the ranks until he reached the position of lieutenant in the Fatah movement hierarchy.
After the Oslo accords, the group was dissolved and the defendant went back to serving in the Fatah movement.

During this time, Simon Dinya left the house and headed home where he swallowed a number of sleeping pills intending to kill himself. He started to have a fit which caused his brother to take him to Sayidet Lebanon Hospital in Joneh where he was resuscitated and placed under guard.

The society's vice president Mohamed Mattar said the basis of "fighting corruption is to have responsibility and accountability, a fundamental matter that public institutions must adhere to."
This justifies the need for detailed provisions in the basic codes for the liberal professions, companies and all administrations."
He regretted that lawyers had not been concerned with the matter because in many instances, company codes are not sufficient to guarantee the highest level of democracy, transparency and accountability.
We wanted to point out that it is not only the public sector which is corrupt and lacking in transparency but also the private sector which means that all institutions in society must employ means to reinforce the prevention of corruption and ensure transparency. These means are ethical codes.
Adwan read out the charter: "The society operates to fight corruption in all its forms in various sectors and to reinforce the principles of transparency and accountability, establishing a state of law and respect of basic rights as defined by international standards and the Lebanese constitution. It strives to guide general work practices by all means and to galvanize civilian society to adopt the principles of impartiality and transparency [...] As for the core values, these are democracy, impartiality, courage, objectivity, transparency and accountability."

This is in keeping with the view of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who also thinks the recovery will not have great momentum.

Since midnight, the Italian lira, German mark, Swiss franc, Belgian franc, Spanish peseta, Greek drachma, Austria shilling, Portuguese escudo, Dutch florin, Finnish markka, Irish punt and Luxemburg franc have become no more than memorabilia which cannot be used to buy or sell in markets although central banks will continue to tender them for a number of years.
The treasurer of the Austrian Central Bank said at the Art History Museum in Vienna, where an exhibition on the shilling and its history has opened, "currency is not only a way to pay for goods.
But with the lira, these memories will be mixed."
In the opening speech to the assembled members at the European Parliament in Brussels, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, whose country is currently president of the European Union, said: "We need a new method of working to pave the way for new stages."
The president of the conference, former French president Valerie Giscard d'Estaing, called on representatives to put their disagreements aside in order to work on a shared vision of Europe.
He accused it of not wanting peace although "the whole world welcomed the proposal" of heir to the throne, first assistant to the president of the council of ministers and national guard commander, Prince Abdullah Ben Abdulazziz, in a recent intervention at a rare open session of the Security Council dedicated to the Middle East which lasted over six hours.
Instead of doing so, he has made a series of accusations against Israel." The Palestinian representative Marwan Jilani said al-Shanakshi's speech was important because it was the first official reference by a Saudi official to the initiative.
What was noticeable was that the Arab speakers, with the exception of the Moroccan representative Mohamed Benouna, alluded to the initiative but did not refer to it directly.
In Jerusalem, Israel's Foreign Minister Shimon Peres expressed his "disappointment" at al-Shabakshi's speech "but this does not mean the Saudi peace initiate is not important [...] Israel must encourage it in spite of the gaps in it."
He concluded that there were no "great disparities" between the Saudi initiative and the peace plan he agreed with the president of the Palestinian legislative council Ahmed Qrai (Abu Ala').
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi welcomed it and former American president Jimmy Carter regarded it as the sole force available at present to strengthen peace.

He greatly welcomed it."
As for increasing the number of French forces which consists of around 520 men, this is open to examination."
Karzai stressed that "the presence of an international force in Afghanistan was necessary to root out terrorism and in order to topple the pro-terrorist Taliban regime and prevent external interference.
Chirac and Karzai opened an exhibition yesterday entitled "One Thousand Years of Afghan Art" at the Gemey Museum and donated eight ancient Afghan pieces from the Bagram collection saved from Kabul Museum which was destroyed by supporters of the Taliban movement.
He said: "The White House rulers are suffering from delusions of power and dream of outright hegemony over the world. This is why they invent enemies all over the place."

This is because the demonstration, which according to estimates included between 5 and 7 thousand people, very much reflected the degree of popular resentment in reaction to the economic and social crisis, on the one hand, and the "mutiny" of the worker base against the leadership, on the other. Worker opposition in the street and their leadership's submissive position to the government may have started something which could have further repercussions on the split in the General Workers' Union, following the agreement between its leadership and the government on travel allowances and teaching grants.
As expected, full endorsement of the government-worker agreement at the council of ministers' session did not happen because economic groups suspended the retail quorum within the social security directorate. Only the travel allowance increase from two thousand lira to six thousand lira was approved, while the decision to increase the school grant to one and a half million lira was postponed for 15 days for ratification by the social security directorate and submission to the council of ministers.
Ministerial sources concurred that the council of ministers did not bring up political matters and confined the discussion to the working agenda.
He told journalists that the sum of six thousand lira as a travel allowance is paid in some public organizations and that the funds to be paid by other organizations would not be a burden on the Treasury because they are not large sums of money.

We also covered important national matters, especially Syrian-Lebanese relations and the question of the south, sovereignty and independence, in addition to the economic and social situation and its essentially political roots, as well as the article published in a Lebanese newspaper which concerned the need to reconsider the political equation in light of Taif.
Another topic covered in the discussion was the issue of the nationality law which gave 400 thousand people nationality, the vast majority of whom live abroad and only come to Lebanon during the elections.

I hope this will happen in collaboration with all loyal and noble persons who want to work toward ridding our borough of family intervention and internal disputes which contribute nothing to the greater good."
We hope president al-Hariri's optimism as "Paris-2" approaches is justified and that French president Chirac's promises are not misplaced!
The worst of the worst would be for the Arab Summit, on which so much of Lebanon's hopes hang, to be a duplicate of summits which failed to save the Palestinians and end Israeli depravity, merely coming up with denouncements and condemnations.
* An official with the National Social Security Fund replied that guest houses that are the subject of a complaint come under social security law if its workers have contracts and after their legal and actual status is examined, in other words the law does not apply to a son who works for his father, a wife who works for her husband and so on.
They asked officials to deal with the problem for the sake of their health and to put an end to their need to take sleeping pills.
The source of astonishment is that the ones removing the obstacles in al-Hariri's path are the very ones who put them in his path.
The report then said in reference to the keyword, in other words confidence, "there is increasing emphasis in many countries on the need to bring about improvements in the areas of transparency and good management and this route could be usefully adopted in Lebanon's case given its positive effect on confidence."
However, we believe that a state for all its citizens where the rule of law applies is able to provide guarantees in its legal system, which allow the citizen victim to resort to a fair judicial system for misconduct and obtain compensation for damages.
Thirdly, we will cover the legal basis for such a compensation claim.
Experience also shows that it is not clear to whom these authorities are answerable, from an administrative point of view.
All that can be concluded is the existence of an opinion of the general assembly of the Advisory Board for Legal Opinions and legislation at the state council under number 654 dated 1997.
Al-Shouweiri said to this end: "To start with, I want to express my satisfaction at the meeting with Doctor Yusif and Mr Hamoud. We discussed the issues which have arisen as a result of the bill approved by the council of ministers and judge to cancel exclusivity protection for agencies; I am also very happy about the discussion concerning the professional schism, a discussion which was characterized by a very positive and perceptive understanding of the subject because any proposed bill always has many positive aspects as well as some negative aspects.
Firstly, with regard to the sectarian or religious tone the dispute about the matter of canceling agency protection has taken, I am in no way involved in this and I deplore it, and this is also how some have described a law which is essentially being brought in to serve the Lebanese economy.
Fundamentally and basically,

It will bring in a comprehensive and gradual policy to reduce dependence on income from profits by offering new products and services in the area of private banking, investment and insurance operations to increase the bank's revenues other than profits.

It has also seen large numbers of Arab tourists visiting in comparison with previous periods, an increase of 13%, with hotels in Beirut and in skiing and mountain areas reporting a remarkable rate of occupancy. We have also seen an increase in flights arriving at Beirut Airport from Arab countries which confirms our conviction on the need to focus very much on our Arab brothers and that the Arab states are the most natural and important market for Lebanese tourism."
He said that the increase in the number of tourists happened before September 11, pointing out that "as a result of the harassment Arabs in the West have been subjected to, Lebanon will no doubt attract a larger number of tourists."
He expected more tourists in 2002 and asked other ministries to cooperate with the Ministry of Tourism in implementing the tourist policy, protecting the environment with its mountains and coasts and preventing the resultant pollution.
The extended meeting the day before yesterday of the Economic and Social Council to examine the views of a number of experts in the field of social security was limited to asking the Social Security Department to provide the council with clear, cohesive statistics and figures to allow it to give a final view for the amendments to be made to the social security bill.
It is known that the workers' union is calling for an allocation system because this is to the advantage of the poor while the first system, that is capitalization, is not to the advantage of the rich but, according to social security sources, guarantees no problems will arise.
A number of individuals raised the issue of bringing in new social security categories such as agencies for the disabled, the blind and those with physical defects and Lebanese University lecturers not previously covered by social security.

Officers from the United States, France, Australia and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia visited Balbek-Alharmel to ensure that the campaign to destroy poppy plants was succeeding and to eliminate every last plant.

They were accompanied by the head of judicial police Brigadier General Samir Subh, the head of the Anti-Drugs Unit Colonel Michel Shakour, the commander of the judicial squad in Balbek Colonel Fawzi Badran, the head of army intelligence in Balbek-Alharmel Major Ali Zuaiter, the head of the judicial squad in Zahla Major Nabil Madhloum and were joined by the commander of the 5th regiment Colonel Ghassan Salim who arrived at the scene in a military helicopter.

He called on everyone "to bear their responsibilities and treat with contempt the tendentious campaigns started by some groups who consider themselves to be wronged by decisions made for the nation's and the citizen's good, as part of a strategy aimed at transforming Lebanon into a big market for the region with positive effects for the people in general and these groups in particular."
The enormity of these losses requires rapid intervention, particularly in massive accident conditions and especially those taking place on highways, in other words outside towns, where the accidents and the resultant injuries are generally of a gravity requiring rapid intervention, which would no doubt reduce the number of victims and the degree of injury they suffer.
In this context, it is useful to point out that a study conducted in Holland found that 20 to 40 deaths could be avoided by using helicopters to reach the victim and transport him.
But the man who said these words is a man of science, research and investigation, a respected academic (lecturer at an American university) who has spent many  exhausting years in libraries and laboratories researching amber from its earliest days through its development over the years (no, thousands of years) to be what it is today.
On the subject, Doctor Milki says: "Amber is Lebanese soil's greatest treasure.
Once again, it is Lebanon which "if it speaks" astounds the world with its treasures, at times natural, at other times human, but always original, establishing itself in the world's memory as the land of value and not volume, quality and not quantity.
Doctor Kassim al-Kadiri read a statement on behalf of the lecturers:
Will our full-time position contracts lie dormant at the council of ministers until another agreement from the university council, which agreed to them yet again on 1/16/2002 for the fifth time, becomes necessary?
While the government sees our case as minor and secondary, we see it as fundamental and momentous, and we ask ourselves why a government that acknowledges the legitimacy of our demands and the justness of our cause and the wrong done to us continues not to make amends and end the injustice done to us.
Deputy Ibrahim Bayan spoke and considered that the issue was a sectarian and political one and in no way related to education.
The physicians released a statement, part of which was:
"3- While those physicians proved their high competence in all fields and in all hospitals, we see that they are facing several difficulties, among which are:"
"Is this the reward of the homeland university and the most important college in Lebanon, so that it becomes subdued by others and jeopardized in its fate, and have the affiliates of the College of Medicine become of lesser status than their colleagues in private universities?"
All our crises have ended in one batch while we await the results. If the state wins, then this means, according to the many promises, that the rivers of milk and honey and the seas of wine will flow in the arteries of the citizen, and that the entire situation will revert after this severe hardship into transparent ease!
Maybe they will merge the Ministry of Energy with the Ministry of Health.
"Live Lebanon" and fireworks that light up the sky of wealthy areas and the luxurious center, their cost being enough to light the candles of sufficiency in thousands of homes lying under the night of famines!
"Live Lebanon" and Lebanon is on the terrorism list, and Israel is besieging us with the everlasting cages of accusation.
"Live Lebanon" and the environment is in danger, and the new generation is half dancing on screens and half of it is awaiting the chance behind the stages.

The Authority of Coordinating Leagues of Professors and Teachers and Workers in the Public Sector held a meeting in which it evaluated the results of the strike and the demonstration, and it issued the following statement:
"Third: The lesson that has to be learned by the officials is summarized in the necessity of going back on their unjust tax policy and opening a true dialog with associative sectors that actually represent the professors, the teachers, the associations, and all living forces in the community."

Nassar's book deals with the introduction published by Charles Malik in 1976, one year before he died. The lecturers and the author were in agreement that it has not received its due analysis and dialog because of the war.
Saab said that the philosophical atmosphere that is almost absent now was flourishing "in the period during which Malik wrote and during which Nassar wrote too," considering that the role that was assumed by Nassar in his writings, among which is "Towards a New Society," is "a continuation of the reviving intellectual line that was started by Anton Saada, particularly in his book 'Islam in its Christian and Mohammedan Messages' and his articles in the magazine 'The New Order.'"
"I benefited from articles written about it in both its editions, but I did not find in any of these articles an exposure of Malik's philosophical position, and that is what I tried to clarify in my book."
About the class of faith in philosophy, Nassar explained that the introduction promised a chapter on faith, but Malik did not talk about it in a complete form. As such, a reference came from him to its role in the text of the introduction passing through the other chapters that dealt with the other classes, among which are mathematics, incarnation, idealism, and others.
In a report by its editor Andrew Jennings, who has previously exposed the bribery scandal that accompanied the selection of the American city Salt Lake City as host for the 19th Winter Olympic Games, the newspaper said that the former president of the International Federation, the Brazilian Juan Havelange, selected Blatter himself to succeed him, due to his confidence that the latter would not expose the corruption that predominated his term of presidency.

Gaddafi Willing to Indemnify Lockerbie Families? Human Rights Watch Organization Criticizes Saudi Judicial System
He did not refer to a specific amount in the message.
The Human Rights Watch organization that defends human rights criticized yesterday the "covert" Saudi judicial system after mystery surrounded the question of issuing two death sentences against a Briton and a Canadian from seven Westerners who were accused of involvement in blasts that took place in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
It added that solitary confinement for long periods and extracting confessions and secret trials are "some of the common features" in the Saudi system.
Attorney Salah Al-Hujaylan said that he and his colleagues will start soon their defense of the defendants and expected the trial to take two months.
As of the night of the day before yesterday, the arrival of personnel from the American forces for special operations in Georgia started to launch a training program for Georgian forces on tactics of combating terrorism.
Deputy minister of defense Gila Bigoashfili explained that "it is the first group for operations of sheltering, transport, and logistics and will prepare the infrastructure to permit the start of the training.... To the best of my knowledge, their number is 18 and the training will start in May."
The American forces will present to the Georgian army arms, ammunitions, a communications system, medical equipment, fuel, and construction equipment.
The quasi-official Turkish agency Anadol reported that the ministers of interior in the three states signed the agreement in the presence of Turkish President Ahmad Najdat Ceser, Azerbaijani President Haider Alief, and Georgian President Edward Shevardnadze who said that this agreement is not aimed at "any state" but is rather to guarantee the security of the Paco-Teblisi-Jihan oil pipeline in the future.

He expressed upon receiving members of the 40th Jordanian Senate in the royal palace that "talking about a mere American view for establishment of a Palestinian state is an insufficient matter without setting a new system to deal with this subject and without a mechanism and time schedule" for the establishment of the Palestinian independent entity.
King Abd-Allah announced that he will continue his efforts with the American administration "to exercise maximum degrees of pressure on Israel for stopping its attacks, immediate withdrawal from Palestinian territories, returning to negotiations, and setting a time schedule for ending the occupation and establishing the independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital."
He criticized the repetitive demands of the Jordanian opposition to close the Israeli embassy in Amman and expel the ambassador recognized by the Kingdom, saying: "If we close the embassy or expel the ambassador, the other party will close the bridges (that link Jordan and Israel) and accordingly we will not be able to enter aid, donations, or any financial support for the besieged Palestinians, which will reflect negatively on them."
Most Jordanians descend from Palestinian origins, and the Kingdom witnessed in the last months tens of furious demonstrations that demanded the government sever its relationship with Israel and rescind the Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty signed in 1994.
Following calm that continued for ten days, the American army announced that patrols belonging to the international coalition forces against terrorism were exposed twice to shooting from "terrorists from Al-Qaeda" in East Afghanistan near the Pakistani borders, explaining that the special forces "responded to the source of fire" which led to killing four of "the terrorists" or injuring them.
He did not specify the nationality of the special forces.
Commander of the American forces in Afghanistan General Frank Haginpick explained that in the second engagement that happened yesterday at dawn, two of the combatants were killed in the same area when they headed toward an ambush.
Zahir Shah, who returned this month to Kabul after 29 years he spent in exile in Italy, said, "I feel sorry for the occurrence of such matters.... I made contacts with the dignitaries of the tribes of this area, and I am exerting my utmost effort to pacify the situation and reach an agreement between them."
"If it (my intervention) is useful and if those who will accompany me can help, we will spare no effort" in that.
In Tokyo, Japanese media services mentioned that the United States asked Japan to assist its campaign in Afghanistan by sending a destroyer equipped with the Aegis air defense system and anti-submarine surveillance aircraft.
Jenin Activists Tell Their Story: It is a Miracle That We Survived This Destruction
Israel says that its forces killed approximately 50 people in the camp, most of whom were fighters.
He refused to sit during the interview with him in the yard of a house.
"I will keep my mobile phone switched off so that the Israelis cannot trace the frequency."
After depletion of their ammunition, Muhammad and the survivors of the members of their unit resorted to a basement; "we could hear the bulldozers destroying the house above us."
"So we asked for help, and they rescued us."
"I was released on Sunday."
"We were taken to a clinic outside the camp where we stole out."
"We will reorganize ourselves."
She said in a speech she delivered at the School of Advanced Studies in International Relations in the John Hopkins University in Washington that "the problem with Iran is that its policies deny, regretfully, the idea that convergence (with it) can help."
Meanwhile, Iranian Minister of Oil Bijan Themeir called on the member states of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), those who are not members of it, and particularly the "Islamic and Arab" states to impose an oil embargo on Israel and the states that support it.
After two days, Tehran submitted the request to the Organization of the Islamic Conference to approve it.
He criticized, at the end of talks with his Tajikistani counterpart Ali Rahmanof, the American "military presence" in the area, and he said, "We do not interfere with internal affairs of other states in the area that determine their own policy for themselves," denying implicitly Washington's accusation to Tehran of interfering with Afghani affairs.
Meanwhile, Iranian media services reported that an Iranian court decided to imprison the reformist journalist Ahmad Ziyad Abadi for two years after convicting him of several charges, among which are spreading a publicity campaign hostile to the state and slander and defamation of officials.
But they found it unlikely that a final agreement will be approved in this regard before the expected meeting of Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri Al-Hadithi and United Nations Secretary-General Koffi Anan today.
The Security Council voted last November on a decision that provides for correction of the sanctions system after the end of its current phase in late May.
Moscow, the traditional ally of Iraq, wants to lift the sanctions off it to move trade contracts with Baghdad with an approximate total value of a billion dollars.
Iraqi Vice-President Taha Yasseen Ramadan denied that Baghdad received weapons from the Czech Republic, as claimed by Iraqi defecting military personnel who were interviewed by the British newspaper "The Guardian."
He was referring to information about Ukraine selling to Iraq four Kulshoga radar systems that allow observation of covert aircraft, at a value of 100 million dollars.
Meanwhile, the Iraqi News Agency INA reported that the Algerian Minister of Industry and Restructuring Abd El-Majeed Manassra arrived in Baghdad to preside over his country's delegation in the meetings of the joint Iraqi-Algerian committee.
Boycotting a Cigarette or New Awareness?
In American tobacco, I know, in spite of my ignorance of economy, that its boycotting will definitely damage the manufacturing companies for which the Arab world represents a preferred market.
Boycotting starts with the mind, by gaining a new awareness of the disasters caused by the savage globalization to peoples, and joining popular movements, in every Arab country, those calling for building a new world and international relationships that are more human.
We still, in the world of Arabs, stop at yelling for Palestine, cursing the Jews and Judaism with ill retrogressive thought, or demanding opening the borders tomorrow however possible, without contributing to scientific and cultural comprehensive organized response to the American haughtiness and its predatory globalization.
Shall we stop in the "glory" of the struggle at boycotting American tobacco?
The Language of "Dervishes"!
It became like its folks sliding dangerously toward dropping all the great ambitions, satisfied with only existence and subsistence, and has from crises in its authority the daily supply that is apt to affect it with a new emergent ailment, which is the ailment of "adaptation" with a political reality that has no roots with the people other than through crises.
In fact, it was a good chance and not bad to show this closed loop in which the institutions revolve while being unable to take even one step placed in direct contact with the poor with the proof that the parliament that was discussing prevention of cars operating with diesel was, on the other hand, refraining from questioning the government, even only from the point of open media exposure, about the secret of the upward rolling increase in the price of gasoline to avoid burning the sacred alliances between the giant blocs, and so that no one who stumbles makes the mistake of transforming the confrontation into governmental-parliamentary while the "crisis quorum" requires now that the fire remain kindled between Ba'abda and Quraytam until the next spot of mobile conflicts is chosen.
Otherwise what secret is it for the authority to become the prime rival of the opposition, stealing its mottoes when the conflicts erupt and the "officials" duel in talking about "the black boxes" without any dervishism?
The proof is what happened in Al-Khaleel yesterday and what can happen in any town in the West Bank at any time when Ariel Sharon wishes.
Of course, there is no need for us to go into details of the diplomatic and political arrangements that led to the decision to remove the military isolation off Arafat, neither to remind that his exit is supposed to form a new stage in kindling the resistance, not by entering the American examinations center to win the respect of George Bush, which Washington wants to make a new specialization in political sciences, such that the leaders obtain "." in punctuality, "." in obedience, or doctorate in submission.
If the minimal national duties toward the massacre against the Palestinians, and what it registered of absence and delinquency and deficiency, incite saying that all the mottoes of the nation and its false gallantries will also remain captive inside the "rhetoric of systems," then the matter in some of its external indications bears more symbolic meanings that condemn even international legitimacy.
Rajih Al-Khuri
Speculation appeared recently in Israel that Syrian influence on the party has decreased, contrary to the situation after the attacks of September 11.
Meanwhile, the leftist opposition attacked the decision, and its leader Yusi Sarid said that the government is involved and has involved with it the state in the way in which it dealt with the international investigation committee.
The "Ha Arts" editorial called yesterday for the necessity of finding a solution for the siege imposed on the Church of Nativity.
"Except for a weak objection from the circles of the right and the ministers, the decision to stop the siege was received with understanding."
"The government that vowed to achieve security and peace but does not try to go further than retaliatory operations and plans for erecting barbed wires is a government that is not doing its job."
When the secretary general of the Iran Freedom Movement Ibraheem Yazdi returned to Iran after a medical trip that was extended by a court ruling to detain him in Tehran, many Iranians expected that he would not spend his first night in his home but rather in detention.
For the verbal pelting, exchange of accusations, and sharp statements represent the apparent face of these relations, while this issue moves in Iranian and American circles in an opposite direction, although it is still in the discussion phase without entering the stage of actual work.
And with whom is it being held in the United States?
As a result of that approval of his, he became a target for the arrows of the religious left and the extremist right at that time, which forced him to withdraw from any dialogue about the relationship with Washington, and particularly in the Khatami phase during which this issue became one of the tools of conflict and exchange of accusations between the reformists and the conservatives.
Mirdamadi emphasizes that such a dialogue can reduce the severity of tensions in the American-Iranian relationship.
It was included in a speech he delivered on Labor Day and broadcast by Egyptian television that the Arab and Islamic states were expecting, after the success of the United States and its allies in its war in Afghanistan, support from the states of the area the resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict by way of negotiation based in the promises made by the international powers.
The Hebrew state started its military invasion of the cities of the West Bank and its villages late last month on the pretext of destroying "the infrastructure of terrorism."
He stressed the importance of the American role in reaching a political settlement for the existing problems in the area, referring to the approval by Israel and the Palestinians of procedures suggested by Washington to lift the siege imposed on  Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.
He asked: "Do you hear that the European satellite channels are used to attack European states?"
It quoted an Emirate official as saying that Mubarak will meet with the head of state Sheikh Zayid ibn Sultan Al-Nahyan to discuss the issue of "the situation in the Arab world and the development of situations in the occupied Palestinian territories."

The press office of the separatist president Aslan Maskhadof said it has no information about him.
In a call with the "Al-Jazeera" Qatari satellite channel, the Chechen Vice-Chairman of Parliament Badr El-Deen Bino denied the killing of Basaiev.
But Russian television broadcast on Friday a tape of a body of a man who looks like him before the radical faction of the Chechen rebels confirmed on Monday on its Internet site the killing of "leader Khattab as a martyr."
He had led with "leader Khattab" armed groups that launched in August 1999, attacks on neighboring Daghistan to establish an Islamic state, which Moscow took as a pretext to justify the attack it launched against the Chechen separatist rebels on October 1, 1999.
Yesterday the corpse of Lebed was moved to Moscow and was shrouded in the officers' club affiliated with the Ministry of Defense.
The white smoke of calm in Presidential relations rose at night, and the telephone call that was made by Prime Minister Rafeek Al-Hareeri to the President of the Republic Emil Lahud came to reflect this atmosphere, in spite of Al-Hareeri's admission in front of his visitors that the dilemma of the cellular issue in these relations still exists, but he assured that the relations between him and President Lahud "will not reach a dead end."
He explained that his position on the cellular issue has not changed.
"As to the cellular question, a limit must be reached, and we will reach a solution that preserves the interests of the state."
In the Star Plaza nothing showed from the givens of the session of the joint committees, which include all the organizations and their representatives, that there is something indicating convulsion.
The joint committees had ended their discussion of the new telecommunications law as amended by the administration and justice committee and cancelled by voting the first item in Article 25 related to "provisions pertinent to public telecommunications service providers."
Chairman Berri insisted that the item remain, so he tabled the matter for voting so cancellation received 11 votes opposed to 10 supporting it to remain.
"Al-Nahar" knew that President Omar Krami will visit President Emil Lahud within the coming days after an absence that continued for two years from the Republican Palace since the last parliamentary elections.
The ambassador showed concern for supporting the area developmentally.
The ambassador had lunch at the Al-Hasibani spring, inspected a Roman temple in Al-Habaria, and ended his tour with a visit to Rashia Al-Fakhar.
He announced that America thinks that "acts of violence that happen in the area will not lead to making peace," stating that the operations of Hezbollah in Sheba farms "cause violence and are not the solution," mentioning "the understanding by the United States of the situations of the area completely and of the situations of the Palestinian people and their suffering."
The Israeli flights extended to Al-Naqura, Sur, and the villages surrounding it, in addition to the villages and towns of the central sector.
Baqradawani Sends "The Message" From Al-Remeil: In the Phalanges There Is One President and One Legitimacy
Makhluf spoke first, and then Baqradawani responded, commending his work and announcing the name of the new president of the area, who is Saseen Shahwan.
"We did not fight for the sake of the Christians, but rather we fought by the Christians to preserve Lebanon for all the Lebanese, Muslims and Christians alike.  Do not believe that the Phalange party is squeezed or secluded, for we are all over Lebanon. You will see it in the south, Al-Biqaa, the north, Triploi, and Akar, and you will see its flags all over Lebanon, believe me, and when these flags return to fly above the sections all over Lebanon, then Lebanon will go back to Lebanon."
The people since a period have become silent;
But the official did not understand the people's silence,
Some of them try to fell some at the expense of felling the people, all the people.
They intensified the concern for their interests, and thus the smell of scandals emanated from every direction, and the people in the far edges of the country started to determine the figures of the profits of each of them in the world of the cellular and the world of the privatization intended to be resorted to.
We understood the delinquency of the Arabs, and they did not seriously champion their brothers in Palestine when they were slaughtered and captured, and their homes were destroyed on top of their heads.
but we are unable to understand how the official intensifies tightening the ropes of the gallows around the necks of the people by following until today the policy of seizing profitable opportunities on one hand and shaking the confidence in all the economic and political elements of this country by legitimizing every means to crush each other.
their children, the children of the people, will not remain silent tomorrow and the curse will not exclude perhaps anyone.
Official sources saw that the meeting to be held tomorrow in the Pastros palace between the Foreign and Expatriates Minister Mahmoud Hammoud and the Minister of State Baheej Tubbara, which is dedicated to developing a plan to translate the decision that was taken by the cabinet in its recent session, is proof of seriousness to prepare for filing a suit in a period no longer than a month, to litigate Israel before the International Justice Tribunal in the Hague on the charge of committing mass extermination in 1948, without indicating by Lebanon's filing of such a suit a legal recognition of the Israeli entity.
Foreign diplomatic sources in Beirut reported that Lebanon's decision to enter a new battle of an international legal nature against Israel is its right, but the battle is "difficult and unpredictable."
Also, the Israeli occupation of Lebanon has not ended by application by the Hebrew state of Security Council Resolution 425 and its subsequent resolutions, but rather by the effect of the operations of the resistance that forced the occupying Israeli army to evacuate the areas that it was occupying after 22 years, except for the Sheba farms and other points.
President Elias Al-Herawi responded yesterday to the position of President Hussein Al-Husseini in the inquiry session in the parliament the day before yesterday and his withdrawal from it.
"I followed what took place in constitutional and legal discussions that were started by His Excellency President Hussein Al-Husseini. Then he was followed by the former minister representative Nicola Fattoush, then representative Boutros Harb. I regret fully what was said by Mr. Al-Husseini, and I permit myself as a former representative before becoming president of the republic to ask him the following question: When he was a chairman of the council and convened us for an urgent session in the temporary building of the parliament that was in Mansur palace and suggested to the council at that time the rescission of the Cairo Agreement, can he answer me who were the ministers who attended?"
"Where was he (Al-Husseini) at that time?"
"The representatives are not ashamed of what they said at that time, and I am one of them."
"For I say in all candor if there are constitutional or legal matters that are not understood by the people, then they have the right to understand them, and let the geniuses of law and those knowledgeable of constitutional issues such as Mr. Hassan Refai, may Allah extend his life, kindly present us with constitution number four."
Its New; Is an Olive Tree 270 Years Old; Beirut Municipality Delegation Inspected the Cathedral; The 270-Year-Old Tree
The guests' questions were numerous, the most prominent of which were about the architectural features, which of them were modified, what was restored, and how the cathedral was before the war and then before the restoration.
The head of the restoration committee was keen on thanking the director of the municipal council and the members for the facilities obtained by the project from the municipality, particularly in terms of reconsidering the entrance from the Star Plaza, the works of which have been completed.
In the afternoon, the cathedral witnessed a pleasant surprise.
The President of the Republic Emil Lahud renewed his call to "keep the economic affair away from political exploitation or linking it to the logic of personal profit and loss instead of giving priority to the interests of the country and the subjects." He also emphasized his permanent commitment to preserve the rights of the state.
"For the strong state that possesses its rights can protect the rights of its citizens to whichever sector they belong, and it can also ensure the continuity of the basic provisions for the construction of the homeland and its recuperating economy."
The President of the Republic had held meetings with a number of representatives, which dealt with internal situations, regional developments, and the needs of the Lebanese areas."
"On the local level, we raised with His Excellency the situations of the area of Akar, stressing what came in the requisition memorandum that was submitted by the representatives of Akar to His Excellency and to His Excellency the Prime Minister. It summarizes the suffering experienced by this area, which is deprived on all levels."
Al-Saeed: Presidency of Summit Moving to Implement Its Decisions; Hammoud Demands a Position in Security Council Allowing Finding Committee to Carry Out Its Tasks; Kuwaiti Ambassador; Swedish Ambassador
Hammoud received in the Pastros palace yesterday the Kuwaiti ambassador Ali Sulayman Al-Saeed accompanied by the first advisor Sami Al-Saad.

"What was stipulated by the Security Council in the recent press conference confirms this approach and the necessity of Iraq's cooperation with the triple committee and the Red Cross."
Al-Waleed bin Talal: My Candor Disturbed President Al-Hareeri "For Every Incident There Is Talk"
He welcomed in this context the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince-the First Deputy of the Prime Minister-the President of the National Guard Abd Allah bin Abd El-Aziz to the United States, which "emphasized the historic relationship between the two countries," adding that Prince Abd Allah "believes that the American arena must not be left to Israel."
He was asked: When you were in Lebanon and advised improving the economic performance and declared your criticisms of the Lebanese economy, were you intending technical criticism only or arriving at the performance of Prime Minister Rafeek Al-Hareeri, aimed at unseating and replacing him?
"I was clear in my criticisms, and I admit that my candor disturbs, sometimes."
Visited Sfeer and Informed Him of His Candidacy; Ghassan Mikhyeer: The Battle Is Between the Opposition and the Opposition
"I assured His Eminence that I and everyone who supports my candidacy will work with great honesty to follow the great deceased and his struggles to serve Lebanon and the Lebanese and Matni people and particularly in defense of Lebanon's independence, its sovereignty, free decision, and the establishment of true democracy on the basis of the overall national interest. We emphasized all these principles in the approach of the deceased and his struggles throughout his life. We emphasized our cooperation and solidarity within the family."
"He found strange the talk about a battle of loyalty and opposition while the approach we use is the heart of the opposition and its spearhead."
He added: "Everyone has the right to nomination, but what we sensed from the Matnis was their disapproval of the timing and manner with which the nomination of Mr. Almer occurred."
Almer responded later to Mikhyeer's statement, and among what he said was: "The defense of Attorney Mikhyeer came weaker than his equation that says that he is the spearhead of the opposition who will arrive at the parliamentary forum with the votes of loyalty and absolute support from the state."
It seems that not adopting the relative representation for the member unions of the general union led to the inflation of their number, the swelling of their leadership head, and to the incubation of more frail unions.
So the General Laboring Union entered the circle of political polarization and party-tugging and in the orbit of authority moguls after the Al-Taif agreement.
To enter into the dialogue is for the sake of realizing the concept of mutual cultural acquaintance, which is considered the practical embodiment of the concept of justice. The cultural aspect of Islam is the prime basic aspect in the Islamic law (Sharia), and the commencement of the revelation with the words "Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous, Who has taught by the pen. Has taught man that which he knew not" is the clearest indication of that foundation.

"In addition to complicated methods of accounting that have no benefit nor use except for bewilderment that is unproductive or even costly to the state and its departments, without hope for a result."
"- An administrative factor, such that the free professional is not required to keep anything but the revenues book and exempting him from the book of expenses and inventory, as long as part of his income is exempt and considered as general expenses."
"For the sake of making this initiative successful, we referred to the direct officials and explained to them the reasons that drove us to propose this amendment. We have to benefit from the waiting period set until June 24, 2002, to submit the proposed law such that the current law is stayed immediately, first and foremost."
At ten before noon, a labor demonstration will be held, which was called by the National Union of Labor and Employee Associations in protest against "the deterioration and decline in work and living conditions and to secure the elements of emerging from the crisis."
The Communist Party saw that "the first condition that must be secured for the laborers to succeed in achieving a guaranteed future is the organizing their rows and stacking their unity in a correct and sturdy form so that their struggle has usefulness and true and tangible effectiveness."
The Popular Nassiri Organization considered that "the consecutive governments since 1992 bear the responsibility for the deterioration of social situations under a national economy that has become more exposed than before, the competition of external workforce with the local laborers, as well as the competition of smuggled goods and commodities that deepens the crisis of industry, agriculture, and the national economic movement in general."
The Union of Laborer and Employee Associations in Sayda and the South expressed its backing and support for "securing all elements of steadfastness for the Palestinian people and boycotting American goods."

Canada Bids Farewell to Its Most Famous Artist Jean Paul Riobil; The Daring Abstractionist of the Vanguard Age; Friend of Jiaco Miti and Proton
The funeral ceremony had been held for him in which the Prime Minister of Quebec province Bernard Lendri spoke, describing Riobil as a giant.
The French artist Sam Safran said that the late artist was like his elder brother, and the owner of the gallery who exhibited his works since 1964 said that she had not meet a person like him.
As for the historian and critic Pierre Schneider, who organized several large restorative exhibitions in Paris in the seventies and the eighties, he described Riobil as an inexhaustible spring and his paintings are full to bursting.
He belongs to an age in which the fine arts were of greatest importance whether in the cultural or social life in European and American cities where some artists could become stars whose news are reported by the media services as they pursue the news of athletic champions or pop singers.
In the days of glory and fame, the mid-sixties, Riobil went into painting decorative signs in his paintings. The critics rose against his new works, but he did not pay attention and continued in his new course. He approached nature and loved the vast North and the world of the Inuit and their game of threads. He adapted his drawing to match his body, which was affected by bone fragility (1968). He innovated amazing things so that he did not stop drawing the painting that he completed in honor of Joan Mitchell after her death and which carried the title "Honoring Rosa Luxembourg" (1992). The painting remained in Casino Hall for a period before it was obtained by the Quebec museum.
A Poem From Behind the Bars; "Pomegranate of the Heart" by Toujan Faisal
Amman is not measured in acres
in what is embraced by the curl of fingers of its gold dust
it remains not for sale
No blood would flow from it but rather
rolled an anklet for the foot.
if it becomes some of your gold dust,
-as is my custom and your custom-
Do you know now why
but we do not die.
-as the face of my mother-
And the love of homelands is inheritance.
I will have no other holding arms left
the features of my mother's face.

while every evening
kept for the necessities of the decency of the gathering, nothing else.

The decision, which is expected to gain wide support, includes the main points of a final agreement "that stipulate the application of Security Council Resolution 242 and the establishment of a Palestinian state with 'irrevocable guarantees' in security and borders that include Gaza and the West Bank, provided that Jerusalem becomes a 'capital of the two states.'"

The leftwing Democratic party that is led by Ajawid responded to the calls for the Prime Minister's resignation, describing the criticisms that are directed toward him by the politicians and the press commentators as being "hostile" and "lacking respect for others."

The two organizations defending human rights in Syria, which label him "the Nelson Mandela of Syria," consider that his trial represents a test for the liberation of the regime.
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat is holding intensive consultations with the Palestinian forces and factions dealing with the process of reform and change intended to be carried out in the Palestinian areas.
He explained, "The preparations for the legislative, local, and municipal council elections are proceeding in full swing."
He said, "The delegation of the Palestinian Authority and Fatah that is officially appointed by President Arafat presented us with some matters that are related to the nature of the change in progress in the Palestinian arena."
One of the leaders of the movement in the Gaza Strip, Khaled Al-Butsh, said, "It was decided for a meeting to be held in Gaza today or tomorrow between a delegation representing the Palestinian National Authority and the Fatah movement and a delegation from the Al-Jihad Al-Islami movement for consultation about the internal arrangements.... No certain positions have been presented yet, and we in the movement will give our response and position after that, but I hope that it will be good in all circumstances."
He considered that "what has taken place of Israeli war and destruction and siege, including besieging the premises of President Arafat, has ended the Oslo agreement."
He added that developing a complete constitution must wait until the Palestinian state is established.
He noted that the security bodies affiliated with the Palestinian Authority also hindered the judiciary by interfering with the cases and obstructing the application of law.
But the American administration preempted the European procedures by expressing its willingness to escalate the commercial dispute between the two banks of the Atlantic and file a complaint with the World Trade Organization.
He added that the strategy of the European Union is represented in "giving the Americans additional time until the third of next July to make a decision regarding the exemptions for the European steel industries."
The European Union reviewed two lists of American products that include widely diversified products from textile to steel on which additional duties can be imposed.
Meanwhile, the World Trade Organization announced that it received notice from the United States expressing its desire to hold consultations with the European Union to discuss the Union's decision to impose sanctions on the American products.
The American commercial representative David Shark had said in a message to the European Union's representative to the Organization Carlo Trujan that the European procedures "seem to be contradictory to the obligations of the European Union" pursuant to the laws of international trade.
The police and the army erected sandbags around the gates of the Technical University in Kandahar where the voting center is.
The official in charge of the preparations Raheem Al Deen Raheem said the tightened security measures will be taken in the voting center in Kandahar, as more than 200 policemen will be stationed in the university's surroundings.
He added, "Afghanistan is starting from scratch, and everything needs rebuilding."
He explained, "We so far have no plans to send additional forces."
In Washington, the American Assistant Chief of Staff General Peter Pace announced that the American forces released 50 people after detaining them in a raid it launched in the night of May 24 west of Kandahar in Afghanistan, and that five people are still in custody.
The organization estimated the number of detainees at the base to be approximately 384 people and expected approximately 150 to join them soon.
Millington used to work for the Sudan programs group in the American State Department.
He commended the steps that were taken by Sudan to support the international community in its war against terrorism.
In Nairobi, the Popular Army for Liberating Sudan announced that its combatants performed a "tactical withdrawal" from the strategic area of Kisan in southern Sudan on the border with Ethiopia and which the Sudanese Army said on Thursday that it has regained control over.
Al Matin Madhouse
Such that it is not tyrannized by the manipulation of the ruler, and it is not terrorized by the screaming of the opposition, that is in principle.
And this commotion is close to becoming a source of weariness for all the Lebanese.
And therefore the Lebanese from outside Al-Matin feel weary of this battle that "does not fly high," as the French proverb says.
3- The state of "political prostitution" in an area to which a current president of the republic belongs and indicates his weakness in a site where he is supposed to be ahead of the others, but here he is more than absent.
6- The legacy of the "opposition chief" is being cleared by the hands of his partners in the opposition and not by the hand of the rule, as logic implies.
3- There must be self-critical review in the seen and heard media, which has not presented a model of logical, reasonable, and prudent media.
Ali Hamada
How could Hussein Al-Husseini, and he is the chief of constitution, and Michael Dhaher and Boutros Harb, and they are two of the leaders of law, have prevented the issuance of the cellular privatization law attached with the binding article, that was proposed by Rafeek Al-Hareeri, and which prohibits the members of the procedural authority and the members of the Privatization Supreme Council and their relatives to the fourth degree to be connected in any way with the privatization operations?
Is it because we have the "illegitimate wealth" law that offends in its known history and its outrageous applications to Lebanon twice, once when we have a text without spirit or effectiveness or result, nor does it lead to supporting transparency in the country, and once more when it becomes a pretext that prevents issuing a similar text as it happened the day before yesterday, in the question of separating the relatives from the privatization... and what do you know about privatization?
And with our knowledge and appreciation for the response of some to the spirit of the saying "From where did you get this?"
But this does not give them an excuse whatsoever to play on "the degrees" in the sense of following the European laws that reach to the second degree the husbands and the children perhaps for mere refusal of dancing on Al-Hareeri's fourth degree.
The monitor of Arab affairs Daniel Sobelman commented yesterday in "Ha'Arts" on the Lebanese talk that was said on the second anniversary of the Israeli withdrawal from the south, that Israel intends to withdraw from Shiba farms. So he wrote: "The problem of Shiba farms, which is according to the United Nations and Israel a part of the Golan Heights and not of Lebanon, was not known until the end of April 2000, when Lebanon started in an abrupt manner and with Syrian encouragement to demand Israel to withdraw from them."
"In his belief, it is better for Israel at the current time to constrict the magnitude of confrontation between it and Syria and Lebanon and restrict it within the area of Shiba farms."
"For ultimately the Americans will enter a confrontation with Hezbollah, but that confrontation does not necessarily have to be military."
"There is another matter that supports the possibility of continuation of the confrontation after evacuating the farms, and that is what was said by (Mr. Hassan) Nasr-Allah himself, that even in case the withdrawal takes place, his organization will remain deployed with its arms in the south."
"It is even expected for the party to continue its operations against Israel in one way or another while taking into consideration Lebanese public opinion; in case Israel withdraws from Shiba, it is expected that the party's internal crisis will increase, and it will be difficult for it to continue its military operations using another pretext."

This is because it is not possible for a humble monitor to comprehend all the dimensions of this fateful battle on the future of a homeland and perhaps more.
The Algerian government can describe the voting as a democratic expression by the voters, and America can also "support the democratic development in Algeria."
For the problem of the Berber has its sensitivity, and searching for solutions for it requires greater sensitivity.
For many voters believe that there is a basic political defect in the system that is irreparable.
But in the depth there is a confidence crisis between the regime and the voters, for which holding elections is not sufficient to solve.
The internal interest that has finished with the cellular battle directs attention to the northern Al Matin elections that have turned with the action of the media and particularly the appearance of it to a fighting arena at more than one level.
The Lebanese Society for Democratic Elections provided some explanations about  Minister Almer's talk and mentioned that it will monitor the election process tomorrow "to observe any violation."
In the night a statement was released from the Secretariat of the Marunite Patriarchy that included: "For days, some citizens and particularly the visitors of his Eminence the Patriarch have been attributing to his Eminence certain talk. It concerns the Secretariat to assure that every statement or talk that is not issued by the Secretariat or his Eminence is of no value, and it reminds the citizens that the elections that will be held on June 2 are a patriotic duty and must be attended with patriotic sense and responsibility."
More than 50 literati, activists, and representatives of the civil society organizations signed a joint statement supporting Mikhyeer's candidacy.
During the trial of the French Marshal Petain on the charge of collaborating, he delivered his famous sentence to General DeGaulle present in Britain, so he said to him: "Your departure from France is not the way to save and salvage it."
But the silence was not a state of satisfaction but of gold.
We wonder, and wondering with us is every honest Lebanese citizen: Is the level to which the General's political discourse has descended reasonable?
Does the General mean by the category, that one which stormed inhabited and residential areas with artillery and tanks?
Do we need to remind the General that we acquired the Lebanese nationality the same as he did and at the same dates?
We wonder: Why didn't General Oun and Mr. Naseeb Lahud demand the second ministerial seat for the Armenians?
We are not in the process of delivering theories or giving advice to those who need it.
And if we take the memory back to the elections of 1992 and review the number of votes that supported the candidacy of Mr. Naseeb Lahud (the former ambassador of the post-Al Taif Lebanese state in Washington) and the ally of his Excellency President Michel Almer at that time, then we would conclude that the Armenian vote contributed to a very large portion of taking him to the parliamentary forum.
Did not the General himself a short time ago repeatedly state that President Ameen Al Jumayel and Representative Naseeb Lahud are under the Syrian roof?

"1- We stopped before what was provided for in the annual report of the Amnesty International organization, regarding what takes place in Lebanon of unfair trials, torture, abuse, and detentions after demonstrations objecting to the Syrian presence, and some journalists and workers in the media services were exposed to intimidation."
"On the other hand, rotation continues in the ring of presidential disagreements on the beat of fiddling with emotions, playing on paradoxes, and kindling the sensitivities as a service to the external hegemony and a justification for its continued interference with Lebanese affairs."
"We ask in this regard: Is it not more efficient for the state bodies with their various specialties and authorities to restrict their activities for which they were established and in accordance with the clear and explicit legal texts that govern their work, instead of the behavior of some of them as instruments for suppressing the opposition and intimidating them, or transforming them into special teams affiliated with this authoritative part or that and at its service, not at the service of Lebanon and the Lebanese?"
Elections are the best test for the voter's awareness.
The scattered opposition in Al Matin challenged the voter in his logic, dignity, ambitions, loyalty, and concern for his area and the future of his children.
What is this time in which politics declines to such an amount of debasement?
They call for freedom and exploit it to offend dignities and defame people.
For freedom is not a slogan but rather a practice.
They ally with those who were leading the campaign against Al Matin and Al Matinis when they wanted the Palestine road to pass through Al Juniyeh.
May the principles rest in peace.
I always meet with the benevolent endeavors that were made by Patriarch Sfeer and Bishop Yusuf Bishara who appreciated the positive position of Michel Almer to neutralize the area from more battles and dispersion.
It challenged the voter in his loyalty because it assumed that the last thing for which the Lebanese cares is loyalty to allies.
Is it not yet time for our youth to understand the reality of their politicians, rulers, and opposition, and rise against them in hope for a better tomorrow, away from more emigration and ruin?
The Lebanese Society for Democratic Elections expressed a group of remarks on the speech of Minister of Interior Elias Almer in the recent television interview, as it emphasized that what he said about optional use of the secret chamber in the elections contradicts the law of elections.
"However, this amendment does not mean in any way a permission for the employee, whether civilian or military, to interfere with the elections and use his official capacity, his authorities, powers, and the means secured for him by virtue of his position to influence the will of the voters."
"What was said by the Minister of Interior contradicts the law of elections number 171 issued on 1/6/2000 which stipulates in Article 49 that the head of the voting section 'shall require the voter to enter the isolator prepared to conceal him from sight.'"
"The University Of Expatriates-The Spreading" Promises Lahud "to Contribute to Rebuilding Every Foot of Liberated Land"

"We call on the judicial authorities to exert all their efforts to find the criminals and retaliate against them as soon as possible."
"We also express our concern for the assassination of the Palestinian official Jihad Ahmad Jibreel, regardless of the reasons behind this question."
"3- We also confirm our position opposing naturalization on the land of Lebanon."
The Battle of ... Presidency of the Republic
Before we start, we want to thank the two gentlemen Jubran Tweini and Riyad Abu Fadel for their withdrawal to preserve the dignity of Lebanon.
- Who allowed you to climb the ladder of leadership on the shoulders of Syria while you curse it?
Everyone calls it the opposition battle, and in spite of that we did not hear anything about the position of the Prime Minister and the seniors of his government or the parliament.
To the senior voters, we know everything and know the past very well, and therefore call on you to understand this fact. No magic of a magician can turn the monkey into a deer because you renounced your mother and your father. The Lebanese will not believe that those who plundered the state in their days have become angels who we have to sanctify. The people of Al Matin will not be convinced that grudge, personal interests, and selfishness, no matter how simplified, beautiful, and resonant their language is, will turn them in our minds into a good example for society.
Is it not reason for laughter and crying that the Marunite leaders open the grave of Dr. Albert Mikhyeer and criticize him, and when he was alive their courage betrayed them to look him in the face because they were merely his pupils in the opposition, forging the exams.
And accordingly that you win for the northern Al Matin, for its people, youth, and girls and refuse to exploit them as bondwomen in the kingdom of buzzing resonant opposition princes, and that you emerge from under the guardianship of the senior voters and win against this that emits venom, and that the white and bright smoke emanates from your triple dialogue for the benefit of Lebanon, and only Lebanon. I call on Mrs. Mirna Almer to take the initiative and invite her two candidate colleagues to meet and for dialogue, with love, the dialogue of the brave who believe that the interest of Lebanon is above all interests and that the three be the mother of the boy, his father, and his brother.
Faris explained "The essence of the Committee's work is to seek to enhance the unity of the Expatriates League, especially after Lebanon was unified following the Al Ta'ef Conference, while the League still suffers from divisions."
Lahhoud received a delegation of heads of the Arab delegations participating the 4th Scientific Conference, organized by the Dentists' Union in Northern Lebanon and also included dentist union leaders in Egypt, Iraq, Bahrain, Jordan, Palestine, Syria and Tunisia, and a number of doctor members in Arab medical organizations.
They commended the positions taken by Lahhoud during the Arab Summit and the "effort exerted by him to enhance solidarity among the brotherly Arab countries, and implementing the resolutions of the Beirut Summit."
It demanded his resignation or dismissal before the date of the elections.
Our position with regard to it is based on our distinguished political position and our national path that is careful to build an Arab democratic Lebanon that is not sectarian. Our position in the opposition arises from this, whose elements we agree with on specific issues (...)".
He is then prejudging intentions.
While the Minister is proud of his role and the role of his father in the Sharon era, in the same regard we must point out the issuance of forged brochures in the name of communists or communist organizations patronized by the known systems cannot afford gains to the Minister's team, and distort the position of our Party.
By Khalil Fleihan:
Some officials were quoted as saying that Solana did not bring with him an initiative, but they sensed he is seeking to discover the position of Lebanon towards such a conference, and finding out what it wants in terms of topics.
An example they gave was that some of the officials understood from him that he is not carrying any official proposal aimed at setting the location of convening the conference, and its time, goals and headlines.
But that remains mysterious and could crystallize further during the tour of American Deputy Secretary of State William Burns who is touring the region, and whose sixth stop is Beirut.
They confirmed that Lebanon is against the policy of phases, meaning it is with resuming Arab-Israeli negotiations on all stopped courses at one time when that occurs.
George Bush and Vladimir Putin want the world to be convinced that what was signed in Moscow to reduce the number of nuclear warheads to only one thousand seven hundred (!) makes the world more reassured that a nuclear war will not erupt.
However, aside from reducing the dangers of the nuclear confrontation between east and west, what is happening in the Middle East reveals dangers and repercussions that are no less severe and capable of destruction than any kind of traditional or exceptional wars.
And despite the Authority's condensed statements, Bush is not satisfied with Arafat's behavior.
As for Arafat, he is in a state of self-withdrawal in order to prepare the "reform" movement inside the Authority.
And despite the fact that the Head of the Authority is surrounded by problems from every side, piling up all at once, he has a history of precedents in the method of evading the siege and the pressures practiced upon him, and he is also good at the policy of changing his skin. Therefore Arafat is a man of all seasons.
Many practices need to be corrected.
And while Israel has put up barbed wire barriers and divided the West Bank into seven cantons and the Gaza Strip into four, the National Authority still continuing the policy of issuing condemnation statements of the Palestinian explosions against the Israelis.
Madi will continue his investigations today and listen to statements from others.
It also sentenced Hussein Mohammad Qoft to two weeks and a fine of one hundred thousand liras and imprisoning Fadi Ali Kifit three weeks because Hussein had stolen a steel military helmet and Fadi money from his friend.

Rashayya - "An Nahar":
After an explanation and presentation from the President of the Organization Nasser Abu Lateef, Minister Hrawi spoke, saying: "The Emirates solidarity project is interested in dismantling mines in the south.
Brigadier Mis'ed said "After the defeat of the occupation, we faced an enormous amount of mine fields in the confrontation lines and in the freed area. According to statistics, there are approximately 2800 mine fields with approximately 500 thousand mines.
Al Zein explained: "A general program will start next week in Rashayya and Western Biqa'a schools for the vocational training of those injured, in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and Social Affairs, to enable those to secure their future."
He added: "We in the South Council are directly concerned with this matter and with the matter of immediate aid to the victims of the mines.
There are injuries that took place in the year 1978 and the year 1982, and now we are accepting applications from their owners, and if they prove to be true we will assemble the limbs.
Bar Association President Honored: I Support Struggling Women
The national anthem started, followed by Atiyyeh's speech in which she welcomed  a meeting that recalls a tradition launched by lawyer Masabki 30 years ago honoring the Association President, who is entrusted with the message of advocacy and its affairs and hardships.
She spoke about Masabki, "the lawyer who was a trainee in 1952 and who reached the status of membership after 13 years, and then the position of treasurer of the retirement fund in 1970", and enumerated "her national stands" and "the most beautiful writings she wrote in French" .
She called on the lawyers to "continue the course of spreading the culture of right and human values".
The first case I won was by a neighbor of mine who brought suit to ban hanging laundry on the roof.
The best thing about her is that she is necessary.
He mentioned that he supported her nomination in the year 1965, "due to my belief in her role in the Association and the Council".
With the building that is being constructed for the lawyers near the Justice Palace and the Ministry of Justice nearing its completion date, he hopes that the Office of the President will not be moved from the Justice Ministry to it.
To him, a noun in the nominative case is in the accusative case, and what is in the accusative case is in the genitive, in addition to the hamzah, which was never, according to him and to other Egyptian literary figures, in its right place.
When I asked one of the Egyptian colleagues at "Ash-Sharq Al-Awsat" about the reason he said: "...by God I don't know.
And believe me if I tell you that I was "fired" from "Ash-Sharq Al-Awsat", where I was treated by those in charge of it with respect and love, because of my inability to go ahead with overlooking mistakes, which the Egyptians refuse to acknowledge, on the pretext that they are 60 million and they are free to do with the Arabic language what they please!
He pointed out that the Municipal Council has not yet made a decision concerning naming the regions and streets due to the variance in points of view with regard to giving names, and that the work of the Municipality is focused on developing the region first.
* A source at the company explained that the conditions are set because the bill is considered personal, and no one but the owner of the line has the right to demand it.
One citizen asked advertising companies to refrain from pushing children into Pampers commercials in the visual media, which damages pure Lebanese values, and must be stopped to protect the feelings of the Lebanese society.
The latest Israeli uproar in the matter of banning Iran's development of its nuclear abilities might be exaggerated, but it has a point and specific goals.
It is also directed at Russia, to convince it to impose clear restrictions on its cooperation with Iran in building a new nuclear reactor to generate energy.
But despite all that, there are those in Israel who see that the exaggeration of the Iranian danger is a matter that lacks realism.
Threatening Jerusalem is also threatening Moscow, or in other words, Iran obtaining nuclear weapons constitutes a threat to several cities in Russia.
But there is another matter that changes the picture: the Iranian threat is not only directed at American or Israeli targets, but also at Iraq, which is largely in the American and Israeli interests combined.
Israel, which seems incapable today of putting an end to a limited traditional war waged against it by the Palestinians, be able to reconsider one of the most important principles on which its defensive theory stands: nuclear deterrence?
3- Because effective administration is the radical solution for gradual public fund management of the public debt.
In the past, three methods of administrative reform failed:
First, in the general method of providing general services:
When they do this, they do not have the right to gain profit from their projects, but suffice with the annual equivalent of their expenses, as the state's status cannot be a merchant ... and other such details.
More importantly, perhaps he pushed the American Congress to increase its military aid to Israel in order to face the dangers of the Iranian land-to-land "Shihab 3" missiles that can reach any point in Israel.
Governor of the Bank of Lebanon Riyad Salameh renewed his affirmation that the stability of currency is a basic choice for the Central Bank to achieve social growth and stability, stressing that Lebanon has the capabilities and human resources that qualify it to come out of its current crisis.

Days ago, the banking circles were preoccupied with the merger process achieved between "Beirut Bank" and "Beirut and Riyadh Bank", after hard negotiations that led to defusing the fuse that almost exploded, as a result of the unhealthy situation the merged bank suffered (Beirut and Riyadh) in the last three years.
Sarraf's speech came during his reception of the former Russian ambassador Oleg Perespikin at the Organization's headquarters in UNESCO, with the members of the administration association in attendance."
He explained that "the Organization is, in coordination with the Russian Embassy, the Russian Cultural Center and the Russian House, organizing various activities, and formed political, economic, cultural, educational and technical committees to follow-up the activation of its role" and asked Perespikin "to coordinate communications and cooperation with the government institutions and find a fruitful communication ground."
It was agreed to convene another meeting early next week to follow-up implementation."
Keeping in mind it will be repeated on the 13th and 14th of June.
"Lebanese - American" Interviewed Him on Financial Situation; Salameh: Coming Out of Deficit is Possible, Presence of Political Decision Important
He said that "the theory of resolving the debt through decreasing the currency is not a convincing theory, because approximately a third of the debt is now in the American dollar, and any decrease does not solve the problem of this debt, but leads on the contrary to unsettling trust, weakening the financial sector and raising interest rates. Moreover, solving of the debt problem does not solve the deficit problem. The economy is dollar-tied and therefore the cost of fees will follow currency fluctuations, in addition to socially unstable airs that will certainly affect the economic stability, growth expectations, destroy a part of the national resources and deactivate the activities of privatization. Additionally, the rise in interests will lead the country into negative growth."
He said that "the plan exists but it is not declared, and there is agreement on directions. However, the distinction that must be taken into consideration is that it is not enough to think of how to reduce the deficit and the debt, but in how to build a modern economy and provide new job opportunities."
The day before yesterday a round table had been convened on the general financial situation, in which the General Manager of the Ministry of Finance Alain Beifani, economic expert Shirbel Nahhas, Dean of the Business Administration College at the "Lebanese-American University" Wassim Shahin participated. It was conducted by Head of the Economics Department at the University Ghassan Deiba.
This Agency had reported bankers as saying that Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and the Sultanate of Oman bought bonds worth more than 500 million dollars, in order to help the Bank of Lebanon maintain the stability of the lira exchange rate.
It was decided to form a delegation from its members and Lebanese industrialists headed by the President of the Association to visit Iraq and discuss ways of activating the bilateral agreement with the Iraqi Industries Union as a first step towards signing a trade protocol between Lebanon and Iraq.
Respecting the decision to boycott foreign goods, which expresses a stand that rejects the policies of some Western countries that manufacture these goods, is our duty, but we must discriminate between boycotting goods manufactured abroad and the goods that have foreign names, but are Lebanese made, such as the foods and drinks manufactured for these goods known under an international name.
Let us protect our economy and people, and let us be up to the reasonable responsibility."
It is now possible for us to continuously search for a formula, not to coexist only, but for creativity and fruitfulness and those guarantees the stability and security of every believer.
The book "Verbal Psychology in Lebanon - the Current Situation" was issued by Al Balmand University Publications, and includes a group of contributions that were presented during a conference that was convened at Al Balmand University and carried the same name. A number of researchers and specialists from various Lebanese and foreign universities (Al Balmand University; Lebanese University; Islamic University; Poitier University, France; Lebanese - American University and the American University in Beirut) participated in it. Researchers developed in it issues related to verbal psychology in its exclusive meaning and topics related directly with the verbal acquisitions and describing them, to social and disease data that have an effect on the process of acquisition, per se. The book is a scientific starting point for future research that could benefit from the experiences of other countries where linguistic multiplicity prevails.
The Stupidity of the Heart Muscle
At the time that faith is a silent internal action, the arbitrary linking between it and the heart, that which does not stop making noise, moving and reacting through the duality of "dum and tak" from the first formation of the embryo to the end of life, comes.
The porter is a porter ...
The remaining body parts became used to adjusting each other by imitating the heart's noise. As for the isolated silent organs, they suffer scorn and contempt.
The heart, is derived from this name: the mold, which is an indication of immobility and stability, the porter is a porter!
Therefore there are those who consider the endocardium the heart formed around it due to its control of the sources of food and the soul's life responsible for this humility it accepts for itself. What prevents the liver from planting wheat (let us remember liver implants ...) and what makes the thinking educated brain a follower, annex and a requirement of the heart, even a subjugated servant that draws its meaning from its subjugation and its value from extinction?!
The Faculty of Medicine and the Medical Center at the American University in Beirut celebrated the presenting of specialization certificates to 52 male and female doctors at the Issam Faris Hall at the Faculty, attended by ceremony host, Minister of Health Suleiman Franjieh, Minister of Tourism Karam Karam, Medical Association President Mahmoud Shukayr, Representative of the University's President, Dr. John Waterbury, Dr. Peter Heath and families of graduates.
While waiting to find out what the future holds for our countries, we will remain in a fluctuating period of our lives during which it is hard to concentrate, resources are low, and with it job opportunities and moving forward.
President Shukair said: "Today a group of Lebanon's doctors cross the barrier of acquiring knowledge and certifying certificates to reach the land of implementation and direct responsibility.
We have enough general and specialized doctors to meet the needs of the country and more.
After the distribution of certificates, Dr. George Al Farzali gave the speech to the graduates.
And if the archeological structure, or archeological landmark, is a hard evidence on the ground, then the memory is living evidence in humans."

He is like a patriarch for the church (as the Organization is a subsidiary to the Christian Church), and like the president for a state.
These will come to Lebanon and meet with the heads of Malta organizations who will come from all over the world."
I was invited by the Iranian government to participate in a conference organized by the Iranian Ministry of Culture on the sidelines of the Annual Book Exhibition held annually by the Ministry of Culture. The object of the organization of this conference was to discuss the rights of authors in light of the international treaties signed regarding these topics, especially since Iran has not yet joined most of these treaties.
We cannot in this article present a complete inventory of the conference's work, but we can express two important notes:
The visitor's attention is brought to the extreme importance Iranians give to the Book Exhibition that is organized on a large piece of land and the permanent structures that are allocated like suites for exhibition, conference, and meeting halls.
Perhaps the support the government offers on the prices of the exhibited books contributes to this turnout.
Under the patronage of the President of the Republic, represented by Minister of Environment Michel Mousa, the proceedings of the annual conference of the Cross Hospital for Mental and Psychiatric Diseases was opened yesterday, on "Modern Treatments in Psychology", in cooperation with the Lebanese French Medical Organization, the Faculty of Medicine at the Saint George University, service departments of the Mental, Psychiatric and Health Diseases at the Catholic University in Loufan, the Lebanese Organization for Behavioral and Cognitive Treatments, and the Lebanese Organization for Mental and Psychiatric Diseases.
In his speech, President of the Scientific Committee at the Cross Hospital, Professor Charles Baddoura, stressed "the importance and comprehensiveness of the conference sessions, especially because they discuss the necessity of general confrontation of the reality of the mental diseases on the basis of scientific advancement.

I turned to this "finally published", and found on his table a huge volume that contains all his works (Lebanon Library). I knew how he had spent days and nights reviewing, correcting and verifying proofs so it would come out in the form that would please him.
This matter happened days ago without great colleague George Skaf (Deputy President of the Press Association today, minister one day, and a rare friend every day) with the publication of his complete collection "Pages from Lebanon" (Dar Nobilis).
Heritage...that is the word.

Yesterday, Kuwaiti authorities hanged three Bengalis after convicting them of killing a Sri Lankan maid. The number of those put to death rose to 46 people since the punishment was approved in the Emirate in 1964.
The verdict was executed despite the interference of the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Khalida Dia, and Amnesty International, who urged the Kuwaiti authorities to replace the death sentence with a "more humane" sentence.
The spokesperson for the opposition National Democratic Assembly in Syria, Hassan Abdul Azim, said that the verdicts issued against the opposition in the country are aimed at "blocking the path of the opposition's activities and their role in working towards national democratic change."
He stressed that "verdicts passed by the State Security Court and the Public Prosecution include exceptional judgments and that the guarantees of neutrality and self defense are not included in them. It is a non-competent court".

Observes referred with interest to the fact the Sudanese President did not use the expression "rebellion" when referring to the " Popular Army for the Liberation of Sudan."
He believed that "what happened in the Nuba Mountains was the first step towards peace, and with a purely Sudanese initiative", in a reference to the ceasefire agreement signed by the "Popular Army" and the Khartoum government under American sponsorship in Switzerland in December of last year.
Model "Al Bashir 1" and "Al Zubayr 1" tanks were displayed, in reference to Deputy President Al Zubayr Mohammad Saleh, who died several years earlier in a plane crash accident. Those two models were modeled in Sudan on the Russian tank "T55".
At a later time, the opposing "National Democratic Alliance" considered Al Bashir's speech disappointing, and void of positive points.
Iraqi Minister of Oil, Amer Mohammad Rashid, stated yesterday that his country hopes to provide Turkey with energy sources in return for providing its needs of infrastructure requirements, while Foreign Minister Naji Sabri Al Hadithi traveled to Vienna in preparation for the third round of the talks with United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Anan, which will start Thursday.
He expressed his country's readiness to "participate in implementing transport and communications projects in Iraq, organize specialized exhibitions, exchange trade delegations for contracting and agricultural sector services, and provide training opportunities for Iraqi agencies."
He stressed that "Iraq is seeking a comprehensive settlement, and we will not accept partial solutions and the sectioning of one element or one small part of the file of the relationship between Iraq and the United Nations."
Yesterday, the Pakistani government directed a general call for help in finding Osama bin Laden, his senior aids, and 16 other members in the "Al Qaeda" Network, considering them "dangerous religious terrorists."
The call in the Urdu language said: "Those who kill innocent Pakistani citizens are the enemies of peace and the country (...) Their goal is terrorism and destruction.
It did not offer financial rewards.
The "Taliban" was overthrown from rule at the end of last year by a coalition of Afghani forces supported by American bombs for harboring "Al Qaeda."
Mubarak Receives Ereikat and an American Delegation; Cairo Opposes Excluding Arafat because He Represents Palestinian's Will
He added: "We told everyone that we support the will of the Palestinian people as expressed in the elections of 1996 in which Arafat was elected freely and democratically (...).  Next year's elections, declared by Arafat, will prove that."
The Egyptian Foreign Minister said that Ereikat carried a letter from Arafat to Mubarak, and reported that the Egyptian President stressed that his country will continue its contacts with all parties "until the Israel aggression on the Palestinian people ends and a real political process starts that will lead to the creation of an independent Palestinian state."
He said that "the Committee's delegation is conducting a tour in several of the countries in the region to become familiar with the circumstances and the reasons that led to September 11th, and preventing it from being repeated."
He pointed out that the delegation will conduct a visit to the Palestinian territories at a later time after visiting Israel, but he did not specify the Palestinian officials it will meet with.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the "FBI", repeated its recommendation to Americans to take extreme caution during the national day on the 4th of July, which is the first anniversary of independence since the September 11th attacks. The Spanish "El Payes" newspaper published that preparations were made for them in Tarragona in the north east of the country, through a "summit", which joined the supposed leader of the hijackers of the planes,  Mohammad Atta and his partners, used in those attacks.
But it did not declare a state of emergency in its ranks, in spite of establishing weeks ago a special center in Washington to coordinate security operations.
It listed the details of Atta's movements, moment by moment, based on records of airlines, the hotel, a car rental company, and his credit card, in addition to stories of some witnesses.
Then Adamat returned, on whom the newspaper did not list any information, to Madrid Airport and Atta headed, in a rental car, to Tarragona on the 9th of July, which is the same day in which Yemeni Ramzi bin Al Shabah, whom "El Payes" introduced as the "coordinator" of the attacks, to Tarragona from Hamburg.
It is not unlikely the participants in the "terrorism summit" have a coordinator in the region.
The "Maariv" newspaper mentioned yesterday, that there is a plan that is starting to crystallize amid the Palestinians that provides Yasser Arafat will abandon his position to Yasser Abed Rabbo, and move to Cairo.
The Palestinian sources mentioned that contacts started with the American administration in this regard, and that the Americans kept the door open to resume the discussion and development of the idea.
Contacts are underway with the Egyptian leadership to obtain its support for the plan.
But currently presented in Washington there are more questions than answers, such as: Should a regional conference be convened?
According to the repot the Israeli government considers the speech a victory of its policy, and it does find that it is required to do anything now, especially that the stage of resolving the war with the Palestinians has actually started.

Israel started building a security fence to protect Jerusalem from attacks by Palestinian suicidals, while continuing to penetrate self-rule areas and impose curfews on the cities of the West Bank, reoccupied as part of the "firm road" operation.

Accusations of Cooperating with Al Qaeda For New Attacks; "Hizbullah" Denies "Washington Post" Story
The weekend witnessed a slackening of the heated rivalry that escalated three days ago between Hariri and "Hizbullah" over the Awzae Bridge Project. More than one party close to both sides expressed a desire to turn the page on this rivalry and grant the opportunity to the reconciliatory efforts that seek to reach an agreement on a resolution to the Bridge Project that pleases both sides, after Hariri said that this project is part of a comprehensive development project for the Southern Suburb region.
It wrote that the experts in intelligence are expressing their concern "regarding this cooperation that additionally enhances the Al Qaeda capabilities of attacking American targets."
But the official in charge of the Central Media Unit in the "Party" Sheikh Hassan Izziddin replied to what the "Washington Post" reported, and said: "We have said more than once that there is no form of cooperation between Hizbullah and Al Qaeda Network, not on the logistics and field level or any other. These accusations and political claims promoted by American intelligence departments come as part of an attempt to instigate and mislead public opinion against the party in order to serve the goals of the Zionist enemy and covering its crimes against the Palestinian people."
But he added that he expects Syrian President Bashar Al Assad will adopt "a more moderate policy than the policy of his late father Hafiz Al Assad and some actions, such as the high level of cooperation in the war on terrorism, bear his stamp (Bashar Al Assad)."

That provides additional time to resolve the conflict with the Americans.
Spokesperson for the Holland Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Bart Yokimos stated that as of this morning, four employees at the interim office in the Hague "with a fax and a phone" can receive complaints until the permanent representatives are appointed early in 2003.
While the Secretary General of the United Nations Kofi Annan considered that the birth of this court is considered a historic event, Britain expressed "great disappointment" with the American position.
Former American President Bill Clinton did not sign the statue until the last days of his term, but his successor President George Bush recorded a precedent by declaring "a withdrawal of the signature" of the United States from it.
Anan said that the entry of the International Criminal Court into operation is considered a historic event "that confirms that the sovereignty of the law is at the heart of international relations."
She considered that "this is an enormous disappointment to all those in the world who want some basic rules for manners that apply to all rulers at all times, which means the elevation of the world."
However, former Minister of Justice, Yossi Belin, believed that the decision taken by the government is "stupid and disappointing."
Maronite Patriarch, Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Butros Sfeir, called on the government to provide for workers "work so that they can preserve their dignity" and expressed his sorrow that the resolutions of the Maronite Conference in Los Angeles were given more weight than they can handle.
We ask God that he inspires our officials, regarding worker issues, to work under the guidelines of Pope Leo the Thirteenth in his message: "Modern Affairs".
We must, in conclusion of what we said about the issues of work and workers, express our regret that some resolutions of the Maronite Conference, convened in Los Angeles last week, were given more weight than they can handle. We do not believe that anyone can deny the national values that every citizen loyal to his homeland defends, namely, sovereignty, independence and free decisions, keeping in mind that these values, if not entrenched in the will of the homeland's people who work together to achieve it, it is in vain that they seek it anywhere else."
Silver jubilee celebration of Al Chouf Development Council; Hamadi: Junblat continues to expand his dialogue and sovereign Lebanon is not the enemy of its surroundings; Hamadi

Deputy Nabil Bustani said: "It is no longer possible to depend on the state to achieve development. This is a fact that must be declared and publicized, and in view of a difficult financial situation we cannot promise ourselves that all the projects will see the light."
I say that and I call on everyone at an era that is the era of preparing the re-launch of national dialogue to prevent going back. We do not want to fall again into the trap of illusions and dreams of those who divide and separate Lebanese efforts, or become the victims of those who call for separation from our natural environment, our people and our national commitments, namely cooperation and coordination with our sister Syria. The positions of Walid Junblat, which some have tried to color as if they change from one stage to the next, these positions remained entrenched. Yes, Holy Abati (Nimr), Walid Junblat believes in our unity, solidarity and harmony in service of Lebanon the master. But the sovereign Lebanon is not the Lebanon that is the enemy of its surroundings, nor the Lebanon that sheds off its national allegiance and commitments.
In conclusion President of the Al Chouf Development Council Najib Al Ba'ini spoke, referring to the activity of the Council "which is an intellectual youth energy."

Yesterday, Bishop George Haddad celebrated at the Cathedral of the Lady of Safety in Zahleh, his first mass after being ordained as bishop, Apostolic Exarch for Argentina, in the presence of representatives of presidents Emil Lahoud, Nabih Berri and Rafic Hariri.
After the Bible Bishop Andre Haddad gave a speech in which he presented "a son of the children of this city, and a friar who worked in your services for several years, and was called by God to the rank of Bishop."
Hamada's words came in a speech he gave on behalf of Junblat at a celebration of the Al Shouf District Development Council at the "Al Shouf Tourism Complex" in Ba'qaleen, on the occasion of the silver jubilee of the Council.
The celebration was attended by former president of the Central Fund for the Displaced Shadi Mis'ed, Mayor of Burj Al-Mulouk Municipality Rizqallah Al Humsi, members of the Municipality Council, late Kamal Farah's family who donated the cost of construction, along with a group of believers of the congregation in the town and the neighborhood.
Brothers, we realize that we must sacrifice everything, even our bodies, for the Lord and for the salvation of mankind.
Signs and statues of non-Lebanese references and characters are increasing, which raises questions and ... sensitivities in some cases.
The "Democratic Dialogue Forum" in Al-Ghaziyyah hosted Bishop Gregoire Haddad in the presence of a group of dignitaries.
He added: "We do not accept a part of the Palestine, we want all of it so that Muslims, Christians and Jews can live on an equal basis."
He gave a speech in which he said: "Christianity and Islam in Lebanon are one sect, which is the sect of one Lebanon.

Deir Mimas, which means "The Convent of the Martyr Mama", or "Mamas" in Greek, falls at the foot of a mountain overlooking the Litani River, and is about 600 meters above sea level.
Beach and river-goers were few yesterday, because most Lebanese people were glued to their television screens watching the match between Brazil and Germany in the World Soccer Championship.

"Self-control" is the main title of the politics adopted by the Israeli army command on instructions from the political command. And with the arrival of Ariel Sharon to the premiership of the government in February 2001, an amendment was made to the Israeli traditional reply so that it includes Syrian goals in Lebanon. Consequently, Syria became directly responsible for any operation undertaken by the Party against Israel. That caused a group of regulations and pressures that reached a climax last March, when skirmishes between the Party and the Israelis almost led to a comprehensive confrontation that the Americans tried to repair by pressuring Syria to control "Hizbollah". That is what occurred, in fact, and the farmlands' front calmed, except for the launching of the Party's anti-missiles against the Israeli Air Force and the explosion of these anti-missiles near settlements adjacent to the borders, causing panic and terror.
The question that presents itself in light of the above is: does that mean Israel started to move towards a serious change in the policy of "self-control" it has adopted towards "Hizbollah" for the past months to avoid opening a "second front" that keeps it from its confrontations with the Palestinians?
The newspapers say Ye'alon, during his introductory visit to Washington, presented a plan of Israeli contribution to the war waged by the United States against terrorism, which provides for directing a strike to its centers in Lebanon when the American campaign to depose Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq starts.
Head of the European Commission Delegation in Lebanonm, Ambassador Patrick Reno, said: "The European Union does not aim to buy the Lebanese market through the European-Lebanese partnership agreement, but to give it access to a market that includes approximately half a billion consumers."
The Director General of Roads and Buildings at the Ministry of Public Works Fadi Nammar toured the roads of Baalbak city that need rehabilitation, paving and building, accompanied by Head of the Municipality, Ghaleb Yaghi, and engineers.
Last week, despite an overcast political climate in the country as a result of the competitions caused by a construction project named "Flying Bridge" in the Awza'i  area between the President of the Government and "Hizbollah", which could affect the investment environment, the currency market in Beirut remained far from interaction with these developments. The American dollar remained in supply, even if in small quantities. It sometimes exceeded trade and non-trade demand for it. It allowed the Bank of Lebanon to buy it at the exchange rates in order to reform its currency reserves, continuously drained since the beginning of the year.
This meeting, which opens at ten in the morning at the United Nations home, aims at providing the official framework to discuss proposals and formulate recommendations related to designing agendas of social development at ESCWA and methods of developing and improving them in the following fields: comprehensive social policies, housing policies, social merging, enabling women, merging social gender issues in the policies, programs and activities, civilization and housing development policies, and providing social statistical data.

The first session was convened in Amman on March 25-26, 1997.
The focus was on the main roads that link the city with the castle and the park.
- Expansion of the roads network, which is considered one of the important and necessary elements to increase the competence of the network and raise its level with regard to serving social and economic requirements.
- Mechanization of the Administration's work through adopting modern information technologies in management, accounting, planning and programming (...)."
He revealed: "There is a project for six international roads that link Lebanon and Syria, especially at Al Masna', Biqaa and the south, the coast and Biqaa, the Homs line and Al Masna' to the capital, and continuing the connection of Dahr Al Beidar - Al Masna' for economic purposes."
This was the Lebanese image from the outside. The viewpoints varied from excessive optimism to melancholic pessimism. The participants disagreed about diagnosing the malady, while some called for the exit of the Syrian army from Lebanon as a priority for reforming the country. The other side was of the opinion that the problem lies within the sectarian system. One of them summed it up by saying: "Lebanon used to own its full sovereignty in the past, yet, it was a farm to the powers that be."
The recent battle between "Future" and "Manar" stations against the backdrop of what happened at Al Awzai, shows that the division among the Lebanese emigrants did not come out of coincidence and that the microbe of sectarianism, which started to crawl in the emigrant body will not stop as long as the Ministry of Information does not move and the National Council for Television and Radio stands by with hands tied, while local televisions engage in washing the Lebanese's dirty linen in public in this tragic way.
Colleges and institutes, whatever their type, have introduced several opportunities to pursue your post-graduate studies and provide you with the most recent scientific achievements."
Minister Ghassan Salameh said, "I, like you, read the newspapers, which tell us that the hospitals are pressing the government for payments that they have not received until today. This affects the work of their teams.
This situation contributes to the waste of public funds.
However, retrieving this role, especially in the hospitalization sector, requires much from us, particularly in relation to bills for hospitalization, and enables Lebanon to intensify research, in addition to working on improving the image of Lebanon in the surroundings in general.
The audience left while the university alma mater was being played.
After the orchestra played selections from "Carmen", the most popular opera by Bizet, it accompanied Al-Qawwas in her operatic singing of arias from ( ) opera by Puccini, ( ) opera also by Puccini and from a modern musical comedy by Andrew Lloyd Weber.
Hiba Al-Qawwas blends, in her music, delicate transparency with wild strength, loading it with the spirit of the East and the West and blowing in it a new unique voice building a bridge between classical and neoclassical, on the one hand, and the contemporary music on the other.
It is certain that Hiba is a good reader of poetry, because the music she composes for each poem she chooses is congruent to the internal atmosphere of the poem and the core and essence, so that the music wears the poetry until they overlap as water overlaps land.
The music of "I Have Known Beirut" has been distinguished as if it were a symphonic work orchestrated for one hundred instruments. It resembles a short epic composed with love and tenderness for the city of Beirut, which awarded her the City Shield in the name of its Mayor, Abdul Mum'im Al-Arees, before the warm applause by an audience that never quenched its thirst from the spring of music and demanded to listen more to the fountains of the spirit.
The first station of Bishop Riyashi and the delegation accompanying him was in Al- Mseileh, where they were received by Berri, member of the presidency board of the "Amal" Movement, Sheikh Hassan Al-Masri, and the General Commissioner of the Islamic Mission Scouts, Hassan Hamdan.
She added: "Such a visit definitely contributes to healing the wounds that we have always wished to take care of and to weave health and vigor with out love and hearts". She considered that "this meeting is a domestic and humanitarian one" and asked "all Lebanese to offer more love and loyalty to Lebanon."
In his turn, Mr. Khreis welcomed the delegation and pointed out, "the importance of the historical site of the Cave of the Messiah and its implications in Qana, where this very region of Lebanon managed to translate the dictionary of national unity that led to defeating the Israeli enemy."
Schools from all regions say goodbye to the school year.

The President of Al-Maqased Hospital, Engineer Al-Da'uuq, said: "The medical foundations of Lebanon have carried the burdens of the citizen's health for more than 20 years. The Ministry of Health, the Social Security Department, the financial insuring organizations and others support health in Lebanon. But, support comes several months after the end of the medical work, indeed, in some cases after two years."
The importance of these States increases during economic crises that throw their burden on the citizen and the Ministry's budget at the same time. This also is reflected on hospitals, doctors, and all workers in this sector. Nevertheless, this daily concern  has not prevented the Ministry of Health from planning and taking organizational steps that are considered to be within the backbone of its tasks."

He said:  "They have gone too far in daring and they want to separate politics from religion and they talk openly about secularism."
He said: "At this time, during which we are being subjected specifically to continuous American criticisms concerning human rights and the absence of political and economic openness, the suspension of newspapers and the harsh verdicts passed against the personalities of the Iran Liberation Movement is harmful to the country."
In the meantime, the spokesman for the Iranian Government, Abdullah Ramadan Zadah, declared at a news conference that  "Iran does not see threats from the Americans, but we must, naturally, be vigilant and ready for any possibility (...). We are ready to defend the entire country."

President Leonid Kutchma dismissed Sterlinkoff on the same day of the catastrophe and put him in protective detention. The charge of committing "professional negligence" in organizing the air show may be lodged against him.
The national assembly in South Korea embarrassed President Kim Day Jong yesterday by refusing to approve the appointment of his candidate, Mrs. Chang Sang, as prime minister to be the first woman in the country's history to assume this post.

After 12 years of the Iraqi invasion to Kuwait, relations between the two countries are still tense, despite Baghdad initiatives for openness and its recurrent calls for closing the page of the past.
Last May, Baghdad pledged to the Arab League to return to Kuwait through the United Nation military observation team, which carries out patrols along the border between the two countries, its national archives and official documents captured by the Iraqi army during the invasion of 1990.
The Iraqi official renewed Iraq's preparedness to improve relations at all levels, saying "the other side should halt the information campaigns, stop the takeoff of American and British planes towards Iraq from its bases, and meet the positive Iraqi steps by ensuring good intentions.
The Iraq president said, "This subject will be resolved through search and investigation in good faith, and away from external intervention, if it were wished that this problem were to be resolved for good."
The Undersecretary of the Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry, Khaled Al-Jarallah, had finally emphasized that Iraq still constituted a threat to Kuwait and the region.
While the Kuwaiti people appreciated the speed with which the government moved to respond to tension prevailing in the region, yet this did not contribute much to eliminate its fears of potential Iraqi vengeance operations with chemical and biological weapons.

American Secretary of Energy Abraham Spencer and American State Department Deputy John Bolton, who are charged with the issues of monitoring weapons, and are currently visiting Moscow, met with Russian Minister of Nuclear Energy Alexander Rumyantsev amid the escalation of American fears of the nuclear cooperation present between Russia and Iran. Washington had always called for its stop so that it does not lead to Tehran obtaining the nuclear bomb.
It added that "Russia does not intend to violate its international commitments with regard to banning proliferation" of nuclear weapons.
The Russian - Iranian nuclear cooperation was the most prominent disagreement point between Presidents George Bush and Vladimir Putin during their summit in Moscow in May.
Deputy spokesperson for the American State Department Philip Ricker was asked to comment on the matter. He replied: "I believe the matter is purely hypothetical, merely predictions."
Since the attacks the United States was subjected to on September 11th, Bush's Administration has become more determined to pressure countries supplying Iran and the other countries in the "axis of evil" with weapons of mass destruction technology.

He said: "There have been a number of people at the Guantanamo Base prison for a few months, and they were at one time or another a part of the force charged with guarding him."

Juan Diego First Indian Declared Saint by Pope in Mexico
Some watched the celebration on giant screens raised in the streets, and jumped jubilantly when Juan Diego was declared a saint. It is worth noting that the majority of them glimpsed the Pope only when he passed, but that was enough.
The "Papa Mobile" car passed through the famous Zukalu Square, where there is the largest cathedral in Latin America.
Dancers wearing Aztec feather costumes started beating Indian drums and blowing through oyster shells, while a picture of the new saint was being carried to the alter.
He added that it "facilitated the fruitful meeting of two worlds, and became the catalyst of the new Mexican identity."

The Turkish House of Deputies voted a bill that provides for conducting early elections on the 3rd of next November, 18 months before their original date, putting an end to the political instability that was caused by the bad health of Prime Minister Pulent Ecivit.
Among the sensitive issues presented is the expansion of the rights of the Kurdish language and ending the implementation of the death penalty for crimes committed in times of peace.
He noted that "It is not possible to say yes to some rules of the European Union and no to other rules."
Lifting the emergency status is a basic condition for the nomination of Turkey to the membership of the European Union, and must be met before membership talks start with Brussels.
Despite his agreement with his partners in the government on the call for early elections, Ecivit repeatedly warned that the elections could hinder efforts to lift the Turkish economy from a severe recession.
Yesterday, the Egyptian State Security Court issued prison sentences that varied between five years and 15 years against 31 persons, among them a former minister and parliamentarians, after their conviction of granting loans or financial credit, or obtaining loans in the value of 200 million dollars without guarantees.

The Palestinian Authority received 70 billion shekels (15 million dollars), the first installment of the freed funds held by Israel since the beginning of the Aqsa Intifada in September 2000.
Israel stipulated imposing an Israeli and international monitoring commission on the spending of the funds the Authority is receiving from donor countries. It also tried to link handing the funds due to the Authority with subjecting these funds to Israeli monitoring.
He noted that the efforts to relieve the Palestinian people, which Israel announces without implementing, are part of a public relations campaign under international pressure that coincides with the start of the countdown for directing an American military strike against Iraq, and America's need to avoid any side pains that result from the escalation of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories.
The giant "America On Line Time Warner Incorporated" Company, in the field of media and Internet services, declared yesterday that the Department of Justice started investigating its accounts, noting that the Securities and Exchange Commission is also reviewing these accounts.
The spokesperson for the company Trisha Primrose refused to make any statement or comment on what was in the statement.
The investigation is related to exaggerating media returns at "America On Line" estimated at 270 million dollars, which is a relatively small figure in a company whose returns amount to 38 billion dollars annually.
The "Washington Post" newspaper had criticized in a series of investigative reports what it called "unconventional" methods of increasing the revenues of "America On Line".

The horrible crime whose victims were eight employees at the Solidarity Fund for the Private Education Teachers near the ministry of Education, reveals, in some of its results, the fragility of the Lebanese civil peace, in addition to the danger of the relationships between the sects.
Yesterday's crime and its results that were not all declared to everyone, that the sectarian and religious fabric in the country is still governed by relations that are troubled and easy to bring out in a confrontational state.
This talk is not just a "cliché".
We hope that yesterday's crimes will be an occasion for the families of the victims and the surrounding environment to stop at the borders of the crime itself.
Lebanese "Horror Movie"!
Because the facts related to the rising conflict between the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister on the issue of privatizing the cellular telephone was ominous of "spreading evil" that can blow the Minister's Council like a booby-trapped car. There are those who do not hesitate to say that Lebanon could splinter and that we are only hours away from the zero hour!
The train of Emil Lahoud carrying gunpowder and heading strong and fast with no room to change or amend its course, and the train of Rafic Hariri carrying dynamite and going also strong and fast with no room to change or amend its course.

But the policies of terror, or rather the terror trains, continued to push towards the explosion point, to stop at the last minute yesterday, in the hope that this stopping would  continue!

But the situation in Jerusalem is different. The city is open and no wall was built around it. It made entry into the city relatively easy, in addition to the fact that the army has to lift the siege imposed on the cities by day and impose it by night only in order to alleviate the lives of Palestinian civilians during the day. However, that gives the saboteurs the freedom to maneuver."
In case the Secretary General of the Party, Hasan Nasrallah, gave a positive answer, it would be possible to make a deal with him through mediators.
Bern calls in his article on the United States to replace the strike on Iraq with a strike on "Hizbollah".

The General Prosecutor Hatem Madi said "The reasons for the crime are financial and personal, and there are no other motives for it." He said: "Every person or party that says otherwise subjects himself to criminal prosecution because he is hindering the work of the investigation."
He explained that he will present today this issue to the Minister's Council "to take the appropriate measures with regard to it".
Lawyer Khalil Ma'touq saw that the verdicts "are very unfair and are not based on any legal basis. They are aimed at silencing the other opinion, oppressing it, and stopping the direction of criticism to the faults and transgressions in our countries".
Ma'touq reported Dalilah as saying,  "I did not have the opportunity to present a defense at all, and I did not meet with the lawyers according to the trials' proper procedures."
The judge preferred to focus on the first charge.
The Criminal Court in Damascus had sentenced deputies Ma'moun Al Humsi and Riyadh Seif in March and April to five years in prison "for aiming to change the constitution with illegal methods".
Lawyer Anwar Al Bunni said that Dalilah gave a "lecture in September 2001 in which he clarified all the negative aspects of the management of the economy".
The verdict in their case was postponed to August 19th.
Statement by 13 Deputies on Cellular: We Refuse to Be Put Before Status Quo By Hariri
We either accept his presentation in the cellular file or we are accused of torpedoing the Paris 2 Conference and endangering economic stability, as well as harming Lebanese-French relations.
Second, the Prime Minister has declared before the joint parliamentary committees that the two contracts signed with the two cellular companies are the best in the world and despite that, he annulled them, because one of his relatives is a shareholder in one of the two companies and he does not want that to be a reason for blackmailing him.

To the Qurnet Shahwan Meeting we say: We agree with you in the goals, and disagree with the methods.
But we disagree with the Qurnet Shahwan Meeting in terms of performance, in terms of internal charging, fighting with the government, hostility towards Syria and betting on regional changes.

In answer to a question Qandil asked: "Why is it that every time there is a meeting among Muslims, there are suspect questions and accusations directed, and when the attendees are from another sectarian color there are a thousand and one excuses?"
What happened led to a reaction, stiffening and charging in the Islamic street.
He added: "The forum is of one color but its speech is national and not sectarian. It aims to absorb the sectarian charging that took place on the Islamic street due to what they did in Los Angeles and Paris."

But who did this government include?
The Imam wanted to contribute to the making of the Lebanese citizen whatever his belief, and melt him into the melting pot of one Lebanese society to protect his identity and work on creating the right climate to maintain Lebanon and its people.
The idea of one head in the party system still dominates us to think as the president wants, and work based on his will.
The tragedy of remaining silent to the fact that some of their leaders read the books of others, and do not read anything of the writers of the homeland.

Minister of Tourism Visits Archbishop Awdah: Lebanon One of Safest Countries.
He was asked whether this year's tourist season had met with expectations. He answered, "The tourist seasons was better than last year's tourist season.
And do the recurring security incidents affect the tourist season? He responded, "Security incidents are regrettable and we feel pain and sympathize with the families of victims.

A collection of three books dealing with the history of the Zionist movement and the establishment of the State of Israel.
- This was a horrific massacre and a crime against humanity. It is a clear breach of all international laws because it targeted a residential complex swarming with civilians and did not distinguish between them.
We say that there must be a response to this aggression and this crime. As regards how this response is effected, this is for the military wing of the Hamas Movement to decide.
I looked into the matter, which took me a long time, because it was the first piece of research that I conducted after beginning my university training.
* How do you describe the operation to assassinate Sheikh Salah Shahadah, which resulted in the deaths of a large number of Palestinian civilians?
- We, in the political apparatus, cannot decide the nature of the response. This is the responsibility of the military wing of the Movement, which will describe where, when and how the response will be made to the Zionist attacks.
* So you did not agree to ending martyrdom operations?
*Now, in the wake of the Gaza massacre and the assassination of Sheikh Salah Shahadah, do these conditions still stand?
*Do you believe that the talks taking place between the Palestinian and Israeli sides are beneficial for the Palestinian issue?
When Israeli perpetrates a massacre, the American administration says that this will not serve peace, whilst putting us on the list of terrorist organizations when we defend ourselves against the Zionist occupation and suppression.
* What call do you address to the Arab peoples?
The administration of President George Bush has succeeded in persuading the world that there can be no return from its decision to intervene.
In the United States itself the decision is on the agenda of all organizations, the latest of which is the Foreign Affairs Committee in Congress.
The French-German position, expressed by the recent Chirac-Schroeder summit, has put the invasion of Iraq back in its "conventional" framework.
The invasion of Afghanistan did not need a resolution from the United Nations, but the response to the events of 11 September was obvious to the extent that the United States' failure to resort to the international organization was not a result of the fear that it would not obtain a resolution, and by consensus.
But, if we assume that we will one morning wake up and see Bush ignoring all the opposition, relying on the idea that the United States, the only superpower, does not need the agreement of anyone, then how will it commence its operations?
This is not to mention the geographical aspect, for from where will they set out?
Perhaps the magic plan is a mix of local uprisings and localized American intervention. But is this sufficient for the task of changing the government in Iraq?
If, for the sake of argument, we assume that the American President is maneuvering and that what is meant by all this "military parading" is to force Baghdad to accept the return of the international inspectors to Iraq, we can find nothing in his diplomatic moves to indicate that he is interested in assembling an international front able to force this on Baghdad, despite the fact that the elements for such a front are available.

He said, "The name of Lebanon had been placed on the list of non-cooperating countries in the field of combating money laundering, for reasons the pretext for which was perhaps very weak. There was a joint effort on the part of all those concerned to remove Lebanon's name from this list.
Dr Buasiri then presented an overview of "the practical steps and measures taken by Lebanon in the area of combating money laundering, commencing with Law 318, dated 20 April 2001 and the general directives subsequently issued by the Bank of Lebanon".

The second issue of volume 30 of the "Social Sciences Journal" has been published. It contains five pieces of research:
The third research is "The Approach towards the Computer...A Comparative Study by Gender and Other Variables" by Ibrahim Shawqi Abd Al-Hamid. It examines the differences between the sexes in the approach towards the computer among a sample of male and female university students. The most important results of this research are that males and females have the same preferences in their approach towards the computer in that the differences between the sexes are limited to the factor of computer anxiety, with females displaying more anxiety than males. This explains why males own and use computers more than females.
The fifth research is "Changes in Values and the Implications for the Situation of Women in Emirates Society - a Comparative Field Study among Working and Non-working Educated Women" by Muhammad Abdallah Al-Mutawwa. It charts the changes that have affected the social value system and their implications for the situation and status of Emirates women, and reaches a number of conclusions, including: a) Education has played a key role in changing many of the social values relating to the situation and status of women in society and their role in social upbringing and their ability to confront problems.

SS is the title of his disc, and a title for his spirit, noble art and the behavior of an artist who has perfected the mix between mechanical engineering and music as he likes it: Blues and Jazz.
He has made the first song, "Blues to Pierre", a sweet memory to the late Pierre Abu Khatir for his humanitarian services and for founding the branch of the Saint Jude Hospital at the American University. He is accompanied for this song by Zaina singing, with Roli Jibril on the drums, Akram Sultan on keyboards, and a female group comprising Claudia Ramlah, Nadiya Wiltson and Regina Korating.
His father, Nicola Bukhaazi, father and companion, is with him, composing the lyrics of his songs for his son, if not more - teaching his son the truth about blues and its traditions, accompanying him as the lyricist and leaving the inspiration for the music to him.
When Sergio was forced to work with a company in Dubai, the group continued to practice its weekly hobby.
The atmosphere of "Blue Note" redolent with a sleepless ambience called this young man to celebrate the joy of jazz with the compassion of the blues.
The scene of the crime was a building that was supposed to be an educational structure. But the sanctity of the place did not stop Ahmad Ali Mansur (aged 46) from carrying out his crime in cold blood, when he stormed the building where he had worked for 24 years carrying two military automatic weapons and a revolver. No sooner had he surprised his work colleagues on the third floor than he began to open fire with his automatics randomly, pointing his guns at the heads and chests of his colleagues without compassion or mercy, and without giving any consideration for the long time they had spent together.
In expression of the condemnation, and in mourning for the souls of the victims, marking work stopped and all educational and teaching sectors stopped work for the whole day. Statements of condemnation were issued by a number of ministers, deputies and parties, who demanded that the authority of security be implemented and that the harshest sentence be given to the killer. Some expressed surprise that the killer had been able to bring the weapon into the Fund building.
She was always active, a smile never leaving her face.

Written by Claudit Sirkis:
Faced with this terrible scene, one that recalls violent films, those present began to scream, run and flee.
My being sought for money represented a financial pressure and burden on me. So I determined to kill four or five people in revenge. There was nothing for me to lose, because they killed me financially.
My family does not know what happened and there was no one behind me. All there is to it is that I felt financial pressure and wanted revenge."
In response to a question, they said that there was no guard at the entrance to the building and that it was difficult to conceive that the bag he was carrying contained weapons and ammunition, reckoned to be about one hundred bullets, in addition to a hand grenade.
He said that any person or organization saying otherwise would expose himself to criminal action for obstructing the progress of the investigation.
He went to the hospitals, where he examined the wounded but was unable to hear their statements as they were being treated.

Minister Asad Diyab played patron to a graduation ceremony for students of the Al-Kafaat Technical Institute and its Academic School at the Al-Kafaat Complex Theatre in Ain Saadah in the presence of its founder Nadim Shuwairi and the Council of Trustees.
He hoped that the future relationship with this partnership would be one of equals and not "a partnership of backward subservience".
The Chairman of the Council of Trustees, Dr Ramiz Awwad, then spoke. He congratulated the students and thanked the Ministry of Social Affairs for its patronage of and constant support for the Institute.
Minister Diyab then addressed the graduates. He said, "(...) Each institution has its own basis, and this institution is based on "aspiration" not "greed".
Faith unites. Sectarianism divides.
With Al-Kafaat, we do not give our speech and then leave. Rather we stand and examine the truth and the quality (...). We move on to quality because globalization imposes competition over large areas of the world, not merely internal or regional competition.
If this does not happen, then we will continue to sing of Qadmus and Carthage. And singing is futile.
I am against an absolute suspension of university licenses. For had we thought of this three years ago, we would not now have had Al-Kafaat.
On this basis, the importance of higher education lies in drawing up rules and conditions. The large universities will remain large and the small will not get bigger."
But we should not put off politics if some engage in it to further themselves or on an unsound basis. What we fear in every field is when the politician is not educated and when the educated man turns himself into a politician. The most important thing lies in distinguishing between the ideals of politics and those who engage in it."

Fattah gave Talawi's speech and noted, "The Arab states are rich in intellectual property, but there is poor exploitation on the part of thinkers and intellectuals in building a scientific and intellectual base in order to help the economic renaissance and increase development rates". He believed, "What has impacted on the Arab states is their transformation into mere receivers of what developed states produce, which has increased their imports and made them a key market over which a number of industrial nations compete."
The works of great men are evidence of who they are and the traces they leave behind are not effaced, but live on.
Turki Al-Hamad, the author, asks: Were these people of those who make the flow of history?
They did not belong to one world or one ideology, but came from many countries in the world.
He adds that the question remains a concern for the spirit and a constraint for the mind and humankind, for can history truly end?
One cannot say that these individuals are the most distinguished and influential in an absolute sense. But one can say that they are such to the conviction of the writer and his relative beliefs.
And the key to the personality, as Abbas Mahmoud Al-Aqqad defines it is the "small tool" that opens for us its doors and takes us behind its walls and bulwarks. In many respects and for many purposes, it is like the key to the house.
The heroic factors may be present in the individual all the time.

Preparations Start for Historic Summit Between Koizumi and Kim; North Korea Defends Its Missile Program, Blames American Sanctions Against It; Sanctions.
Tokyo, which is keen to ensure the success of Koizumi's visit, sent the Director General for the Asian and Oceanian Area Department at the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hitoshi Tanaka, to the Chinese capital Beijing yesterday to hold talks with North Korean officials there.
Talks between the two countries stumbled for two years on account of a number of issues, including Pyongyang's demand that Tokyo apologize for its colonization of the Korean peninsula between 1910 and 1945 and Tokyo's concern for lost Japanese, whom they say were kidnapped and taken to North Korea.
Elsewhere, the North "Korean Central News Agency" reported that "the issue of missiles possessed by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" (North) has nothing to do with the American sanctions against this country.

European Union Foreign Ministers meeting at Ellsinore in Denmark, which holds the rotating Presidency of the Union, have supported the Middle East peace plan prepared by Copenhagen.
He clarified that he would meet Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Chairman of the Palestinian Authority Yasir Arafat.
The Danish plan provides for the declaration of a Palestinian State in August 2003, the borders of which will be temporary until it is finally established in June 2005.
He confirmed that the 15 Member States of the European Union "support the United Nations completely" on the Iraq crisis.
There is consequently no justification for taking a decision on a hypothetical war."
He spoke during a press conference about "the massive danger and impossibility of evaluating the risks (associated with a conflict in Iraq) in the long and short term".
He added, "The Security Council should also examine the available options, including the military one."

The Assistant Deputy Minister at the Palestinian Ministry of Education, Abdallah Abd Al-Manim said, "The new academic year begins in difficult and very complex circumstances on account of the complete occupation, the imposition of the curfew and the Israeli obstacles to the movement of pupils and teachers and other citizens from one area to another."
He said, "The massive damage caused by Israeli practices has had a dangerous psychological impact on children and pupils who have come to live under daily terrorism". He noted, "The Ministry has been able to conduct activities to lighten these destructive psychological effects and we will implement a plan drawn up by the Ministry, which includes 48 activities, such as drawing, music, entertainment and summer camps."
The new academic year comes at a time of increasing unemployment, which has exceeded 70% in the Gaza Strip and West Bank.
The delegation of economic organizations that met with the Prime Minister only needed to ask for the 26th of August of each year to be made a national celebration for popular joy, prayers of thanks and the burning of incense.
To be clearer, because the warm winds between the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister have helped to bring about this miracle, which no one expected.
The unbelievable state of the public sector does not lie in the flood of surplus employees, whose productivity had been stopped whilst their salaries and allowances continue, but also in the army of self-styled courtiers, beneficiaries and companions who have been imposed on the departments, organizations and sections, and have thereby become employees by benefit, not by work or production.
In addition, for example, to the 32 Director Generals transferred to provisional retirement and whose salaries, allowances, bonuses and transport allowance are still paid when they do not work!"

Tens of people gathered yesterday before the flame of freedom above the l'Alma Bridge in Paris in commemoration of the death of Princess Diana in a car crash at that location five years ago.
A poem addressed to the "Lovely Princess" had been written near one of the pictures of Princess Diana, which begins with the words, "Five years have passed".
On the one hand, the people were in grief and millions of Britains laid flowers before the home of the dead Princess in London and followed her funeral.
Five years later and the Royal Family has learnt the lessons of this chapter and taken inspiration from the "Queen of Hearts" to become more modern, more human and closer to the British people.
Last week he sent a letter of condolence to the families of the two girls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, whose murder provoked shock in Britain.
The Queen, aged 76, perhaps also because of her grief for her sister and mother, who died this year, gained popular support unprecedented in more than 12 years on the occasion of her Golden Jubilee as Queen of Britain.
He added that all that Diana had done was to intensify the crisis of a monarchy that had to find its place in a modern society and appear to be close to the people without losing its dignity.

His visit to the area of Al-Batrun yesterday and his meeting with Patriarch Safir on this occasion came in the wake of his meeting with the "Qarnat Shahwan Forum" and the "Consultative Forum". In both these forums the role of the Maronite Patriarch was forcefully present in the discussions that took place and which reflected a complete conviction that the stances of the Patriarch must become a focus for serious dialogue, one that could be successful, as well as being a focus for all contacts relating to the apostolic milieu.
The role of Deputy Michel Al-Murr in the preparation for these receptions has become clear. In this context we also note that Al-Matan will be the third area within the framework of similar visits undertaken by the President of the Republic, following Ukkar and Kasrawan. The Beqaa will probably be the fourth stop, where Lahud is expected to lay the foundation stone for the Al-Asi dam.
In this respect we note that the matter of holding the Paris 2 Conference next autumn represents the focus of communications taking place between Al-Hariri and the Gulf States. The Prime Minister previously confirmed that they would participate in this conference.
He said, "Syria is an extension of the Lebanese national will. Everyone must know that Syria is the only State surrounding us. There are no other borders."
He repeated the demand "to deal with justice and equality in all cases brought forward because injustice will inevitably kindle hatred in the spirit and represents a rejectionist factor, one that will negatively reflect on the progress of the State, and weaken confidence in the judiciary, which we want to be just."
He said, "Some official agencies have taken upon themselves the task of keeping us in a continuous state of anxiety."
Can one thus be reassured as to the aim of the desired dialogue?"
Regarding the previous statements he had made indicating his readiness to visit Syria, he said, "I was asked whether I was prepared to visit Syria, and I answered yes because I am not of those who wish to bear the sword of vengeance against Syria.
But I am ready for dialogue when this is possible."
Regarding his relations with President Emil Lahud, he said, "There is no relationship between us. He took a negative stance, which I have not reciprocated."
Despite what I have heard and read about mothers who gave birth to more than one baby, this is the first time - and it should be recorded in the Guinness Book of Records - that I have heard of a mother giving birth to forty-two in one go. May God be praised that their number was not forty, because then there would have been the jokes about Ali Baba and the forty thieves, or forty days of mourning, or the forty days in which a man can have sex with his wife after she has given birth. And as for the forty-four legged centipede, well, it just doesn't fit in with them.
The youths sat down, drank water and juice and enjoyed the electricity, the tables with their sheets and the preparation. And everything, everything is due to you, Ahmad (to whom the cheers and ceremony are directed).
Well-informed sources have noted that Lebanon is not afraid of the Israeli threats, which have increased following the operation mounted by "Hizbollah" against the Al-Samaqah and Ruisah Al-Ilm locations in the occupied Shabaa Farms, which resulted in three Israeli soldiers being wounded.
They played down the importance of the leaks that have filled the Israeli media, believing that talk of American Deputy Assistant Secretary of State David Satterfield communicating an Israeli threat to Lebanon and a "stern warning" to Syria was "futile old-new talk".
It had not restricted itself to causing trouble between Lebanon, Syria and America and accusing Hizbollah of links to Iraq.
They believed that, in terms of form, an Israeli Defense Minister could not charge an American official on a mission because that would be viewed as a transgression of the interests of the state and violation of its sovereignty. More obviously, the American Defense Secretary could charge Satterfield with the mission of pointing out to Lebanon, Syria and Israel the danger of the military maneuvers, the fear of escalation, and action to delay them before they escalate.
Deputy Qaisar Muawwad described the meeting of the "Consultative Forum" with President Emil Lahud the day before yesterday as "very positive", citing President Lahud's confirmation offering his patronage to the dialogue.
Muawwad commented on the meeting, saying: "The occasion was foremost a social one and then became a political meeting as a result of the heavy political presence, which dealt with numerous topics, including the positive effects of the "Consultative Forum" statement, especially in the North, which has always been at the forefront of life in common and proposing a unifying national message.
Regarding the meeting with the President of the Republic he said: "The meeting was very positive, especially as it established the readiness of the groups, no matter how much they differ, for dialogue and cooperation. President Lahud confirmed the maxims on which the Constitution is based and in which we believe. President Lahud said that he was patron of the dialogue and not a party to it. The parties to the dialogue must prepare the necessary working papers, the focus of the debate, and determine the working mechanisms. The State, at the head of which stands President Lahud, shall provide the patronage for this dialogue."
Then there are the incomes from interest and profits from treasury bonds or bank interest, the annual revenue from which is more than five billion dollars. We cannot object to imposing tax on these bonds and interest at a rate of 10%, thereby securing 500 million dollars for the budget without violating the confidentiality of the banks or impeding their freedom of movement.
Therefore, if we do not carry out administrative reform and equip the administration, an increase of four or eight hours will be to no avail (...)".
"On investigation and consultation, it transpired that the convict Habib Antoine Yunis had presented, by means of his agent, attorney Riyadh Matar, an application recorded under number 59, dated 27/08/2002, seeking an explanation of the ruling issued by this Court on 11/07/2002, under number 191, to ascertain whether the punishment imposed on him under this ruling included the removal and taking away of his civil rights or not.
Consequently, we rule by consensus to confirm that the ruling issued by it against the applicant Habib Antoine Yunis on 11/07/2002, under number 191, does not, in light of the punishment imposed on him, give rise to the removal or taking away of his civil rights in any form."
About twenty of the passengers on the bus were injured in the accident, which took place last Friday on a main road near the village of Tarif, in the west of Saudi Arabia, according to the "Al-Watan" newspaper.

In 1998 they said that we were not from Tripoli and that we did not belong to the town. We continued to work in the manner we had adopted, expressing our sense of belonging and our loyalty to this town.
We understand that anyone who wants to do so may meet with whomever they will and that there may be a meeting of interests, especially given the differences and intrusion of political cover in finance and the authority.
We are with those who call for integrated competition.
He added, "If these ideas gain their poison and direction from the great international conspiracy against the Arab World, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, we say to them that the faithful from every sect continue to have a high degree of awareness, rationality, unity and accord with which to abort every move to assault Lebanese security in the name of this fairy tale put forward today under so-called national dialogue and national conference. We say: a dialogue between whom and whom?
For the nation is secure. Its constitutions, laws and regulations are stable. Its Arab character and goal has stabilized.

He then received a delegation from the Ain Wazain Municipality, including municipal head Nazih Al-Husniyah and members of the municipal council, and another delegation from the Youth and Baqlin Activities Conference Monitoring Committee, which thanked him for attending the Conference.
Al-Hariri also met Second Deputy Saudi Prime Minister and Minister of Defense and Aviation Sultan bin Abd Al-Aziz at his office in Jedda.
He explained, "The Forum will, in its next meeting, study the expansion towards forces outside the parliament and will also put forward a conceptualization of the dialogue mechanism."
He indicated his readiness to join the Forum "when it becomes inclusively nationalistic".

This national treasure suffered greatly during the occupation, the shells from which started fires in the mountains, fields and plains. To date it continues to suffer a more deadly enemy, however, represented in the fires that consume the earth and desiccate its flora.
As an example of this, Mt. "Aburkarb", which overlooks the village of Armati from the north, which held thick forests of oaks and wild pines, was completely burnt. "Khallat Khazin" was also severely damaged, with about six thousand dunums being burnt from a total of ten thousand.
Sources confirm that the fires in the last three years have focused on the forests of Ariyah, Bahnin, Malikh, Al-Aishiyah, Mt Safi and the areas of Basaliyya, Birtai and Rimat, most of which are oak and wild and air pines.
Among the most obvious reasons for the fires are the impossibility of clearing the forests from branches and dry grasses which help spread the fire and the fact that the Ministry of Agriculture will not allow the forests to be cut down and agricultural roads built in them to facilitate the movement of fire engines to the site of fires.

During the Israeli occupation, these forests were the subject of a major maltreatment operation, especially in terms of the fires that broke out in them, in addition to the incendiary shells. The fire swept through great expanses leaving the land empty and arid.
The Al-Rihan Stretch, which overlooks the town from the West and which contains thick oak trees, and which stood as a stronghold for resistance fighters attacking Israeli bases, was no less unfortunate: the Israeli forces, adopting a scorched-earth policy, burnt it.
The largest fires to have affected the area of Jazin and continued for three days in succession broke out in the forests of Qituli, Al-Humusiyyah, Al-Qabaa and Rum. This took place on 30 July.
There is another reason: the presence of just three observers in the Jazin Forestry Center who are unable to monitor and cover this expanse of forest.

Lebanon has come to resemble an archipelago of sectarian and factional islands, brought together by geography, which can only be linked by political channels and social boats.
The sectarian war in Lebanon began to come to an end when representatives of the people met in Al-Taif to affirm Lebanon's new constitution, including Article Ninety-Five, which stipulates as follows: "The Council of Deputies elected equally between Muslims and Christians shall adopt appropriate measures to achieve the abolition of political sectarianism under a phased plan and shall form a national body to be chaired by the President of the Republic ...", the function of which shall be "to study and propose ways to abolish sectarianism".

- Fifty Years Since the 1948 War.
In the presence of the Minister of Public Works, the Director General of this Ministry and the Director of Transport, the Prime Minister yesterday morning met in his office in the palace Mr. Lanhen, President of the Mediterranean Company, who had come to inform the Government of the Board's decision to establish a petrol refinery in the Al-Zahrani area, near the Al-Tablin center, and that the company would send one of its senior engineers during next September to draw up the designs necessary for the project.
The inhabitants of Pyongyang were warned by leaflets and radio close to the time of the raid. Among the targets were the anti-aircraft artillery batteries in Pyongyang.
The girl enters her grandmother's house, undresses and joins the wolf in bed.
Catherine Orenstein's new book "Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked" published by Big Books allows the investigation, enquiry and pursuit of the stages in which the story/legend was created and what we can discover about every culture that adopted it.
Instead of the two big legs, the wolf came to have two large paws "all the better to hold you" and two big eyes "all the better to see you". The Grim Brothers preserved the masculine standards of the time, sending a man to rescue Little Red Riding Hood, who resisted the wolf, filled his stomach with stones and left him to die.
The book provides an opportunity to re-examine this power once more, as well as providing a historical overview and a better understanding of the strange details in the story.
But what are the roots of and the background to the wolf?
She gets distracted by various ideas, which amount to the statement that the fictional story and immoral writings portray the submissive heroine accepting her fate as a means of sexual entertainment for men.
The French Foreign Ministry confirmed yesterday that four of its subjects were being detained in Yemen without "any official charge yet" being directed against them.
He said, "The security forces detained the four in the town of Yafi (60 km north of Aden) three days after they first appeared at a mosque in the town." He noted, "They speak Arabic, which made us think that they were of Arab origin."
They added that eight others were wounded, including the son of Abdallah Al-Ahmar and that "two of the wounded, one a police officer, were in a serious condition in intensive care".

However, Washington requires Turkish military cooperation, in particular the use of Turkish air bases to strike Iraq from the north.
Jones added that Washington would take Turkish concern into consideration, noting that Turkey was very important for the United States.
Aziz told journalists at Ankara airport that the American threats to overthrow Iraqi President Saddam Hussein were a threat to the whole region, noting that relations between Ankara and Baghdad were good and that Iraq considered Turkey a friendly state.
Turkey allows American fighters to use Turkish airbases to monitor the no-fly zone above northern Iraq.
At the end of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank's annual meeting, which took place in Washington over five days, the world's financial leaders pledged to make all possible efforts to prevent disturbances in the financial markets having a negative effect on the inconsistent economic resurgence. They also decided to hold a meeting no later than April 2003 to discuss a new rapprochement for dealing with states burdened with debt.
Gordon Brown, Chancellor of the British Exchequer, said that 15 states had pledged to provide assistance, but only some had set the sum. He explained that German, Britain and Sweden had made specific pledges, which he believed to be more than 200 million dollars.
The agenda for the meeting also included trade issues.
The World Bank believes that the trade restrictions imposed by rich states in all circumstances swallow up 650 billion dollars that could be used to improve the living conditions of people in all parts of the world. These restrictions also limit the freedom of poor states to reach international markets, which is what they urgently need.

The Qatari News Agency reported that Qarzai conducted "friendly and constructive" talks with the Amir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifah Al Thani, dealing with "the efforts to rebuild Afghanistan, in which Gulf states, including the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, are participating.
Qarzai had visited Saudi Arabia last January on his first visit outside Afghanistan as head of the interim Government.
He stressed, "If there are any problems in Afghanistan, they are the work of foreign forces and not of the Afghans themselves."
In a satellite telephone conversation he said that more than ten of Zadran's fighters had been killed, including the commander of the base, which is situated in the Sayyid Karam area, 20 km northeast of Gardez.
Zadran used his base in Sayyid Karam to rain down rockets on Gardez last February in response to the Tribal Consultative Council excluding him from his position as Governor of the region.
Diya Al-Din said, "He can no longer pose a threat to Gardez (...) This (the Sayyid Karam base) was the place where he held his interviews and stored his weapons (...) He has lost an important area around Gardez and in the Baktia region generally."
Koizumi Conducts Cabinet Reshuffle Hoping to Strengthen Economic Reforms.
Many criticisms have been directed against Yanagisawa, who opposed the harsh financial measures which Koizumi decided to adopt to deal with the Japanese banking sector, which is facing problems.
After Yanagisawa, the next most prominent reshuffle was the dismissal of Minister of Agriculture Tsutomu Takebe, who was one of the harshest critics of the policy adopted by the government to deal with the outbreak of "Mad Cow" disease.
However, the Prime Minister is still subject to intense pressures to save the economy from its collapse.
Under Siege With Arafat, Recounts Experience: I Did Not Imagine I Would Come Out Alive.
Looking at his Kalashnikov automatic in front of the entrance to Arafat's office, he added, "There was heavy fire and we had to take a quick decision: either to surrender or risk crossing the bridge, which might cost us dearly (...) but we, I and the other young men, preferred death to surrender."
But there were some who were not able to cross and were captured by the Israeli army.
The exhaustion of the security men was apparent as they left the headquarters of Chairman Yasir Arafat, as if they had gone without sleep for many nights whilst awaiting the unknown and monitoring the movement of Israeli bulldozers and tanks, from which only the wall of the building separated them.

According to unofficial results announced by the Center for Free and Democratic Elections, the ultra nationalist leader Vojislav Seselj, who has the support of former Serbian President Slobodan Milosovic who is being tried by the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague, gained 22.6% of the votes, which is a higher percentage than that expected.
Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Nebojsa Covic, who supports Kostunica, noted that the results achieved by Seselj demonstrated that Serbia was not yet finally rid of the extreme nationalism that characterized Milosovic's era.
He said, "I started from nothing.
The turnout was 55%, the lowest since the start of a multi-party system in 1990.
For the second time since the beginning of insurgency in the Ivory Coast on 19 September, the Government has extended the curfew for another week, to the seventh of October, as the army announced major losses inflicted on the rebels.
A large number in their ranks have been killed."
After a week in captivity in Korhogo, the rebels released the "France Press Agency" correspondent Kristov Kofi, aged 40.
Representatives from Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Niger, Nigeria and Togo will take part in the contact group that will mediate between the rebels and the Government of President Laurent Gbagbo.
Despite the fact that the Ivory Coast media have accused the President of Burkina Faso, Blaise Compaore, of supporting the rebels, Compaore and Gbagbo embraced warmly.
Washington Provided Iraq With Samples Used to Develop Biological Weapons in 1980s.
It later became clear that the Center and the "ATCC" company sent types of all the germs used for producing weapons, including anthrax, the bacteria responsible for botulinum toxin and germs causing gaseous gangrene, which kills the internal organs and causes severe hemorrhaging.
These exports were legal at that time and were approved by the Ministry of Commerce.
Bird noted that Rumsfeld met Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in 1983 in his capacity as envoy for the former American President Ronald Regan to the Middle East.
In 1999 four consignments of anthrax and in 1988 three consignments of gaseous gangrene were sent.

Certainly someone is preparing himself at this time to blow on the contradictory positions we heard in the Huraik quarter last Friday and then at the Sheraton Coral Beach Hotel on Saturday. But waging on a crisis in the relationship between the Prime Minister and "Hizbollah" will not lead to the desired end.
For those who have just smiled cunningly, we hurry to say: There are no double standards in the matter, for politics can be expanded to include new ideas, and if the opinion of the State is white and that of Hizbollah black, that does not mean that we are heading for an internal clash. In fact, it presupposes a creative dialectic, starting with the ambiguity that is occasional caused by the contradictory stances between Prime Minister Al-Hariri to be specific and Mr. Hasan Nasrallah.
In the "Loyalty to the Palestinian Intifada" march last Friday, Mr. Hasan Nasrallah was unable to be anything other than the Secretary-General of "Hizbollah", who possesses internal conviction, fed by jihad incentives, that the Intifada was born in its first form two years ago in the spirit of victory achieved by the resistance in the south.
Because at the celebration of the American University in Beirut Alumni Association (of course, among the graduates there were some students from Hizbollah) he could do nothing other than be the Prime Minister of Lebanon, who stood up not to throw cold water on Nasrallah's fiery sermon, but calmly to try to rectify the long-standing enthusiastic, impulsive and agitated character of Arab policies towards America over a long time, which makes it easier for Zionist circles to perform their basic function of establishing a major strategic fissure between America and the Arab and Islamic states.
There are those who call for confrontation and clash, relying on the fervor of the faith in the truth and the people, and there are those who call for us to duck in the face of the coming storm
Whilst the Russian press believed that the goal of Sharon's visit was political and aimed to obtain the support of about one million Russian immigrants currently living in Israel before the Likud bloc conference, Israeli newspapers noted that the aim of the visit was to discuss Russian arms deals with both Syrian and Iran.
The other topic discussed by the newspapers is the passing of two years since the outbreak of the Al-Aqsa Mosque Intifada.
The economic damage is massive.
In the opinion of the writer, the cause of the pride of the Palestinians in their uprising is the truth that there can be no return to the past: "Palestinians do not see the possibility of re-establishing trust between the two sides."
There's no need to blow on the milk now.
For, ultimately, at least at this stage, it should be understood where the borders of Lebanon as a state, government and system lie, and where lie the borders of "Hizbollah" as a resistance, party and jihad lie.
But there are some who only look to this contradiction or ambiguity from the perspective of stirring up problems in the face of the Prime Minister, or from the perspective of linking the problems to the neck of "Hizbollah".
But if Mr. Hasan Nasrallah, in the eyes of his enthusiastic listeners in the Huraik quarter, deserves a salute, then Al-Hariri, in the eyes of those who heard him on the next day, Saturday, and who read his speech at the beginning of the week, deserves a greater one.
But what is not important is that Al-Hariri should say this, but that some should be persuaded that their interest lies in putting Israel in confrontation with America and that this should require more than "making threats and stirring up people's sensibilities".
Are Natural Disasters and Movement of Planets the Key to Success in Financial Markets?
Mustafa, who works in his private shop in the evening and observes the movement of the planets in the morning, calculates the angle of the earth in relation to the sun and uses this to determine whether the general outlook at a specific time and specific place on the earth is encouraging or not.
Refusing to give his advice for free, Mustafa said, "I can feel the forces.
He continued, "The information is available to everyone, whether it be the price to return rate in one company or the most recent fall in interest rates, but I can know how traders will interpret this information."
Whilst Mustafa wages on the movement of trades on the same day, Richard relies on longer-term market calculations.
He says, "People, like nature, behave strangely. By studying how small particles all move together when there is an earthquake, we can better understand the group behavior which led the share markets to fall in July."
Montier says, "Rises and falls witnessed by the markets in recent years are an example of group behavior and show that understanding the psychology is extremely important for trading in the market."
A joint statement issued following the talks said, "As part of the framework of fraternal consultations conducted by Arab leaders to confront the increasing challenges faced by the Arab Nation and its issues in the recent period, and continuing the contacts that were conducted at summit level over the last weeks, President Husni Mubarak received His Excellency President Bashar Al-Asad in Cairo.
The two Presidents further discussed the recent developments and the different possibilities for the Iraqi issue and its dangerous implications for all states of the region. The two Presidents called for this issue to be examined in view of its importance and the danger it represents for all persons.
She added that Syria, which has held a seat of a non-permanent member of the Security Council since last January, is mounting a "genuine campaign" in the Council for the interests of Iraq.
Lahud Returns With Dark Impressions on Iraq; Other States Renew Talk About Dialogue; No Decisive Decision from Adum to Pursue Gemayel.
It is reported that this meeting will move to stress the adherence of the Forum to all its stances in respect of the "attack to which the opposition and freedoms are subject". At the same time, it will confirm the initiation of dialogue under the patronage of the President of the Republic after Bikirki received with satisfaction "the flexible message" directed by the Minister of the Interior Ilyas Al-Murr to Bishop Bisharah last week.
He stressed, "Justice does not target anyone". He repeated his statement, "Let them await for the end of this procedure. The result may be that the information contained is no more than talk and the basis for pursuing it may not exist."
As regards the Sultanate of Oman, the signing of cooperation agreements will continue and the Omani Foreign Minister Yusif bin Alawi will visit Beirut next month to study completion of the agreements which require signing in order to bring them into effect immediately.
In this context Lahud stressed Arab solidarity, especially that the resolutions of the Beirut Arab summit contained many points that needed to be exploited and activated in order to translate this solidarity. He asked, "If the Arabs do not unite today, then when will they unite?"
The direction will come from Vienna, where the talks are taking place for an unconditional return of international weapons inspectors.
If Baghdad accuses the inspection teams of spying, then such a statement also hold much truth because international weapons inspectors who have worked in Iraq have admitted this and the United Nations has spoken of it, although America has failed to comment.
Or let us say a method for not facilitating the American decision to wage war.
If we recall how Baghdad embarrassed Washington on 16 September when it agreed to the unconditional return of inspectors, then its actual acceptance of this return today will have greater significance.
Baghdad's choices are clear: complicate the task of the inspectors and thereby invite America to launch a war quickly, or facilitate the task of and cooperate with the inspectors and thereby embarrass the Americans and refute any pretext they may have and consolidate the position of states opposed to war.
Sahar Basiri.
We have everything, as fresh as it can be.
May the move be made by the brigands and our happiness be made complete. It was essential that gallant Assistant Richard Armitage bring us the good news, bearing in his left hand the carrot of aid and in his right the stick of conditions and obligations.
Like a sum that is not obtained without asking and enquiring.
In general terms the Americans are not happy with us, and the factors appear to be many.
Moving like a headstrong horse.
For a very long time there has been a one-sided love story between Lebanon and America.
They explained that Al-Hariri's visit will last two days and that he will meet senior Japanese officials.
Tomorrow Al-Hariri will meet the Director of "Microsoft" in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Jean-Philippe Courtois, who will announce the opening of the Lebanese Government information center and IT Institute.
He noted, "The economic indicators have begun to tend towards the positive. What merchants, industrialists and businessmen complain of today is limited to one problem, of which the Government and the Treasury also complain, namely the increase in interest rates.
The first aim is to stop the debt growing, which will happen as soon as the budget deficit is closed.
He reiterated his conviction that Lebanon is "the country least affected among the states of the region by the regional conditions and the possibility of a strike against Iraq, firstly for geographic reasons and secondly on account of Lebanon's commitment to the resolution of the United Nations and full international law."
Members of the Association's delegation included: Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Shiite Islamic Council, Sheikh Abd Al-Amir Qablan, Archbishop Maron Sadir, Yuhanna Haddad, Antoine Al-Hayek, Ilyas Kafuri, Sheikh Ahmad Al-Zain, Mufti of Tyre Al-Sayyid Ali Al-Amin, Judge of the Druze Sect in Hasbiya Sheikh Salim Al-Ismi, Sheikh Abd Al-Muhsin Al-Abdallah and a number of members.
Before taking lunch in one of the Al-Wazzani restaurants at the invitation of Mufti Qablan, a meeting was held of the members of the Association, following which Sheikh Abd Al-Hussein Al-Abdallah, Archbishop Kafuri, Al-Hayek, Sadir and Haddad gave statements stressing "Lebanon's rights to its water, national unity and standing shoulder to shoulder in the face of the Israeli threats."
What a difference between Ali and the rapists, oppressors and occupiers.
I am proud of your presence here today. I have the honor to be at your service on the banks of the Al-Wazzani river where we are separated by meters from our Palestinian territory, from the occupied Shabaa Farms, the Kafrshuba hills and the Golan, and the territory of Mt Amil, which crosses into Palestinian territory.
As Lebanese we are required to preserve water and land.
There Mufti Qablan gave a speech in which he said, "His Eminence, concealed Imam Musa Al-Sadr, came to this Patriarchate in the 1970s. He and the then Archbishop Al-Muthalath Al-Rahmah Bulus Khuri announced the start of the Southern Aide Association.
The Al-Zahrani Branch of the "National Assembly for Salvation and Change" yesterday held its founding meeting at the "Fuad Fil" complex, Al-Sirfind. Members of the Central Monitoring Committee Usamah Saad, Saad Allah Mazraani, Khidr Salim and Mufid Qatish and prominent figures attended.
2. Confirmation of the right of all political forces to play their political role freely and without any pressures or restrictions.
6. Call for the encouragement of agriculture by means of a supporting agricultural policy and a call to protect local agricultural production, and for the encouragement of investment in the field of agricultural manufacturing and for foreign markets to be secured for the marketing of excess production.
10. Call for the development of the means of popular and national solidarity with the glorious Palestinian Intifada, declare genuine solidarity with Iraq, support the Syrian stance in confronting the American attack and stand alongside the resistance in Lebanon and its right to operate in order to complete liberation."
Afterwards Al-Idrisi said, "Despite the protocol nature of my first meeting with His Excellency Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Mr. Nabih Birri, we took this opportunity to exchange views on conditions and developments in the region because of the friendship and fraternity between us, as you know.
We believe that the best way to confront all these serious challenges is to unite efforts and work between the Arab and Islamic states in this region. Consequently, we believe that on account of these complex conditions we must increase coordination and cooperation and the exchange of views between us."
They need assistance, protection and the safeguarding of their interests. His Excellency has undertaken and continues to undertake the contacts necessary with influential and active Arab and European states in order to help them and transport their members to safer and more stable locations."
Is the Decision to Suspend American Aid a Case of "Calling Lebanon to Account" for Its Regional and Domestic Policy?
Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri and Foreign Minister Mahmud Hamud returning from Muscat consulted on the matter, in preparation for the required action.
The American irritation may be represented in the stance on the closure of the "M.T.V." television station and the summoning by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants of American Ambassador Vincent Patel, who refused to give any comment but who was clearly irritated after he had confirmed his country's position 24 hours following his meeting with Minister of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants Mahmud Hamud for another purpose.
Diplomatic sources called for the policy of increasing American pressure on Lebanon to be dealt with wisely and for the extent of coordination between officials to be increased in order to nullify this policy and avoid expanding it so that it does not affect the Paris 2 Conference, which is expected to be held this autumn, as President Jacque Chirac promised, because many of the wealthy states invited to the conference are friendly to or allied with the United States, like Japan, and some European states and states of the Gulf Cooperation Council, have influence with it.
The fact is that what political circles viewed as a strategic retreat in the "Al-Qarnah" message appears, with a meeting held on Sunday in Bikirki, to be a "tactical" withdrawal, the aim of which is to catch their breath and feel the pulse of the "campaign which has been thought through in security, political, judicial and even media terms" in order to draw up the headings and determine the framework for the coming stage clearly, far from the recent tense political atmosphere.
When it transpired that this signal was not sufficiently clear, the meeting with "Al-Qarnah" was held to reiterate it in a more comprehensive, more precise and more clearly worded form, leaving no room for ambiguity.
Bearing in mind that he was relying on the third call, in which he dealt with sensitive internal issues in detail, including the status of the judiciary.
It is not unlikely that Basharah may be tasked to conduct a range of contacts aiming to consolidate and re-launch the atmosphere of dialogue.
However, in the context of its adherence to its uncompromising position, it will not strike out dialogue from its political lexicon, for it recalls that it was the first to conduct such dialogue with the President of the Republic and did not sever it. In fact, the step to close "M.T.V." and the measures and leaks that followed this led to the suspension of dialogue and made it "pointless".
Phalanges: Gemayel Intends to Revoke Decision to Expel Him; Baqraduni Demands Completion of Al-Buma File.
With regard to the judicial files, he said, "We distinguish between files that have a political characteristic and stem from the Lebanese War, in respect of which we demand, in the name of national reconciliation, that the pages of the War be turned and closed once and for all; and between files that have a financial characteristic, which concern politicians and others, in respect of which we demand, in the name of national unity, that they all be opened in order to safeguard public funds and morality."
Consequently, we demand that justice be allowed to take its course in the Al-Buma file, as in similar financial files. We have every confidence in the judiciary and that it will act as required by law and conscience."
They said that the Party's Political Bureau had studied the letter and decided not to meet the request "because there is no Party precedent allowing us to direct a written decision of expulsion to the person concerned".
Lebanon is fortunate to have this Patriarch - he is the most fitting man in the appropriate position.
We complain of Syria to the American and Zionist Congress by an ignorant and envious emigrant minority.
Patriarch Safir then met a member of the "Qarnat Shahwan Forum", former Deputy Michel Al-Khuri, followed by leader of the Free Nationalists Party Duri Shamun and Secretary-General of the Party Ilyas Abu Asi.
There are suspicions about the money. The suspicion of citizens in respect of the money they owe is natural.
I believe that this situation must be changed and that this annihilation must be stopped because people are not prepared to continue to have their skins stripped off when they are in this economic crisis.
At the same time, I confirm that this issue and scandal is the result of the government abandoning the required administrative reform, which will turn the administration into a support for citizens rather than a sword above them for embezzling them, plundering their food and the food of their children."
The Secretariat met under the chairmanship of Deputy Qablan Isa Al-Khuri, in the presence of Minister Michel Musa and Deputies Jibran Tuq, Eli Aun, Qaisar Muawwad, Antoine Haddad, Marwan Faris and Ghattas Al-Khuri.
"Article 1: The Consultative Forum shall be a political assembly whose members seek to consult and coordinate between them on various political and national issues with the aim of formulating joint positions on local, regional and international issues affecting the Lebanese arena on the basis of the fundamental principles expressed by its Founding Statement.
The functions of the Secretariat shall comprise the following specifically:
- Maintain the minutes of meetings of the General Board.
Article 6: Deputy Chairman: The General Board shall by mutual agreement select a Deputy Chairman to perform the functions of the Chairman in the event of the latter's absence or pursuant to his instruction.
Invitations to attend meetings of the General Board shall be sent at least ten days earlier. In emergency circumstances there shall be no delay.
Francophone University Agency Supports University Education in French.
- At the Lebanese University: License in Law, a Postgraduate Diploma specializing in Financial and Accounting Management, an in-depth studies diploma in.
- Specializations distributed between various universities: postgraduate internet diploma at the Lebanese University and St Joseph University, and a postgraduate diploma in agricultural sciences and nutrition at the Lebanese, Jesuit and Holy Spirit.
For their part, Francophone universities involved in the work of these branches contribute in non-financial ways.
There are also general programs applied in many states, including Lebanon, which include grants to pursue studies in Francophone Universities abroad (from which 50 Lebanese students benefit each year) and exchanges of lecturers and researchers (from which about 40 Lebanese benefit each year).
Al-Indari Representing Maronite Patriarch Inaugurates Pastoral Complex in Birhaliyun.
At the start Archbishop Al-Indari led a mass, in which he was assisted by the priests of Birhaliyun and served by the Faghal choir.
What makes this work valuable, gives it weight and gentle meaning is that it immortalizes the efforts of those who have faithfully served this blessed parish.
A speech was then given on behalf of the parish of Birhaliyun by Antoine Ukkari, followed by Bishop Francis Al-Bisri and Bishop Grahmann, who stressed the "deepening of dialogue, love, and meeting between all countries and peoples of the world, especially at this delicate stage of the history of the world".
Finally, Monsignor Tarrad spoke, thanking all of those who helped complete this vital parish project.
President Jemayel is not the only person to be targeted, for those accused of threatening national security are many. "Coincidence" would have it that they are all of the same color, which has become prominent at this time of deterioration, despite the fact that this color has shed light on the darkness spread from the Ocean to the Gulf.
An outstanding pupil said that the decision issued by the National Council for Scientific Research to assist outstanding pupils in the General Secondary Certificate corrects a historical flaw that had to be addressed.
He added that the Council had decided, and was persuaded of this, with the mandated authority, namely the Council of Ministers, that those outstanding in the General Secondary Certificate deserved all support in view of the fact that they were the outstanding students in Lebanon.
*So Clean Company have confirmed that they have inspected the location the subject of the complaint, but that there was no container in which rubbish was piling up or overflowing.
Minister of Environment Michel Musa, represented by the Director of the Education and Awareness Department at the Ministry Antoine Gharib, acted as patron of a workshop on the twin problems of refuse and waste water under the title "The Problem Between Obligation and Compulsion". It was organized by the "Environmental Development" Association in Rashiya at the Wadi Al-Tim School hall. Representatives from the Ministry of Municipal and Village Affairs Hasan Hatit, representative from the Ministry of the Environment Bassam Sabbagh, Director General of the Al-Laitani Department Nasir Nasrallah, and a number of municipal, village, club and association heads attended."

The environmental committee of the "Future Youth" Association has organized its first environmental exhibition in Martyrs Square in central Beirut.
Tripoli - Naim Asafiri:
In a celebration to be held at 9 am today at the Le Meridian Commodore Hotel - Al-Hamra, the Ministry of the Environment is launching "The Consultative Services Projects, which stems from technical support of the consultative planning program", under the title "Building National Partnership".
Following the national anthem, Attorney Khalil Abu Saad gave a speech on behalf of the Association. He believed, "The impact of environmental problems experienced by the individual in his society, goes beyond the geographical limits of his area, and even his country, because environmental concern is no longer a domestic issue affecting a specific society or country; it is international, crossing borders and policies."
In the area of environmentally-sound management of solid household refuse, the state has drawn up a national plan to manage, sort and bury refuse in Greater Beirut and Mt Lebanon, in addition to preparing the Conditions Document for an international tendency to collect and treat refuse and develop a comprehensive strategy to manage solid waste."
Sabbagh said, "One of the most important problems facing these plans is that which reflects the crisis of trust between the citizens and the municipality on the one hand and the state on the other." He noted, "The Ministry hopes for greater cooperation between different departments, chief among which are the municipalities, to implement integrated projects using appropriate technologies that limit the negative effects on the surrounding environment and public health."
Upon the arrival of this ill-omened anniversary Chilean television broadcast an historical political debate of key significance between Maria, granddaughter of former dictator Pinochet and Gonzalo Mitza, grandson of the former President, who was betrayed in his palace on the day of the Salvador Allende revolution.
Of course, even had there been a compromise solution between the Deputies and the Government, this would not have stopped the Government finding itself in a position of moving to disband parliament in the future and the constitution granted this right. But, certainly, gaining the greatest amount of time for the experiment would have been a gain for democracy in Bahrain and a gain for the fledgling democratic awareness and socio-economic achievements.
Imperial Israel!
But this connection could have lost its meaning and Israel could have continued the siege had the Palestinian street remained quiet and viewed what was happening to their leader as an inevitable fate.
For that which links Jerusalem and Baghdad is not the same as that which links Palestine and Afghanistan.
For it gives nothing for free and does not deal in deferred bonds.
Following the Third Gulf War, which will inevitable happen, does Israel expect in return for facilitating the mission any less than for this military and economic superiority to be translated into political and regional power with it having the final word in the affairs of the region.
They have not ignored a people, ethnic or sectarian group from the Arabs, Kurds, Persians and Berbers, to the Copts, the Druze, Alawites, Arwahites, Sunnis and Shiites.
The expansionist Israeli mind no longer aspires to the state of Greater Israel. In the post-11 September world it has found an opportunity to turn its entity into a major empire having the final say on the issues of the region - its way to achieve the liquidation of the Palestinian issue.
On a beautiful autumnal evening, in the Al-Nijmah square in central Beirut, where the evening is filled with people wandering to and fro usually watching each other or dispersed along the pavement cafes, both men and women enjoying the water pipers and smoking cigarettes, there I sat with the most famous bachelor in Lebanon, whose friends call him the Bey. For those who do not know him he is Mr. Minh Al-Sulh, the son of an Arab Beirut political family afflicted by the same successes and failures as Arabism. Sitting with the Bey is enjoyable because of its many memories and few admonitions, as he says. It is, however, interrupted for no passer-by or waitress can pass without greeting the Bey. In fact, some of them ask permission to sit for a while, wanting to confirm a piece of information, deny a report or spread a hot rumor.

It was the end of 1943 Charter but did not abrogate it, for it still controls the background to the Lebanese parties, which appear to be in a state of permanent struggle.
The response was the "Islamic National Forum" in the "Hamad Cell", a purely Islamic assembly, headed by a Muslim man of religion.
But Lebanon, despite the satisfaction emerging from the meetings of the Lebanese delegation to Washington, has not ignored the necessity of awaiting the rulings that will crystallize subsequently, whether through the visit of the Monetary Fund visit to Beirut on the tenth of October or during the convening of the Paris - 2 Summit in the coming months.

On 21 August 2002, near midnight, Fuad Bulus' long life came to an end.
For a long time his family appeared through his achievements irrespective of the type of work he performed.
The Executive Council of the General Association of Farmers and Peasants Societies, in a statement yesterday, asked the Chairman of the Parliamentary Agriculture Committee for "the need to hold intensive meetings by the Agriculture Committee for the purpose of overseeing the activities of all public establishments dealing with agriculture, especially the Ministry of Agriculture, and for activating its functions, guiding its performance, welcoming and discussing suggestions for regulations, freeing the hand of the Agriculture Committee in its oversight function and eliminating all strains on it."
He expressed his rejection of "the supervision of any organization over farmers and the obstruction of their decision," demanding the need for revising the traffic law regarding registration of agricultural vehicles of farmers for the purpose of enabling the smaller ones, who constitute 85 percent of farmers, to register their produce-transporting vehicles.
Also required from "Ideal" is improving its performance with respect to applications filed with it, and deciding on them since they were filed more than six months ago and were not addressed, particularly those regarding the definition of relationship between the farmer and the exporter, requiring farmers' signatures on bills of all produce purchases from middlemen and exporters, finalizing the increasing of subsidies for exported flowers, and calculating the weight for which the actual cost has been paid in airfreight.
The statement warned of "the living conditions of the olive farmers, whose oil from the previous season is still in containers, where it is feared that farmers will be unable to manage the quality of their produce this year because they did not refine the dry beans, causing a drop in the produced oil quality, and consequently, the deterioration of their living conditions. Accordingly, the Association asks all concerned ministries to secure the marketing of the stocked produce, especially since the crisis of dispensation is the result of the openness policy adopted by the government and the inability of the Lebanese produce to compete.
77.5 percent of it concentrated in bounced foreign-currency checks.

On August 21, 2002, around midnight, Fouad Boulos' long journey ended.
For so long, his family was evident through his accomplishments, no matter what type of work he was doing.
In the year 1963, following taking the decision to establish the Central Bank of Lebanon, President Fouad Chehab designated Fouad Boulos to supply the bank with security equipment.
His natural skill in engaging technical experts through the experience he gained by interaction constituted a source of power for him during such time periods when knowledge and experience were rare.
He was forced to fight several battles in order to bring this project to the minds of those who were supposed to approve it, whether religiously or politically, or even to businessmen at that time.
On the day of his death, President Emile Lahoud awarded him, for the second time, the Medal of Competence, and he remains in the memory of whoever knew him the solid believer in the greatness of predecessors, with a determination that provokes changing the future.
I tour the earth's cities from the extreme north to the extreme south.

Yakzhan: Is it a commodity for consumption?
It is a matter tested if we gazed in the universe, searching.
But whatever time means to this one or to that one, there's some strong tie between time and finesse.
This does not mean that you are in a race with time, but rather in a race with yourself and with whatever you seek on the earth.
Time for me is a test site, for every experiment has a site or a place at the single moment that experiment takes place.
What about the upcoming time?
Maknar: Carving of time may lead us to confronting the universal time, and we have stopped by it more than once.
Yakzhan: Does the eternal existence have another dimension other than the contentious relationship between the past, the present and the future?
This is what explains the meaning of growth or retreat, the meaning of dashing ahead or reluctance, the meaning of transformation or steadiness, and the meaning of adversity or conformity.
As a continuation of two previous biographies, the first of which was published by "Dar Al-Farabi" in the year 1991, and the second published by Dar "Mukhtarat" in the year 1994, Elham Mansour writes her third biography, published recently under the title "When I Was a Man."

Astonished for "Uproar" After Requesting "Puma" File, Addoum: Let Them Wait Until We Review It; Basis for Prosecution May Not be Present
Let them wait for us to review the record's content first.
So why precede this issue with this uproar?
Who told them we want to prosecute them?
Let them wait for the purpose of this measure and for answers for the warrant I issued.
He said: "We need some time to receive answers on what we asked for in the warrant.
And in case of his moving around, why weren't the warrants issued against him by the Lebanese justice system and which were conveyed to the Interpol, enforced?
That awaits the response to the warrant."

The municipality of West Sair in the south honored the president of "Al-Janub Construction" Company, Riyadh Said Al-Assad, at Al-the Husseini Club in town under the patronage of the president of the "Loyalty for the Resistance" Bloc, Representative Mohammad Raad.
Raad followed and said: "Development is not contingent on political association, but rather on human and national association and the public interest."
Riyadh followed him by saying: "Change is not from the top, nor elective or instant, but it is either national or not, inclusive or not, dissenting and legitimate or not."
Any talk intended to isolate Lebanon from its Arab and Syrian reality in particular is a sedition in-the-making intended to tear this country apart."
In conclusion, the Chief of West Sair Municipality, Mohammad Assad Matouk, presented two shields to Raad and Riyadh Al-Assad.

Stardom and Married Life
Life, as a theatrical play, cannot be limited to one star if it were to last, for there's a beginning and an end in theatre, and theatre has a role and continuity. Therefore, the star must share his stardom with others: either all will have secondary roles and thus he gets the absolute stardom, or some will co-star with him and the rest play secondary roles. It is not possible for all to be stars unless the end is tragic for all.
Marital partnership is a contract of acknowledgment of accord between two different people and an acknowledgment of the right to differ between two congruous people, in which one party may be content to be the secondary player in the other's life, or in which both agree on the limits of stardom for each one of them or both could be secondary players who do not realize the cost of stardom nor the possibilities for qualifying for it.
There are many families that do not realize the importance of stardom in their lives, regrettably.

This was followed by Murad's address in which he said: "Lebanon is rich in its people, the main source of its wealth and to whom attention and care must be given. We must prepare them well for life, and that cannot be accomplished except by education, and on grounds that allow them to catch up with the time with all of its challenges and qualify them to be efficient, productive human beings, capable of using the means of knowledge for the chance of making it productive, not just for consuming it.
He re-iterated that he was against the law that was enacted to exempt parents from the registration fees.
Murad responded by an speech in which he stressed the continuous quest to develop the official school and official education in various fields to be at the level of the progress of the time.
The Commission adhered to "defending our national institutions which offer higher education to the majority of university students in Lebanon," and the important role this institution must play in producing knowledge and contributing to developing the society's structure, arriving at straightening out our general affairs.
First: Supporting the league of full-time professors at the Lebanese University in its root stance from this scandal which favored ethnicity against academic competence, and in its vision of the solutions that need to be adopted for full-time employment.
This would guarantee the impediment of any "parachute landing" or the conduct of avenues and channels that are far from the curriculum and sheer academic mechanisms.

The President of the Hospital Workers Union, Rafiq Harb, delivered a speech in which he said, addressing the spirit of the celebrated: "You founded a hospital to cure body ailments, and it has become a witness of love that heals every illness.
"He dedicated himself to worshipping God, thus dedicated by this very act a messenger for the service of man.
He followed what Jesus taught: If you do a favor, do not let your right hand know what your left hand had done. But he realized that he who gave one of those little ones a drink of cold water... his reward will not be wasted."
Finally, the curtain was unveiled from a statue of Father Yousef Yazbek, which was placed in the lobby of Dr. Emile Al-Baitar Hospital.

One of the most notable films is the Swedish film "The Victim," by Tarik Saleh and Erik Gandini, which discuses the real informer on the Argentine freedom fighter Ernesto Che Guevara, who continued to inspire the leftist movements throughout the past forty years.
The accusations of the world public opinion, intellectuals and leftists were directed against Bustos for informing about Guevara's whereabouts, while the French intellectual was cleared.
From investigating the incident of Guevara's killing to scrutinizing the role of Egyptian intellectuals in modern Egyptian history in confronting the British colonial power in the 1919 revolution and what followed it, arriving at their role in confronting the visit of former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to Israel in 1978 with the Egyptian film "Café Rische" by Gamal Kasem.

The Minister of Interior went where no official has gone before to say, with the most eloquent words, that Lebanon did at one stage what America has done in Afghanistan.
Paris-2 was even one of the signs of investing in security, for without the American green light, no date would not have been set for this conference.
The "advocates" of fear and panic went too far in exploiting differential points with the opposition to the extent that made the internal scene closer to being at the mercy of the fear merchants and beneficiaries.
The frequent and authoritarian banning of demonstrations scored points for the opposition, and put it on the same side with the multi-sect social classes that are eager to express their living crises, contributing to the breaking up of the intensity of polarization with a single-sect tone.

Those who carry the fire extinguishers will no longer find in Lebanon anyone who tries to set fire to their tails and to the country's tails...
No one is waiting, of course, for answers to these questions, but delusions are very big and may even surpass Lebanon's huge debts. If the state is convinced it can go to Paris-2 with a spirit of openness and modernity - at a time when Beirut is continuing a policy of closed doors and mouths, which must remain closed!
The prime minister seemed, in his talk the day before yesterday, like someone who is driving a tourist-filled car on a terrain that is pregnant with surprises and threatened with bumps, and he must convince the tourists from the Paris-2 folks that they are on quieter, more stable and steady "grounds."

When Authority Wins... Over State
With the end of what seemed like a episode in its battle with the opposition, it became clear that the definition of the state has fallen, struck down by the relentless practices of the authority and its cronies.
Those are only assigned to manage its affairs, and therefore, they were only entrusted with authority.
Such a review shows not only the silly scenario which has become the authority's only weapon, but it clearly reveals the authority people's abandonment of any feel for national responsibility, not to mention morality, which must accompany the political action in a country that claims for itself the twin adjectives of republican and democratic.
A mentality that justifies one thing and its opposite, as long as it serves the intended purpose, whether such purpose is to preserve "the protective regime", which wears the mask of "the distinct Lebanese-Syrian relations", or to secure the permanency of a sick ruling team which realizes that it has no real protection except for the whole country to be a protectorate of someone else's.
Mousa: 1948 Palestinians Part of Palestinian People; Arab Commission for Defending Ahmad Al-Taibi; Al-Walid Bin Talal Donates to Rashid Center in Dubai; "Pentagon": Libya Seeks Long-Range Missiles
The Director of the Cairo Center for Human Rights Studies, Bahyyeddine Hassan, wondered: "Can the historic isolation fences, which were imposed by force on this part of the Palestinian people, be destroyed?"
He said that "the committee aims at supporting the struggles of Dr. Ahmad Al-Taibi, who is being subjected to a vicious assault by the Israeli government and the rightist forces in Israel in order to rob him of his rights, and who was punished for entering the city of Jenin and its camp on the eve of the massacre."
He expressed his admiration for the services offered by the Center to special-needs children, and urged businessmen to support charity projects "because of what they offer of great training services that help develop society and making productive members out of its citizens."
But he indicated that most likely, Libya does not possess all of the capabilities that have been attributed to her to produce such weapons, adding that it is one of the countries which seek to acquire long and short-range missiles, like North Korea and Iraq.

He did not mention the countries included in the campaign, saying that the decision to broadcast these films on television stations in the Islamic World will be taken gradually in accordance with initial reactions.
He added: "The terrorists said that they are attacking the West while in reality they are attacking all peoples (...). Fundamentalism is not the purest attainment of a certain religion, but is nothing less than a tarnished caricature of it."
He added that the "Al-Qaeda" Organization, which is led by Osama Bin Laden, regained its power and it has been referring to its capabilities in statements aired recently by the Qatari satellite station "Al-Jazira".
He affirmed that "the terrorist threat to the Western World, including Germany, is still present."
He explained that Dostum and Mohammad will supervise the disarmament process.
The agreement calls for the withdrawal of fighters from the positions they occupied or that they join the national army.
Mohammad controls most of Mazar El-Sherif, and he fought a war with Dostum to control it in the nineties.

Approximately 50 Israeli tanks and armored vehicles penetrated deep in the village of Qabatia near Jenin.
The homes of four Palestinians were also destroyed in the city and camp, including two homes belonging to two suicide bombers, while the other two belonged to two runaway activists being pursued by Israel.

The Sudanese Minister of State at the Peace Department, Dio Matok, announced yesterday that government representatives and "Popular Army for the Liberation of the Sudan" insurgents, who are participating in negotiations at the Kenyan town of Machakos, are leaning toward addressing the sharing of wealth after "their failure to arrive at a resolution for the issue of power sharing despite discussing it adequately."
He disclosed that the government agreed to look into the issue of the of the Nuba mountains, Angsana and Abai regions through the Machakos negotiations, but "away from the problem of the south."
He also rejected forming an alternating presidency between General Omar Mohammad Al-Bashir and Garang during the six transition years in the south, called for by the Machakos Agreement Protocol.
Defense Minister General Bakri Hassan Saleh explained that this plan "aims at liberating every grain of soil that the rebels and foreign mercenaries seized, guaranteeing the security of the territories, airspace and water resources, and maintaining the security of strategic sites and services via the formation of a force capable of dealing with all developments and emergencies."
On another front, the Canadian oil group "Talisman Energy" announced today, Wednesday, the sale of its oil stock in the Sudan from a branch of the Indian national company "Oil and Natural Gas Corporation" for 1.2 billion Canadian dollars (770 million American dollars).
The United Nations warned that the reduction in Iraq's oil sales will lead to a decline in the capability of the humanitarian program, supervised by the international body, for improving the living conditions of the Iraqi people.
He spoke of three possible scenarios after intensive American air strikes and they are "a coup by the army to topple Saddam Hussein," "a power take over by the opposition," or "the intervention of the army of an Arab country, such as Jordan, to support the Americans."
When asked about his talks with Al-Hakim regarding "the future of Iraq", he responded that "their movements will try to assure and pledge to the Sunnis that they will not pay the price of an alliance between the Kurds and the Shiites."
He explained that Iraq estimated its oil revenues for the twelfth phase of the "Oil-for-Food" Program, which extends from May 30 to November 25, to be seven billion dollars, but its export revenues as of November 25 did not exceed 3.8 billion dollars.
This formula was adopted to prevent Baghdad from directly getting an additional fee that it imposes on buyers because United Nations resolutions call for depositing the oil revenues in an account administered by the international organization.
Fundamentalists Consolidate Positions in Bahrain Elections; Women Hopes Dashed With Failure of Latifa Al-Qaood

Independent businessman Othman Al-Sherif settled the outcome in his favor in the seventh district at the expense of the President of the "Consultative Society", which is close to the "Moslem Brothers", Abdel Rahman Abdel Salam.
The number of independent Shiite representatives in the Parliament increased, following the success of Jasim Al-Muwali, Samir El-Shweikh and Abbas Hassan Salman in the second, third and fifth districts of the Northern Governance, while the result of the fourth district of the Northern Governance, competed for by two independent Sunni candidates, is not clear.
Bahrain's King Hamad Bin Issa Al Khalifa is due to appoint the forty members of the Consultative Council in the middle of next November.
Rumsfeld Expects Quick Collapse of Islamic Regime in Iran; Khatami; Two Parliamentarians Killed
When asked about the possibility of launching a military action to overthrow the Tehran government, in the aftermath of overthrowing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in Baghdad, he responded that Washington rejects this option and relies on a natural collapse of the Islamic republic.
Analysts at the agency thought, in a report sent to the Congress in April and published on Monday, that the Iranians "are losing confidence in the elections as a means for reform," as a result of the strict ways of the conservative clergymen.
The Iranian president began his visit on Monday and used it as an opportunity to affirm his country's determination to open up politically, economically and culturally. He called on Spanish investors to benefit from "the new looming  climates in Iran," to develop their activities there.
Spanish Foreign Minister Ana Du Palacio announced that Khatami and Aznar agreed to form an Iranian-Spanish working group that will be in charge of preparing for a dialogue meeting of cultures that can be held during the World Forum of Cultures organized in Barcelona from May to September 2004.

The name of the suspect being sought by police has not been released.
The American Ambassador in Jakarta, Ralph Boyce, visited the scene of the blast and called reports published by the Indonesian newspapers that the United States was behind the operation "irresponsible."
He added, "We may never know if these statements predicted the Bali attack on October 12, but we can be sure that the hand of Al-Qaeda is somewhere there behind this massacre."
He justified the arrest of a number of Moslems and the campaign against their homes in Sydney and Melbourne as aiming to verify whether the "Jamaa Al-Islamia" is active in Australia, affirming that the government does not apologize for such measures.

Al-Hariri: Opposition is Necessary, Expression Guaranteed and Lebanon Needs Grace Period
Someone may say that somebody from the authority or the government may have asked the second party to demonstrate or ask for a license so that the Ministry of Interior can use it as a pretext to call off both demonstrations.
At the present time, there are tens of ways for expressing opinions, and I do not think that the opinion of the demonstrators or those who wanted to demonstrate is unheard or unknown.
We are indeed in need of determining what we want and what Lebanon wants.
Opposition is very important and means of expression are guaranteed in the constitution and by law. I wish that we would give our country a chance to breathe so that it may overcome the difficult phase we are going through and are all experiencing. I believe we have a very big chance to overcome these difficulties, so lets utilize the opportunity, set our differences aside and open our hands and hearts to each others."
Under the patronage of Helou, the "Youths of Lebanon Movement" commemorated the ninth anniversary for its founding in a ceremony it held at the ballroom of its regional headquarters at Bhamdoun Station.
He added: "Where did our dispute with President Al-Hariri begin?
He said: "Lebanon exists on the balance between factions.
As for the Druze, who are 6 or 7 percent of the Lebanese population, no one can think of establishing any political assembly and overlook them, because they are united. We (the Christians), who constitute one third of this country, do not have much because we are scattered and divided.
He thought that  "members of the Qornat Shahwan gathering have important advantages, but I think that the mistake began when the gathering turned into a front."
Karam said, "The big success achieved by the summit comes as part of a series of regional and international successes achieved by Lebanon under the leadership of President Lahoud, and all of that will lead to the development of our tourism industry and the restoration of Lebanon's distinct role in the world."
Al-Jisir also thanked the president of the republic for his personal patronage of the opening of the judicial year last Friday, and thought that the participation of the state's leaders in this annual judicial tradition "reflects

Minister Hovnanian then spoke and said: "Mobilizing the active powers in our society, with the youths at the forefront, became a national and domestic duty in the face of the challenges facing the nation as a result of the hostile alliance between world Zionism, represented in the Israeli entity, and the American Administration."
It is the one that stands by the uprising of the heroic Palestinian people."
Yesterday, he visited the President of the Republic, Emile Lahoud, and Vice President of the of the Supreme Islamic Shiite Council, Sheikh Abdel Amir Qablan, and toured the north and the south.
From Baabda to Jizzine ("Al-Nahar"), where McCarrick received the Chaplain of the Flock, Father Elias Nassar, at his home before the cardinal went on his way to Marjiyoon.
In the evening, Cardinal McCarrick visited the Vice President of the Supreme Islamic Shiite Council, Sheikh Abdel Amir Qablan, at the Council's headquarters in the presence of the Mufti of Sour and Jebel Amel, Mr. Ali Al-Amin, Islamic Law Judge Sheikh Mahdi Yahfoufi and Judge Sheikh Mohammad Zghaib.
He added, addressing McCarrick: "If you wanted to help us, then let them draw the American people's attention to support oppressed peoples, pay attention to the Zionist injustice and terrorism inflicted upon the Palestinian people, while Lebanon is occupied with Israeli land mines left over by the occupation.  Shabaa Farms is also still occupied, and everyday Israel violates Lebanese sovereignty when its planes violate Lebanese airspace."
Then there was a short recess at the Enclave's lobby, during which Bishop Al-Bisri presented the American cardinal a souvenir gift made from cedar wood, followed by a visit to the Jibran Museum in Basharri, where Cardinal McCarrick toured and listened to a presentation by Joe Gaga on Jibran's artwork.
Maronite League Criticizes "Official Loose Talk;" Al-Khazen: Inclination by Some in Authority Toward Reducing Areas of Liberties in Country
Representative Al-Khazen, in turn, criticized "the permanent inclination by some parties of the authority to reducing the areas of liberties in the country." He assessed the role of the opposition in general, and some of its interceptive steps which it does not have the ability to enforce under an authority that was able until now to divert objectives and take advantage of the outbreak of the secular situation in the country without bearing the responsibility for it.
The general political situation prevailing now indicates that the country is standing at a dead end as a result of growing resentment and charged atmospheres reflected by the media, further exacerbated by what comes out of the official media, including the loose talk from those who are supposed to be speaking on behalf of the government of all of Lebanon.
Parallel to the desired national dialogue, an internal Christian dialogue must be established to pave the way for it. The required dialogue does not aim at eradicating the political diversity inside this arena, nor does it aim at dissolving particulars, but at least to streamline competition within contexts and mechanics that rely on the principle of recognizing one another, the right to disagree and not resorting to undemocratic means and slander."

This was what a foreign ambassador told more than one Lebanese official, especially after Lebanon pumped a quantity of Al-Wazzani's water that has been allocated for drinking for about 40 southern villages.
He called attention to the fact that the danger of destroying Al-Wazzini's facilities is still present, and that the real deterrent until now has been American, which falls in the same context, calling for not opening a front in the south.
The same source affirmed that Lebanon is used to the Israeli threat, especially with Sharon, for twenty years at various times, and that threatening will not make her forgo her decision to liberate Shabaa Farms, exactly as she has been patient for about a quarter of a century before being able to liberate a large part of her territories in the south and West Bikaa that were occupied by Israel.
The Chairman of the Socio-Economic Council, Roget Nisnas, laid out 3 factors for the success of the council's work consisting of cooperation of the economic entities with free-lance vocations, associations and domestic powers; state support through satisfying its needs; and finally, "that the council stand up for itself, affirming that it constituted a need through its contribution to opening a dialogue and to cooperation between the powers of the society as it is between these powers and the state."
Al-Hariri was speaking at a luncheon party held by the International College Alumni Society in his honor at the "Pial" Center, in the presence of the Society's President, Mufeed Baidoun, and a number of ministers, representatives and alumni.
As for the public sector, there are several ways to stop the waste, most notable of which is to privatize the working sectors and finalize the issue of surplus employees.  It is important that we do not expand employment without justification and take advantage of the capabilities available to us."

So according to the plan agreed upon between them, he started sharing with his cousin this money, which Hisham was getting by way of entering the plaintiff's office with the copied keys to steal some checks drawn to the plaintiff's accounts in the banks, in addition to his own seal, and then writing out these checks, stamping them with the stolen seal, forging the plaintiff's signature on the checks, as a drawer and an endorser, and then cashing them through his cousin, defendant Bahaa S. and sharing their revenue.
At the invitation of the National Action Seminar, a discussion group met yesterday about former Minister Dr. Essam Nomaan's book, "The Arabs at a Juncture, an Outlook on Challenges After September 11, 2002", at the Tawfiq Tabbara Center in Beirut.

He endures the anxieties of the Arabs, especially in Palestine and Iraq because they have been directly targeted, and because of the tragic circumstances the Palestinian and Iraqi peoples are living."
He posed such questions for discussion as: Why are ethnic wars, wrapped with many slogans such as "self-determination", sweeping the world after the Cold War?
He made comments on "the confusion when dealing with the nature of the relationship that binds the United States with Israel and which side is serving other and which one is leading the other. This confusion often emanated from an idea which serves to enlarge Israel in order to once justify Arab incompetence, and another time from the desire not to show hostility toward the American policy."
Often we read statements from professors and students in the third division at the College of Sciences at the Lebanese University who complain about the poor conditions of their college, but as the popular proverb says, "Talking is not seeing."

If a similar threat were to occur at any private university, politicians would have raced to offer donations to preserve the reputation of the country in front of foreigners.
If this dream were to be realized in the coming years (20 to 50 years?), like the dream of the university city in Al-Shweifat has been realized, and like the work that is going on in the Al-Bikaa city (where the cornerstone had been laid), the situation until work is finished in the Al-Moon Michel cannot be tolerated, and the sciences students have no laboratories this year.

The Lebanese intellectual Ali Harb analyzed in his article "The Intellectual Crisis Between the Church and Secularism - The Example of Bishop Haddad's Case", the occurrence of secular phenomena, explaining the points which secularism intersects, as a development in the human intellectual communication, with religions which are considered removed from intellectualism due to their adherence to metaphysical divine communication, and contending that a big gap exists today between these religions and the societies that belong or "submit" to them, and that they are detached from the spirit of the time and the beliefs that are appropriate for it that contradict the now-useless metaphysical divine rules that produce nothing but blind fanaticism and which made Carlos Abboud, for example, assault and hit Bishop Haddad, creating a state of confusion in the church again and opening the case of Bishop Haddad with the church, a case that historically goes back more than a quarter of century.

Pinocchio at War; Rajeh Al-Khouri
We, in the Third World, know that type of presidents, but we are talking about America "the lone empire," and about the president of America who did not hesitate to describe himself, albeit indirectly, as if he were fate and destiny, or the "super vision!"
It is as if he wanted to say, for example, "Pinocchio At War," since the mere correlation of the mental picture of Bush, which is a mixture of amazement blended with underestimation (perhaps it was that underestimation that made Francoise Ducros, the Canadian Prime Minister's Aide, call Bush "a moron," which led to her resignation the day before yesterday). This correlation is enough to launch a load of needed irony!
He did not hesitate to say: "I am in a fiery mood... I am worried, rely on intuition and I like to provoke the people around me."
Perhaps we do not need this conversation in the first place as long as Bush has told Woodward that America cannot afford to get the approval of all people to use force, for example, against Iraq, but the "confident action" leads to the desired result because it acts as a type of attraction that pulls the hesitant to join the ranks.

The Jordanian Prime Minister, Ali Abu Al-Raghib, reminded the chiefs of the societies that it is not permitted for these professional organizations to practice any political activity and urged them to respect that decision.
The 13 professional societies contend that they have more than 100 thousand members.

Difference in Opinions on Cellular Case; Dhaher: No Guarantee For State To Obtain Collection Bonds
"The Central news Agency" asked Representative Dhaher for his opinion on the recent developments in the cellular case, and he called attention to "Minister Qardahi's conservatism on the collection bonds, valued at 600 million dollars, and thought that these bonds must not be frozen; otherwise, what is the guarantee for collecting this sum?"
While any sum due the two companies is under the trust of the state, they will collect it because the state exists and is not prone to bankruptcy.
For his part, Fnaish said: "We had a previous question on this subject and we did not receive the required response for it.
He responded: "The matter requires study and a financial and economic calculation.
Does he fear that the state would lose the collection bonds?
As for Khalil, he thought that the official clarification confirms that entitlements of the state were not exceeded and that the matter is left to the results of arbitration," calling attention to "that this matter is the focus of a serious discussion between the president of the republic and the government."
Which is the result of the united will of the president of the republic and the prime minister."
"We called attention, in the statement by the General Secretariat of the Supreme Privatization Council at the Council of Ministers, in its opening that "the government of President Al-Hoss issued the two collection orders (against the two cellular companies) in April 2000.
After the issuance of the two collection bonds in April 2000, the Minister of Communications immediately conveyed them to the two cellular companies, and both of them rushed to object by filing a lawsuit against the state with the Beirut and Baabda Elementary Courts and asked for halting their execution.
Our government decided then to wait until the two courts issued their verdicts so that we have a basis to go with.
Or after the departure of our government.
Attacking our former government does not shield the shortfalls of the Council of Ministers' decision.
It is wrong because it set a relatively-high interest rate (10 percent) on the sums due the two companies in dollars, at a time when the government is bragging about the lowering of interest rates in the market in general, claiming it is due to be lowered more."
On another front, President Lahoud received a message from the French President Jacque Chirac, in which he congratulated him for the fifty-ninth anniversary of independence and affirmed France's constant standing by Lebanon "in honor of the deep friendship ties that bind the two countries."
I repeat my thanks to you and to all Lebanese for your reception and fondness of the French language which we all share."
The Emirati Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Maktoum Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, and the Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Bahrain, Sheikh Salman Bin Hamad Bin Issa Al Khalifa, also sent congratulatory telegrams.
The Iranian Islamic Republic is proud to always be with its resources besides this people who are building glory and zeal.
The "Permanent Consultative Gathering of Religious Authorities in Lebanon" reminded the world, as peoples, governments and regimes, that "the City of Jerusalem must be liberated from the occupation that is holding it like a nightmare, and that the religious holy shrines cannot remain captive and humiliated." It denounced the Israeli siege of the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Church of Nativity.
- Second: We also offer the various Christian factions in Lebanon and the world, especially in oppressed Palestine, similar congratulations on the occasion of Christmas and the New Year, which coincide this year with the happy Eid.
-Fourth: We appeal to the free and honorable consciences everywhere to pay attention to the magnitude of criminality and killing exercised by the leaders of the Zionist enemy, with the civilized world seeing and listening, and with the blessing of the super powers, especially America.
-Seventh: The Gathering affirms its full support of the resistance in Lebanon in its confrontation with the Israeli occupation and its quest to liberate the Shabaa Farms, releasing the captives and affirming our right in our waters, and we affirm our standing by all religious factions in Lebanon because it is our choice and the only road to attain our rights.

In view of the circumstances incited by the Council of Minister's resolution on the cellular telephone case, the Information Office of the Minister of Communications, Jean Lois Qardahi, issued the following statement, in response to the statement by the Secretary-General of the Supreme Privatization Council, Ghazi Yousef:
Flaihan gave an address in which he said: "Paris-2 is not a single junction, but it is the result of two years of work done by the Lebanese government in cooperation with the Parliamentary Council to take a number of measures that helped Paris-2 a succeed, the most important outcome of which was the issue of the Lebanese lira.
None of the ministers received any information on an employee at his ministry, regarding an issue that has disgusted a government official recently.
Former Representative Albert Mansour expressed his fear that the "role of the presidency of the republic as a monitor and a controller of the work of the institutions" will be impaired and noted that "the president of the republic, instead of being a monitor of the institutions, has started to become a partner."
This atmosphere is the one that led to what happened to the issue of the cellular telephone, after it was prepared for by previous agreements between the prime minister and the some ruling key figures.
He thought that "this matter shows the absence of a Council of Ministers institution, which goes back to the way the government was formed.
Is it right that the Council of Ministers commit several violations under the ruling body unity slogan?
And instead of holding this team accountable, they will force us to pay again."
Murhij: Paris-2 Golden Opportunity For Government; Reject Privatization If It Means Monopoly
He explained "that privatization is not a process of selling public sector institutions to the private sector, but the state assumed during the war a role bigger than its capability and its size, and now, it is presumed to return to the private sector all it can manage better, under proper conditions that are adopted by the Parliament and proposed by the government.
As for colleague Ali Hamada, he contended in a conversation with the same program "that Lebanon is not ruled according to a written constitution, but it is rather ruled according to an unwritten and invisible constitution in line with an unwritten political doctrine," describing the government as "made up of four basic political powers and that the widest body in it is President Al-Hariri's bloc, followed by Minister Junblatt's bloc, then President Lahoud's bloc and President Nabih Berri."
The "Tripoli Alliance" is repulsed for the turning of a difference in opinion on  public issues into a "personal dispute" that can harm the understanding of political action and the interests of the city," calling for "a return to the language of reason and dialogue."
Regarding some opinions in the press that dealt with the "Tripoli Alliance" or its representatives, we affirm our respect for the freedom of expression and assure those who voiced such opinions that the "Tripoli Alliance" knows exactly what it wants; that its positions are resolute and specified clearly; that its style is openness with the public opinion; that it does not deal with politics via hidden messages; that it still holds the initiative and is capable of protecting its alliances as long as it enjoys the confidence of its people in Tripoli and the north; and that it acts out of its national convictions and what its Parliamentary responsibilities dictate."
He disclosed that the President of the Republic, Emile Lahoud, will lay on the 14th of this December the cornerstone for the unified academic building in the north.
As he pointed out that he was one of those who welcomed Paris-2 and one of those who praised the abilities of President Rafiq Al-Hariri to make this conference a success, he called on the government to "start with administrative reform, since our administration is experiencing a shameful reality."
He urged the Lebanese youth to stick to the home country and not become hopeless because hopelessness is a killer, and it is hope that opens the prospects of the future in front of them."
"It seems that the Secretary-General of the Supreme Privatization Council is not to be trusted with what is going on with the cellular case as he minces words and distorts events and facts.
2- We remind the Secretary-General and his working team, which includes a lawyer who has a working relationship with the "Liban Ciel" Company, that the Ministry of Communications expressed reservations on a number of issues including:
In addition to an innumerable number of legal, financial and administrative comments spelled out by the Minister of Communications and which were not adopted.
- Second: The minister's comments on the working team of the General Secretariat of the Supreme Privatization Council, especially on its legal council, is slanderous and not truthful.
- Fourth: As for the freezing of the two collection bonds without giving the necessary guarantees, this subject had been discussed at the Council of Ministers, which rejected the mechanism proposed by the minister to give guarantees, clearing or freezing a part of the book value sums owed to the two companies.
Al-Siniora: Success of Paris-2 Ushers Lebanon Into New Phase
After pointing out the implementation of a series of policies and measures to develop and stimulate the Lebanese economy, he contended "that the desired objective out of these measures is to free the country's economy of the empty cycle whereby balancing the budget can be achieved by the advent of the year 2006.
He thought that "in parallel to what Paris-2 gave us, including loans, financial facilities and others, the convening of the conference constituted a political, moral and material support, and "a message of trust" in Lebanon and its economic program from the international community, reflected by the level of attendance on the one side, and the crux of the positions that were declared inside and outside the conference on the other.
We also think that achieving these results, after this good and generous initiative was achieved, and which we are working today on implementing its substance, requires the need to double the efforts at all levels.
Martial Law was declared in Baghdad by a Royal decree, and as evening descended in Baghdad, the army had occupied key points and began patrolling the deserted streets.
In the city, calm retuned while the armored vehicles continued their patrols.
It is understood from the news that reached Cairo from Baghdad that General Abdel Latif Amin was appointed as a military governor for the Baghdad region and that police arrested some demonstrating political leaders, and several arrests are expected.
British official circles continued to say that there's nothing to regard the Baghdad demonstrations as extremely serious, and these circles explained that there is nothing to warrant comparison, with the situation as it stands now, between these riots and the incidents that preceded the crises in Egypt and Iran.
And for what age did he assign the seats which were jammed with kids and adults at the first show of his play "Simply"?
A big crystal ball is unfolding before you with captivating colors and tunes, as Luna (Jihan Arsenious) and her grandfather (Raymond Hossni) appeared in a dialogue on the looming snow, led by lightening and thunder.
And before its fire eats Luna's house, the snow "Ahh" comes in and extinguishes it, then melts... simply.
Thank you, Camille, because we remembered it, and I will never forget.
Duration: 95
As a remembrance for yearning, captivated by thirsty roads.
Or when the glitter of untimely pride takes your hand.
And after the scent of returning to Autumn surrounds me in your voice.
The sound of hail has cleared, except that more pleasant sleep from the stars sits on his hands as a garb.
Roots being cared for by the fertile springs, pouring fertility.
Let me stay in prairies that are rippled with your chosen night like the ecstasy of a dim star finding comfort in your deep face.
Leaving to the blossom of your life exposed me as to sparkle with the sweetness of the lakes.
Call me rosy pots of flowers, swinging with reminiscence into the soul of wandering that reminds of your comfort and the heavens.
When days passed without him being detained, speculation started in the Iranian political and press circles.
From the discussions of the Iranian inside, it seems to the observer that the controversy about opening a dialogue with Washington has entered a new stage that can be considered advanced.
What is noticeable is that some who are classified in the square of conservatives have started to talk about the absence of impediments for dialogue with Washington and about the importance to Iran of the relationship with Washington.
In his address to a gathering of representatives recently, Rafsinjani said that "no one opposes establishing ties between unofficial circles in Iran and the United States including the representatives of the people, but what is refused is using this matter as a tool in political rivalry."
From  the collection of Iranian positions, the theoretical and the practical, since the incidents of September 11, starting with Khatami's condolences for the victims of the World Trade Center and his condemnation of terrorism, passing by the practical position in Afghanistan, and reaching the call for "self-control" in southern Lebanon, the Iranian-American relations that have been tense since February 1979 seem to be heading for a new phase. Perhaps it will be a step along a track followed by the Iranians with their eyes on the model of Chinese-American relations.
In the beginning, Bishop Abu Juda welcomed the attendees, inviting them to participate in the media staff honorary celebration that will be held at noon on Tuesday, May 7, in the Center.
After that Sister Mary Roger Al-Zughbi delivered a speech in which she said that it "is difficult today to determine the source of knowledge and culture due to the media services' effect on minds, thoughts, and conceptions, particularly since the media services and especially the Internet have become like professors of new sciences and are close to replacing the family and the school."
Then the head of the technical committee presented an explanation of the program.
In one of the weekly meetings held by the two publishers Hisham and Mohammad Ali Hafiz, I raised the issue of the mistakes made by Egyptian writers. Their answer was: "The Egyptians have their own style in writing, so do not try to impose the Lebanese style, and do not forget that we, in Saudi Arabia and in other Gulf countries, have learned at the hands of the Egyptians".
You'd better ask 'Al-Azhar', for it may have the true tiding."
Residents of the Mar Taqla Al Hazimyyah region, specifically those from the street that extends from the former Libyan Embassy crossroads to the French Consulate, passing through Ad-Diyar Building, Region 6, Street 73, complained of the bad condition of the roads and the potholes that are spread throughout the streets.  They said they felt as if they were in the unknown regions of Africa.
A subscriber in one of the two cellular telephone companies in Lebanon received bills with very high amounts that made him suspicious because their value exceeded the services and the calls he made.
And to verify that he has to come in person
- From colleague Ghazi Miqati:
But I advise citizens not to change their car engines before the law determining the internationally approved specifications is promulgated", indicating that this would happen soon.
In many different places and buildings, in different quarters, which has exhausted citizens as they conduct their business in official departments. The police detachment center is one building, the population office in another, in addition to the district headquarters, the finance department, the telephone utility, the social security and the other security centers.
An office of the Official National Press Agency was also opened, but most of the rooms and halls were empty of everything other than neglect and chaos.
Year of publication: 2002.
In the Al-Sitt Nafisa quarter in Sidon there is an old house that was inhabited by former President Adil Asiran for a time before he moved elsewhere.
It is clear that Rafiq Al-Hariri is careful not to exaggerate in raising the ceiling of expectations.
The intention, of course, is to urge the Lebanese, despite the variation of their interests in opposition, to oppose and to oppose the existence of an opposition(!); to exert the effort that benefits Lebanon, not what harms it.
How could the state hold an almost free dialogue with Western countries and institutions, while it is not holding a minimum-level dialogue with the Lebanese forces?
We are not also exaggerating when we say that the external lantern with the prime minister glows, helps and produces more than the internal lantern.
Perhaps through this symbolism, which is not without anguish and hope, the crux of his talk boils down to two words: opportunity and trust.
Did it win over the opposition?
For that, without pretending to teach a lesson in political philosophy, although some representatives and ministers are in dire need for it, it must be reminded that the state is not owned by anyone but its citizens, all of its citizens, by solidarity and standing together.
As for the authority's victory over the state, there is no need for complex analyses to prove its occurrence.
The scenario ends by arming the authority with the very noise that itself caused to legitimize the violation of democracy rules it will embark upon. For example, demonstrations are banned to justify, with a retroactive effect, the poisons it spread to arrive at this happy ending.
As for the price, who is asking?
The civilization of the picture, where is it now?
Even the "Taliban" movement which is a stranger to the picture culture became aware of this absence, and changed its mind about refusing the presence of television crews (except "Al Jazeera") in its emirates, and opened the door a quarter wide, seeking to spread the scenes of destruction created no doubt by US bombing, and through that, seeking to receive international sympathy.
No bodies, no blood, no howling.
It was without a doubt the reason behind the initial reaction, but another factor came to entrench the absence of victims.
What is deemed strange by journalists is perceived by historians as normal. In all wars, the warrior seeks to hide his losses so that the moral is not affected. This is what Mark Fro, the French writer who dedicated a part of his research to the relationship between history and cinema before working on the archive picture material in an intriguing television show that was played on the cultural "Artie" channel, explains in his same report.
After that, how do we perceive the conflict of civilizations?
This is also clearly known in Lebanon, where as soon as talk turns to the politics of the last ten years, the word prevails over the picture, save for a few exceptions mentioned on the program "With the Naked Eye", the documentary prepared by Diana Muqalled on the "Future" channel.
Not even that, the same story is repeated over and over.
And talk is not restricted to "Al Jazeera".
But what justifies this exception?
Of course there is the presence in Kabul and the use, which Osama Bin Laden can turn to.
The delegation members, whose number exceeded one hundred, demanded liberating their salaries and dues "to enable them to secure their morsel of living and pay the fees for registering their children in public schools."
He also received a delegation from the "Congregation's Custodianship", which concerns itself with the educational sector and helping students, then the director of the French Cultural Center in Tripoli, Philip Ardouan on the occasion of his assumption of his new tasks.

The book states that the fortress was built during the reign of the Sharif of Mecca, Surur bin Musaid, between the years 1772 and 1788 "by the efforts and funding of the Sharif and local, not Turkish, workers".
It confirmed that the Ajyad fortress "was a purely local monument, built on Saudi territory by the hands of the inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula, not those of the Turks," and for that reason, "the Turkish interference in the matter of the Ajyad fortress has no legal or historical basis".
The commercial and housing complex is one of the projects underway to modernize Mecca. The Faqih Research and Development Center confirmed that "most of the buildings [which] are currently situated near the Sanctuary cannot meet the increasing numbers of pilgrims" and that "the only solution is to develop the area surrounding the mosque by building towers in order to increase capacity and solve traffic problems".
To facilitate traffic flow and prevent jams, 40 side roads will be built leading to the Mosque, in addition to pedestrian tunnels.
American President Recovers Quickly and Starts Domestic Tour; Pretzel Caused Bush to Lose Consciousness; Fall Leaves Bruise on Cheeks; Pretzel; Planned Tour
Smiling, he said, "My mother always used to say to me to chew my pretzel well before swallowing it. Always listen to what your mothers tell you."
And they were looking at him in a funny way."
He said that the President had, over the last two days, complained of not feeling his usual self and expected to have a cold, and that this condition, and his eating the pretzel without swallowing it properly, had caused his heart rate to slow and his lose of consciousness.
This is a very common phenomenon, which may be caused by fear or intestinal disorder.
Pretzels can be found in London's shops as a specialist food.
His visit includes a foodstuff factory in Aurora, the state of Missouri, before he heads for New Orleans to make a speech.
Jordanian Prime Minister Ali Abu Al-Ragheb submitted the resignation of his government to King Abdallah II bin Al-Hussein, who instructed him to form a new government in preparation for the election of parliamentary deputies to be conducted in the Kingdom this year.
The elections were to have taken place last November, but the Government decided to postpone them until June, for reasons relating to the promulgation of a new election law in the same month which has redistributed electoral constituencies and increased the chamber of Deputies from 80 to 104, but has retained the "one vote" system, which has caused controversy in opposition circles.
Wali Al-Hulaiqah has retained the composition of the Economic Team in the former government. Basim Awadallah continues as Minster of Planning, Michel Marto continues as Minister of Finance, and the only woman in the former government, Tammam Al-Ghul, retains the social development portfolio.
General Parvez Musharraf came to power as a result of a military coup in protest at former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's acceptance of the withdrawal of Kashmiri fighters who had penetrated Indian lines in Kashmir between May and July 1999.
Were Nawaz Sharif able to appear in public today, he would have said to his successor, "Now you understand the meaning of international pressures when they increase and intensify, and the price for standing up to them becomes so high that you just can't pay."
But the world is no longer the same.
One of Lahud's boasts as President is that he, by virtue of his political steadfastness during negotiations with the United Nations following liberation on 25 May 2000, secured the return of 17 million square meters of Lebanese territory and retained the right to an armed resistance that is inseparable from Hizbollah.
Shabaa is undefined in the lexicon of Resolution 425.
It is not Hizbollah alone, but the state that supports and offers it sanctuary, that opens the door to military operations on the borders with Israel.
And ultimately, Musharraf could do nothing but weigh up the balance of probabilities of a heavy defeat to be added to the loss in Afghanistan.
Lebanon: The day on which it will confront decisive choices is not far away.
And that is crucial.
These contacts, which are being undertaken by American and European parties, aim to find out the extent to which Syria and Lebanon are prepared to enter into talks with Israel on the basis of implementation of resolutions 425, 242 and 338, whereby Israeli forces would withdraw from the Golan and the Shabaa Farms, prisoners and detainees would be exchanged between the three parties and peace would be realized between Israel on the one hand and Syria and Lebanon on the other. Efforts to establish peace between Israel and the Palestinian Authority would continue.
In addition, an agreement between Israel on the one hand and Syria and Lebanon on the other would negate the reasons for continuing the Lebanese resistance because both the Shabaa Farms and the Golan would have been liberated. The continuation of resistance in order to liberate Palestine, which has people of its own to assume this responsibility, would be unacceptable.
And it could be difficult for Arab borders with Israel to remain calm were there to be a war between Israelis and Palestinians.
It may be that to achieve comprehensive peace in the region requires time and more effort. Realizing security before achieving such a peace may be easier and closer to hand. If Syria and Lebanon do accept an Israeli withdrawal from the  Shabaa Farms and the Golan in return for security along the length of the borders with Israel, then negotiations for a comprehensive peace could take their time in an atmosphere of calm, security stability or truce.
There is no complete plan for a remedy and, if there was, there would be a problem in securing the funds necessary to implement it."
Those responsible for the state finances and the public coffers, at the forefront of which stand Fuad Al-Sinyurah, have the right, if not the duty, not to fund bankruptcy.
The opportunity that the new Board of Administration demands may cost about 400 million dollars, that is the cost of the fuel deficit for a period of ten months, and we do not know whether it is possible to improve collection to reduce this sum, which, by the way, secures a fixed and not a permanent current.
Hasn't there been a call to resort to the security and judicial forces?
After Acceding to the Security Council and Against the Backdrop of American Openness, Syria Retains Shabaa as Key Card until the Talks
Meanwhile, Rod-Larsen's words have left the impression that Syria implicitly agrees with what he said. It did not deny it in the media, with the implications this has for protecting the right of resistance in operations it mounts in the Shabaa Farms and underlining Lebanon's right. Nor has it refuted this in documents to the Security Council in the last two years.
Not to mention that its transformation into a member of this effective and influential organization carries with it a considerable amount of responsibility, which cannot be ignored.
2) The American openness in the first instance, and that of the West generally, towards Syria on the basis of co-operation in the struggle against terrorism.
This was explained by diplomatic sources as an encouraging distancing of Syria and a spur towards greater cooperation in combating terrorism, especially following the noticeable calm in the Shabaa Farms, which is due to Syria in the first instance.
Because the Pressures Increase
The President of the Republic says that he will dispatch ministers to deliver the invitations to Arab leaders.
But even this is insufficient to transform the official Lebanese positions into a unified Lebanese position, a strong and decisive stance in preparing to host the summit.
In any case, a Lebanon that is united and convinced of its position towards resistance needs the summit in order to ensure an Arab position that supports it and goes beyond the mere formulation of such a position, in order to hold fast when the pressures brought to bear on it do increase. The alternative is for Lebanon to find itself without effective Arab cover when the pressures brought to bear on all the Arabs increase.
India, Pakistan's traditional enemy, has helped to push Pakistan, specifically its President, General Parvez Musharraf, to take the side of the United States in the war on Taliban and bin Ladin terror in the wake of the 11 September attacks, and to provide the military facilities the United States needs to win this war.
This would have put his country on the America list of terrorist targets to be struck and eliminated.
Naturally, Musharraf could only choose the second option, which is what he did.
Does this mean that all that is happening on the Indian-Pakistani borders is a scenario planned and scripted by the United States and performed by the rulers of these two hostile neighboring countries?
But this meeting of interests is, on its own, insufficient to establish calm, even relative calm, between Pakistan and India, to stabilize General Musharraf's regime and make him succeed in building a moderate Islamic state. The United State must make this not a temporary meeting of interests, but one that is permanent and stable, and this is possible by several means, including rapid efforts on its part to resolve the problem of Kashmir.
It also requires that we wait to verify the sincerity of American support for such an experiment and for any similar experiment in the Islamic world.
Now you have your answer, albeit after labor pains the like of which Arab summits have not seen since summits and the Arab League were first established.
At the time and place set by the Amman summit, namely in Beirut at the end of next March. So be proud, you Lebanese!
But this is not all the news.
At least, it is some time since they last bore one like this.
Does this mean that the messing about is over and that there are no surprises or personal shocks to come?
Some days ago Israeli seized a ship loaded with weapons and claimed that it had originated from Iran and was heading for Palestine to support the Intifada.
This horrific situation causes us to raise a number of questions, the most of which are as follows:
The Palestinian Authority has denied involvement with this arms shipment and Hizbollah has mocked the spurious charged directed against it.
It is perhaps no coincidence that this incident should occur on the eve of the arrival of the American representative (Zaini) to the region.
Is this approach in line with the values for which America calls, namely liberty, democracy and human rights?
For at its very beginning the Intifada was not an armed revolution, but one that was armed with nothing but rocks.
The Intifada must continue and honorable civil resistance must escalate, armed with demonstrations, sit-ins, media campaigns and an embargo against Israel.
If the Palestinian question were relabeled as a pan-Arab issue, it would be because the fate of the Arab nation and all of its peoples depends on the fate of the Palestinian question.
So why does America support Israel and justify these operations?
New Delhi continues to apply pressure on Islamabad to suppress extremist Islamic groups. Indian Defense Minister George Fernandez announced that Indian forces mobilized on the borders with Pakistan would only withdraw if Pakistan's President Parvez Musharraf translated into action his undertaking to reign in the Islamists.
He confirmed, "Mobilization is complete. Efforts may be made to reduce tension only, and I repeat the word only, if cross-border terrorism is stopped in practical terms."
A police officer said that revolutionaries had stormed the store in the Punsh district. 250 km north of Jammu, the winter capital of the state, and had opened fire. Two soldiers were killed immediately and three others wounded before the fighters fled.
In Islamabad a spokesman for the military government General Rashid Qurshi announced that Pakistan was awaiting the withdrawal of Indian military reinforcements to reduce the tension.
Abd Al-Ghani Bahat, leader of the Freedom Conference, which comprises about 23 parties and separatist organizations believed, "The time has come to go beyond the normal considerations, to respond to the present invitation, seize the opportunity and take practical measures."
The separatist "Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front" welcomed the address of the Pakistani President, notably "the renewed emphasis on political, moral and diplomatic support for Kashmiris".

First President of the Editors Syndicate Mulhim Karam yesterday met at the Syndicate's headquarters with Iranian Ambassador Muhammad Ali Subhani and First Advisor at the Embassy Abu Al-Hasan Zaafari in the presence of a number of members of the Syndicate Council.
The media are one close-knit family and have duties, obligations and needs which it must meet.
Today we believe that the Palestinian Intifada and the resistance in Lebanon are sources of strength and power for the Arab and Islamic world in confronting the Zionist enemy.
There can be no doubt that Lebanese national unity on the one hand, and Lebanese resistance on the other, are the two principal guarantees for Lebanon's permanence, sovereignty, continuation and preservation of all Lebanese gains.
And whilst its military machine may be sophisticated, the Israeli soldier is a coward because he is not defending a just cause.
President Bashir Al-Jamil, for whom Jan Ghanim was his right-hand man, used to call him Jano. Former minister Ilyas Habiqah before becoming leadership of the "Lebanese Forces" used to call him Jano, as did Dr Samir Jaajaa, despite the differences between the two men.
But he lost the 2000 elections and the relationship between him and his colleague Ilyas Habiqah, who also lost in the elections, was lukewarm.
Ghanim's star continued to shine in the party and political arena. On 28 December 1985 he headed for Damascus to witness his friend, Ilyas Habiqah, Director of the Executive Authority in the "Forces", sign the tripartite agreement with the leader of the Amal movement (Speaker) Nabih Birri and leader of the Progressive Socialist Party (Deputy) Walid Janbalat, under senior Syrian patronage and in the presence of a number of prominent Lebanese witnesses.
And whilst Jan Ghanim may have closed his eyes, the smile will remain on his face, which never frowned.
He returned to Lebanon where he practiced medicine in various hospitals, including Sainte Charles and Baabda, as well as various clinics in the district of Baabda during the war years and thereafter.
He stood for a seat as a Deputy in the district of Baabada in 1992 and 1996 and won on both occasions.
He died yesterday (Monday), 14/01/2002, following a traffic accident about two weeks ago which left him in a coma.
They mentioned that more than one minister who had met with Musa since his arrival at his headquarters in the Phoenicia Hotel had felt that he was portraying the summit venue as a problem and giving the Libyan proposal more leeway than was necessary, bearing in mind that the written support of Djibouti for the proposal did not require any delay in setting the date.
However, Musa's attempt to persuade officials of the importance of waiting for the results of what he termed "quiet Arab diplomacy" on the pretext of taking the positions of these countries into consideration, had been officially fenced off at a senior level. This was not just by simple rejection of the attempt, but by issuing of two statements. The first emerged from the Republican Palace and included a list of 8 ministers sent to the President of the Republic Emil Lahud to pass on letters and invitations to Arab Kings, Presidents and Princes even before the Secretary-General reached Baabda and whilst he was meeting with Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri, who also issued a written statement confirming, like Lahud, Lebanon's concern that all Arab leaders should take part in the summit and Lebanon's determination to hold it on its territory.
They said that that the statements issued by the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister had headed off the justifications brought by Musa, on the basis that messengers had begun to pack their bags to deliver the letters and that Lebanon was keen to welcome the Libyan leader.
They responded to Musa's fears that the threats directed against Col. Gaddafi were not insignificant and should be taken seriously by saying, "The security measures being put in place aim to protect all those participating, notably the leaders of the delegations.
They did not wish to predict the effect of the two statements on the Libyan leadership, and before them on Musa, wishing instead to focus on actual preparations for the summit in Beirut on the 27th and 28th of next March.
Lahud received Minister of Communication Eng. Jan-Lui Qirdahi, who gave a presentation of the Ministry's achievements during 2001 and its Program of Work for 2002, and provided him with a short report on these matters.
The President of the Republic received Minister of Culture Ghassan Salamah who informed him of the results of the Francophone Ministerial Meeting, held in Paris, which, pursuant to a request made by Lebanon, passed a joint resolution to hold the next Francophone Summit in Beirut next October.
He also met former Deputy Zahir Al-Khatib and discussed with him a number of political topics and Lebanon's position towards current regional developments.
I ask Almighty God to keep you, Amir of Kuwait, in good health, to enable you to continue leading the fraternal State of Kuwait and its proud people on the path of goodness, success and prosperity."
The President of the Republic also received the Director General of Civil Defense, Air Commander Darwish Haqibah, and reviewed with him the civil defense conditions and the requirements for strengthening and developing its work. President Lahud praised the efforts made by civil defense cadres, particularly in light of the difficult natural and climatic conditions, in addition to the aid work and other humanitarian services.
Deputy Prime Minister Isam Faris yesterday visited Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Nabih Birri, and discussed the developments with him.
Subhani invited Karam to participate in an Islamic Conference to be held in Tehran on the 29th and 30th of January entitled "The International Conference for Media in the Islamic World to Support the Intifada".
Chairman of the American Congressional Delegation, and leader of the minority democrats therein, Richard Gephardt believed that "achieving peace is very important for Lebanon and the United States". He stressed the need to fight terrorism "because it destroys and spreads chaos", noting that "Lebanon has witnessed terrorist acts and has been affected by terrorism perhaps more than any other country".
He answered, "The fact is that the Archbishop is preoccupied with many things during the period of the feasts and we have not met since three weeks. There was a need for a long meeting, but I stress that it is the heart that is talking."
Jan Ghanim, aged 57, was a good friend even to his political opponents and was the most flexible of his contemporaries and peers in the military units and forces and finally in the Al-Waad Party even at the height of the political confusion in 1992 when he stood for election and won on the votes of those other than his own group by virtue of their boycott, and again in the 1996 elections.
Files that were opened by the judiciary during the government of President Al-Hiss and then frozen have not yet been closed.
After Al-Hariri had evaluated with him the benefits anticipated from the Agreement, which was signed a few days ago in Europe, he said, "We have initialed the Partnership Agreement with the European Union and, God willing, it will finally be signed in three months time and start to have automatic effect, because Lebanon has agreed with the European Union to sign a phased agreement so that all the commercial provisions will take effect on final signature and, God willing, the agreement will take effect within 3 or 4 months and we will start to feel its impact."
Al-Shuf, Al-Nahar:
Junbulat's tour included the villages of Shahim, Katrmaya, Al-Wardaniyyah and Burja. Ala Taru and the Progressive Party representative of the Al-Kharub region Munir Al-Sayyid accompanied him.
Junbulat is known to have discussed the demands of the Al-Kharub region with Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri during their meeting yesterday.
Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Popular Islamic Council, Sheikh Abd Al-Amir Qablan met with a delegation from the National Union of Associations Contracted with the Ministry of Social Affairs under the leadership of Tawfiq Asiran and informed him of his movements.
Israeli military aircraft yesterday broke the sound barrier above Beirut whilst the Secretary-General of the Arab League, Amr Musa, was meeting with the Lebanese President of the Republic, perhaps to remind the Arabs via this unshakeable national figure that it is Israel that can "move" the Arab Summit from Beirut to another venue, or even cancel the summit should it so wish, and not Shiite threats against President Muammar Gaddafi, which everyone knows are not serious, nor the counter-reaction of Libyan pressure on some areas of the Arab world.
The real fear is that the result that the venerable Arab summit might come up with as regards the real problem in the region, namely the Arab-Israeli dispute, will be no different to the result produced by the Investigation Committees of 1978 in the case of the disappearance of Al-Sadr.
Otherwise the conference will, whether it knows it or not, call for the principle of a trade, but... in relation to "the war on terror".
The following clarification has reached us from the Media Office at the Kuwait Embassy:
How can out statements be inaccurate when Kuwait has submitted the documents left behind by the Iraqi forces defeated by Kuwait to the United Nations, which reports prove that the Iraqi regime did arrest a number of Kuwaitis and Arabs and other nationals, whom it transported to Iraqi territory on the instruction of the National Command?
Why does Iraq not return to the Geneva Convention and the tripartite committee to end the suffering of our people and our prisoners?
We would remind Mr Al-Shuwaish that he is forgetting the results of Dr Abd Al-Majid's efforts and his repeated visits to the Iraqi capital, from which he would return with empty hands as a result of the obstinacy of the Iraqi officials and their lack of cooperation, exactly as the International Committee of the Red Cross did!
Yes, Kuwait has prisoners in Iraq, as is established by the documents submitted to the United Nations.
And at this juncture we would remind Iraq that the files on these missing persons only appeared in 1994.
1137 or 1124?
Our brothers in Iraq: just one prisoner with an Arab brother or neighbor is equivalent to the prisoners of a nation in its entirety.
Following the National Anthem, Archbishop Saada gave a speech focusing on "the importance of the responsibility entrusted to the village leader and his role in development of the village and the area".
It promised to cooperate with the municipal councils, officials and officers for developmental focus to examine the needs of the area and formulate a serious mechanism to monitor its implementation."
In stressing the establishment of the state of institutions and law, he declared that he "put himself at the service of the Association".
Shaarani clarified that the municipality had taken this step to rescue the situation and had opened the road after the contractor, who is responsible for surfacing the road and completing the works, had closed it.
It also asked those who wished to do this to append to their application a map showing the road, a notice of ownership and a document showing the record of the person concerned, in addition to a certificate of acquittal from the municipality. It noted that the maximum road surfacing should not exceed 120 meters in length and 3.80 meters in width for private roads. The maximum for public roads should not exceed 180 meters and 3.80 meters in width.
A number of Lebanese journalists managed to enter this territory after crossing the iron gate and traveling over roads surfaced by the Israeli forces and used by the Indian battalion for its vehicles on their way to the site facing Maskafaam settlement. They reached the south-eastern heights of Al-Adisah, close to the Blue Line, which has been marked with blue paint on a surfaced road, but did not cross it, at a distance of 50 meters from the dividing line, which Lebanese civilians have reached for the first time since the Israeli occupation in 1976.
Deputy Nazih Mansurah said, "This territory, which was occupied prior to 1988, about which the Lebanese government has expressed reservation with regard to the Larsen line, but which he did not notice, and, as Deputies of the area, we are keen to restore all the territory because the blood that has watered this land cannot be wasted."
We demand the return of our land so that the people can farm it, live there and secure their children's future, especially in these difficult economic conditions, and we call on the officials and international authorities to stand by us; otherwise, there will come the day when we will have to do something to secure the return of our land.
This may not continue for long, however, on account of the rapid changes in the winds, which determine weather conditions.
The general accumulative rate to this date in year is 462 mm.
The temperature expected on the coast will range from 11 to 17 degrees, in the mountains from 5 to 10 degrees, and in the Beqaa from 0 to 6 degrees.
They demanded that the Public Prosecutor for Cassation, Justice Adnan Adum, "change his mind with respect to his recent arrangement, by which he rendered terrorist operations, organization of demonstrations and the distribution of political leaflets one and the same".
All main and international roads in the administrative areas of Aliyyah and Baabda have been cleared.
Maintenance teams from the Ministry of Public Works continued to distribute large quantities of salt on the international road and main roads linking Aliyyah, Al-Matan and Al-Shawf.
Movement in the town was also paralyzed until 11 am.
Only the Hasbiya-Rashiya road via Ain Ata remains closed because no one has tried to open it.
Israeli military aircraft violated Lebanese airspace for the second day yesterday, and broke the sound barrier in Beirut and Tripoli.
Mr Stefan de Mistura, Personal Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General in southern Lebanon, noted, with all regret, the resumption of these air violations, and demanded that Israeli authorities put an end to them."
The head of the Roman Orthodox archdiocese of Ukkar, Archbishop Bulus Bandali honored the following Syrian and Lebanese security leaders in Ukkar at a "friendly dinner" held in their honor at a restaurant: Col. (Staff) Muhammad Muflih, responsible for Syrian security; Lt. Col. Bassam Al-Ayyubi, commander of Ukkar regional police company; Lt Col. Antwan Makkari, responsible for State Security; and Lt. Yusif Abdallah, responsible for the General Security Center in Halba.
Citizens from the area of Al-Tayunah, Ragheb Allama Street, have complained of a fault in the wires leading to their quarter. Their contacts with the Repairs Department in order to put the fault right have been unsuccessful and they have asked for power to be made available.
Faced with this regrettable situation, and in light of the absence of any official that one could contact at the Company to deal with complaints, they must be published as they are until such time as the absent officer responds to them and resolves them.
For two months, and following persistent visits, they told me that they were prepared to give me water, but at street level where it would not reach my home, which is about 150 meters away, in spite of the fact that I myself have acquired the necessary pipe, bearing in mind that the house is at the bottom of the village.
Samaan Al-Khuri has proposed to the Ministry of the Interior that the blood group be added to the Driving License in order to facilitate the transfer of any person involved in a traffic accident to hospital and the provision of first aid.
"From time to time, places of worship are targeted, whether as a criminal act by explosives being thrown or as a felony, by theft of the contents, including votive offering and possessions, or by throwing them into disorder and thereby creating an atmosphere of tension in the country.
I thank those responsible for their concern and timely action. I further hope that the officials will fulfill their remaining promises at the earliest opportunity, in particular to restore the infrastructure in the two streets (water, sewers, pavements and surfacing) and plan and modernize them."
The weapons are at once from Iran and from Iraq, and simultaneously for the Authority and for its political opponents in Hamas and Jihad.
In any event, Sharon did not need a Palestinian confession: an American statement confirming the involvement of the Palestinians would have been enough for him to proceed in what he intends to do.
Sharon wants this statement to complete what he began in the wake of 11 September by putting Arafat up against a rock, in preparation for removing him and his Authority and taking him out of the political equation in order to achieve his fundamental objective: the establishment of the state of Greater Israeli and thereby realize the dream of the first Zionist pioneers, which was stopped by the borders of the 1948 war.
For the Arabs are enjoying the anaesthetized state in which they have lived since that date and have no sense of there being any need to restore consciousness and wake up. Their regimes behave as if they were responsible for 11 September, bartering and making concessions even before they are sought, negotiating both in secret and in public to put their affairs in order with the Great State to avoid the evil of something they did not do, burying their heads in the sand so as not to see what is happening around them and prepared to do anything in order to wake up and find themselves on their thrones for another day.
Judicial overload exists in the most advanced and progressed countries, notwithstanding the particular characteristics of each country and the features of its legal system, and Lebanon, in turn, also suffers from this.
It is thus strange that Mr Abdallah Al-Ahmad cites the production figures and exchange rate of Syrian lira against the American dollar, without taking the trouble to find out those who occupied the position of Minister of the Economy during the period in which Dr Abd Al-Rauf Al-Kasm occupied the position of cabinet chair.
Note that the exchange rate of the Syrian lira against the American dollar remained essentially stable for the years 1908-1981 at an average of about 5-5.60 Syrian lira
Lead-Free Petrol: Some Appropriate Conclusions.
A review of the pages of the major oil companies on the Internet (notably that of the Saudi company Aramco) makes clear the following:
- New vehicles that are designed to run on lead-free petrol are equipped with catalytic converters and other exhaust systems. Catalytic converters are anti-pollution devices in the exhaust system of vehicles that are filled with rare metals, such as Rhodium and Palladium. During chemical reactions they convert pollutants in the exhaust gases (such as Carbon Monoxide, non-combustible hydrocarbons and Nitrogen Oxide) into water, steam and Nitrogen, which are more compatible with the environment.
In addition, the use of lead-free petrol extends the life of spark plugs and the exhaust system, provides better protection for the engine by increasing the time between oil-changes and limits engine corrosion.
- Portable petrol cans and other containers used for temporary storage will not require cleaning before being filled with the new petrol.
However, in light of developments in the movement of offers and demands, it was actually circulating in banking operations at the top end of the Central Bank's margin of intervention, between 1513.50 and 1514.00 lira, for the duration of working hours in a market automatically balancing itself, the total volume of which did not exceed 6 million dollars circulated between the banks in both purchases and sales.
At the same time, the dollar suffered from profit-taking operations in the currency against the Yen following the positions announced last week by senior officials in the Japanese government, which contained a clear warning against those speculating on the continued deterioration of the Japanese currency, which has begun to threaten Tokyo's economic interests and its relations with its Asian and American partners.

European stock markets moved to fall in wake of the doubts raised by the speech of Head of the American Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, about the areas open to the economy in the United States for a recovery this year. This put stock exchanges on the other side of the Atlantic in a weak position, as was the case with Wall Street and Nasdaq.

15 Million Dollar Credit Line to FranceBank; Al-Qassar and Al-Manai Confirm Consolidation of 300 Million Trade Exchange for Lebanon.
He announced that Francebank would, under the new agreement, obtain a line of credit totaling 15 million dollars, following its obtaining lines of credit to the value of 15 million in 2000, 10 million in 1998 and 7 million in 1997.
In turn, Al-Manai said that the occasion reflected the extent of interest of parties in the Arab world in increasing cooperation between them, which would have benefit for Arab economies. He pointed out that the signing of the new line of credit agreement for FranceBank came in this context.
He said, "Today's (yesterday's) agreement is the 42nd with Lebanon. The value of facilities has reached about 300 million dollars, which reflects the movement and dynamism of Lebanese banks in respect of the Trade Sector, which is one of the most important sectors for activating the National Product."
He called on Arab states to benefit from the volume of Arab trade and the efforts being made to expand intra-Arab exports.
In turn, Al-Qassar said that the Program provided funds for the banks according to specific conditions, with the risks at the responsibility of the Bank "which must scrutinize the quality of the borrower and the risks associated with his position, and then formulate the margins in terms of the scale of the operation, its precision and the situation of the borrower".

Quwaider: Arabs Must Provide 4 Million Job Opportunities Annually.
He added, "The Egyptian government has approved 8 programs to provide 1 million new job opportunities. These 8 projects include the employment of 150,000 young people in the administrative apparatus of state, providing 300,000 job opportunities in non-government sectors, creating 150,000 positions as part of the export support program, giving loans to 300,000 young people and craftsmen to implement small projects, employing 50,000 people abroad and 50,000 young people for village and district development."
President of the Republic Emil Lahud yesterday met with the Chairman of the Board of the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, Sheikh Badr Al-Humaidi, accompanied by the Kuwaiti Ambassador, Ali Sulaiman Al-Said, the Fund's representative in Lebanon, Bassam Al-Uthman, Chairman of the Board of Development and Construction, Jamal Aitani, and Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive of the Al-Laitain Water Utility, Eng. Nasir Nasrallah.
He praised the support provided by the Kuwaiti Fund to Lebanon to assist it in its progress towards economic recovery under the direct guidance of the Amir of Kuwait, Sheikh Jabir Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah and senior Kuwaiti officials. He believed that the position of Kuwait in continuing to provide support for Lebanon " underlines the depth of relations between the two sister countries and reflects a common will to develop and consolidate these relations in all areas".
At the beginning of the meeting His Excellency inquired about the health of His Highness the Amir of Kuwait and I reassured him that he would return tomorrow (today), God willing, following his recovery.
In signing this agreement we hope to begin implementation before the end of this year.
In this climate we welcome brother Badr Al-Humaidi and once more thank Kuwait, its Amir, its Council, its government and its people, in the name of Lebanon and in the name of every southerner."
For a number of years Muhammad Al-Rumaihi has held the post of Secretary-General of the National Council for Culture, the Arts and Literature in Kuwait. He is also the editor and general coordinator of valuable Kuwaiti specialist research publications, including "Alam Al-Maarifah", "Alam Al-Fikr" and "Al-Thaqafah Al-Alamiyyah".
He did not conceal his belief that it would be subject "to pressures from all sides
We do not find that the poet has exaggerated in his excursus describing the red cloud because it appears far removed from being a passing cloud or mist holding the words of a dangerous secret.
In another place the red cloud simulates a woman more beautiful than Snow White and more necessary for all of humanity, who disappeared for a thousand years. And, as it is known, she disappeared from the heart to remain still in human emotion, which refused to remove and expel her once and for all from an age, which now takes us away from
The charge brought by the Judicial Public Prosecutor read:
Whereas it is apparent from the case papers that the explosion which occurred in Mari Jirjis Monastery, Aukar, on 12/11/1985, was aimed at the leader of the Lebanese Front and its members, some of whom are to be considered political leaders in the country, and therefore the legal conditions for referring the case to the Council of Justice for a judgment have been fulfilled;
In addition to terrorist acts, by setting off a car bomb in the Mari Jirjis Monastery, Aukar, on 12/11/1985 during a meeting of the Front. The explosion caused the deaths of Sergeant in the Lebanese Army Michel Al-Haddad and Corporal Butrus Al-Hadshiti, and wounded others. The crimes are set out in Articles 5 and 6 of Law 11/01/1958, Articles 549, 549 and 201 of the Punishments Law and Article 72 Weapons. We hereby seek from the Investigating Judge that he conduct an investigation examining the case and issue all papers and documents required by the investigation, including the arrest warrant."

Training Workshop for Secondary Teachers Opened; Murad: Why the Strike and Disruption of Schools When Permanent Appointments Law is Before the Chamber?
Unlicensed contractors and others have demands. I looked into this matter when I was Minister of Vocational Education in 1995 and I approved a proposal in this regard to give permanent appointments to those contracted in vocational education, which I followed up in the Education Committee.
He said, "We cannot continue with this novelty of contractual relations. Nor can we ask contractors to work when they have not received their dues in 18 months."
The new Director-General of Education, George Naamah, spoke saying, "I do not claim that I have come to perform miracles, but to cooperate with everyone in order to reduce the problems, not inflate them. This will take time.

In the third section, "The Lights Go Out and the Dancer Sleeps", he presents the last night before the outbreak of the Lebanese war on the eve of 13 April 1975, when Beirut performed its final dance in the nights of time.
The publishers dedicates the fourth section to hotels that have made a difference to the Lebanese tourism industry, such as: San Joseph, a thousand nights and stories; Al-Bustan, the dream of a night in the thirties; Phoenicia, the pearl of the coast, Lebanese Marriott, the Albergo, where history is a guest, Berntania, mountain palace, Riviera where the sun does not sleep; Bristol, the elegant; Bay View, the heart of the city.
And perhaps some hate the program so much that one person said that his ulcer hurt him every time he watched it and that he quarreled with his children, asking them to change the channel so that he could relax.
The two strong players hurry to fill the bank with profits, thereby persuading the smaller ones to burn each other up, just as the big states fund the wars of the small.
This is the situation of the strong player who has withdrawn from the game in spite of the fact that he is the strongest link. He leaves strong before the viewers whilst the winning strongest link triumphs but, in the eyes of the viewers, he is the weakest in practical terms, which is why he deserves to be described in terms of "cowardly voting", because he is a member of the party of successful enemies, the largest party in the Arab World generally, and in Lebanon in particular.
The Weakest Link shows some of the values prevailing in this new world. The age of globalization in which we live cruelly throws the facts before our eyes, and when we reject them, it means that we remain closely tied to our old world.
Members of the National Union of Private Associations began their protest by assembling outside the Ministry of Social Affairs bearing banners demanding payment of their salaries. A delegation from among them then met Minister Asad Diab. President of the Union Tawfiq Asiran spoke on their behalf, saying, "The problem of the Private Associations is not with the Ministry, nor is the demonstration directed against the Ministry, because the Ministry today is a victim just like we are.
Is it because it is the Ministry of the poor, those on low income, the disabled, people with difficult social circumstances and orphans?
We are convinced of your demands and your case is a serious one. I hope that your concerns will be lifted because the Private Associations bore the social concerns during the war and, without them, we would not have reached this level of social work.

Abu Zubaidah, Palestinian in his 30s, Reorganizes Al-Qaeda Operations.
The newspaper explained that he was also one of he few Al-Qaeda leaders who had traveled frequently to have contacts with members of the organization in foreign countries.
It confirmed that this Palestinian was directly involved in the planning for the 11 September attacks and also in the planning of other operations that were to have taken place after that date in Europe.
Officials in the American intelligence agencies expressed the belief that he was with bin Ladin in Afghanistan in the first weeks after the 11 September attacks and that there was scattered evidence that he had fled to Pakistan.
Washington Firm on Egyptian Missile Sale; Wall at Israeli Ambassador's Cairo HQ Destroyed; Enron Board Dismisses Deputies; President Al-Asad Receives Iranian Vice President.
A senior defense official said yesterday that the American Defense Security Cooperation Agency had decided to proceed with the deal after members of Congress had examined the details on Wednesday.
Congress has 30 days to put a stop to the deal.
(Reuters)
A representative of the Israeli Embassy in Cairo confirmed that there was a dispute but did not clarify the reasons for the objection of the new Ambassador to these works.
The report did not blame the two Vice Presidents but their place in the group hierarchy and their positions put them at the heart of the scandal, alongside former Finance President Andrew Fastow, who established a money-smuggling network with a secret and suspicious link to Enron.
She had asked him again on 30 October to declare the company's financial losses.
The Syrian Arab New Agency (SANA) reported that they had also discussed "the deteriorating conditions in the occupied Arab territories and the suffering of the Palestinian people as a result of Israeli aggression".
At a press conference held at the beginning of an unofficial meeting of Interior Ministers from European Union Member States, he indicated that the European arrest warrant represented "a basic judicial tool with which to differentiate the past of counter-terrorism and organized crime from their future". It includes such crimes as terrorism, aircraft hijacking, fraud and money laundering, and forms part of the measures taken by the European Union since the 11 September attacks.
Snider was the previous Inspector General in the agency before retiring last year.
One of the most prominent doubters was the deputy speaker of Congress, Republic senator Richard Shelby. The Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Democratic senator Bob Graham supported Snider's appointment in view of his long experience in intelligence circles.
Witnesses said that Said had been transported to the terrorism crimes court in Karachi handcuffed and with his face covered in an armored troop transporter.
He responded to another question, by saying, "Yes.
I do not believe that Pakistan should be allowed to become a contractor for the interests of the United States."
Musharraf, who is visiting Washington, said that his government did not believe Said "because one day he says something and another he says something else".
Earlier, the senior prosecutor in the case and the Public Prosecutor in the Al-Sind region, Raja Quraishi, cast doubt on Said's confessions, especially as he had not specified where and when Pearl had been killed.

The second topic of note in the fringe meetings was the Israeli attacks on the Palestinians, the intensive European efforts to reduce tension, the threats made against Lebanon and the accusations that members of Al-Qaeda had joined Hizbollah in southern Lebanon.

Iranian Authorities Detain 150 Arab Nationals; Tehran: American Information on Al-Qaeda is Old, Incorrect and Inaccurate; Hikmatyar
The Iranian government has previously denied repeatedly that it provide a safe haven for Taliban or Al-Qaeda fighters. It said that it had detained a number of them whilst they attempted to flee across the common Iranian-Afghan border, which is a mountainous area.
Iranian radio broadcast that the authorities has recently detained in the south-east of Iran 150 foreigners, most of whom were Arabs, some of whom held French, British, Belgium and Dutch passports.
This statement was made two days after the Iranian authorities closed the offices of Hizb-e Islami in Iran in an attempt to limit American criticisms of Tehran on account of Washington attributing to it attempts to rock the stability of the transitional Afghan government lead by Hamid Qarzai.

French newspaper Le Monde yesterday published the key excerpts from the "non-paper" drawn up by Perez and the Chairman of Palestinian Legislative Council, Ahmad Qurei (Abu Ala).
There must also be political dialogue, but there is none at present."
The Israeli press will cover this matter.
The attempt to put an immediate end to the struggle failed.
(The proposals) have not been prepared to take the place of the Mitchell report and the Tenet document, but to provide a framework in which they can be implemented ...The present situation requires a fundamental change...immediate recognition of Palestinian State can lead to talks between equals on the borders of the final solution.
The ceasefire would be implemented with the participation of the United States ...this stage includes measures designed to build trust between the two parties, including a persistent fight against terrorism.
They would deal with matters relating to the borders, refugees, Jerusalem, settlements, security, water and relations with other countries....implementation of the agreement would take one year with effect from (the date of) signature."
He had appeared on a video cassette of a meeting in Malaysia with one of the suspects in the bombing of the American destroyer USS Cole in Aden in October 2000.
He added, "His brother, Najib Ahmad Muhammad Al-Hada, was an explosives expert who was killed in Afghanistan whilst taking part in training operations for Al-Qaeda members there when he jumped from the mountains into the water of Qandahar river". "Mustafa Abd Al-Qadir Al-Ansari," he continued, "one of the accused on the list published by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, was married to one of his sisters".

An increase to customs duty, for example, will keep one group happy, whilst a reduction will do the same for another.
But, according to those with experience, and before any decision was taken on this matter, the abolishment of monopolies required that a widespread media campaign be organized, one which would explain the reasons for a review of the status of monopoly agencies. This would have reassured their owners of the step being taken by the government in this area and the protection of their rights. It would also have ensured the positive response of all sections of the people because it will lead to a reduction of prices by opening the door to competition. In addition, it will be in harmony with the international trend, with the laws of international trade and the European Partnership Agreement, which requires entry into a stage in which laws are updated and developed in accordance with international legislation. It will further restore Lebanon's role as an Arab-Asian marketing center after economic and political changes in Lebanon and the region have prevented it from continuing that role.
The logic of dealing with the government and its measures requires that we wait to see what these measures will produce in order to pass judgment for or against them. If the results are in the interests of citizens, why should there be any need to mount unjustified strikes, demonstrations or marches?
To continue sound preparation for the important leap to rectify the financial situation, by means of the process of privatization, with the aim of reducing the public debt, in readiness for the convening of the Paris 2 Conference, with the Government having completed most of what is required in order to obtain at this conference the aid and loans that will allow Lebanon to escape from its economic and financial crisis. This requires that the leaders cooperate in taking the necessary economic measures and set aside political differences to avoid any shocks from them, even until the date set for the Arab summit in Beirut and the Paris 2 conference. This is what makes President Lahud stress to some of his visitors, "The unity of Lebanon's stance appears today to be more necessary than at any other time in light of the challenges facing Lebanon, especially the economic challenge, which requires cooperation between the state and the citizens. The priority in the current circumstances is to focus on the daily needs of the people."
The Insanity of Suspicion.
The worst consequence of all this is that it reflects the affliction of some groups who, until yesterday, were far removed from sectarian selection, or rather appointment, with the insanity of suspicion.
The facts in this situation might be branded the product of a personal and self-interested mood, with no place for knowledge or fact in all that is put before us every day by the media, widely available in its audio, written and visual forms.
Reactions have begun, and possibly exceeded normal bounds, at the unexpected, excessively severe and twitchy economic measures, which lack flexibility and transparency.
In place of which there has appeared a strange equation, making its first appearance on the surface of Lebanese crises.
But with all these pressures, there is only an aggressive consumer, who can dodge the blows and give them in the name of salvation and renaissance: the sects have nothing to do with it.
It is astonishing that, instead of building bridges to safe shores, he is bent on blowing them all up without guaranteeing that there will be any way of return, as they say. And thus discussion of Fateh's decision to abolish its two military wings, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and the Al-Awda Brigade, is no more than a desperate attempt to conform to American-Israeli bluntness, albeit at sword point or beneath that sword.
But you would have to be very superficial to believe the "Statement of Obedience" which, it was initially said, had been issued by the Al-Aqsa Battalions, after the Revolutionary Council had issued its decision following discussions which Arafat had personally led over a two-day period, since subsequent statements rejected that very decision.
Once more there is no need to answer. But there is another perplexing question that suggested itself yesterday: What is Arafat gaining from the statements he made to the Italian La Republica newspaper, in which he said that the Hamas movement was the willing tool of the Israelis?
Arafat has revealed that Ishaq Rabin once said to him in front of King Hussein, "We acknowledge that the establishment of Hamas was a major error on our part." But if Hamas is Israel's prodigy, Israel will not accept that this fact come to light and nor will Hamas ever accept the charge.
Haartz yesterday revealed a document never before published, an unofficial paper prepared by the Miguel Anjel Moratinos, Special European Union Representative to the Middle East following talks in Taba in January 2001 between the Israelis and the Palestinian. The document records the points agreed between the parties and those that remained a matter of dispute.
The two parties agreed to the principle of exchanging land provided that Israeli and Palestinian territory remained geographically continuous.
The second concerned the absorption of refugees from areas that Israel would hand over to the Palestinians as part of the exchange of territory. The third related to the absorption of refugees as part of a framework to reunite families.
The Israeli side agreed that the city should be the capital of two states: Urshaleem, the capital of Israel, and Al-Quds as capital of Palestine.
Notwithstanding this, Shif acknowledged that it comprised an accurate compilation of the stances of the two parties on various topics.
Randa Hidar.
In the absence of a clear plan and mechanism which the state can follow, the government, by means of the steps it has taken in order to absorb the rancor over the value-added tax, has translated them in a haphazard and ill-conceived way, thereby overthrowing in reality the desired positive effects, if, indeed, there were any positive effects, on the basis of a terrorizing verbal attack launched in all directions, instead of reassuring us.
But the overthrow of the government is not desirable as was apparent from the meeting to approve the draft budget, bearing in mind that there was an initial move on the part of Deputies, and there were slogans which many rallied behind, on the basis that this was an option. In fact, matters went much further than this when the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies headed a meeting of the leaders of the blocs in order to organize the sessions for the debate but with the aim of taking control of matters in bringing the government to account.
But one cannot discount the possibility that the government hopes that this creates conflict and interference in the private sector, by which it may be able to implement more taxes for at least another year, during which time some things may become clear and it may have scored a few points for consumers.
Whilst this measure is important, it should not be interpreted so much as scare mongering at the situation as a message to those concerned that the matter has gone beyond being just empty words. In practical terms, it should be interpreted in terms of the Central Bank playing wisely with the cards it still has in its hands as part of the "engineering" of the state finances that it is carrying out, extending Lebanon's ability to withstand. It has introduced a range of steps: the imposition on banks of the 15% compulsory reserve on foreign currency was not the first; the last was the request made to banks to take stocks in scattered debts at the banks in liras, as it wished to establish a liquidity with which it could work.
It passed quietly and without us returning the French President's greeting with one better, or at least with one that was the same.
At the same time there arrived your dear letter, and we almost made a mistake that would have been deadly had it not been attended to and left to spread its shadow over the summit about which Beirut is chattering like a mother on her daughter's wedding day.
Beirut did not notice the mistake nor bite its fingers in regret until the Comoros Islands bellowed in angry protest, and were joined by Djibouti and Somalia.
And just as the saying "Stop Napoleon or lose your land" goes, they said either you send the invitations with ministers or there will be hell to pay.
The story, or the precedent, may be linked to the swift and unexpected visit by which Amr Musa honored us yesterday.
Mallat: A Shock But We Will Continue; International Court of Justice Prevents Sharon's Trial; Attorneys of Plaintiffs; Israel.
The ruling given by the International Court of Justice criticized Belgian legislation because it allowed for the trial of foreign public figures on charges of committing crimes against human rights irrespective of the location where they were committed.
He said, "I believe that Sharon's case is closed."
- Despite the negative decision, it was necessary to focus on paragraph 45, which viewed the International Arrest Warrant as violating international norms because it represented an obstacle to the work of a Foreign Minister.
* In Jerusalem a spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Yafa bin Ari, welcomed the ruling of the International Criminal Court.
A Cheese Platter and Hungry Diners.
But, despite these complexities, the contest that flared up surprisingly quickly over the draft abolishment of monopoly agencies succeeded in confirming that reading Marxist political economic literature was not a waste of time for anyone who did so in Lebanon.
For the percentage of journalistic effort here too is low when compared to the "norm" of repeating the press dictation, albeit from different sources. Or even assuming that this is how it is, we cannot forget the possibility of there being a disjunction between an economic, class-based dictation on the one hand, and a political-security one on the other.
In a country that both loves money and is embarrassed by it at the same time, that continues to shrink from the material accounts that are at the heart of its existence, the emergence of class interest into the public domain constitutes an invitation to review some of the conclusions that were thought to be final following the war.
For citation of the "old classes" is of no benefit unless it leads to observation of the "new classes" who, in turn, are striving to have their share of the cheese platter.
This means, in as much as it means anything, that the merging of Arab economies in an international trade movement free from restrictions will have a negative impact on most unless the measures striving towards openness (towards the outside world) are completed by opening Arab markets to each other.
Samir Qasir
The meeting was attended by the Minister of Finance, in order to understand how quickly, in what way  and by what deadlines the government is able to follow this file. We agreed with His Excellency and Minister Al-Sinyurah on the priorities about which I spoke with the President of the Republic, which naturally focus on completing the political tract of the Return File, namely the settlements and evictions so that every home or property owner can return to their home.
Al-Hariri also met with the Chairman of the Social Economic Council Roget Nasnas, who said: "We discussed the economic conditions and matters relating to the Social Economic Council, and we informed His Excellency of the work we do. We also requested that the Council Law be amended to allow it to perform its work as it should do. There is an understanding to amend some of the articles in the Council Law and we hope that this matter will be dealt with before next April."
He also asked, "Why has the Authority not tamed its appetite for plundering public money nor corrected its lost sense of direction?"
In principle, there is nothing to justify the monopoly dispute in any of its present forms.
But, as they welcome this official move, which has been needed for many decades, all Lebanese are asking about the competence of this ruling authority, in both its visible and invisible wings, to bring about this required move, in exercise of a correct process that will bring benefit to citizens generally and not just to this group or that, which benefit from the protection of one or more wings of the government.
And if we repeat, once more, our support in principle for every measure designed to limit every form of monopoly in the service of the people's interest, we also ask why the Authority, in both its visible and invisible wings, has not tried to tame its appetite for plundering public money and rectify its lost sense of direction in the economic-financial and social administration, so as to slow the speed of the present collapse?
After the meeting, Chairman of the Committee Deputy Sami Al-Khatib said, "The Committee had postponed a decision on the second draft because the Minister of Defense's signature was not on it.
We found that two of our colleagues had made valuable observations on the draft and we postponed completing the study of the draft until a meeting next Thursday after the Deputies have seen these observations, so that the debate would be more effective and beneficial."
More than one thousand teachers are known to retire annually.
She clarified, "This initiative is restricted to secondary teachers and we give priority to education, which will form the basis of selection."
The National Economy, Trade, Industry and Planning Committee announced its support for the government shift to lift protection from commercial agency monopolies as it "was in the interest of the consumer and lightens the economic burden".
Former Norwegian Prime Minister and Director General of the World Health Organization
In other words, it views investment in human resources as a pressing need and central factor in development with the aim of breaking the poverty trap in developing countries.
And we must do this not just because it helps to create a safe world for everyone but because it is the right thing to do.
At the same time, by focusing on international and local facts, it helps to erase the poverty gap.
But this figure is three quarters the amount allocated by poor countries today, estimated at 11 American dollars per person per annum.
The profits would be massive. Members of the Commission estimate that 8 million people would be saved each year and annual economic profits would reach 360 million American dollars, i.e. a sixfold return on the original investment.
For the political leaders will take action when they see their people demanding it and when they see a new inclination emerging.
The World Health Organization will work with these countries as they follow up the recommendations of this report.
Qabbani: 22 February First Day of Al-Adha; Three Days Holiday for Al-Adha Feast.
We congratulate the pilgrims to the Sacred House of God and hope that their pilgrimage will be acceptable to God. We also congratulate Muslims in the East and West on the occasion of the Feast and ask that God may bless the Arab and Islamic nation with prosperity, good fortune, blessings and success in obeying Him, that He may liberate Arab territory from the Israeli occupation and that Lebanon and the Lebanese may strengthen their unity, security and integrity. He listens and responds.
Qabbani spoke of the importance of investment in Awqaf property in the commercial center, noting that it was the fifth property to be signed by the Directorate General of Islamic Awqaf. He stressed his commitment to take care of Awqaf property in the commercial center and denied the "tendentious rumors to which the Islamic Awqaf in the commercial center are subject".
The Summit, the Cell Phone and the Needs of the Regions: Lahud's Meetings with Ministers and Deputies
He dealt with a number of topics of the moment and the agenda for the meeting of the Council of Ministers convened yesterday afternoon.
In this context we wish to record his recent position in rubbishing the Zionist claims, which do Lebanon a disservice by persisting in their description of its resistance as terrorism and granting refuge to members of Al-Qaeda, in preparation for a strike.
We should not forget to point out the efforts made by His Excellency and his response to the establishment of the Unified University Building in the north, which will soon see the light of day and come to represent one of the most important achievements of this era and government."
The Director of the Riyadh Taha Cultural Center, Jihad Riyadh Taha, visited Baabda Palace accompanied by the Director of the Human Beings Without Borders Society, Murad Khuri.

President of the Republic Emil Lahud informed Secretary-General of the Arab League Amr Musa that Lebanon "had completed all the arrangements required to hold the Arab summit in Beirut". Musa, meanwhile, announced that the summit would be held on the date set and did not given any importance to any talk of it being postponed, noting that American aggression against Iraq would "make the holding of the summit more pressing".
A France Press report from Damascus states that the Secretary-General of Hizbollah, Mr. Hasan Nasrallah, met at the Iranian embassy in Damascus with Iranian Vice President Muhammad Rida Arif, who confirmed the continued support of the Islamic Republic of Iran for the resistance in Lebanon and the Palestinian Intifada.
He referred to "the settlement process that reached a dead end", calling on the Palestinian people "to follow the example of the martyrdom attacks carried out by Lebanese martyrs".
A former official commented on the abolishment of monopoly agencies saying that there were ministers who enjoyed a monopoly and that their monopoly should also be abolished.

Ministry of the Environment: New Legislation to Manage Harmful Waste
The aims of the project may be summarized as follows:
4. Set up activities, prepare materials to educate relevant persons, and hold educational events in the regions about the dangers of this waste and how to dispose of it.
Special leaflets and a guide to managing harmful waste in the proper manner will be distributed."

The Syrian detainees are entering their fifth month of detention at the Ministry of the Interior Adra Prison close to Damascus. With the exception of Deputy Mamuun Al-Humusi and Deputy Riyadh Saif, whom the regime believes to be an internal case and subject to special rules and provisions that do not apply to the other detainees, none have been charged.
The question should be put to the Authorities first because their detention has implications that go beyond the people involved, implications for the choices and opportunities open to the government and the country. The alternatives to them, which the detainees, each in their own way, have succeeded in posing and in bringing out their true form, bear appropriate answers to the equation put before Syria:
The expression to which he refers, and which he markets in the heart of his article, is this: "Syria has experience in combating terrorism, from which the United States can benefit".
The other side to this censure from Eid goes as follows: "Brother Hadidi's basis for his interpretation of the expression attributed to the President is that logic requires that the Syrian authorities and the President's young administration take care to bury this infelicitous reference... it should avoid speaking of it, try to erase its trace and turn the page... and there is an interest in forgetting it or feigning forgetfulness.
Eid failed to spot the major moral difference between an authority that once caused a massacre and the simple "logic" - tactically as strategically - requiring this authority to bury the memory of the massacre, if possible, and the right of citizens and victims, not to mention the duty to remember, not to close this black page other than as part of a comprehensive and effective national reconciliation (which Eid acknowledges has not yet happened; in fact, the most prominent and genuine supporter of this reconciliation, Riyadh Al-Turk, has been locked up) after accounts have been settled and people called to account for their actions.
For my part I say that I view the young Syrian President, until he proves otherwise, to be the offspring of the old regime and an organic extension of most of its policies, a participant with those who repeat yesteryear's production, a man who has not only not stopped reconciliation with "the sharks and dinosaurs" but today he commemorates some of them when his father was keen to change them into ghosts and ashes!
The Greek vessel Alexis arrived at Tripoli port last Friday morning bearing a consignment of sugar for importer Mr. Zain Harb.
Information indicates that Brazil is the country of origin and that the vessel that loaded the sugar in Brazil offloaded it in Greece to the Alexis, which then headed for Tripoli.
He stressed that the Customs Department did not allow any vessel to unload its cargo before the safety of the imported goods and materials had been verified and that required paperwork and permits  were in order.
During the wait, the cargo owner, Mr. Zain Harb, submitted a request to offload the vessel, store the sugar in the port holds and pay all the fees and duties to the Port Authority and Customs.
The Customs Department had not received the necessary documents and papers and did not allow it to dock until the morning of Monday, the 11th of this month.
At the invitation of the Association, in the presence of a number of prominent political, economic, commercial and syndicate figures.
He clarified, "The American pressure brought to bear on Lebanon, Iran and Syria will increase the scale of the grave economic problem."
About 70 citizens assembled at 8 pm yesterday evening in front of the entrance to Quraitim Palace, demanding to meet Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri who, at that time, was at the headquarters of the Council of Ministers in the museum.
At 9:15 the delegation came out announcing that they had formed a committee of 10 members and promised to resolve the issue within 10 days or they would return and sleep at the entrance to Quraitim with their children if their problem was not resolved.
Director of the Association for Vocational Information Jalal Fawwaz,  Honorary President Brigadier Sami Nasiri, Captain Muwwafaq Al-Yafi, Secretary-General of the Workshop Yusif Munsif, and  a number of interested persons attended.

In Preparation for Riyadh Exhibition; Al-Majali: Future of Lebanese Merchant in Approaching Arab Environment.
Shaarani highlighted the importance of "sending to Riyadh a model of Tripoli, especially given that the purchasing power of the Saudi capital is 3 billion dollars per month".
If these merchants do not develop themselves and their industries, they will find themselves in the future before the reality that Lebanese consumers will not accept their goods because consumers generally have begun to search for brand, quality and price. Lebanese merchants must therefore build a strategic relationship in Arab states and always look for something better."
The choice for us here is clear and frank, for there can be no escape from the first of these two options, which is tantamount to the cross of potential salvation for Lebanon, in light of the difficult conditions in which it lives.
In response to a question, Deputy Muhammad Qabbani said, "We are not going to become a second Dubai or Argentina. Lebanon has its own circumstances and particular characteristics. The process of competing with Dubai would need many steps. What is taking place are steps in that direction. The abolishment of agencies will lead to a reduction in prices.
But to make blind accusations of monopolies in Lebanon should not be allowed. Lebanese merchants do not hold monopolies - they are merely the owners of exclusive agencies."
The Syndicate said in a statement that it had examined the decision of the Minister of Public Health, Sulaiman Faranjiyyah, concerning the liberalization of the importing of medicine, and had no objection to the lifting of commercial restrictions. It hoped that "the results of Minister Faranjiyyah's decision will be positive and achieve the desired end".
- "Speed up the measures necessary for privatization and liberalization without hesitation because the projected returns will greatly outweigh any negative consequences rising from the process of liberalization, especially in light of the experiments taking place in Jordan and Morocco.
- Commend the sophisticated experiment underway in Jordan and Morocco in the communications field; hope that the Communications Law will soon see the light of day in Lebanon and Egypt.
- Demand that the experiment of North Korea in information transfer network development be adopted, which witnessed a massive advance when the market was opened to competition, putting it at the forefront of countries using the system.
Or are they consumer goods, subject to supply and demand, with whoever imports them having the right to impose the prices they want through a monopoly on these goods, thereby depriving citizens, especially those of the middleclass and below, of their right to treatment?
This is not to exaggerate the issue: the cost of recovery in Lebanon is twice what it is in neighboring countries, and even more in relation to some other countries.
There is an office for medicines at the Ministry of Health.
It is also good on the condition that the Medicine Office, which will save the government enormous expense being paid as increases in the prices of medicine, which ultimately found their way into the pockets of the monopoly holders. It will also save more than 50% of the cost of medicine, further reduce waste and increase the capacity of the government to provide more services to citizens.

Producers and developers of services, represented by local and European companies will provide information solutions and respond to question about matters relating to the improvement of tourist services; activation of tourism marketing via information technologies and ways of conducting a virtual visit of our museums, and archeological and historical sites (...) by computer; organization and management of journeys and accommodation according to personal requirements; ways of investing in the tourist industry in Lebanon; and implementation of information technologies in the Syrian tourism sector."
When the first Egyptian-Arab satellite, Nilesat, was launched on 28 April 1998, media circles were betting on the development of Arab-Arab and Arab-West competition in the sphere of modern communication technology investment, which would lead to a media renaissance and put the Arabs, in the first quarter of the twenty-first century, on the international circuit for the communication technology revolution and expand the footprint of Arab media.
On the other, it confirmed the ability of the private media to compete with the official media supported both materially and morally by Arab governments, to secure a very broad footprint in the Middle East and Africa in preparation for another possible deployment in other areas of the world, which the Arab media, and the Lebanese media specifically, have not yet reached.
The Wind Quarter, which comprises teachers from the Lebanese National Conservatory and players from the National Symphony Orchestra, gathered in the Bayyar Abu Khatir Hall at the Faculty of Human Sciences, Jesuit University, for an evening which brought together composers from different times who had composed pieces for groups of wind instruments, bringing out the abilities of a Chamber Orchestra comprising flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon and horn to vary breathing and color the melody according to the capacities and virtues of each instrument.
Skillful expressions brought out the charms of the instrument and the ability of the player. For the summer outing by Giano, with its five movements, was like a breath of fresh air in the wilderness.
The oboe, which resides between the voice of the clarinet and bassoon, opened the allegro gravely and touchingly. The flute joined in for a very short while before the rays of this piece became even more delicious. At the Adagio the oboe returned to take its role as guide to the meaning of Kloghart's music, inviting the flute to an increasing celebration on the scale of instruments and breaths.
Army Commander Brigadier Michel Sulaiman held a dinner in honor of Justice Nasri Lahud at the Ministry of Defense Restaurant on the occasion of his transfer from the military judiciary to chairmanship of the Supreme Council of Justice.
The Court restricted them from Article 1 of this Law, as its criminal provisions do not apply.
The enquiry  conducted into the identity of these persons, led to an investigation with the two accused persons, the result of which was as follows: The first accused owns an internet company in Beirut and owned more than 40 mobile phone lines in his name, that of his brothers and his mother. He obtained a permit decision from the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications to lease a digital 1024 kb/second line and to link his Beirut office to a company in New York.
It transpired that these persons had only released her after detaining her for three days. Accused Al-Sharidi told the court that he had accompanied Al-Shihabi, whom Abu Muhjin had tasked to bring Nisrin, for reasons relating to her immoral ways and practice of prostitution.
It compelled him to hand over the weapon of war he had used in the kidnapping within 15 days from the date of the ruling or pay double its price, which is estimated to be 300,000 liras.
During the investigation he confessed to stealing the revolver from the home of Manuk Atian Antosian in Burj Hammoud, along with Murad Karnik Sh.
The director responsible for the Al-Diyar newspaper, Yusif Al-Huwaik, was attacked and robbed yesterday evening in Al-Dakwanah by two unknown persons who claimed they were from the security forces.

on bail of 25 million lira,
on bail of 10 million each.
The security forces arrested Shahrur.
When elements from the security forces entered the area, they all fled.
Brigadier Sulaiman gave a speech in which he thanked Lahud for his efforts in the government commission with the military court, noting that "he stemmed from a family that had borne the worries of the nation, whose father, Jamil Lahud, was a prominent national figure, whose brother His Excellency, President of the Republic, Emil Lahud,  had the main merit in building the military institution".
Lahud then made a speech in which he said: "On this celebration which brings us together today on the occasion of my transfer to the Chairmanship of the Supreme Council of Justice, I can only bow before the magnificence of the military institution, maker of men, and a school for honor and chivalry, the Minister for which is Khalil Al-Harawi and led today by Brigadier Michel Sulaiman, the wise leader who works, as did his predecessor, His Excellency, Brigadier Emil Lahud, day and night, determinedly and in silence, to stop the homeland from hemorrhaging and establish a state of institutions.
Fate and circumstance have led me to the judiciary when I always wanted to be one of the soldiers in this institution. How could it have been otherwise when I grew up in a home that taught me the principles of honor, sacrifice and loyalty?
The Minister of Defense then gave a speech in which he extolled the virtues of Justice Lahud from the time he had first come to know him in the 1950s and focused on "Justice Lahud continuing the security tract, his efforts and clear independence", noting that "to try to curry favor with Justice Lahud was not possible".
In appealing against the ruling of the Military Court, the attorneys for the defense reiterated the line they had taken during the trial of Al-Hindi and Basil, namely that the offence attributed to them could no longer be brought before the court because 3 years had passed.
Despite this, the Court decided to include the defense to the fundaments, which means that the clients are being pursued for the same act before two legal authorities. Consequently the ruling being appealed contravenes the law.
Afifah Karam by Barbara Badawi: Story of a Female Emigrant Writer.
Her childhood years were spent "wandering or walking in the gardens of her beloved village" or in the company of her father and sitting with him, until she became old enough to learn to read and write. It is most likely that she attended the Sister Ursula School in Jubail at the age of 12, having received her primary education from her father.
Separation from her homeland created a bitterness that intensified her depression and physical incapacity, which is reflected in her writings. She resorted to prayer and piety and gave money to women's organizations, poor homes and schools in Lebanon and Egypt. She also gathered donations to help the victims of the First World War. Before that, she sent large amounts of money to Lebanon "to restore the economic and moral damage wrought by the events of 1860". She adopted a number of orphans and other poor emigrant children. Some were educated at her expense and she came to be approached by the needy.
In addition, she translated a large number of novels and articles and published them in serial form in the Al-Huda newspaper.
Her most significant literary achievements include the novels "Badiah and Fuad", "Fatimah, the Bedouin" and "Ghadah Amshit". She translated a number of novels including "Queen for a Day", "Muhammad Ali Basha the Senior", "Daughter of the King's Deputy" "Cleopatra" and "Nancy Stair".
Her novel Ghadah Amshit is relevant here. She wrote the following lines: "I hope above all else that you my dear sisters will have the right to choose your marriage partners today and tomorrow.
A girl's freedom is her right and liberating yourself from the tyranny of a myth is your duty."
Afifah Karam was the first female journalist and writer from Lebanon and the Arab World to burst forth as an emigrant in the late 19th and early 20th century. But her name would have almost been forgotten were it not for the efforts made over four and a half years by Dr Barbara Badawi investigating in upper rooms and boxes and traveling between the major universities in Lebanon and the United States, searching for the biography of the daughter of her own town, Amshit. All the obstacles that confronted her did not overwhelm her; in fact, she researched more than 100 references, including books, magazines and manuscripts. "Some of the books, which had turned yellow, and were torn and covered in dust, were from the upper rooms of some" senior figures "in Amshit or from university libraries in

She added that the Mar Yaaqub Spiritual Restaurant was established under his patronage on the 13th of February 1994 in collaboration with Archbishop George Saliba.
We say in our prayers "Give us this day our daily bread". When we ask God Almighty to give us our daily bread, we must, for our part, provide it for the needy, immigrants, refugees and all of our people who are living in very difficult conditions, especially given that the State is unable to do what is necessary for those in need. We must undertake this role and we must continue to do so. God willing, we will be able to complete this mission with the help of all good people.

If Christian emigration seems to be a flight of Christians from Lebanon, this is fundamentally linked to the economic conditions of the country, not to religion or a desire on the part of Muslims. Lebanon is a country for all of its children, Muslims and Christians. All Lebanese are the same in their devotion to their homeland and their collective national unity."
Sheikh Sami Abu Al-Muna said, "Our concept of citizenship must go beyond the limits of duties to secure the rights of the citizens in their nation. The State is principally responsible for securing these rights by justice and equality. The foremost rights are those of freedom and democracy, the right to knowledge and education, and the right to a dignified living, security and stability."
They cite as evidence the influx of thousands of tourists and visitors to the major international museums to see the best works of classical artists from by-gone ages.
He was a student of our senior classical exponent, Mustafa Furukh, before breaking with the horizons of classicism and entering a luminous Islamic phase during which he immersed himself in the Arabic script, drawing on its most beautiful forms in verses from the Holy Quran, gilded phrases or expressions in relief. He then pursued the abstract, with its horses, its dancers and its scenes in which the colors scream in joy, light and beautiful deviation. He then broke the world record for scale (his latest painting is 200 square meters for the new Karkalla Exhibition, "One Thousand and One Nights") and speed (last summer he executed a giant painting 10 square meters in size in less than an hour for "Ras Al-Matan's First Drawing and Sculpture Days"). Some months earlier he painted four portraits of poet Said Aql, historian Nicola Ziyadah, composer Walid Ghalmiyyah and Mrs. Muna Ghazal, in which the accuracy, expressions and original classical fidelity were striking.

Oh, Nakhlah, master poet, boast among the Arabs.
Until he slept, absent-minded, like Al-Mutanabbi.
I recall the haughty sermon in Jaras.
God's fingertips wrote the first letter.
Heir to the praise of the greatest Arab chief.
In Kuwait, where the characteristics of the Arabs were gathered.
In Al-Babtin, the poetic columns raise it up.
For Lebanon's Nakhlah has grown branches.
On his behalf circumstances protect the child with their eyelashes.
In which your letters form a chain of comets.
Twisting at length, it rests from fatigue.
Its letters transformed into golden treasure.
The leader is scarce and they the worms of the earth.
They come with the creative in a noisy retinue.
How poetry filled us with longing in its new gown.

The Scottish Appeals Court held in Camp Zeist in central Holland yesterday confirmed the guilt of Libyan Abdelbaset Al-Megrahi, aged 49, on the charge of mass murder in the case of the Pan American airline bombing above Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988, which left 270 dead. It upheld the sentence of life imprisonment given against him. This closes the door on a detective "story" and judicial investigation that have continued for about 13 years and increases pressure on the Libyan leader Col. Muammar Gaddafi to acknowledge the responsibility of his country for the incident and to pay compensation to victims' families.
Al-Megrahi, a secret Libyan agent aged 49, who has been detained at Camp Zeist in Holland since Libya handed him over on 5 April 1999, was transferred to a Scottish prison where his sentence will be spent.
Al-Megrahi's lawyers tried during the appeal to establish that the bomb was put on board in London, not Malta. They focused on a statement made by a retired security guard at Heathrow Airport, in which he said that he had discovered that the lock of the baggage hold had been tampered with on the night before the plane took off, indicating that someone may have put the bomb in the suitcase that blew up the plane.
In Tripoli, The General People's Committee of the People's Office for Foreign Communications and International Communication expressed in its statement, "its great astonishment" at the ruling, which "like, its predecessor, was based on circumstantial evidence, the veracity of which had not been established".

A statement issued by the Secretary-General of the Arab League, Amr Musa, said, "This resolution represents an important and objective step forward in international treatment of the Arab Israeli conflict" because "previous Security Council resolutions had been limited to censuring aggressive Israeli practices in the occupied territories".
He called for "it to be built on" because "it focuses on the importance of finding a political solution to the problem, not only on the security aspect."
Iranian Foreign Affairs Minister Kamal Kharazi, who is accompanying Khatami on his visit to Greece believed that the resolution represented "a step towards embodiment of Palestinian rights and their legitimate right to establish a state of their own".
El Figaro wrote that the resolution "in itself solves nothing (...) it merely sets out principles". But it welcomed the "clear acceptance by the United States of the establishment of a Palestinian State".
Written by Nicola Nasif:
1 - Despite the fact that there is evidence suggesting that the resolution was prepared without prior consultation with the Arab community at the international organization, there is other evidence that speaks of Arab pressure imposed on Syria, the non-permanent member on the Security Council, to make it withdraw a draft resolution it had proposed that contained explicit condemnation of Israeli attacks against Palestinian territory and Palestinian inhabitants. Discussions were held in this respect in order to polarize support for it.
Syria, thus retained the right to object on principle, perhaps even on form, to a resolution that put the Arab community on the other side of the Syrian stance.
It also reflected the first formulation communicated by American journalist Thomas Friedman from Prince Abdallah, not the revised version which, it was recently said, was the product of a meeting between Syrian President Bashar Al-Asad and the Saudi Crown Prince for the purpose of imposing the characteristic of a comprehensive settlement on the ideas he had proposed.
But this has not prevented unofficial discussions among officials to evaluate the resolution, which, according to well-informed official sources, will not necessarily cast its shadow over the Arab summit. They also confirm that Washington follows reports on the summit on a daily basis through the successive activities of American Ambassador Vincent Patel with some officials. These activities focus in particular on the fringe, unofficial discussions of the summit, in the manner of the recent Iraqi move towards Lebanon and Syria after the two countries were informed by the Iraqi delegation of considerable flexibility in dealing with the summit and the results thereof, which it was keen to demonstrate, along with Iraq's desire not to make its problem with Kuwait a cause of discord in it.
The Maze Between Cheney and Zinni.
Here it is necessary to examine in detail the policies of the Israeli government, which, since George Bush announced that he was sending Zinni to the region, has drawn up three options to totally undermine his mission. They are:
This is sufficient to ensure that the elements for an explosion remain, especially if we recall that the ceasefire is supposed to take us back immediately at least to the points established when the Tenet paper was drawn up.
In light of all of this we do not know what the objective elements that can help Zinni in his missions are. The explicit criticisms directed by George Bush yesterday evening for the first time against "the bloody Israeli military operations, which do not help provide conditions for peace" are not sufficient to force Sharon to respond to the conditions in the field necessary for a ceasefire. Similarly, the Security Council resolution, which provides for the establishment of "the Palestinian State" for the first time, cannot constitute an incentive to push the Israeli government to put an end to the plans to destroy the Palestinian Authority. The opposite is, in fact, the case.
Indelible Ink.
The important thing is that the resolution issued was accompanied by written recognition, albeit after a collective wail that has continued for half a century, after wars, setbacks, disasters, after a flood of blood, sacrifices and victims.
And the signatories thereto represent countries on this earth, not Mars.
To be specific, they have shifted to the meetings hall of the Beirut summit, which is supposed to review the agenda, give a better greeting than the one it received and say to the American President, "This is my vision."
The people of the cave, who were not woken by the vision of Prince Abdallah and that of George Bush, may wake up to the beating of the drum at the vision of the international Security Council.
The other two tanks were destroyed using armour-piercing RPG rockets in the occupied town of Ramallah.
But he added, "We are waiting for a full withdrawal from the area of Palestinian control, including Ramallah, and other sectors which Israeli recently entered."
He concluded by saying that both sides had to "take immediate measures to create a climate would allow progress to be made".
Two Palestinians were also killed at night when their car exploded in the eastern area of the same town.
In return, the Palestinian Authority confirmed that it would not hold ceasefire talks with Israel until it ended its expanded attack in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and fully withdrew its forces.

He explained that the ladder was arch-shaped, which allowed the armed men not to touch the sensitive fence.
They said that the armed men were equipped with good weapons.
Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin Ben Eliezer told Israeli television's Channel 1 that Hizbollah had demonstrated intent to escalate the situation on the northern borders.
He confirmed, "All the usual threats and browbeating that we hear today, or that we may hear tomorrow or the day after, does not scare or frighten us, nor will it stop us from carrying out our duty and bearing the responsibility.
We are not afraid. We will not hesitate once or twice. We are ready to confront anything the Israelis can think of.

The Yemeni Press Agency (Saba) quoted Ali Salih as saying, "Yemen will continue to make efforts with the brothers in Iraq for acceptance of the return of the international inspectors within the framework of the resolutions of international law, with which Iraq has stressed its compliance and which will ensure the security, stability and integrity of Iraq and prevent intervention in its internal affairs."
Cheney said, "We discussed a wide range of issues, including the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the present war on terror (...) and Iraq."
A Yemeni official said, "Yemen is a fundamental strategic partner in the international efforts of the United States to combat terror."
Cheney later traveled to the Sultanate of Oman, where he met Sultan Qabus bin Said. The Omani Press Agency reported that discussion in the meeting focused on "existing cooperation between Oman and the United States of America in different areas".
It has been decided that he will then visit Kuwait, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Israel and Turkey.
In an interview with the Central News Agency, Buiz commented on the convening of the Arab Summit. He said, "Arab summits do not usually give us historical, great or exceptional achievements, especially given that this summit will be held in exceptional, if not highly pressurized, circumstances for the Arab situation.
Consequently, we ask this summit to take resolutions based on forbearance, i.e. resolutions that respect the martyrs who fall and that respect the fundamental turning point realized by the Intifada following the Lebanese resistance, meaning that they should not treat Arab rights lightly nor weaken the Arab will to restore its rights in full."
By which I mean that we believe that the cards governing and determining the nature of post-peace relations should be in the hands of the Arab negotiator, especially those countries that are in the vanguard, which are still demanding their rights. The other Arab states should support those in the vanguard because they are concerned in the first instance with the Arab-Israeli conflict but are not demanding direct rights. Any proposal made now takes this card out of the hands of those vanguard or the Arab negotiator and weakens their position."
Finally, I believe that this matter can also not ignore the rights of Lebanon. It must also, in the first instance, be precise in the matter of the establishment of a complete Palestinian state, sovereign over the territory of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and also Jerusalem."
He referred to the pressing need to amend the Advertising Law and the Audio-Visual Law, and to establish an Audio-Visual Union.
He was asked: It is known that the need for the Advertising Law is pressing, so what idea did the committee form from the debate. He answered, "The need for the Advertising Law is pressing, the need for the Audio-Visual Law to be amended, including digital and satellite, is more pressing, and the need for the Audio-Visual Union is pressing. For this reason we will initiate a major workshop on all these laws so that everyone is satisfied. The committee will certainly have a position on workers in media organizations because they are, as the saying goes, "neither divorced, nor married". They are not part of the Editors Syndicate or the Journalists Syndicate, and they will not be part of the Union. The committee has given this matter considerable thought.
Criticizes Al-Jisr's Stance on Naturalization; Maronite Association: Intensify Efforts to Prevent Spread of Tension on Borders.
The Council thanked the lawyers who provided the review for their efforts in pursuing the matter, and reiterated its demand that the Naturalization Decree, which contains fundamental legal flaws, be overturned. It also expressed surprise that His Excellency Minister of Justice Samir Al-Jisr should have stated some days earlier in response to a question that be believed that the State Consultative Council would not nullify the decree in respect of which the appeal had been brought because it did not usually do so.
Meanwhile, the Council urged the government to increase its efforts and take note of the spreading tension close to the Lebanese borders with Israel.
The Emigrants Abroad Association has criticized the actions of "civil servants in the administration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs" for initiating "an open war on the Association".
We confirm some emigrant, particularly Australian-Lebanese facts, as follows:
3- We are completely astonished at how an official from one of the government's ministries can act to spread division in the emigrant ranks by appointing illegitimate representatives of the Association in Australia, when there already exists an elected, legitimate leadership.
"It Is a Lie to Say That I Call For Bloodshed"; Aun: Syrians Must Know Matters Will Run Their Course.
The price for our patriotic stance has been paid by thousands of martyrs, detainees and those tortured, exiled and beaten. The Ministry of the Interior will not be able to create a climate of terror for thousands of young people, nor prevent the demonstrations from coming out into the streets to express their view on reclaiming independence and sovereignty.
When the Lebanese realize this fact, then the end of all their crises will begin and there will be the beginnings of a solution. Anything else is just a continuation of the same vicious circle.
The Syrians and their agents must know that matters will run their course. Syria must realize this fact and act wisely on this basis to put in good order the future between the two countries and peoples.

Its right would be imposed.

Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Islamic Shiite Council Sheikh Abd Al-Amir Qablan believed that the new hijri year was "the year of the Intifada". He thought, "What is required is fidelity to the Arab right in Palestine and rejection of all formulations that people want to promote to solve the Palestinian issue."
On the occasion of this New Year, the anniversary begins of the Ashura retinues, by which Imam Al-Hussein (a) fled to God, may He be praised, following the examples of his grandfather and father in sacrifice, altruism and jihad. Thus was the revolution of Imam Al-Hussein  (a) an extension of the jihad of his grandfather, the Seal of the Prophets. This was expressed by the Prophet of God in his words: Hussein is of me and I am of him.
The message of the Hijra and Ashura requires us to support our brothers in Palestine and to provide all that they require to stand fast and to support the confrontation with the renewed Zionist terrorism against their villages, towns and homes. One cannot stand by and watch as a spectator the massacres and attacks against people, to which the Palestinians are subject without limitation.
The anniversary of the Prophet's flight calls us to learn from it the meanings of patience, determination and struggle. The anniversary of Ashura calls us to the greater and lesser jihad, to combat corruption and perversion, to triumph over ourselves, to consolidate our national unity, to deepen our Arab and Islamic solidarity, to give in a spirit of altruism and to sacrifice in public and personal matters."
In the midst of this complete confusion of weird and wonderful, and occasionally astonishing, legislation, statements and speeches, the enlightened observer can not avoid seeing them as an advanced attempt to wipe out people's memory, to destroy and impoverish them, whilst those who do not even have average knowledge or intelligence play and twist words and wires.

Bearing in mind that they have paid and continue to pay to those who have occupied other people's houses in Beirut and elsewhere compensation far beyond the sums paid to migrant citizens whose homes were destroyed.
And how?
On the 25th anniversary of his glorious martyrdom (16 March 1977), if Kamal Junbalat, who made the main slogan of his party's charter on the day it was declared in May 1949 "A Free Citizen, A Happy People", could return, he would express the spirit of the charter in these terms: "All of society's institutions, both government and private are barren or fertile, made sacred or the object of insinuations to the extent that they serve or do not serve mankind."  Were he able to return he would have raised his voice in their faces in fierce reproach and asked: What have you done and what are you doing to "The Free Citizen and the Happy People" in this country, at once large and small?

unregulated construction and the negative consequences thereof, and the significant waste of river water that flows into the sea when the river floods without any benefit being gained from it.
He was asked whether the meeting was an attempt to tackle the issue of public possessions on the river, which the state had failed to do. He answered, "There are some infringements against the river possessions and we will see with the municipal heads and the district office how to tackle this and remove these infringements, especially when the people of Al-Damur have rights to the water and some people are infringing on these rights. This has nothing to do with the Basic Law, which I hope will be completed and which I hope will match our aspirations as to how to tackle the infringements to sea, river and other possessions.

Because, had you read this contract, you would have found the precaution that we included with harsh conditions for protection of the environment and that a consultant was appointed to draw up the necessary study on the environmental risks...by an international company that will chose the consultant. In addition, an international company has been tasked to supervise the works, with the exception of a specific building on the summit of Al-Manarah (2091m), on the same site of the dilapidated building previously operated by Lebanon and Al-Mashriq Television, which was destroyed by the Israelis.
So, son of Al-Mukamil, the contract signed between us and the tourist company means you comply with us by preserving the environment, which must begin with your home, your town and your region and from there the awareness will spread to the country, not by extemporizing.
This project has not passed through the darkness. It has been though a terrible war waged by people with interests who play with the good resources of our area through the water that they pack and export, and finally sell to foreigners for tens of millions of dollars.
For God's sake: Enough of trying to lay the blame in the name of the environment, my brothers.
He answered me saying, 'I would have preferred to be President of the Republic.'
The distance between the two parties has reached the point of disagreement, due to the fact that Prime Minister Al-Hariri has not listened over the last period other than to the domestic calls that hurried him to take decisive action because the time remaining to salvage anything was beginning to run out, because more than one party had him in their sights and because he not only had to save the situation, but also himself, with the least amount of losses possible.

Others entered into a deceitful peace, one that they did not need, in order to secure the satisfaction of the United States and the West generally.
This is how we find them all, with no way to resist international and American pressures on them in particular. Their sensitivity to the pressure is heightened by their awareness that most do not rule by the will of the people: they talk in their international meetings about the dangers of a popular revolution against them, about being overthrow, and the need for protection if they go against the will of their people and walk far with the United States and Israel.

Was a supreme religious authority speaking these words in this simple manner, one that penetrated the heart and conscience?
He continued with the same simplicity, "When the Armenians left Armenia, they found places to stop in the countries of the world, but in Lebanon they found a homeland that embraced them.
The renaissance of the Armenians outside Armenia only took place in Lebanon.

He may have fled Armenia, its land and sky taken from him, but no one can take what is in his heart.

The Lebanese did not need reminding of the anniversary of 13 April to pile up renewed fears on top of the inherited nightmares.
This is true and very important in terms of the giant stock in hand for the Palestinian cause internationally, not to mention the devastating failure of Ariel Sharon in falsifying the essence of the issue and his inability to make the world submit to the logic of genocide and massacres, and even in terms of the inability of the American administration to drive their own allies to submit to their ambiguous, hesitant and prejudiced policies on the pretexts of 11 September.
There is no difference between targeting the security forces at the hands of "infiltrators" in the demonstrations, and the easy and easiness with which rockets are fired at the borders, and the pre-planned opening of a war front.
Another reminder: the suppression of oppositionists at a time of "popular peace" is deceptively allowed on this pretext. The last seasons of this suppression were last August.
Are not three weeks of this sort of thing enough to appoint "Protective Security" as arbitrator? It has previously proven itself, especially in respect of the oppositionists.
Haartz yesterday observed a reduction in the severity of the bombing seen by the Shabaa farms for over two weeks.
In Haartz, Dani Rubenstein wrote an article about Arafat's meeting with Powell saying, "The achievement is in the essence of the meeting." There follows a translation of the key content:
Arafat's declaration of his condemnation of terrorism, which was issued yesterday, was made as soon as the Americans sought it.
Most of Arafat's close associates, and even he himself, tend to reject the idea out of hand.
Yesterday, a major media battle broke out with regards to what happened in Jenin Camp, the Casaba and Nablus once these places were opened to representatives of the media.
American Secretary of State Colin Powell yesterday held talks with Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat in his headquarters, surrounded by Israeli tanks and soldiers in Ramallah, before meeting, for the second time since he began his mission in the region on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.
Following the announcement of the visit first to Beirut,
In an address to the nation broadcast on television immediately following his return in a helicopter from his place of detention on the Venezuelan island of La Orchila in the Caribbean to the palace, the leftist leader said, "I am still astonished" at what happened. But he called for calm, unity and reason as thousands of Venezuelans gathered in the streets outside the gates singing the national anthem and setting off fireworks in celebration at his return.
Ramallah - ASHA - Palestinian source have confirmed that the Israeli army has executed the leader of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, which is close to the Fateh movement, and Area Commander of the Jenin Camp Jamal Abu Huwail, known as "Abu Jandal".
Following the announcement of the visit first to Beirut, American State Department spokesman Richard Boucher confirmed in the evening from Jerusalem that Powell would stop his talks with Israelis and Palestinians in order to concentrate on Hizbollah operations against Israeli forces, who are still occupying the disputed Shabaa Farms are in southern Lebanon.
This step comes following a daily deterioration that has continued for over two weeks in the Shabaa Farms.
And that Powell would arrive at Beirut airport at 9 am to meet with President Lahud at Baabda palace at 9:30 or 10 in the presence of Foreign Minister Mahmoud Hamud.
Following his return to Beirut in the evening he visited Speaker Birri.
These sources said that President Lahud was "insistent that development in the region could not be separated from their influence on the Lebanese arena whenever Israeli undertook an attack against the Palestinians on the domestic front, which required that the problem of the region be viewed not just in terms of developments in the occupied Palestinian territories but in terms of the problem in its entirety, in particular that efforts must be made towards a just and comprehensive peace that would provide solutions and secure the rights and guarantees for all parties to the dispute".
Junbalat yesterday met a large delegation of religious leaders from the Al-Bayyadah assembly halls in Hasbiya and the surrounding area in Al-Mukhtarah. They were visiting him to thank him for his concern for the area and its people and to hear his view on events in the Palestinian territories.
They should know that the Palestinian blood that has been shed in Jenin, Nablus, the West Bank and other areas, will be a curse, the curse of Palestinian blood that will fall upon or be directed sooner or later against all those who failed to answer the Arab cause, from the Occupied Territories to some Arab or foreign rulers.
The delegation also visited the two pillars of the sect's spiritual authority Sheikh Abu Hasan Arif Halawi and Abu Muhammad Jawwad Wali Al-Din in Al-Baruk and Baaqlin.
Senior Lebanese sources expressed their satisfaction at what they described as the "American awakening" towards Lebanon and Syria when American Secretary of State Colin Powell decided that his present tour to the region should include Lebanon and Syria, after he had informed Beirut before it began that it had been excluded from tour. He gave as the reason that his mission was limited to tackling the clashes between the Palestinians and Israel and the fact that he would meet Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri, who is visiting Washington today, on Tuesday. The surprise visit caused Al-Hariri's visit, which was scheduled for yesterday, to be delayed in response to Powell's wishes.
According to an American source accompanying Powell, Sharon threatened to deliver a harsh blow to Lebanon and the Syrian forces.  The White House was worried at this and he did not want any deterioration in light of the information available to him to the effect that Sharon intended to focus his military strike on the new projects built in the south following the Israeli withdrawal in May 2000.
They though it unlikely that Powell would communicate an Israeli threat or warning - rather fears of an Israeli strike that Lebanon could not bear as it experiences dangerous economic conditions.
Sources reported that President Lahud was informed at 3:15 pm yesterday that Powell thanked him for setting a time for him today.
He said that Powell would read a press statement but would not answer journalists' question and that the visit would last three hours.
Palestinian Authority Calls for Resistance to Pressures; Hizbollah: Were the Resistance Not Ready, Israel Would Have Acted in a Tragic Way.
On the domestic issue he said, "In the last few days we have mounted intensive operations in the Shabaa farms in order to make Israel anxious and communicate different messages that we support the liberation of territory and the right of the Palestinian people, and confirm that the arena will not be left open before the Zionists to gain greater dominance. This is our natural right."
He criticized "the Arab political regimes that have adopted the option of settlement and are unable to issue a statement of condemnation and disapproval, unable even to speak".
"Now every Arab bears a Palestinian heart and the road to Palestine only passes through Palestine", phrases spoken by Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish yesterday that echoed in the Kamil Shamun Sport City among twenty thousand Lebanese and Palestinians who had come to declare their solidarity with the forbearance of the Palestinian people in "Palestine Day in Lebanon - Besiege Your Siege", the invitation for which was issued by the publisher of the Al-Safir newspaper, colleague Tallal Sulaiman, and commemorated by the poet along with artists Majdah Al-Rumi and Ahmad Qaabur.
Following the national anthem and a minute's silence to mourn the martyrs of Palestine, the Master of Ceremonies said, "We meet today to say that we are surrounded with Palestine, in Palestine and like Palestine, to confirm that Palestine is broader than its territory."
He answered: I am going from here to Palestine (...). In those ashen days, no one believed anyone because hope lay beneath the ruins.
Yasir Arafat is besieged in his office denying his exile (...).
He told the story of a fighter from the besieged Jenin camp who met his fried outside the camp and said to him, "Tell me a joke to make me laugh before I become a martyr." His friend asked him, "How can you laugh when you are about to die?"
She addressed the Palestinians via the satellite channels: "Our hearts are with your. Our spirits are with you. Truth is with you. The land will return to you."
The public accompanied him as he sang, "I call on you, I grasp you hands more tightly and I kiss the ground beneath your feet" (by poet Tawfiq Ziad), which he repeated twice at the request of the crowd. He followed this with the song "Pulse of the Bank, don't be calm".
The choice of Sport City as a place to commemorate the "Besiege Your Siege" festival, in solidarity with the Palestinian people, was no simple coincidence or the result of some logistical requirement.
The city in this sense has a special place in the memory of the Lebanese generally and the Palestinians specifically.
It is the symbol.
Today is no different to yesterday.
For the events witnessed by Shatila Camp in 1982 is no more than one chapter in the chapters of massacres perpetrated by Ariel Sharon today, as yesterday, in Palestine, as in Beirut.
The road to Palestine only passes through Palestine."
It is also no small detail that Mahmoud Darwish should address the Palestinians from Beirut and specifically from Sports City and that he should be with the Lebanese and the Palestinians whose blood, as he said, was shed in defense of Beirut, who did not surrender.
Everyone applauded as they liked and everyone observed the minute's silence in their own way.
Now we are all Palestinians without distinction."
It would have been useful for Secretary of State Colin Powell to have stopped at Jenin Camp on his way to visit head of the Palestinian Authority Yasir Arafat in Ramallah.
which he heard when his military transporter circled above the Israeli-Lebanese border.
It would perhaps also have been useful had the Secretary of State seen with his own eyes and heard with his own ears, and not just via the reports of aid organizations, how the remaining residents of Jenin are living today without water, electricity or foodstuffs amidst destruction and waste which we, the Lebanese, who have experienced the invasion of the Israeli army of our towns and seen what follows it, can imagine.
The men either fled or were killed, or they surrendered to Israeli soldiers with some being detained and others freed but not returning to their families. The fate of many remains unknown.
It is true that the American Secretary of State said shortly before traveling to the region that his task would not be easy, but will he be honest in the event that it fails in pointing out the real reason for that failure, in the event that the visit ends but the battles do not?

Let us sit and think for once, and make some simple comparisons:
* Secondly, Yasir Arafat revealed nothing when he said that the Likud decision constituted the demolition of the Oslo Accord. He was preceded by Israeli ministers and analysts who mounted a strong campaign against this decision. He did, however, reveal a new facet of the concessions when he told the "..." television station to the letter: "We hope to see an independent Palestinian state alongside a Jewish Israeli state".
* Fifthly, the Jordanian monarch says that he bore an urgent (note the word urgent) message to Washington saying that the region was in need of foreign intervention to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian dispute and that Washington must replace its policy of "managing the dispute" to one of "ending the dispute"...This urgent message calls us to recall the time when the Arabs opposed any American intervention in the dispute out of the fear of bias towards Israel, as if that bias has now ended!
Of course, there is no need for any of us to scream: where were we and where are we now, because where we were has led us to where we are.
The opening page of yesterday's Haaretz criticized the decision taken by the Likud central committee opposing the establishment of a Palestinian state, describing it as "useless" and containing an "historical fallacy".
Whilst he was Prime Minister the Knesset approved the "Golan Law", so that he could demonstrate at the end of his term that he had tried to hold talks with Syria and appear to be prepared to offer major concessions.
He has demanded that the party's central committee not negotiate the matter of the Palestinian state at present in order not to harm the political efforts and in order to allow the government to conduct its business.
Yesterday "Maariv" mentioned that Sharon had sent letters reassuring the Americans and his partners in the government, the Labor party ministers, that his policies would not change following the Likud vote against the establishment of a Palestinian state.
Until that time he will continue to work as usual without the interests of groups or individuals being served.
Randah Haidar.
* First, a tripartite Arab summit of pivotal weight concludes with what is almost an "appeasing" declaration condemning the violence in response to American demands.
The acceptance of the "Jewishness" of the Israeli state means that the "right of return" is dropped, which amounts to a free payment, one without recompense, at a time when the tone of political decisions in Tel Aviv shifts towards abrogating any text that speaks of the Palestinian State, towards a continuation of the aggression to establish "Greater Israel".
* Sixthly, the United States of America's share of Arab condemnation, angry statements, accusations and insults parallels that of Israel. But this is one thing and seeking America as sole authority to intervene and impose a solution is something else.

Birri Meets Head of Lawyers Syndicate and Industrialists Association; Industrialists Association.
We say that we, as free professions, are bound by the law provided that it is just and deals with all.
Birri then met with a delegation from the Board of Directors of the Industrialists Association headed by its President, Fadi Abbud, who said the following after the meeting: "It was a protocol visit to inform His Excellency the Speaker of the projects which the Association conducts.
The most important matter we discussed with His Excellency the Speaker concerned workers and unemployment. We, in the program of the Industrialists Association, are working to wage a war on unemployment in Lebanon. We discussed with His Excellency the Speaker ways of making more job opportunities available to Lebanese."
In response to a question, he said, "The meeting of the Council of Ministers scheduled after tomorrow, Thursday, will be devoted to studying an agenda covering ordinary matters."
Tuq said that discussion dealt with developmental and service issues relating to the Bishri area, including the infrastructure project for the Qadisha region and violations against municipal property in Al-Arz. "We asked for a full-time property judge to be appointed to examine the protests in the area of Bishri municipality."
This noble gesture reflects the trust Your Excellency has in the role of our forum. We also view it as appreciation of the services performed by Lebanon's Ambassadors over the past decades.
The Forum has taken slow and deliberate, but firm, steps. We look with optimism and confidence to greater activity and movement towards realization of the aims and goals for which we strive.
President of the Republic Emil Lahud yesterday discussed with a number of ministers the activities of their ministries and domestic conditions.
The President of the Republic then met Minister of State Pierre Halu, who explained that they discussed the political and economic situation in the country and that he had informed him of his view on the matters put forward and the role of the Council of Ministers as an executive authority.
He also informed him of the decisions issued at the meeting, the most prominent of which was Beirut being adopted as the headquarters for coordination between the Arab social security organizations.
The discussion also concerned educational matters relating to the future of official Lebanese certificates, especially the Baccalaureate and the Privee.
Maronite Patriarch Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Butrus Safir observed, "There are many interactions, which we hope will be stopped so that the officials will resume their path in re-establishing the situation after its collapse." He believed, "The economic situation is contemptible - this is no secret. But we most not lose hope and give in to despair. The future belongs to God, the present to us."
The security situation threatens to collapse, especially given the increasing number of explosions recently, the perpetrators of which are unknown, in addition to the disappearance of our friend Ramzi Airani in broad daylight in the center of the capital, without any trace of him being found. It is as if we are living on a farm ruled by gang law, although it sometimes assumes the guise of democracy.
These are all matters of worry and concern. But we must not see life as black. There must be hope. Anyone losing hope falls into despair.
The same applies to the political situation. There are many interactions, which we hope will be stopped so that the officials will resume their path in re-establishing the situation after its collapse.
Today Safir will chair the monthly meeting of the Maronite Archbishops Council. The agenda includes church and national issues.

This was the first public confrontation between the Iranian clerics and the government and was followed by numerous others at different stages, in which the Iranians mostly submitted to what the religious authorities, who had left the narrow domain of personal jurisprudence for the public arena and major interests, said.
Studies that adopt the Marxist methodology of analysis agree that they, namely the men of religion, form a class alongside the other classes of society in Iran...without this meaning that this description applies to clerics in other societies, in particular outside the domain of the Shiite sect.
Iranian religious scholars then split into more than one group. Some believed in the possibility of the establishment of a government representing God's shadow on earth, thereby allowing support for the monarchy embodying that rule. Others adopted the view that it could only be established by jurists. Still others opposed the intervention of men of religion in politics.
The electorate looked at the pictures of candidates and preferred the turbaned candidate to the effendi.
Do you think that if Al-Mirza Al-Shirazi returned today and issued a fatwa calling for a boycott of American goods, for example...how many Iranians would throw them in the streets as they threw the water pipes more than a century ago?

A former government official walked out of a lecture to which he was invited. The lecture was supposed to deal with globalization. However, the former official was surprised to find the lecturer attacking one of the independence figures and talking about many things besides globalization!
I replied, "Because I have been considering journalism as a mission, and a journalist is a soldier who does not sell himself to people in power no matter who they are. Otherwise, he would be 'his master's voice,' promoting the interests of opportunists and profiteers, which may conflict with the interests of the country."
"I was so glad when the late editor-in-chief of "Lissan-Ul-Hal," Jubran Hayek, called to inform me that then Saudi ambassador to Lebanon, Ali Al-Shair, thanked him, saying, 'You sent a journalist to al Riyadh who served the name of Lebanon magnificently. He did not hang around running after money.'"
I started to follow up my papers in government departments, but my papers have not been processed for three months. This is because one of the members of the Board of the Civil Service Council has retired.
* The complainant is asked to contact "Division 19" to clarify several points. The relevant department in the Ministry of Finance has advised that the complaint is missing some data and that the process is not being handled according to the regulations of retirement or dismissal transactions.

"So should lawbreakers be rewarded? And those who stuck to the rules, don't they deserve to have their situation settled by state compensation, especially if they are facing fierce competition?"
"I sold my gasoline-powered engine for only 30 dollars. However, today I will stop working."
We met a former public vehicle driver who is now selling lottery tickets instead of his previous profession, which he abandoned because of expensive gasoline. "I am now making more money than before. When vans started operating, we had to change our careers."
"Today, I waited from noon to four o'clock without having a single passenger. If I switch my engine, I will not be in a better position."

Akar-from Michele Hallaq:
Expeditions participating in the conference include: the Italian expedition excavating in Ibla, Qatna, Musharaffa, and Jabala in Syria; the Austrian expedition excavating in Tal Dib'a in Egypt; the Australian archeological expedition; the German expedition excavating in Kamd El-Loz, Lebanon; and the archeological expedition excavating in Bella, Jordan.
Archeological researcher Hanan Sharaf indicated that yesterday the lectures focused on pottery. Professor Danielli Burundi Bonakofsi, who is supervising the archeological excavation works in Musharaffa and Qatna in Syria, discussed the ancient and first intermediate Bronze Ages in the site he is excavating.
A Trial State
Thus, the increasing American role in finding solutions is a result of Sharon's failure to achieve security by force.
Ironically, Sharon fears no competition from the Labor Party. The traditional opponent of the "Likud" no longer enjoys any considerable political weight, as the majority of Israeli society is currently leaning toward extremism. The remaining party leadership is becoming even more rightist than the Israeli right wing, in a bid to maintain what is left of their popularity.
Bush agreed with Sharon's request by announcing that the circumstances appropriate for the conference are not yet available.
Obviously, the purpose was to avoid any clash with the Israeli government, which does not want the U.S. to have a clear and detailed vision or to announce any schedule for the settlement of major issues between the Palestinians and Israelis, such as borders, the status of Jerusalem, refugees, and settlements.
This does not require a new international conference for peace in the Middle East, unless the purpose is to play for time on the chance that Palestinians and Arabs would eventually accept the crumbs offered to them by Israel, because of their inability to seize back their full rights since the current balance of power is in favor of the Hebrew state.
His advisor, Usama Al-Baz, admitted upon returning from Israel that the Egyptian plan did not gain Sharon's approval. He considered it incomplete and not adequate enough for him to adopt.
The regrettable attack on Archbishop Gregoire Haddad took place after his appearance in "Tele-Lumiere" TV network interviews, in which he dealt with Christian religious and theological topics. Motives behind the offensive push Lebanese citizens, in general, and Lebanese Christians, in particular, to try to shed light on this incident. It might not have been randomly done, accidental, or merely a reaction of a group of people provoked at Archbishop Haddad's audacious views.
A line was omitted from the second and fifth paragraphs of Dr. Rasheed Shuqayr's essay, which confused the intended meaning.
Lebanese Have Poor Memories
Second, this phenomenon supports the approach adopted by some currents that fundamentalist movements are dangerous, no matter to which origin, religion, sect, or affiliation they belong. Fundamentalism is an epidemic. Its infection is unpredictable.
We cannot count on good intentions. Several religious media organizations, with hidden and/or public agendas, will definitely increase such phenomena.
Sixth, what about the identity of this group? Who has been supporting it and why? Who is behind it?
Probably this incident would provide a clearer vision, a clearer dialog, and would help uncover the disorder eroding our society's structure. Perhaps it could draw more attention from church and state officials. This might be of more importance than spending energy on issues that officials believe to be substantial and important, while we and they are totally incapable of handling them.
Al-Qassar addressed the opening speech in which he said: "Integrating our private sector, in particular, and our national economy, in general, into the current global trade system requires fundamental changes in the structure of the Lebanese economy. This makes integration an important issue, and it must be handled nationally and democratically to approve the bases and results of such integration."
Minister Fuleihan continued, saying: "Negotiations for the joining process are continuing in all successive governments. Today, we have managed to establish a plan and present a memorandum to concerned officials in the Organization, in which we explained the laws and systems of our national economy."
"2- Public relations and our ability to convince the world's countries of our capacity, our position, and the importance of our aspirations for the future. By doing so, we can enter the World Trade Organization, but this requires continuous efforts, which we are working on. At this point, we encourage the private sector to form a committee to follow up on this matter."
In a statement released yesterday, the Ministry of Finance announced, "The total treasury payables (budget and other treasury operations) until the end of May 2002 was 3777 billion pounds, compared to 3300 billion for the same period the previous year, i.e., an increase of 477 billion pounds.
On the other hand, the aggregate primary surplus realized in implementing budgetary operations during this period of the current year is 867 billion, compared to a primary total surplus of 527 billion in the same period of the previous year. This is a remarkable improvement in terms of amount and rate
The other part of the drop resulted from the abrogation of consular fees.
Relations between the Council and the Bank were reviewed. Total loans granted by the Bank to Lebanon through the Construction and Development Council reached around 450 million Euros, allocated for development and health projects in various regions of Lebanon.
He pointed out the "importance of projects that are beneficial to citizens all over Lebanon, in accordance with comprehensive development principles."
The Bank is currently considering financing new projects worth over 165 million Euros, such as the Shatura-Masna' junction from the Beirut-Damascus highway; a junction from the Port highway-al-Badawi; the al-Hikma-Jadet Charles Helw junction from the Beirut ring-road; the wastewater and rainwater refinery station in Sur; and the sewerage network in Grand Beirut.
For his part, Itani presented the history of the Lebanese-European partnership that goes back to 1977.
Chairman of the Construction and Development Council had initialed the loan agreement during his visit to the European Bank headquarters in Luxembourg on April 12, 2002.
Extending the main wave breaker to reach 1000 meters in length.
Minister of Administrative Development Fuad Al-Sa'ad said, "To counteract the industrial sector crisis, we have to admit that our capabilities depend on regional and international potential."
After a word from our colleague Ma'an Barazi, Abboud stated the conference topics. He considered the reinforcing of industry to be based on two factors in an overall formula: the private industry sector, and the general economy and role of the state.
In this context, he emphasized the necessity of establishing a common Arab market, which requires political decisions that provide definite support to fulfill the requirements of the long-awaited market.
The second session was held under the title "National Industry and Means of Competing in International Markets." Industrialist Society Foreign Relations Secretary Ahmad Kubbarah and the Society's Secretary General Ghazi Yahya both addressed the session.
El-Senyora: Agreement with "Global Refund" for Management of Value-Added Tax Refunds
Al-Senyora explained that the agreement with the company came as a result of an international tender held by the ministry and approved by the Cabinet. The agreement was drafted and approved by the Accounting Authority and was signed on the 22nd of the previous month.
Al-Senyora mentioned that the signed agreement stipulates that every organization in Lebanon is entitled to participate with the company in passing anything related to export operations carried out by tourists.
The agreement also stipulates that the organization will claim 1.85 percent of the charges, which is less than any similar charge claimed by any refund organization in the world.
For his part, the company's representative Larsen Linde mentioned that the company included Lebanon in its expansion plan even before Lebanon adopted the direct value tax system, because of Lebanon's strategic role in the Middle East and because it is a real center of tourist attractions.
Salama foresees that the privatization of some governmental inputs will have a positive impact on the market.
Deputy Governors Nassir Al-Sai'di, Faheem Mi'dad, Marawan Al-Nasouli, and Harotion Samuelian represented the Bank of Lebanon.
He asserted that the market witnessed buying demands in all banks.
He announced that the balance of payments achieved in March a surplus of 220 million dollars.
Accordingly, he requested a six-month delay for implementing the relevant decision, specifically from 6/30/2002 (the end of June) to 12/31/2002 (end of the year).
Tarbiya considered that such laws develop and promote the role assumed by Lebanon as an important financial center in the region.
They run smoothly over the keys with the tunes whispering softly, and when they touch the piano keys, the heart is touched.
They were in such harmony to the extent that one may think of them as two children playing in the field of pure music-in the middle of them, Rafael tightening the ties between twins devoted to the same message: music.
With the simplest melodic methods Al-Basha controls the senses, making long roads short with delicate musical phrases that are calm, clear, and inspired from virgin nature.
Abdel Rahman Al-Basha plays while surrounded with the legend of his success that has accompanied his fame in the West, recognized for his Eastern heritage and that deep indulgence in the Western culture with its different epochs.
From Liszt's meditative poem in Oberman's Valley, from the series "Years of Pilgrimage" where tranquility and melancholic nostalgia meet the magic fingers, to the charm the artist takes to infinity.
Hence, he goes into the depth of the script, reaching the heart of the music.
Chopin's sonata is explosive, fierce, and boldly harmonic. We listen to its delicate phrases, and Al-Basha shed tangible light on every scene, revealing its darkest truth.
The third anniversary of the assassination of four Lebanese judges was commemorated in the Palace of Justice yesterday. There are two explanations for the huge number of people participating in the event and the speeches delivered. First, the event gave the impression that the judges were killed yesterday, although three years have passed since they were assassinated. The Palace appeared to be arranged for condolences. The pictures of the victims were hung on the wall behind the arch, and women dressed according to mourning customs. The judiciary wore the official colors red, white, and black. Constitutional Council Chairman Ameen Nassar appeared in dark blue and white. A giant screen was raised for those who found themselves outside the hall.
Such major crimes must be handled by breaking the barriers adopted in dealing with other types of crime. The flow of information to the media must be secured.  Under such circumstances, no criticism can be made and no one can be accused of ignoring the case. Everyone should be responsible. Responsibility must not be left to the judiciary alone. However, they did everything they could.
Minister of Justice Sameer Al-Jisr responded to criticism against the Judiciary. He described the judiciary as "the martyr of fabrication," a reminder that the body of this organization is made up of people.
It was a moment of intense fear and confusion. Words were lost.
In the evening, he learned that Commander Said Eid, upon instructions from Minister of Interior Elias Al-Murr who is currently abroad, ordered investigations of ten internal security personnel, who were present at the gates of the Tele Lemiar TV station building. They were accused of not acting quickly and effectively as required to protect Bishop Haddad.
"The security forces present there attempted to dismiss the three young men, but Father Mihanna intervened, saying that he knew them, and he started talking to them."
"As the General Administration of Internal Security Forces is intent on carrying out security tasks accurately, stringent and immediate disciplinary measures have been taken with regard to the security force that was assigned to protect the security of the place and its officials."
The anniversary of the assassination of the four judges turned into an opportunity to respond to occasional campaigns against the judiciary. It was equally a reminder of that horrible crime and of the perpetrators who are still free.
Security personnel said it was most likely due to extreme heat inside the audio instruments and car battery that were on the back seat.
A Torch and the Darkness
This violence is intolerant of differences in opinion and of free expression. It is the violence of a fabricated, loaded, and dubious Christian "fundamentalism" that may not be overlooked by the church.
Even if Bishop Haddad forgives that aggressor who knows nothing about Christ and Christianity, he must still continue his mission-the mission of free and sound thought. The mission of questioning and doubt. The mission of true faith, which is also manifested through suffering and endurance.
The scent of morning
Time covered with dust
Passed by the mind and relieved it
By throwing stones
Flags of peace and victory
The scent of daisies
From the fragrances of bends and berries
The scent of forenoon
Hey, jurists
In the heart of trenches and wasteland
In the age of depravity and lechery
What will lightning say about us
Where are the tombstones
The scent of dew
Spread all over the place
Bowing down in the mud of history
Rivers and water flows
In a white gown
The University of Sayeddat Al-Luweiza Zoak Misbah organized a seminar about the book "Going Back to Roots" published in English by Dar Al-Murad and written by Dr. Amaal Salibi Malik, a Lecturer-Professor at the College of Human Sciences at the University. The seminar was attended by the General Manager of Ministry of Culture Al-Qadi Andre Sadir, Manager of Political Affairs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ambassador Naji Bu-'Asy, President of the University Butrus Tarbiya, and the administrators and students of the University.
The University's Public Relations Manager, Suhail Matar, delivered a speech saying, "Amal Salibi Malik's own self is the book itself."
"And what kind of Lebanon she is returning to?"
Finally, Dr. Amal Salibi Malik, the author, presented a brief overview of her experience abroad from the beginning until she came back home. She emphasized the problems she faced in raising children.
Invited by the League of Public Secondary Education Teachers, the Minister of Education and High Education Abd El-Raheem Murad inaugurated the third educational conference under the title "Educational Reform-Theory and Practice" in the UNESCO Palace. The event was attended by Member of Parliament (MP) Ghanim and Atif Majdilani, General Educational Inspector Dr. Reda Sa'ada, Chairman of Civil Servants Cooperative Association Anwar Daw, Educational Center Administration Manager Badri Najm, member of Council of Ph.D.'s Dr. Mustafa Yaghi, Chairman of Teachers Union George Sa'ada, Secretary General of Catholic Schools Monsignor Kameel Zeidan, teacher of al-Maqasid Islamic School Dr. Kamal Dalal, Chairman of the League of Assigned Professors at the Lebanese University Dr. Baheej Al-Rahban, representative of the League of Primary Schools Teachers Ayda Al-Khateeb, and a large number of secondary education teachers and school directors.
"The Ministry of Finance is delaying the payment of allocations to schools and high schools, and consequently their activities have nearly come to a halt."
"You may also know that some associations are not affiliated with the Ministry of Labor, such as the Unions of Physicians, Lawyers, and Engineers, and recently the Nurses Association."
"We do not say this to complain about our relations with the Ministry of Labor. In fact, His Excellency the Minister was a colleague and knows the details of the educational field. However, we are mentioning this to say that it is now time in Lebanon to unify our view towards teachers, in preparation for unifying the voices of teachers, the work of teachers, and the structure of teachers and education."
Also included were limiting the emigration of professionals by providing fresh work opportunities for them and activating the Ministry of Labor's role in establishing and coordinating such opportunities.
"This role has a significant feature in that the pupil is its only cornerstone. We have identified the pupil's importance in setting up curriculum, and this can be summarized in one phrase-providing formative education rather than instructional education. We have to develop the pupils' own art of discovery and exploration, and stop them from being merely receptive. Their characters have to develop on the basis of independent thought that is accompanied by the teamwork spirit and that refers to logic in dialog and persuasion."
He listened to candidates' comments about the exam atmosphere. He received differing feedback and responses, since students are of different backgrounds. Some of them had left school more than ten years ago.
"There are approximately 12,000 baccalaureate and 600 intermediary candidates."
"It is their right to take the exam after being forced to leave school because of difficult social and economic conditions. It is also their right to benefit from such a certificate in their work or private business."
"I think anyone who submitted a blank sheet will not return on the second day and will not pass. This is exactly what happens in any type of examination, even in the university exams. It means that they did not prepare themselves well enough for the exams."
He was asked whether he found the new curriculum better after piloting.
Helen Keller a Nearly Boundless Ability
Blindness could not stop Abul-Alaa AL-Ma'ari (great Arab poet and philosopher), Taha Husssein (prominent Arab Egyptian author), Bashar ibn Bard (ancient well-known Arab poet), and Homeros from making their dreams come true. They became stars in the fields of literature, poetry, and philosophy.
In her country's view, she was a living example of human willpower that possesses nearly boundless ability.
At the age of six, it was said of her, "Helen is a small wild creature, so frustrated with life. She feels herself imprisoned in a world that she cannot communicate with."
Her boldness in riding horses and bicycles was amazing.
"I follow it with my fingers on the piano. As to colors, I recognize them by matching."
"It is true that I do not see people who talk to me, but I wish you knew how easy it is to recognize the character and temperament of a person through his behavior or the touch of his hand."
She also wrote hundreds of articles that were full of optimism and courage.
"Academic Palm" Award to Bushra Adra "For Her Efforts in Publicizing the French Language"

The Russian football team's coach Oleg Romantsev submitted a quick resignation to Russian Football Federation President Viaceslav Kolskof, after Russia's defeat by Belgium 2-3 yesterday. Losing the match left the Russians out of the competition, and they left the 17th World Cup football finals in the first round.

Director of Kings College's Communicable Diseases Section Michael Malem explained that discovering the role of the VIF protein and the SIM 15 gene represents a quantum leap toward combating AIDS.
Sharon's Government Withdraws Support of Law Preventing Arabs from Owning Land
The Government's Secretary Jadoun Sar explained that Sharon informed the ministers that "Jewish settlement in the state of Israel is a success for Zionism and is vital for protecting the state's internal security and borders."
A source said that the state minister of the Religious National Party Isaac Levi accused Sharon of "yielding to pressure from the left wing, which opposes the law."
Later the couple won a lawsuit in the Supreme Court of Justice, which said that the state is not entitled to allocate pieces of land "on the basis of discrimination between Jews and non-Jews."
She refused to specify how long her country will wait for Rabat to respond to the withdrawal request and pull out of the island, which lies opposite the north coast of Morocco.
"We are saying, 'We are here.'"
The Moroccan army had established on Thursday a surveillance center on the deserted island. Spain denies any Moroccan sovereignty over the island, but it does not claim the island as Spanish territory.
He said the frigate "Nomancia" departed Sunday at noon from the port of Rota in the southwestern end of the Spanish peninsula where it was moored, and it is scheduled to arrive this morning in Ceuta, a pocket near the island of Laila.
Spanish State Minister for Security Affairs Pedro Morins visited Ceuta and is expected to visit Melilla today.
The "Demain Magazine" weekly, which fears the consequences of current events, considered that the issue involves "the biggest military crisis between Morocco and Spain since the Green March," which was organized by Morocco in 1975 to restore sovereignty over the Western Sahara.
The Danish Presidensy of the European Union announced in a statement published on the Internet, "The European Union expresses its full solidarity with Spain and urges Morocco to withdraw its forces immediately" from the island of Laila.

Assailants Disguised as Hindu Priests Kill 27, Injure 35; Kashmir Attack Renews Tension Between Two Nuclear Neighbors; New Delhi Accuses Islamabad and Announces Response Today; Islamabad Announces Pakistani Military Exercises
Before heading for Jamo, he told reporters, "On that subject, the government will tell the parliament its views on Monday (today)."
Police chased the assailants on Saturday night and yesterday but found no trace of them. However, many residents of the sector are still fleeing their homes, fearing the assailants may launch new attacks.
The United Jihad Council, which includes several Kashmiri factions fighting  Indian rule and based in Pakistan, also condemned the attack, saying that New Delhi may have arranged the incident to damage the image of the Kashmiri struggle.
New Delhi accuses Islamabad of arming separatists, who are fighting against Indian control in a section of Kashmir having a Muslim majority since 1989, and of allowing activists to sneak in from Pakistani lands.
However, this quiet period remains fragile. In early July, New Delhi renewed its accusations that Islamabad is not respecting its obligations. Pakistan denied the Indian accusations.
The statement said, "After the operational deployment of the armed forces in response to the intensive mobilization of Indian forces along the border, the preparation and training of various formations will be maximized through these maneuvers."

The other Iraqi newspapers wrote about the "Role of the July Revolution in Confronting American and British Hostile Plots Against Iraq and Arab Countries."
Amman had freed itself from Prince Hassan's participation in the London conference, saying, "He has no official capacity."
He explained, "America will use its bases in eight countries, including Arab states, without asking their permission!"
He claimed, "Morale is at its lowest, and the forces have been torn apart due to continuous wars."
He advised Washington to announce that it is after Saddam, not his forces.
The U.S. Central Command announced in a statement that four American and British aircraft raided Iraqi air defense systems in southern Iraq on Saturday, after they were exposed to hostile fire.
Chiefs of southern Afghan regions started arriving in Kandahar yesterday to attend a regional meeting aimed at putting the final touches on a suggestion requesting that U.S. forces avoid launching military operations in their regions and searching for fighters of the fundamentalist organization Al-Qaeda and the Islamic movement of Taliban without obtaining prior approval from them.
The Governor of Kandahar had previously stated that the governors will exchange views on initiating an express intervention regional force of 400-500 men from the six regions, and a border-guard force of 3000 men.
He said, "We are coordinating our efforts with the Afghan government and will continue to do so in the future (...) However, when we sense a certain danger, we will do what we believe to be right and take appropriate action."
He said that attacks against Afghan soldiers in southern Afghanistan have increased. Southern Afghanistan is inhabited by Pashtun tribes and was a Taliban stronghold. The local population turned against the U.S. and its allies since the bombing of the wedding party.
He emphasized that the benefits resulting from "restoration of productivity and commerce, strengthening social coherence, and establishing security in Afghanistan are issues that affect all our interests (...)" He added, "On the contrary, absence of investment in Afghanistan at this difficult time can lead to realization of our serious concerns about the integrity of Afghan territories, its economic growth, and its unity."
Al-Hariri, Junbulat, and "Moderation"
We could have understood the secret of enthusiasm that urged Junbulat to raise the level of his requirements, especially in his defense of Syria, if only the matter had stopped at his categorization of opposition into moderate powers and extremist powers. The Syrian issue in his discourse represents his ultra sensitivity and also represents a mitigated element of justification.
The categorization and the call to push them away is not because they reject internal political concepts adopted by the leader Walid Junbulat, but because they continue to oppose Syrian power in Lebanon.
Hence, we find him closing the door of dialog about Al-Taif, and officially placing the key in the hand of the Syrian president. He even denies any credit for his own government and rule in implementing the Al-Taif agreement. If we are to accept his claim that the agreement has been implemented almost completely.
Nabeel Bumunsif
The mistake was committed by Khalid, the Algerian singer. According to the campaign against tonight's concert, which is part of Beiteddine's festival, Khalid will join the Egyptian popular traditional singer Hakim, known as "Egypt's Lion," and a player of Oud and lute, the Palestinian New Yorker Simon Shahin.
There are those who watch over the nation's morale and won't allow it to be stabbed in the back.
But does this mistake deserve a campaign?
Simon Shahin will perform in two concerts in Beiteddine-tonight's concert with Khalid and Hakim, and another performance will be held tomorrow night with the "Kantara" band that he manages.
Anyway, it is not too late.
The "Protocol Fallacy" that attempted to install Lebanon as real president of the Arab Summit (which has become such an abyss!) did not last for long (...) it was wrapped up yesterday, or the day before, when the Lebanese Foreign Minister, in the capacity of President of the Arab Monitoring Committee, failed to stop the foreign ministers of Egypt and Saudi Arabia from overlooking his reservations (and the reservations of our "partner" in the "unified course," the Syrian Foreign Minister). The three went to New York to meet with the "quartet" (USA - Russia - Europe - U.N.) and discuss the "American View" of the future of the Middle East, and the chances of holding an international conference to limit Washington's exclusivity (with Israel, of course) in dealing with the crisis, or rather all the crises that are shaking the area like a storm.
It is said that he fired one bullet from a 22mm-caliber rifle before he was apprehended.
What arouses concern is the unclear attitude of Palestinian factions on one hand, and the lack of any practical steps that prove the determination to capture the murderer, on the other hand.
Yesterday, the Royal Palace in Morocco distributed these photographs, taken during celebrations of the wedding in Rabat on Saturday, of King Muhammad VI and his bride Salma Al-Banani, who is a 24-year-old computer science specialist.
"ahead of this military council is to lead the military effort within the process of changing" the Iraqi regime.
Four Days After Sayda Crime: Will the Negligence Be Repeated?
Meanwhile, repetition of what happened in previous incidents is starting to develop. This is in light of political views comparing the rapid reaction to act on less dangerous matters than what happened in Sayda, and a nearly complete absence of reaction when it comes to a serious case like the murder in Sayda.
Disparity also surfaced among Palestinian factions to the extent of disagreeing on the venue of their meeting that was held yesterday afternoon.
In that context, it was noticed last night that special forces and battalion enforcements were deployed at the entrances and around the camp.
Two days before enforcement of the decision, van owners escalated their activities, continuing their stay-in-strike in the center of Beirut, which has turned into a large van parking lot and a field full of immobile van owners.
General Tawfiq Yasiri, who was elected as a spokesman of the council, stated in a press conference, "The major task ahead of this military council is to lead military efforts within the process of changing" the Iraqi regime.
There are other officers who are living in exile but who have not joined the Council. According to opposition sources, those who do not have a clean record in Iraq did not participate in the meeting, which was held in a secret location in London.
Those officers bring back memories of 1991, when American President George Bush, Sr., encouraged Iraqi Kurds and Shiites to rebel after the Gulf War but did nothing to prevent the Iraqi army from using its air forces to repeal the short-lived insurgence.
He added that the American administration understands Turkish concerns about a possible offensive against Iraq but believes that Turkey can gain significant political and economic benefits from the changing of Saddam's regime.
Replying to a question about Teheran's stance on the London meeting he said, "If (the opposition) truly represents the Iraqi people and it stems from the core of the people" then it can "seek assistance from others, provided it does not fall into the American trap."
Foreign Ministers of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan to Meet Bush; Sharon OKs Perez Meeting with Palestinians; Sharon Approval; Damascus
Maher will meet members of the quadrilateral committee. The quartet includes the U.S., Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations, with Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan Al-Muashar and a representative of Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal.
The Egyptian foreign minister mentioned that Israeli Minister of Transport Afrayem Sineh met Senior Foreign Ministry Undersecretary, the Egyptian President's Political Affairs Office Manager, Dr. Usama al-Baz in Cairo, and presented a plan developed by the Labor Party to solve the Middle East conflict.
Sharon and Perez met on the day of a postponed meeting, scheduled for Saturday evening between Perez and a Palestinian delegation to discuss means of re-establishing contacts that started on July 7-8 with two new Palestinian ministers.
He added, "Perez told Sharon (that he will meet Rashee) before going to Denmark, and Sharon agreed."
Syrian Ambassador to Egypt Yusuf Ahmad stated on Saturday that the Arab League did not authorize Egypt and Jordan to speak on behalf of the Arab Peace Plan Monitoring Committee.
During the call, the regional situation was discussed in light of recent developments.
"There are no security islands, and the situation in the camps will be dealt with on time. We should not forget also that regardless of the tragedy that happened in Sayda, there is a real tragedy taking place in Palestine. Also, at a later stage when we settle matters, we must give the minimum social and service insurance to these camps, which are in fact islands of misery, deprivation, and poverty. That is what I discussed, or rather that is my point of view and not the view of His Excellency the Prime Minister. This is my long-standing, well-known view."
Nominating Al-Ma'ashar and Maher Only to New York Meeting Raises Doubts About International Intentions
They added that these invitations were not made before 55 days following Lebanon's Arab Summit. The current president of the Arab Summit made the request, because representatives of the Quartet had fully-booked schedules. Then the invitations came selectively, which raised disparity, concern, and doubts among member states of the Arab Initiative Committee. Therefore, Lebanon and Syria found it necessary to explain that the committee did not authorize the foreign ministers of the invited states to represent it in New York tomorrow. Maher and Al-Miashar indicated that they are meeting members of the international Quartet at a dinner banquet, not in a formal meeting, and that the meeting is of a consultative nature.
They said it is impossible to speculate the results planned by the Americans according to what the Israeli wish may be.
They mentioned that during the discussions of the second committee meeting in Cairo last Friday morning, some convergence was achieved. Ministers demanding a meeting involving all members of the committee to be held with the international Quartet said that Maher and Al-Ma'ashar must restrict their discussions in the New York business dinner to presenting the Arab Peace Initiative, insisting on maintaining it, and adopting its content as a benchmark for any suggestions.
Reception at al-Sunawbar Palace on French National Day; Le Cortier: Committment to Financial Reform and Francophonic Summit Emphasizes Lebanon's Position
In a speech before the French community and Lebanese guests he said, "We meet in this place that witnessed the birth of the modern Lebanon, and since that time it has been a symbol of the friendly relations and sincerity that link our two countries."
He said, "This support appears first of all in the political area, and in this regard France has condemned Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon since 1978 and has supported the restoration of these lands in May 2000."
He added, "French support is strongly manifested in the economic area."
Finally, he referred to the Francophonic Summit to be held in Beirut next October with more than fifty participating countries and to be attended by President Jacques Chirac.

"How much do we miss today the Phalanges who says things for the people's benefit. Perhaps what has been happening recently is meant to prevent the Phalanges from restoring its sincere approach in today's frantic regional atmosphere. But we will not give up our struggle. We cannot sacrifice or neglect our cause. We will continue to struggle for the cause for which many comrades have lost their lives. We will continue our Phalanges struggle, and no one can prevent us from using the name of the Phalanges."
"We promise the Lebanese people and our Phalanges comrades that the our party will remain faithful to the cause no matter how immense the challenges are. The Phalanges is not a mere label or sign on a building or a stamp on paper; it is a spirit, faith, and continuous struggle. The last experiences, as you all remember, the story of my return to Lebanon, the supporting demonstrations, and the popular unity gave me hope. Then came the Al-Matn general elections in which our comrade Sheikh Bayar won with such a majority, the battles of challenge and dignity led by our comrades in the Phalanges base, and the Al-Matn secondary elections, the elections of challenge in which the real winners were the truth and vigor of Al-Matn and Lebanon."
Al-Shouf - "Al-Nahar":
"There is a lot of coordination and cooperation with the Druze Initiative Committee in Palestine, particularly with the national movements that maintain important relations with all groups in the occupied land."
Junbulat also received a large popular delegation from the town of Karnayel, representing all the town's families, Christian and Druze. Speaking on behalf of the delegation, Municipality Director Khaled Al-A'war and Mayor Muneer Sulayman Hilal both emphasized "the fundamentals of MP Junbulat's approach to security, peace, coexistence, openness, and dialog." They thanked him for the way he dealt with some obstacles after the recent trouble in their town. The delegation quoted Junbulat as confirming that pending judicial matters will be finalized soon, and his emphasis on "the importance of joint national effort and consolidation of potential for the development of the area and the homeland, as the town needs many development projects." Junbulat also emphasized the "importance of respecting the cultural features of the Al-Matn area."
Junbulat had sponsored a celebration in the town of Batloun Al-Shouf on the occasion of setting the cornerstone of the Dar Batloun Municipality building. Marwan Hamada; MPs Nima Tima, Nabeel Bustani, Alla Tru, Eli Oun, and George Deeb; a large number of political and social figures; clerics; and a popular gathering attended.
"In addition, the water issue will be handled with concerned parties, particularly the Ministry of Emigrants through Mr. Marwan Hamada."
Syrian Minister of Information Adnan Umran called for the "adoption of an international Arab media plan to face the challenges."
Umran told reporters, "We are used to the artistic authenticity of Abd al-Haleem Karkala. We are also used to his creativity and efforts. We hope this art will continue and contribute more and more to the entire Arab world. We also expect more of the wonderful reputation enjoyed by Abd al-Haleem Karkala and his band. It is carved into the minds of Syrians, due to admirable performances he gave in Syria."
Al-Shouf - "Al-Nahar":
He announced that they reviewed Syrian-Lebanese relations, common issues, and regional developments. They emphasized the Lebanese-Syrian basics in that regard, and the importance of promoting Arab solidarity, reinforcing unity, and activating joint efforts to confront developments, challenges, and threats.
He said, "There are some people stealing the country's money. If such people did not exist, this money would not have been stolen."
"We commit sins. God did not create us with sins."
He offered his condolences to the army command and the families of the martyrs. He said that this "proves that the Lebanese army, regardless of differences in the affiliations of its personnel and officers, belongs to one Lebanon."
Baalbak - "Al-Nahar":
The visit had a family atmosphere.
Edition number: 1
Prime Minister Al-Hariri is making private contacts to ensure the attendance of several sister and friendly states at the Paris-2 Conference.
Attorney Michel Mar'i, on behalf of unlicensed radio stations, provided a statement, saying, "There are not 39 licensed stations and 24 unlicensed stations. In fact, there are 63 actively operating radio stations to which the Radio and Television Media Law does not apply, either in terms of licensing or in terms of failing to comply with the financial duties required of them."
"As such, we would avoid adding a new social crisis to the crises we are already suffering, and the government would secure additional revenue through easy to collect taxes. It will also benefit from subscriptions of 25 new frequencies, and possibly it will be able to offer the same to regional stations, securing no less than one billion, two hundred million pounds of treasury revenues."
"In our arena, Syria and Iran represent a salvation front for our nation, after governments have laid down arms leaving Syria and Iran alone in the field. We are with you, encouraging you, and cooperating with you to establish truth and eliminate falsehood."
He explained that the public hospital project in Ehden was not executed through the cabinet; "we knocked on its doors 11 times to no avail." He expressed gratitude for Italian aid.
Then came an introductory speech by Levera Yameen, in which she hailed Minister Franjieh's efforts; thanks to those efforts, the only hospital in Ehden and its vicinity was established.
Franjieh delivered a speech and said:
"We go back four years to the dispensary (in Ehden), the story of which is like the story of the oil jug."
"During that time, we went to the cabinet 11 times but to no avail."
"The people of Zagarta may disagree within Zagarta, but they agree with each other when they leave it."
The public hospital was established in a building that was previously occupied by Lazari nuns. It is built of stone and bricks. It is located in the middle of a relatively wide area at the center of the city of Ehden.
Bahamdoon Station Restores its Glamour, Restaurants, Cafeterias, Markets, Hotels, and Tourists
What Bahamdoon Station is witnessing now must be carefully considered: overcrowding, cafeterias, and lights here and there, making you imagine yourself in an Arab capital.
Its seven hotels, most of which are luxurious, are almost fully booked by Kuwaiti summer visitors and others, and international chains of restaurants have established branches in it.
"As to the hotels that have begun operations, they have taken off with a modern spirit in the full sense of the word. Their services match the grand international hotels, and they are of supreme quality."
"We are preparing Bahamdoon for the future, but the preparations are followed very carefully to avoid hitting obstacles that might move us back to square one."
He added, "We are making the right start, and we request that all of Lebanon follow our path."
"Hezbollah" Deputy Secretary General Sheikh Naim Qassim considered "All accusations made by America and Israel against Hezbolla are psychological warfare attempting to ruin its ability to confront Israel's aggressions and to place it in the forefront of danger."
Zuhla - "Al-Nahar":
The national anthem and then the Baath Party anthem were played followed by a note from MP Hashem about "The achievements of Haffez Assad at the internal construction level, his contributions to modern Syria, and his strategic approach at the national level."
Following him was Antoine Haddad on behalf of the martyrs' families, Emil Kfouri, who delivered the Baath speech, MP Hussein Al-Haj on behalf of "Hezbollah", and Kamal Nader on behalf of the Syrian Social National Party Center.
The Syrian Social National Party Continued its Commemoration of the 53rd Anniversary of its Founder Anton Saada's Absence
Hasibia - "Al-Nahar":
The South Territory of the Amal movement held a celebration party for local and international press and news agency correspondents in the south. The party was held in Al-Shaqeef club-Al-Nabatiya on the anniversary of the Amal Martyr Day.
"The series of moving security operations we are witnessing today are meant to subdue our homeland and relapse."
Finally, a speech was delivered by Lawyers' Association Advisor Ahmad Al-Gharbi.
The hotel collapsed in a matter of seconds, leaving nothing but debris.
Akkar - From Michel Hallaq:
Demolishing Old Hilton a Lesson to New Generation
Maybe tens and hundreds of my generation who took part in the cruel battle of hotels remember how fierce it was and how much blood it cost the Lebanese. They will also remember, when it's only too late, the grave mistake they all made in unison.
Religious Leader Blames Sectarian Incompatibility; 11 Muslims of Lebanese Origin Condemned of Rape Incidents That Infuriated Australians
One of the victims was raped 25 times by 14 youths within six hours and in three different locations in a suburb of Sydney.
The wave of sexual assaults took place within a six-month timeframe in the year 2000. However, the trials emerged publicly one year later, when groups of Middle Eastern emigrants were trying to come to Australia.
A study published last week showed a strong current of prior ideas against Muslim Australians.
Senior Mufti of Australia Sheikh Taj EL-Deen Hamad Hilali paid visits over the past few days to a number of the culprits' families, who still refuse to admit that their sons committed rape.
Group rape incidents were reported, but many of the culprits were not arrested.
As the Israeli occupation of the Syrian Jolan Heights continues, and as the IDF re-occupies West Bank cities it previously withdrew from, it seems that the single-sided Israeli withdrawal carried out by the IDF from Southern Lebanon will indefinitely remain the sole liberation accomplishment in the region.
This status quo, as it starts to take form after U.S. President George Bush's speech and through international mediators, leads to a single result: all the Palestinians will get from now and for two years is a declaration of an interim disarmed Palestinian state on 42% of their lands.
However, the fact now is that Sharon is the one dictating the agenda of the political solution and settlement process of the problem with the Palestinians: starting with dismissing Yasser Arafat and the advent of an alternative Palestinian leadership, moving on to establishment of a disarmed Palestinian state, talks about long-term interim agreements, all the way to maintaining security belts in Ghour Jordan to prevent that state from any regional contact with other Arab states.
In spite of all that, everyone inside and outside of Israel realizes how fragile Sharon's political accomplishments are, and that they may very well be wiped out any minute, perhaps with the first big blast, either inside Israel or on the border with Lebanon; then the entire region will fall into the unknown.
The new facts imposed on the settlement process with the Palestinians will definitely reflect on the future of any negotiations between the Israelis and the Syrians.
On the eve of the parliament's discussing the telecommunications bill, "Al-Nahar" received a letter signed by long-time Ojero employees inquiring about the reasons for "depriving them the benefits of Law 161" and their failure to understand "the ambiguity" enshrouding article 49 of the bill.
"We, the long-time employees of Ojero, have safeguarded our organization for all the years of the war! What crime have we committed to be deprived the benefits of Law 161 (we are only 127 employees). Where is equality in the state of law and institutions?"
"- One-month salary for each year of actual service up to the tenth year."
"This was after consultation with the Legislation and Consultancy Authority, who approved our entitlement in letter number 613 dated 9/28/2000."
"Noteworthy is the fact that the electricity sector reports hundreds of millions in annual losses, whereas the telecommunications sectors profits hundreds."
The employees demanded "permanent employment for all Ojero employees, in equality with their colleagues in the Ministry of Telecommunications."
He said, "Casino of Lebanon business results have started to improve, and Intra has obtained from the Casino a dividend distribution advance of 4 million 470 thousand dollars, which represents 10% of the debt value. Intra also obtained from the Bank of Finance, which is almost a subsidiary of Intra, an advance of 2 billion 700 thousand pounds."
The Ministry of Agriculture, in cooperation with the European Union and the University Cooperation Institute-Rome and within the context of the Agricultural Sector Support and Qualification program in the South, organized an agricultural guidance seminar on "Cultivating and Marketing Mushrooms" in the Agricultural Guidance Bureau of the project in the Bint Jubayl mixed school.
The Organization is placing its available power to compensate for this shortage during the above-mentioned stoppage period.
The event began with the national anthem, played by the "Kashafet El-Mahdi" band, then a speech by Bint Jubayl Commercial Enterprise Owners Association Chairman Tarek Bazzi, in which he mentioned the restoration of the city's commercial role, particularly through establishment of the first and second shopping festivals.
Feteish discussed Bint Jubayl city's role at the confrontation and heroism level, and the patriotic situations of its people. He said, "This Month of Shopping drives the economic and tourism wheel in the area." He also mentioned, "The combined economic objectives require attention to the needs of the region and its developmental necessities. We would like to put it on the record that there is no official attention paid to the development of the area nor to compensating it for its substantial loss during the occupation."
On his part, Minister Filayjan said, "With the city of Bint Jubayl we recall a long heroic history of struggle against the French mandate, then participation in the Syrian and Palestinian revolutions in the 1920s and 1930s and its results, with concurrent attention to construction and prosperity, as well as the hard toil of the South, of Mughtaribat, and of Lebanon entirely. Int Jubayl remains high-headed and eminent at the crossroads of homogeneity and will between Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine." He added, "Shopping means construction and prosperity, and thinking of the present and the future with the mentality of building, development, and improvement. That is what our enemies do not want for us; they want us to remain the captives of fear and anxiety."
During a sleepless night, a book I was reading led me to the great movie director who is now in his nineties and almost forgotten these days-Michelangelo Antonioni (born in the Italian city of Ferrara in 1912). The book had been waiting for me on one of my desk shelves, with all the director's views and theories about movies in it.
In the 20 years that Romy Schneider had been away, "Paris-Match" decided to ask her colleague Brigitte Bardot, who starred in the same Golden Age, a few questions.
* Through which occasions and circumstances did you get closer, in order to become such close friends?
* You appeared together in some pictures and particularly in Saint Tropez.
* How did you find your way to the top?
The eighth round of the Cairo Radio and Television Festival ended its activities and dropped the curtain on the award-giving scene, which included several organizational errors. It left a number of questions regarding the fabrication of that huge number of program category classifications, which allegedly increased diversification and allowed more room for competition among the festival's contenders.
Or do our radio and television media managers disdain participation in Arabic festivals, like the Cairo festival?
I swear! It seems that someone developed this invention by expanding the database that contains blacklists of actors, directors, and films to include live performances and singers. Moreover, he found a way to feed the database continuously so that if a mistake is committed, "The Monitor" records the offender's name and marks him/her with a black mark. His file is then distributed to all boards, conferences, links, and clubs that are against cultural invasion, so that they take action at the first opportunity and so no one escapes punishment.
Two months ago there was a hue and cry in Palestine, but surprisingly our nation can sleep peacefully.
Maybe Khalid made a mistake, or let us say it is indeed a mistake.
If only those campaigners had asked Simon Shahin, Khalid's partner in today's concert.
But performing in those two concerts is at least a statement to those against naturalization, saying that the world is not black and white. If only they paid attention.
Let them be a minority at Beiteddine tonight.
"Actually, I became a professional actress with the help of my parents."
*Wasn't Francis Huster the one who helped you succeed in your acting career?
*When did you start your career as a movie actress?
"Many reasons."
*How is Nicole Garcia as a director?
"Everything in her is sexy, her body, the way she thinks, the way she talks."
*With whom do you want to work now?
*Did the cinematic world attract you?
"Zulawski's and Benix's movies are all terrible."
*What are the movies you like to watch these days?
"No! But I believe that French actors are not systematic in their careers."
To that end, representatives of teachers' organizations and leagues are distributing a detailed memorandum of the rights and reasons that led to boycotting grading procedures to MPs Tuesday morning before the parliament plenary session.

2- How can the teachers under contract for secondary and elementary education continue to work and travel to and from correction centers when they have not received their salaries for a whole year for secondary contract teachers and for the past two school years for elementary contract teachers?
First: Emphasizing that the intuitive rights demanded by teachers form a single integral set, and that the government and the Ministry of Finance are required to expedite their approval and implementation after the collapse of all financial excuses made by the Ministry of Finance.
In tandem with the statement and escalating agenda, activities and statements supporting the teachers' demands are developing consecutively.
The Technical Institutes and Schools Committee of the Free National Movement declared their standing by "the cause of our teachers, who never lingered or failed us. We know very well that they are more concerned with our future and success than our own selves."

Minister Murad spoke and said:
"How can they continue, and with what feelings are they going to teach?"
Hazeem Sponsors Graduation at Al-Balamand Secondary; Fayyad: The General Economic Situation Prevented Good Application of Curricula; Hedaya Schools
The graduates entered, then the national anthem was followed by speeches by students Dima Jadoor, Myria El-Nashif, and Elsie Nasr in the name of the graduates. They paid tribute to the memory of their colleague Jassi Farah, who died in a car crash two months ago.
"And freedom without democracy is single-legged and deficient." (...)
Finally, Bishop Elias Qurban, the Patriarch's representative, delivered a speech in which he conveyed the blessing of Patriarch Agnatios IV. He also commended the contributions of Tallet Al-balamand institutions in terms of secondary and university education, under the guidance of the Patriarch who works diligently to reinforce the progress of these institutions as a participation by the church in preparing the new generations and securing education using the latest educational methods. He also expressed his joy to participate in the graduations "seasons" in the institutions of the Tripoli and El-Kora Diocese, which is concerned with preparing the students in an educated and scientific open manner driven by the will to develop and release free humans in the homeland as active participants in all forms of progress.
Distinguished pupils were given certificates of appreciation and token gifts.
"With regard to the first reason, most universities adopt similar academic programs, but the difference is in the attention and care every student finds."
"As to the second reason for the success of our graduates, I would like to say that the spirit that developed inside you while you were with us, the spirit of freedom that you enjoyed and that encouraged you to ask questions, discuss, and express your opinions is the reason for your success."
Certificates were then distributed with the assistance of the deans of the College of Engineering and Architecture Dr. Abd-Allah Sufeer, the College of Business Dr. Tarek Mikdashi, the College of Arts and Sciences Dr. Hadia Harb.
Zajal, as it is well known, is the heading of challenge and exaggeration.
"You must know that there never was despair or tears in your father's poetry."
Many people note that I seldom write a piece without mentioning or reminding of my father, citing some of his verses, opinions, or situations, and expressing admiration.
How can we wake and these are your heights
Your rebellious people
And we raised the standard of work
Its tunes nurtured me before my birth
Qublan Makrazil, the poet whom the foreigner failed to stop from demanding independence for his homeland and was thus locked up every Lebanese prison. However, he used to defend himself and his comrades, and they would always be acquitted:
With the page of love, liberty, and pen
I am not one to take, I
To that end, representatives of teachers' organizations and leagues are distributing a detailed memorandum of the rights and reasons that led to boycotting grading procedures to MPs Tuesday morning before the parliament plenary session.
The celebration was attended by Educational Center of Research and Development Director Dr. Laila Mileiha Fayyad; North Educational Administration Director Fawzi Nima; Secretary General of Orthodox Schools in Lebanon Shafeek Haydar; former Engineers Association Chairman Atta Jadour; the secondary school's Trustees Council Secretary General Elias Bushaheen; members of the Council; members of the Parents Council; directors of a number of schools; and parents.
Of course, they intended the positive meaning, not sending him on a flight out of the government.
The "Liqaa Club" in Ein El-Maryas started its meetings for this year with the "Social Justice" dialog with Bishop Gregoire Hadda and Mr. Muhammad Hassan El-Ameen.
The conference started with recitation from the Holy Qur'an, followed by a speech by Jabal Lebnan Scholars Organization President Sheikh Afeef Al-Nabulsi, in which he praised the resplendent history and continuous struggle of the hawzas.

"This is what introduced differentiation between what is religious and what is political. Loud voices demanded isolating religion away from politics and leaving politics to its specialists."
Hawzit Al-Talkeen Director Mr. Abd-Allah Fudl-Allah presented research titled "A Narration on Coordination of Hawzas and on Scientific Curriculum."
The people of today in the East and the West suffer under serious diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart and artery diseases, as well as obesity.

In addition, Professor John Dean spoke about Abomorphine and its effectiveness in stimulating the brain and inducing its natural signal for the erection process.
It indicated the importance of a perfect performance in presenting creative works to an audience.
And the poet. What would his poetry be worth if it did not reach anyone perfectly?
Those who got to know Badr Shaker Al-Sayab in Beirut (or any other place) remember him as a slim, svelte, and shy person. He reads poetry in a monotone, and his voice is not attractive. It could make him lose a lot when conveying the profound content of his poetry and its well-tailored metaphors.
Poetry as an "elocution phenomenon" needs eloquence, that is, "theatrical performance" or "theatricalization" to reach the audience in a complete expressionistic sound and visual experience.
The 2484.71 kilometer total distance Rally, of which 1090.27 kilometers are distributed over 12 speed stages, was worthy of its reputation as the most powerful and exciting among the championships. Only 13 cars completed it, out of 48 cars that set off the starting line. All the others withdrew because of fatigue or breakdowns caused by rough surprise-loaded terrain.
This is Makri's second victory during the current season, after winning the Greek Acropolis Rally one month ago, his first for a year.

Egyptian men and women fully dominated the titles of the fifth Arab Club Champions Squash tournament for men and the first for women. The championship was hosted by the Lebanese Squash Federation. Six countries participated, and games were held on the courts of the Escape and Moon Lasalle clubs. The tournament ended yesterday.
Alex Coritba of Spain, currently ranked eighth, won his first title this season when he defeated Gaston Gaodio, ranked seventh, 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) in the final match of the Switzerland International Open Tennis Tournament held in Gastaad with prizes totaling 600,000 dollars.
This is the first time for Kroon (26 years old) to win in a stage of the French tournament. He beat his two compatriots Servais Knaven and Erik Dekker, as well as Franck Renier, Sebastien Hinault, and Stepahne Auge, all of whom are French. He made it in 4:36:52 hours, at an average speed of 47.135 kilometers per hour.
The Australian team, who was missing many of its major players including Harry Kubel and Mark Fidok due to prior engagements with their European teams, dominated the first half of the match. Their top-scorer Joel Porter was about to score in the tenth minute, but New Zealand goalkeeper Jason Patty's outstanding performance prevented the ball from touching the net.
Following are the results, with the host team listed first:
Bulle 1 - Neuchatel Xamax 1
1- Grasshopper Zurich 6 points, from 2 matches (6-2).
5- BSC Young Boys 4 (6-5).
Musharraf also severely criticized assailants who committed "disgraceful" attacks on Christians and Westerners, considering them "enemies of Islam" and "terrorists."
He wondered,  "Who is the loser, apart from the innocent victims who were killed?"
He mentioned that the assailants were either killed or captured.
He urged his citizens to be filled with patriotism, religious tolerance, and commitment to unity, saying that his country gained respect for its contribution to the international war on terrorism in which it "was in the lead."
He also rejected the Indian viewpoint that suggests that holding the elections in a peaceful atmosphere will be a "test of Pakistan's credibility," emphasizing that his country "cannot guarantee any possible developments" might take place in Jamo and Kashmir. "India cannot hold Pakistan responsible for the failure of elections," he added.
"India is willing to hold bilateral talks as soon as cross-border terrorism ends, once and for all."
The Indian police mentioned that three Indian soldiers were killed and 18 were injured in a mine explosion and machine gun attack in Jamo and Kashmir with responsibility claimed by "Hezb AL-Mujahideen."
Twelve others who were injured in the blast will be given the Pakistan Medal, which is a third-degree medal, in recognition of their services to Pakistan.
He announced that he is going to appeal the decision.
During the referendum, East Timor was under the rule of Suarish. He is one of three officials tried in this case. The other two are commanders of the armed forces and police in the then Indonesian region.
The Human Rights Tribunal was established last year after intensive international pressure on Jakarta to try those who were responsible for the bloodshed.
Last May, East Timor was declared an independent state, after two and a half years of U.N. administration.
Pyongyang had shown willingness to receive an American envoy, despite its threat on Wednesday to withdraw from the nuclear agreement signed in 1994 with Washington.
Analysts speculated that differences in wording occurred because North Korean representatives did not have the right to decide on military affairs.
South Korean government spokesman Ray Bong-Jo said, "We believe that agreeing on different types of talks will bring relations between the two Koreas on track and will help consolidate cooperation and reconciliation."
The railway and a parallel road have a symbolic value, as they represent the first crossroad across the demilitarized zone that has divided the Korean peninsula since the end of the Korean War.
The economic talks bear additional significance since Pyongyang took intermittent steps on the economic reform path.
One of the sensitive issues is Tokyo's accusation to Pyongyang of abducting 11 Japanese and forcing them to spy for North Korea, or training them to do so.
The 220-page book discusses 35 verses of the Koran.
He added that many Americans have a strong belief that most Muslims wish to kill Americans, particular those who are Christians.
He said: "I do not believe I would have chosen another book for this educational purpose," as Sales "does not deal with it as a preaching faith but as a scripture that we need to understand."
However, the program might actually be discontinued today if a federal judge makes such a ruling in the lawsuit filed before him.
American "Apache" Crashes South of Kabul; Khatami Promises Karzay 50 Million Dollars; Khaleel Zadah; Burglary; Pakistani Detainees
It added that the coalition forces closed the accident scene, 30 kilometers south of Kabul.
Iranian newspapers reported that Khatami promised Kabul a 50 million dollar aid package to be added to the overall aid of 550 million dollars that Iran promised in the Donors Conference in Tokyo last January. He said that he signed several agreements for economic cooperation between the two countries.
It also agreed to transmit electricity to Herat west of Afghanistan and to expedite construction works on the Dugaron-Herat road.
University Professor Sadik Zeibklam, who maintains close contacts with Iranian reformists, expressed his view in an interview with the "Aftab Yazd" newspaper saying, "Khatami's policy of bringing Iran and Afghanistan closer to each other could lead to the easing of tensions between Iran and the United States."
Guzna is experiencing turmoil since the overthrow of the Taliban regime late last year.
He said that Pakistani detainees who were not proven to have affiliations with militias of the Taliban or Al-Qaeda will be released on August 18, Afghanistan's national day.
The security slip in the Ein El-Helwa camp represents further evidence of the limitations on Lebanese "sovereignty" and decision.
And as to imposing Lebanese security control on the camps, this is an issue  postponed to the solutions stage, which will include remaining parts of the South and Jolan and Syria's regional status in Lebanon, as well as the expected economic package in return for handling the file.
In view of the Lebanese authority's abstention from practicing politics in the true sense of the word, any talk about Lebanese security remains a matter of theory argued about by members of the Central Security Council without any ambition to try to Lebanize some part, even if slight, of the camps' security with mutual consent.
As such, there has to be Lebanese-Palestinian-Syrian research to push matters toward a new formula of co-existence between the concept of the state and the reality of the security islands imposed in reality from beyond the Lebanese framework, which cannot exceed an extremely particular interpretation of sovereignty, and for the role of the camps.
How can it respond to the inhabitants of the city of Sayda and its vicinity, who sleep on the beat of ongoing combat in Ein EL-Helwa?
It should include a greater role for the army and greater room for the credibility of the constantly shaking state.
For when the Iraqi opposition delegation emerged last Saturday to face reporters in front of the Truman building after holdings talks with Assistant Secretary of State Mark Grusman and Assistant Secretary of Defense Douglas Fayt, the final scene was extremely exciting.
Perhaps because the officials in Washington are aware of their guests' nature, Colin Powell found it sufficient to give them just enough time to say a few words: "Our common goal is liberty for the Iraqi people," then leave.
In short, there were those demanding the Hashemite throne, the supporters of Ayatullah Khomeini who speak in the name of monarchy, the Shiites, the Kurds, the veterans of Baath, and of course the friends of the CIA.
For further mockery, the newspaper wonders: Are they 6 or 7 groups?
Perhaps 8!"
Attack on Iraq Before November & Immense American Pressure on Syria and Iran
He mentioned that there is intensive activity by the Americans, who are transferring arms and ammunition to the combat region, particularly to their bases in Turkey, Bahrain, and Qatar.
Shif mentioned that the "new development is the position of the leader" of Hamas "Sheikh Ahmad Yaseen, who, public statements aside, says that the Palestinian interest now lies in stopping the suicidal attacks in return for immediate withdrawal by Israel to its lines right before the confrontations, releasing all Palestinian captives, and stopping IDF operations, concentrated liquidations in particular.
Commenting on that, Shif says, "This is the start of an internal Palestinian dialog of which Israel should not hinder the development."
Completing his term according to the law is one of his explicit aims.
Most probably, the opposite will happen.
"For example, the declining "Shas" party, particularly Fuad."
R. H.
After the Lebanese army was recently given Badee' Hamada, alias "Abu Ebeida", who is accused of killing three Lebanese intelligence personnel, and the escalation of political, media, and even military skirmishes in the camp on daily basis, the Ein El-Helwa problem raised two basic questions that represent the focus of political concern about the resulting situation in the camp: What is the scope on which the Lebanese state deals with the Palestinian camp, and are the military incidents inside it connected in any way with the Palestinian situation in the occupied lands, and consequently the regional situation, which leads to an intuitive question: Do the current events represent a local card imposed by an agenda of incidents internal to the camp, or a card that may be utilized externally as well?
Such an essence extends to the recent events, in terms of the Lebanese state's tendency to resolve the situation in the camp.
The Lebanese state is facing a substantial challenge in the impossibility of continuing to overlook the resorting of people with criminal records, and the like, to the camp of Ein El-Helwa.
Having responsible Palestinians control the internal situation of the camps secures a defined reference that enjoys independence, the privacy of which is respected by the Lebanese state, as was the case during the past years.
After Assignments Diplomatic Formations Cooking State Completes Privatization Rounds And Budget In August For First Time
Prime Minister Rafeek Al-Hariri is leaving on a private one-week vacation, while seven ministers are spending private vacations abroad.
The law was amended in connection with the requests of laborers, contract hires, and employees of the Lebanon Electricity Organization, so that the applicable surplus provisions apply to them as of the date of issuing the law, and pursuant to the provisions applied in the Electricity Organization and Qadisha Electricity with regards to the end of service compensation.
On the other hand, the prime minister announced in the session that 15 international and Arab companies informed the government as of the 9th of the current month of August of their willingness to participate in the mobile phone bidding and tender. The cabinet also approved the financial agreement between the Ministry of Telecommunications and the two mobile phone operators, which assigns to "France Telecom" 38 million dollars and to "Lebancell" 37 million and 750 thousand dollars for the operating stage."
Ministerial sources described the session as "One of the most harmonious sessions" as evinced by the approval of all items on its agenda in a record time, particularly the appointments issue, and that it lasted for only 45 minutes.
So where is this draft?
This proposal is currently under discussion and refinement, amidst concealment of the included names.
Israel Vaccinates For Smallpox And Distributes Anti-Radiation Pills "Al-Talibani" Refuses Trojan Horse Role In Northern Iraq & German Chancellor Supports Continued "Containment" Policy Schruder Amman Al-Talibani
Ministry of Defense General Manager Amos Yaron explained that this step is for protection from any accident that may happen in a nuclear establishment, and that it is not for any Iraqi threat.
He added that consultations must be made with Berlin "not only about the method and time schedule, but also in the reasons" of any operation.
He explained that Russia sensed flexibility in the Iraqi leadership, which was manifested in the act of inviting UNSCOM Director Hans Blix to visit Baghdad, noting that the initiative "came in response to Russian advice."
CNN had quoted Al-Talibani as saying that "The American army will be welcome in Kurdistan in Iraq, contrary to some rumors," expressing his willingness to make the bases he controls in northern Iraq available to Washington.
He emphasized, "Our forces are not prepared to offer services to anyone. However, if American forces come to Kurdistan to protect us, they will be welcome (...) As to assuming a Trojan Horse role, or helping foreign forces in their special missions, that is not part of our missions or duties."
Special American envoy to Sudan, former Senator John Danforth, arrived in Cairo yesterday coming from Washington on a mission for several days during which he will hold talks with a number of Egyptian officials in connection with the developments in Sudan.
An Egyptian foreign ministry official had mentioned that the American envoy will meet, in addition to Moussa, with Foreign Minister Ahmad Maher and Foreign Ministry Senior Undersecretary, Egyptian President's Political Affairs Office Manager Usama Al-Baz to discuss the "latest developments in the situations in Sudan in light of the Machacus agreement between Khartoum and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement."
On the other hand, Sudanese Foreign Affairs Minister of State Shol Denek emphasized the importance of the Egyptian role in achieving peace in Sudan.
Yesterday, the Egyptian foreign minister had met Sudanese Ambassador to Cairo Ahmad Abd El-Haleem, who explained that he presented Maher with "some ideas relevant" to the efforts being exerted to reach a solution within the framework of Sudan's unity.
In Khartoum, the Secretary General of the ruling National Conference party, Ibraheem Ahmad Umar, announced that the party had decided to change its motto to "Peace, Unity, and Development" instead of "Struggle, Victory, and Martyrdom".
This position comes after the statement issued by the National Conference Party confirming that Muhammad Sir Al-Khatm Al-Merghani, cousin to Muhmmad Al-Merghani, joined the party.
Iranian radio quoted him as saying, upon meeting the cultural attachés in Iranian embassies abroad, that "The President of the United States uses Adolph Hitler's language,"
"But as we proved before, we will respond to any aggression to protect our national interests and the sovereignty of our lands."
One of the commentators said, "The truth is that the USA has turned terrorism into a personal issue."
"And they definitely have allowed Al-Qaeda into their country." (...)
(WSF, Reuters)
The truth is that Naila Muwwad's poltical movement aims at applying the Al-Taif agreement that the authority turned against, among whom Minister Franjiya is a permanent fixture.
Does not extending strength from Syria or behind what Minister Franjiya calls "the line" and introducing Syria as party to the internal Lebanese conflict represent destruction of Al-Taif?
Does he know that he is not qualified to give others lessons in patriotism?
Needless to say, he should remember that sovereignty does not mean a political science replacement of one power with another. Rather, it means refusing any subservience of any sort, as well as the exclusivity of the state's decision on all its lands.
Third: Minister Franjiya claims that the Syrian army in Lebanon protects Christians, and in case it withdraws there will be nothing to prevent the other team (i.e. the Muslims) from demanding count-based democracy on the premise that they form 60% of the total population.
Does that not represent questioning of the will of the Lebanese to co-exist, or even of the entire Lebanese body?
Among the congratulators were: Presidents Ameen El-Jumayyil, Hussein Al-Husseini, and Rasheed Salih, Ministers Biar Helw and Jean Louis Qirdahi, MP's: Robert Ghanem, Waleed Abdou, and Muhammad Qabbani, Saudi Ambassador Fuad Sadik, Gabon Mufti and Ambassador Simon Tuton, Staff Brigadier Elias Farahat on behalf of Army Commander General Michel Sulayman, former MP's: Talal Al-Mura'bi, Biar Dikash, Tamam Salam, Rafeek Shaheen, Michel Khuri, Michel Samaha, Jameel Al-Shammas, and Shafeek badr, former Ministers Sulayman Al-Tarabulsi and Joseph Al-Hashem, Physicians Associate Chairman Mahmoud Shuqayr, Economic and Social Council Director Roger Nisnas, Marunite Council Director Rimon Rafael, Roman Catholic League Director Marun Abu-Rejeileh, a delegation from the "Human Unlimited Society" presided by Murad Al-Khuri, Syriac League Director Habeeb Afram, National Social Syrian Club Party Leader Jubran Arabaji, Lebanese National Front Director Ernest Karam, Lebanese Movement Director Nabeel Mushantaf, National Media Council Director Abd EL-Hadi Mahfouz, Sheikh Bilal Al-Mulla on behalf of Republic Mufti Sheikh Muhammad Rasheed Qabbani, Beirut Marunite Parish Deputy Director and "Al-Hikma University" President Monsenior Joseph Mirhag, Catholic media Center Director Khuri Abdu Abu-Kasm, Marunite League Secretary General Khaleel Karam, Arab Bank Union Director and Banks Society Director Joseph Tarbiyya, Contractors Association Chairman Sheikh Fuad Al-Khazin, a delegation from the Imam Musa Al-Sadr Foundation presided by Suad Al-Husseini, David Eissa on behalf of the chairman of the "Funding Bank", Sana Agency Manager in Beirut Yaseen Murhaj, Ambassador Fuad Al-Turk, Ministry of Justice General Manager Umar Al-Natour, Islamic-Christian Dialogue Committee Member Muhammad Al-Sammak, Attorneys Khadr Haraka and naji Al-Bustani, Zahi Al-Bustani, former Attorneys Association Chairman Rimon Eid, Attorneys Association Secretary Muhammad Shehab, Attorney Joseph Abu-Sharaf, Athletic Editors Society Chairman Khaleel Nahhas presiding a delegation from the society, a delegation from the Lebanese Women's Council presided over by Sanaa Al-Sulh, and Supreme Shiite Islamic Council Vice-President Adnan Heidar.
The massive attendance during the election process and his colleagues' enthusiasm confirm that the Editors Association is now a full-fledged democracy.
*Minister Qirdahi: "Your election for a new term at the top of the Lebanese Editors Association represents a new testimony to your achievement-rich history.
"We rely on Chairman Karam, the perpetual voter and great friend, to remain at the front lines of defenders of freedom in Lebanon."
The Cabinet issued a batch of appointments last night to fill openings in first class jobs.

Sfeir went from Al-Diman to Kanouin on foot. He took the pedestrian road between Al-Diman and Kanouin and was accompanied by an emigrant delegation from Al-Diman Club in Sydney Australia.
They were expecting the vans from the east, and the decision came to them from the west.
The Committee held a meeting in the Catholic Media Center in Jabal El-Deeb yesterday, at its invitation, and was presided over by its deputy director and Mariam Marunite Monks Director General Apati Francoise Eid.

"It will be inaugurated and will start offering its services during Iranian President Muhammad Khatami's upcoming official visit to Lebanon, Allah willing."
Al-Zein delivered a speech in which he lauded the position held by Iran. Sibhani responded with a speech in which he criticized the "American bias in favor of Israel," mentioning that "Pressure has been exercised on Iran and Syria to stop supporting the resistance," and emphasizing that "Such pressure and threats have not succeeded in achieving their purpose." He called on the officials of Sayda to assume a fundamental role in resolving the Palestinian camps situation.
Sibhani responded with a speech in which he confirmed that his country "is always striving to allow people to live in freedom and dignity, far from the Zionist hegemony and American arrogance, which want to turn our world into mere numbers with no value, orbiting around the American and Zionist interests. That is why we stood by the human right to refuse injustice and resist occupation, be it in Lebanon, Palestine, or anywhere else around the world. We are subjected to unfair American intimidation and threats because we did not appease or agree with the United States on the account of those people and their national and patriotic interests.
The Convention held its meeting yesterday in the presence of former MPs Uthman El-Dana, August Bachus, Mahmoud Ammar, Michel Malouli, Rafeek Shaheen, Shafeek Badr, Anwar El-Sabah, Tarek Habashi, Elias El-Khazin, Biar Dikash, and Edmond Rizk.
It is hurtful to see "the repulsive dispersion between members of the same government team, as though the various authorities are distributed among factions, each of whom is primarily concerned with ridiculing the other. Daily issues have come to be divided among speakers and counter-speakers, writers and counter-writers, statements and counter-statements."
It resumed: "Perhaps the worst experience through which Lebanese legislation is going is the lack of seriousness and stability, so that the Parliament is obliged to retreat on laws previously passed even before their ink dries, as is the case with the fundamentals of penal trials and diesel."
The declaration will be in the form of a comprehensive message to the President.
"They are also used to disturb people and harass pedestrians."
The Council also approved assignment of construction and plantation works in the Beirut Forest through public tenders; preparation of terms for assignment of digging six water wells to irrigate plants in that forest; and assignment of rehabilitation of al-Rumeil area roads by public tender.
He also stressed the "necessity of continuing the coordination between us and the Embassy of Kuwait so that we can furnish the needs of tourist Kuwaiti families, who form an essential part of the social fabric of this town."
"Filing a penal lawsuit against the general manager of the Lebanon Electricity Organization because he refused to pay the quarterly municipal dues, which is a violation of Article 97 of the Municipality Charges Law."
al-Daniya Group Under House Arrest; Normal Conditions In Ein al-Helwa Except Combat Scene; al-Daniya Group Members' Arrest Order "Evaporates!"
Several Palestinian sources indicated that particularly since Waleed Badee' Hammadi (Abu Ubaydah) was turned in, the situation has become tense, and fighting may erupt any minute. This does not mean that the fighting may erupt today or tomorrow, because anything that might happen will have certain "prices," particularly in connection with individuals accused of judiciary matters.
The actual situation inside the camp seemed normal, except for locations that witnessed confrontations.
On the other hand, no one managed to meet any officials of Usbat al-Ansar, either at their homes or offices.
A meeting held last night in al-Miqdah's house was attended by the National and Islamic Palestinian Forces Higher Committee in Sidon's camps.
"Work towards finalizing the al-Daniya case and solve it with preservation of Palestinian-Lebanese security."
A Palestinian official said to "al-Nahar," "We are waiting for the al-Daniya members issue to be dealt with. It has also been agreed to place them under house arrest, disarm them, and prevent them from making any statements to the media."
"They have hit and run already" was a phrase used by a Palestinian refugee in the Ein al-Helwa camp in Sidon yesterday to describe the situation in the camp after Tuesday's clashes between armed Islamists, members of the Fatah movement, and the Armed Resistance in the camp.
"The detained were deposited with the relevant judiciary."

"They are also used to disturb people and harass pedestrians."
Murad saluted those who resisted the Israeli invasion "and those who are continuing to do so until full liberation of occupied Arab lands is achieved."
Speeches were also delivered by Rifaat al-Nimr, Monitoring Authority Director of Independent Nassiris Movement-Murabitoon Nihad Orfalli, and Muneer al-Sayyad in the name of Arab Socialist Union-The Nassiri Organization. Finally, Murad and Eitani distributed memorial coats of armors to the martyrs' families.
Why should the average citizen's destiny remain in the hands of such people, in an age where aspirations are for building a state of law and institutions so that all Lebanese citizens are secure?
"How to prevent such devastating blazes? We suggest the following:"
"Fourth: To enforce the above, an environmental police authority must be established as soon as possible, with at least five hundred personnel assigned for observing the environmental situation all over the country."
Some citizens from the area of Harit Hereik, Abd al-Noor street near Mahal Halal, complained of an electricity generator in Ahmad Qazan residential compound sending a black smoke trail that looms over the street, polluting the air and laundry in addition to a bad smell, whenever a power failure occurs. They needed a solution to this problem.
"I plead with you, the general manager of Beirut Water Company, to follow the steps of Lebanon Electricity's general manager and give Lebanese citizens their rights, as it is a cause of both surprise and sorrow that an average employee should pay the price of a water meter, which is 800,000 liras, while his monthly salary does not exceed 450-500,000 Lebanese liras!"
Controversial possibilities are forming, regarding how the leaders of the al-Sham assembly (formed from the two states of Lebanon and Syria and run from Damascus) deal with the current situation in the region, particularly in Iraq.

- Fifty Years after the 1948 War
Palestinian national and Islamic forces in the Gaza Strip managed, after intensive and continuous efforts, to draft a political working paper-a document that specifies the strategy of Palestinian policy in the current stage. It includes the views of these factions toward Palestinian objectives and the measures required to achieve them. The document identifies current strategic objectives.
- Ending Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories occupied in 1967, including Jerusalem.
- The uprising, resistance, and all forms of political struggle that can be exercised by the people to serve their national objectives.
Had this document been approved, it could have formed an important pillar that would back the objectives of the Palestinian people in the current stage, at a time in which the Palestinian issue is under the threat of liquidation and dispersion of Palestinian resources. However, special agendas of some forces delayed the approval of this important document.
These sources added that the movement's leadership informed the High Monitoring Committee at a later time last Monday that Hamas requires the following amendments to be made to the document:
4- Decisions are to be made collectively through a unified leadership until full elections in Palestinian lands are held. This means that Hamas wants to skip the institutions of the PLO and the Palestinian Authority and to deal with them as if they do not exist in reality.
Alia-From Ramzi Musharaffa:
He thanked everyone who worked, supported, and facilitated this project.
He considered that "the grant presented by the Saudi government is an example of such initiatives, which leave decent political and moral impressions."
He said: "This project started with a discussion between two people. There was a major challenge in that the Development and Construction Council could not have completed this project on time in order to get ready for the summer high season, in which the area welcomes visitors from Lebanon, the Arab Gulf, and brothers from Arab countries."
"The Council has many ambitious projects. We are currently pursuing Arab brothers in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in particular, as well as other funding sources to execute these projects and assist Lebanon."
After the Administration's Promises to Pay Transport Allowance, the TMA Association Dismisses its General Assembly
He hoped that other organizations would implement the decree "because it is the right of workers and employees, and rights must not be ignored."
It is known that employers objected to the decree and filed several requests to the State Advisory Council. However, the advisory opinion rejected the arguments and approved the necessity of full implementation of the decree.
Rejecting the government's policy in handling the issue of living and social conditions and objecting to what it called "disrespect of laws," the General Labor Union defined its position regarding raising transport allowances and increasing scholarships, by threatening to organize demonstrations and to declare an open strike.
The Union's executive board held a session yesterday, chaired by its Director Ghassan Ghusun and attended by Union members. The session started with attendees standing for one minute to mourn the Union's former director, George Sakar.
"As the issue is a clear challenge to the law and the governmental decisions and decrees, as well as an unjust violation of the rights of laborers that has struck in the heart, the conferees can only emphasize maximum negative measures to be taken to counter that decision. These measures include a call to demonstrate and picket all the way to an open general strike, until the Transport Allowance and Education Grant decree is applied."
It also held the government responsible for not implementing the decree, and it requested the government to amend a number of provisions in the Law of Labor "to include fines against violating laws and decrees, particularly against those which are related to labor." It called on the government to apply strict measures and penalties.
It considered that the expansion of privatization will encourage monopolies and institutions that dismiss laborers. "If privatization of certain sectors is necessary, particularly independent organizations, then their services have to be performed with private-sector mentality, without transforming them into monopolies and laborer-dismissing organizations."
It called on the government to finalize the hospital debts issue "because if it remains pending, it will be reflected in citizens' health care in general and laborers' specifically."
On the occasion of completing the international al-Hazimiya-Sofer road works, funded by a Saudi grant, Naseeb al-Rayyis, President of the Contra Company which executed the project, honored the Development and Construction Council Director Jamal Abd al-Raheem Eitani at a celebration held at his house in the city of Alia. The celebration was attended by Ministers Fuad al-Saad and Bayar al-Helw; MPs Abd-Allah Farahat and Akram Shaheeb; Central Expatriates Fund Authority Director Fadi Armoun; Alia Municipality Director Wajdi Murad; Saudi Ambassador Fuad Sadik Al-Mufti; and the Embassy Chargé d'Affaires.

For that precise reason, the Arab States Regional Office assigned a number of Arab thinkers to the task of preparing the Human Development Report.
The conferees discussed the application of the committee action program with regard to the following:
- Preparation of a guidance program for agricultural producers.
- Specify the stages that can be followed in the agricultural exports development program to help agricultural exporters develop their exports for international markets.
Association Chairman Emile Juha told the Central News Agency that the strike begun in all areas last Saturday was suspended after the parliament passed the law regulating the electricity sector, and amendments were agreed upon in the meeting of the day before yesterday with the prime minister and the chairman of parliament.
This junction will allow direct connection between al-Hazimiya at the al-Sayyad roundabout and the two areas of al-Ashrafiya and al-Marfa'.
The residents of the al-Joma area and towns in the vicinity complained of almost a total cut in their water supplies during the past 15 days.
The Australian delegation reviewed the EIDAL organization's tasks and the services it provides to investors as well as available investment opportunities, particularly after the investment promotion law was issued in Lebanon.
Consequently, it was agreed to continue discussions to develop cooperation frameworks and implementation steps.

"Article 5: As a prerequisite, the Ministry of Agriculture must be informed before importing any frozen sperm of the type of sperm to be imported and their compliance with health requirements. The following must be submitted:"
"Article 6: The importing organization or farm must maintain IVF operation records and their results to enable monitoring and supervision of its operation by the Animal Production and Breeding Authority of the Animal Wealth Administration."

al-Khouli and Electricity Privatization: Laborers Union Failed to Resist and to Defend Laborers
"Their actions were limited to dismissing the dealings made by the chairman of the parliament."
He also criticized the structure and mission of the Higher Privatization Council, whose meetings are restricted to government officials without any participation by laborer and economic organization representatives, law consultants, and specialized experts.
He ended by saying, "The Laborers Union must set an essential and basic condition on privatization laws and operations, that is, keeping the ownership of public organizations in government hands during development of administration privatization."
Both of them were born in 1898. Belmondo, the Frenchman, was born in Algeria, a territory occupied by France at the time, and Moore, the Englishman, was born in Yorkshire.

In the book, Patriarch of Antioch Agnatius IV shines as a divine presence, one of the church's greatest fathers who had a sturdy patriarchal belief and ample diversification when approaching the meanings of life in the light of belief in God.
Therefore, there should have been a comprehensive language reached before, documenting poetry and the Holy Quran.
The sixth issue of the magazine of historical studies "Chronos" was released. The magazine is published by Balamand University. The magazine contains many articles, most of them written in English and French by researchers from European and American universities.
Kristin Schulze (from the London School of Economics, London) wrote "The Jews of Lebanon: History, Identity, and Memory" and Mahmoud Haddad (from Balamand University), "Umar bin al-Khattab and the Meccan Aristocracy."
Paul Belmondo had chosen the trend of traditional method that submits sculpting operations to strict acts known as classic academic rules, which are very rigid rules, where extremism reaches the rejection of boiling-up human expressions that leave a shadow on the final features of a sculptured work.
In his themes, there is realism that accepts no deviation or distraction, where minutely structured balances control the movement of his treatment to the rhythm of shapes and the masses of shaping on a sculptural level.
The role of the previous design to sculpture figure or some of its parts surpasses the solutions for the merging of the mass size and clarifying the prominent characteristics and creating items for unexpected difficulties to make the work of art, to secure its pouring in natural mildness that formulates its human identity to appear superior to its similar origin, as if it is the imitation/the work and origin at the same time.
Some say that the celebration of the French cities during 2002 of the sculptor Paul Belmondo is the strong cultural, human, and effective existence of his son, the star Jean Paul Belmondo, who defines himself as the first admirer of his father's works, where in his house there are main models of such.
Twenty-five years ago when the Lebanese war erupted, there were no televisions or FM stations.
Active media organization was limited to a very small number of newspapers, like "al-Nahar" newspaper and "al-Hawadith" magazine.
So, it settled in London and Paris.
And yesterday, Association Director Milham Karam was re-elected.
It is as though "the free word and Lebanon are twins."
It has no role.
"Shahrayar" does not want a free media and does not believe in it because it reports the truth.
He hates give and take.
That is how Lebanon TV was dismantled and the National Agency was struck, with all its members scattered under the slogan of development and advancement.
Claims against them today are not surprising.
Anyone who seeks concealment comes in the dark, far from the eyes of surveillance.
Otherwise, would it be considered a dissenter?
So he said his word and proceeded.

In cooperation with the Ministry of Environment, the American University in Beirut (AUB), and the Mediterranean Center for Preserved Areas, MIDEST started a project 12 months ago to establish a preserve for turtle hatching.
Teema Majdilani, the MIDEST volunteer journalist, says that this place was known before the Lebanese civil war in 1975 as the "Gulf of Turtle" and was saved by "divine care."
Teema is still touched by the egg-laying scene she saw in May.
"The turtles escape noise and light. They never lay eggs when the moon is full."
In spite of enthusiasm by the area's residents for the project, hoping to promote environmental tourism in their area, the Ministry of Tourism has not yet declared the site as preserved.

Lebanon is a microcosm of the Middle East, in the sense that it attracts all religious groups that exist in the region.
Likewise, it is impossible to talk about the Middle East in isolation of the new effects of globalization on this part of the world.
On an invitation from the Saint Ejido Society, the Fifteenth International Conference for Dialog of Religions and Civilizations was held in Palermo, Sicily, on September 1-4. This year's conference carried the theme "Religions and Civilizations: Between Conflict and Dialog" and was attended by more than 4000 people coming from various parts of the world. Among the attendees were various official and religious delegations, including 250 figures representing different religions and civilizations of today's world.
He was very intelligent and prominent among his schoolmates. He mentioned in his "Confessions" book how pupils were treated at that time and how obedience to teachers was necessary and compulsory. A pupil who neglected that would be treated cruelly at school as well as at home. He admitted that he also got his share, because of his disobedience and his occasional refusal to conform to rules.

It might not be possible to talk about the Middle East without talking about Lebanon, and it would also be impossible to talk about Lebanon without talking about the Middle East.
This special nature is what made Pope John Paul II describe Lebanon as being "more than a state; it is a mission."
The Arab conflict is with Israel, but Arab negotiation is done with the U.S.
They decided to publish the output of their discussion next autumn in their different countries in Arabic and French under the title, "How can the believers of today face the challenge of announcing their faith and making it deep-rooted in their daily life, especially when they are living in a world of diversity and multiplicity?"
"If dialog is a religious and moral duty, it is also an adventure, in the sense that it takes place in history, which means that it is subject to human desires, which usually tend to restrict freedom, justice, and peace."
"Based on our understanding, we were directly and tangibly concerned with various questions and anxieties raised by people's experiences in different locations and fields. Among those, for example, are:"
"4- How can we work together to humanize politics and economy, in order to overcome the 'political' crisis and to rehabilitate the spiritual and moral dimensions of human life?"
"1- Every one of us must work among his own group toward confronting the process of using religion as a legitimate justification for violence and injustice."
"5- We must work together to defy the international arms trade, nuclear weapons, and WMDs. We must work to achieve true balance among peoples in the universe, and between them and nature in order to preserve the future of human life on this earth."
On an invitation from the Saint Ejido Society, the Fifteenth International Conference for Dialog of Religions and Civilizations was held in Palermo, Sicily, on September 1-4. This year's conference carried the theme "Religions and Civilizations: Between Conflict and Dialog" and was attended by more than 4000 people coming from various parts of the world. Among the attendees were various official and religious delegations including 250 figures representing different religions and civilizations of today's world.
The most outstanding session was titled "After September 11: Is the Clash of Civilizations Inevitable?" in which Ghassan Tweini, former French Minister Bernard Coshnere, the Director of the Peace Institution at Washington Reverend David Smoke, Cardinal Diyar Moyde Martin from the Vatican, editor-in-chief of the Italian newspaper "La Stampa" Gianni Riota, and Turkish Islamic thinker Muhammad Aydeen participated.
Society Director Dr. Andrea Ricardi had mentioned Lebanon in his keynote speech in the conference's opening session, commending its dialog experience and the participating delegation that reflects this experience and represents its variety and unity.
The "Religions and Schools" page considers the conference to be a major event in terms of its topics, representation, and participants. I would like to present to you the contributions of Bishop Ghufrael Salibi and Muhammad al-Sammak.
The Saudi News Agency (WAS) reported that Khatami was also welcomed by Saudi Cabinet Second Deputy, Minister of Defense and Air Force, and the Saudi Inspector General Prince Sultan ibn Abd al-Aziz.
He also added that the two leaders will "discuss bilateral relations as well."
Talks may also include oil issues before the OPEC meeting scheduled in a week's time.
He said that "the behavior of the suppressive U.S. regime is driving the Middle East towards blood and chaos."
They reported that the new al-Fatih A-110, a 200-kilometer range land-to-land missile, has been tested. The leaders confirmed that the test was successful.
He said, "I came to tell the Iraqi people that the American people are concerned about their suffering."

For that reason in particular, the Arab States Regional Office assigned to a selection of Arab thinkers the task of preparing the Human Development Report.
He said in a statement, "The continuous and immediate threat of more attacks on the United States" justifies the extension of the state of emergency for another year.
He condemned "that disgraceful criminal act," stressing his country's "resolve and determination to stand by the international alliance against all forms of terrorism."
He expressed a view that "such challenges result only in deepening the relations between the two countries and increasing their common will to stand against everyone who bears malice and evil against them."
The plan will be presented to the decision-making authorities in the African Union before being implemented.
UN-Reuters-Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan pledged before the U.N. General Assembly that his country will never allow the independence of Taiwan, saying that it could endanger peace and stability in the Asia and Pacific region.
"The great work related to reuniting China will definitely be completed."
In an Historic Meeting in Copenhagen, Ashcroft and European Ministers of Justice Confirm Cooperation in the War against Terrorism
were affiliated with a terror cell based in the German city of Hamburg.
However, Schily said that the war against terror is being waged at several levels and includes protective measures.
Germany confirmed that it will not provide the U.S. with information related to Zakaria Moussaoui, who is being detained in the U.S. for plotting the September 11 attacks, if such information leads to sentencing him to death.
Three Days Before Kuizomi's Visit to North Korea Kim Chong-il Confirms His Wish to Establish Relations with Japan
It said, "The issue of relations between North Korea and Japan (...) remains unresolved." However, it added that "the time has come to change that situation."
There are no diplomatic relations between Japan and North Korea.
It said that if any progress is achieved toward a settlement, then Kuizomi might agree to establish diplomatic relations with North Korea.
According to an agreement made last August, the two Koreas agreed to start working on constructing the railways and road network as of Wednesday in the western and eastern sectors of the borders.
Perez Urges American Strike Against Iraq; Moscow and Beijing Encourage U.N. Settlement; Moscow, Beijing, Cairo, and Kuwait
However, Perez clarified Israel's option within statements related to the American war against terror after the September 11 attacks.
He did not say whether he believed that the Bush administration has made a decision regarding the use of force against Iraq.
Ivanov said, "Experience proves that international crises and conflicts, regardless of their complexity, can be solved with the help of United Nations instruments and on the basis of international law."
Egyptian and Kuwaiti Foreign Ministers Ahmad Maher and Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah reiterated their "objection" to potential American strikes against Iraq and hoped a diplomatic solution for the crisis can be reached.
He said that "a war will increase the suffering of our brothers, the Iraqi people, and will escalate tension and instability in the region."
The return to "international legitimacy" is not an absolute return. It is conditional.  The U.N. Security Council should join the U.S. option, which springs from the removal of WMDs supposedly possessed by Iraq, and proceeds to "active" efforts to change the current regime.
In other words, he would be extremely mistaken if he believes that the Iraq of today can rely on an absolute European objection and a tangible and effective Arab objection if he goes too far with the "abyss edge" policy.
And then there is an essential point related to the Arab world.
As such, we can say that we are moving toward issuing a resolution from the Security Council containing three items:
In case of noncompliance, the Security Council is to address a short time-limited warning to comply. In case it does not, all means to enforce Security Council resolutions will be available.
The information indicates a suggestion of a "peaceful solution" to dissolve Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's regime by his leaving Baghdad with a number of his close associates to an optional exile in an Arab state (Cairo, perhaps) with full guarantees of security and sufficient financial resources to secure an extremely comfortable "retirement," without enabling him to possess financial capabilities sufficient to fund any security or political activity against the regime that would succeed his regime.
As to the "brothers," an observer can risk saying that they are seeking nothing from all this but to save their image or a share of post-Saddam Iraq! This is very well understood by the Americans and the Europeans, and they do not hide their smiles when we, the Arabs, talk about an Arab refusal!
It seems a week after closing the station, the authority's stiffness in dealing with the case and its political consequences is lessening.
Full recognition of the judiciary's authority in its new decision in the MTV issue also means recognizing the decision it will take within the coming weeks, and which likely will be positive, although it comes late. This will also mean that the problem started in court and will end there.
Although the decision of the Meeting to discontinue the dialog was a reaction to closing the station and other actions taken by the authority or parties closely associated with it, the direct and indirect communications held with Meeting members clarified the erroneous supposition of discontinuing that dialog. They also showed, and perhaps the important supposition lies here, that any dealing with the MTV
For it is extremely clear that Syria and other Lebanese officials unhesitatingly submit to the authority of the President and to his exclusive influence on finding required solutions for difficult issues.
This matter also indicates, in the view of the highly informed official sources, that the authority today finds itself able to control the street with no illusions, and is able at the same time to paralyze opposition activities in mobilizing that same street, which until only a few days ago was witnessing heavy army and security deployment. It was a clear sign that army and security forces were instructed to act if necessary.
From Wazzani to Baghdad!; Rajih Al-Khuri
Because the first decision taken by the Arab Summit in 1964 to divert the tributaries of Jordan River made Lebanon prepare to divert the Wazzani spring, which is one of the tributaries of the Hasibani River that travels 20 kilometers in Lebanese lands before flowing into Lake Tabariya, which represents Israel's major water reservoir.
It was said that there were tunnels under the Shaqeef Arnon castle constructed by the enemy under the river to steal its waters and that they still exist. Likewise, the waters of al-Hasibani and al-Wazzani were also stolen.
The newspaper explained that there is a strict demand from the U.S. to withdraw the water issue in South Lebanon from negotiations because it "could lead to undesired tensions in the light of current circumstances."
It is too early for such an assumption. Lebanon must continue its protective measures.
Isolating Ghrelin Hormone is the Key to Controlling Human Body Weight
Type 2 diabetes affects more than 150 million people around the world.
According to the researchers, Leptin activates an enzyme known to burn excessive fats, to increase the cell absorption rate of sugar from blood, and to prevent fat and cholesterol from developing inside the liver.
That is why obesity and diabetes have prevailed, and that is also why there is a need to develop new types of medication to reinforce the inadequate natural control mechanisms.
In the following four hours, the volunteers were injected with a saline solution or a specific dose of Ghrelin. Then they were allowed to eat as much as they pleased for the rest of the day, while carefully observing the calorie rate represented in the food.
Ghrelin is produced in the inner cells of the stomach lining.
However, developing a means to stop the effects of Ghrelin in order to reduce appetite and treat obesity will require more time.

Meanwhile, Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri confirmed that the summit will be held as scheduled and that any possible attack against Iraq will not take place before weeks, describing the situation in the region as "very sensitive and difficult."
U.S. President George Bush emphasized that Iraq's violations of Security Council resolutions have become intolerable. He urged the international organization to show "some strictness" in confronting Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, explaining that the United States is ready to act whether there is international support or not.
The ruling National Party of Egypt is to hold its eighth conference today, amid curiosity among political circles whether the party is to renew and develop its cadres and ideology to cope with rapid changes, especially since its old guard holds views different from those of the "newcomer" members, according to analysts.
In addition, security forces killed four armed Islamists on Thursday and Friday in Tizi Ozo, Bum Merdas, and al-Boyra.
The Eighth Conference of the Egyptian Ruling National Party Starts Today; Jamal Mubarak is to be the "Strong Man" in the Duel Between Newcomers and the Old Guard
He added that this "situation will grant the strong man Jamal Mubarak a position within the party."
However, Deputy Director of al-Ahram Strategic Studies Center, Waheed Abd al-Majeed, said, "I do not believe that party renewal or development is possible, because development views do not exist."
He said, "Except for the conference that was held after the assassination of the late President Anwar al-Sadat, in which President Mubarak was elected to succeed al-Sadat, the past six conferences were held without anyone's notice."
"Al-Ahram newspaper considered that the purpose of the development process is development of ideas and philosophies, but some observers focused solely on one aspect: changing individuals or some officials, despite the vast difference between the two things."
He recalled the experience "led by King Faud in the 1930s when the People's Party was established, and the experience of former Prime Minister Ismail Sidqi (during the monarchy), who was surrounded by opportunists and pursuers of interests, then the experience of the late President Anwar al-Sadat with the Misr Party, which collapsed once Sadat abandoned it."
Christians Celebrate the Anniversary of the Exaltation of the Cross and Pray for "Prosperous Days with Many Crosses"
Patriarch Sfeir blessed the water.
"thus after Christ and with him the road of the Cross has become the road to salvation, sainthood, glory and eternal happiness (...)"
"But worshiping is not enough if it is not associated with deeds that show we want to work, God willing, to bear the Cross with Jesus Christ and similarly contribute in the redemption for the love of Christ and the people, all the people, taking Christ as our example (...)"
"Let's ask Christ on the anniversary of the Exaltation of his Cross to give us the courage to bear the Cross in these days, to us, full of Crosses, and take him as an example, like Paul the Apostle who said, 'We call for crucified Christ.'"

Minister of Immigration Marawan Hamada stressed the "necessity of reinforcing  internal national unity, conserving our distinguished relations with Syria, and preserving the impregnable peace among our people as a weapon to confront Israel, who is embarrassed by this unique model of co-existence in spite of all the rabble-rousing and conspiracies."
Then Hamada delivered a speech in which he hoped "that the dispensary will contribute to bringing about the National Organization's intention to provide assistance and health care to everyone who needs it," considering that "the poverty in our areas urges us to work closely and try to neglect our personal interests and desires for the sake of public interest. Accordingly, we succeed in our battle to win our country's development, which we consider to be a fundamental prerequisite and an element of reinforcing its economic and social stability."

He expressed a view that the "al-Shouf al-A'la area, which is considered one of the most prominent areas to witness resolution of the return issue in its numerous villages and towns, has a strong relation at the same level of importance with the tourism and environmental issues. It is an inevitable relation, the importance of which was realized at an early stage by Mr. Waleed Junbulat, who was keen on providing this area with exceptional care, even amid the events and the anarchy phase, as that results in preserving a cultural value that must remain and must be protected."
The celebration included several speeches, the most important of which was by Dr. Jafar Fadl-Allah on the database and Dr. Jack Sammouri on the initial plan for suggested tourism tours.
Cardinal George will begin his rally today from the Maronite Diocese, visiting the Mukhtara Palace before reaching al-Fawwara, where a morning meeting will be held with Cardinal George, Patriarch Khuri, and a number of figures. Al-Fawwara Municipality Director Yusif Elia and members of the municipal council will also attend the meeting.

Administrative Development Seminar on Modern Management; Al-Saad: Some Practices Hinder the Public Sector; Al-Saad, Reno
European Union Ambassador Patrick Reno and Central Inspection Director Fuad Hedmos attended the two-day seminar.
"The changes we mean are not meant to be only technological"
He stressed, "The Lebanese administrative sector has suffered two decades of isolation because of the civil war. Otherwise, development should have moved gradually and normally. The effects of isolation are still aching, and some just do not have the ability to overcome them. However, we do not want this to be a justification for surrendering, because life must go on."

"Reform is the process of reviewing all concepts that form Lebanese administration." (...)
Following is the text of the memorandum submitted by Lebanon to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan regarding the Israeli threats to Lebanon on the issue of al-Wazzani waters:
"The al-Wazzani River, which is one of the tributaries of the al-Hasibani River, rises in the Lebanese territories and flows into the al-Hasibani River inside Lebanese territory."
"What Lebanese authorities are currently doing is extending pipelines that carry  water to villages in the valleys of the al-Hasibani and al-Wazzani Rivers. The maximum amount expected to be pumped is 9 million cubic meters annually, which is much less than Lebanon's legitimate rights."
"Lebanon urges the permanent member states of the United Nations Security Council to take every possible action to prevent Israel from carrying out its threats, which will have the gravest consequences on the entire region."
"Al-Diyar" newspaper's editorial staff released the following statement: "Publication of 'al-Diyar' will be resumed as of Tuesday morning, 9/17/2002, after having suspended publication for three days in protest against the complete closure of the MTV station without prior notice."
In an interview with the Central News Agency, he revealed that "most television and radio services have paid approximately 60% of the charges required from them to the Ministry of Information. Most television services have also paid satellite transmission charges to the Ministry of Information after correcting the error in calculating the amount and terms of payment," indicating that "organizations that have not paid the required charges will bear the responsibility, because such refusal is not what we agreed on with media organizations. We insisted that everybody should pay, even if within their current abilities, to prove their compliance with the decision issued by the cabinet, and in response to their wish to request the cabinet that they pay the amounts in installments."
"Some media services paid the required charges, the licensing and first-year fees, years ago and did not keep their receipts."
"All these facts will be presented to the cabinet, which will take the appropriate actions."

Jubran Tuweini in a Radio Interview: Satellite Configurations Were Meant to Confuse the MTV case
Tuweini's statements were made in a contribution to Free Lebanon Radio's program "On Your Responsibility," which is presented by colleague Matilda Faraj Allah.
With regards to Qirnat al-Shahwan discontinuing the dialog with the President, Tuweini explained, "There is a difference between the Qirnat Shawan decision of stopping the dialog with the President and defining a situation on the basis of some matters that are refuted by the statement, with the outcome making it sound as though the dialog has become futile, and that is what we wanted to say."
"If anyone analyzes the situation in Lebanon since 1990 and makes a simple calculation for this period, he will find that the rulers have a problem in running this country."
"the Meeting considered that it is necessary to meet again with Patriarch Sufair  to consult him and review his new ideas regarding the subject."
But what would the case be if the directors of major companies are forced to adopt different forms of truth?
"Fortunately, the 'Federal Collusion Gang' answers all our requests positively nowadays."
"On the other hand, comedy and drama series continue to greatly depend on sex scenes to attract a greater audience (they are accompanied by advertising of the same style)."
"Additionally, we have included new talents among our team. They are talents with ideal loyalty to our organizational model."
"between dull old songs and current pop music to help listeners dissipate their pathetic, consuming energy."
"Speaking of cigarettes, our magazine team is now doing better work, as they are reducing articles related to smoking and health."
"Our search engine section also received huge bribes, all of which are totally legitimate, to support the owners of sites who prefer to occupy some position among the top ten sites list, rather than the 247th position."
"As to the media service staff working for our company, they include a reasonable number of employees committed to the principles of free press, decent expression, and public service."
Let us imagine that the executive manager of a pioneering media organization felt that he must speak frankly about all the activities carried out by his organization.
"We now possess at least six radio stations and two television stations in some metropolitan areas."
In fact, with the dawn of almost every day we hear about a new emergency situation: a plane or helicopter has crashed, a residential building or store has burned, very dangerous criminals have escaped from prison, armed soldiers have deserted (often after killing a number of their colleagues or their commander), a gang has been arrested with a number of members from the police, trained dogs have bitten their owner's neighbor or an unfortunate passerby to death, or a new lunatic murderer has emerged from among the psychopaths who are wandering the streets freely!

Zionism in a Hundred Years
But saying that the West and the entire world bear nothing but hatred and conspiracy for Arabs and Muslims only contributes to deepening others' phobias of Arab and Muslim societies. It also dismisses anyone who makes such a claim from the set of sensible humans.
The National Socialist Front,
Therefore, the National Socialist Front declares that the existing authorities are swerving Lebanese rule toward absolute autocratic dictatorship, as well as being extensively reckless of the people's will and interests. It is also moving further away from the contemplated path of reform in order to buy time. This leaves the opposition no choice but to consider all negotiations related to participation in the rule, at the time being, a waste on its part of its strength, a concession from it of the people's basic demands, and a retreat from the position it is assuming with the people against the corrupters who can neither carry out reform nor even participate in it.
But saying that the West and the entire world bear nothing but hatred and conspiracy for Arabs and Muslims only contributes to deepening others' fear of Arab and Muslim societies. It also dismisses anyone who makes such a claim from the society of sensible humans.
It even seems that the continuous dwelling of those people on the image issue only ends in saying that they are distorting our image rather than saying that our image is distorted.
Even if it is true that some people are distorting our image, it is also true that we often cost them no more than a faithful and literal translation of our articles, talks, and statements that fill our newspapers, screens, and books to accomplish their goals. It even seems that corrupting the text is the last thing they would need to go to.
It is more worthy of someone who had had his image distorted not to frown in front of the photographer, let alone comply with the pose required by an ill-willed photographer!
The Spanish artist Pablo Picasso was born in Malaga in 1881 and died in Mougins in 1973.
Picasso started dissembling the elements of his portraits to levels instead of sizes, for example "Violin and Guitar" (1913), and he merged raw materials such as cloth and pasted papers in the portrait "Still Life with Fruit and Violins" (1913).
He settled in Southern France in 1948, and his production there was abundant and variant.
Note: There are museums for Picasso in Paris, Antibes, and Barcelona.
Matisse is considered the pioneer of the "Fauvism" (wildness) (1905-1908).
Matisse settled in Southern France in 1917, and his quite ornamental portraits developed into purity and tranquility.
High-quality musical instruments have an effective role in presenting the musician's value and the depth of his mission.

From the "Morning Psalms" by George Kallas
Give me time to take off my body on the thresholds of Your mercy,
Why are there invocations?
Why is there life?
God, approach my Hour of Resurrection and adjust the sky pointers to the
or no night strike can kill! It is warmed by Your blessing and grown under Your glory
O God, bring Your satisfaction upon me and let me be Your partner in Your Kingdom, O Merciful.
O God, I entrusted You my secrets, and gave You my pen so you could sign me with Your judgment, or grant me forgiveness for sins I have been through, and sins I did not realize, and never thought to be entertained with them being forbidden, the day when I was in my soil, down under.
Let me share Your heavenly lights and joys, so I do not lose both: You and my heart bearing my remaining love!
And as You have shaped me from Your own soil, and formed me according to Your own image, here I am a small god, very small! A god serving his God to honor Your picture in me.

He sat on his usual chair in front of the TV, drinking his coffee mixed with the taste of bloodshed in Palestine and the world.
He had often blamed her for not sharing with him his morning coffee, preferring useless books that have no clues.
Then she came back again.
He is inspecting his car from inside and the outside, as though he was seeing it for the first and last time.
The trip looked like a short visit to a holy shrine or a Montessori filling the neighborhood with sad hymns and the footsteps of an old nun on whose eyes time has greatly worn.
They were racing against time.
She said to herself, "Why did he call me from that far distance for just one fig?"
His heart was bleeding with tears. Why is it that life reaches its closing stages, and one has nothing but long travel, exile, and some memories?
They went very far. As to Riyad, he was moving away lonely, among the leaves of figs and boxthorn, between the yellow broom and the scent of the sky.
He didn't say a word.
Alone, she went back home.
She did not weep.
The Islamic Pakistani League Party, which has strong ties to President Pervez Musharaf, expressed willingness to ally itself with Pakistani fundamentalist parties that won the recent parliamentary elections, in order to form a new coalition government.
The Front won 45 seats and controlled the regional national assembly in the northwestern province, which borders Afghanistan.
The rebels told the International Radio of France that they achieved a massive victory by seizing Daloa, which is known for cultivating cocoa. All cocoa shipments to Abidjan have to pass through Daloa to be prepared for export. They also confirmed that they are now in a position allowing them to march toward Abidjan.

He said that it is time to suggest political solutions for the Palestinians' problems.
Ukraine authorities denied the sale. Presidential Office Manager Victor Medfidcoc stated that Kiev "is extremely concerned with the accusations and will provide everything to help the investigations."
A source in the British embassy announced the participation of British forces in exercises that will be held in the Jordanian desert.
For the fourth time in three years, efforts to maintain a Catholic-Protestant administration in Northern Ireland have been dealt a severe blow with the announcement made by the British minister in charge of Northern Ireland affairs, John Reed, that London has decided to suspend indefinitely the activities of the two semi-independent bodies in the British region, namely the parliament and the government, as of midnight Monday (23:00 GMT). This comes after a disagreement on I.R.A. espionage operations caused the peace process to witness the worst crisis since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.
Although this is the fourth time that London suspended the functions of the two semi-independent bodies in the region, the general feeling among a large sector of people is that the return of Catholics and Protestants to work together once again will take longer this time.
Northern Ireland's Prime Minister David Tremble, the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, had accused the I.R.A. of repeatedly breaching the cease fire.

Daloa also has a significance for morale. It is the stronghold of the Bit tribe, to which President Gbagbo belongs.
Some cocoa dealers expressed anxiety over stopping export operations from Cote d'Ivoire, which could lead to further price increases.
In the first interview with press since the start of the mutiny, Gbagbo told the French newspaper "Le Monde" that he feels that demobilized soldiers are betraying him, considering that he did his best since he assumed office to avoid "such events."
He admitted that he was obliged to dismiss Minister of Defense Moyez Lida Kuasi in response to rebels' demands because "someone had to be sacrificed."
Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa stated yesterday upon leaving Doha that "not a single Arab soldier will participate" in any possible American attack on Iraq.
He mentioned, "The Security Council has not yet reached an agreement regarding the return of the inspectors." He expressed his belief that "had Iraq not accepted the return of inspectors, the Council would have made a decision to use force against it."
In Kuwait, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Muhammad Sabah al-Salem considered that Iraq's noncompliance with international resolutions has resulted in  the current crisis that hit the region.
In Cairo, tens of American University professors and students demonstrated against the U.S. policy in the region, demanding that it not attack Iraq.

After two sessions, one of which was confidential, the Yemeni president confirmed that the Sana'a summit "is not dedicated to imposing isolation on Eritrea."
Hundreds of Somalis from different affiliations, warlords, and cultured people will meet beginning today in Eldoret, northwest Kenya, as part of a new peace conference, which would be the sixteenth since civil war erupted.
"Second, alliances against Ethiopia and Djibouti inside Somalia have faded away."
The program for resuming talks provided a temporary halt to military operations throughout yesterday. The civil war in Sudan erupted in 1983 and until the present has resulted in the killing of two million people.
A Shrill Francophone Voice
However, the summit will remain in the dictionary of international politics a unique occasion for the voice of reason against madness. It is also the summit of logic against rashness, the summit of adherence to international laws against the one magnet world, and the summit preserving the values of justice, participation, and responsibility at the edge of exclusivity that imposes upon all others the principle of voluntary or involuntary affiliation with the "Empire."
To elaborate further, the summit is being held at the crossroads of a new American strategy that does not only attempt to sketch a new world, but also very nearly to  announce that it wants that world annexed to it as an obedient ally, a subdued enemy, or a mercenary carrying out orders.
That is the slogan that opens the door to the establishment of the "American Empire."
Undoubtedly, the Francophone states group's voice will rise from Beirut in parallel with the Arab States group's voice to call for giving international legitimacy, through the inspection team, the right to handle the issue of Iraqi arms, and for urging a return to negotiations to find a solution for the Palestinian issue in such a way as to stop Ariel Sharon's continuous investment of America beating on the drums of war against "terrorism" to the benefit of the open massacre he is carrying out against the Palestinians... and against the American interests in the region!
"Haaretz" wrote, "President Bush will tell Sharon at their meeting in the White House that the U.S. administration expects Israel to act with maximum self-control in case Iraq attacks it."
It added, "Bush and the U.S. administration officials will present to their Israeli counterparts the American plan to face a possible Iraqi threat. The plan aims at aborting any attempt to launch land-land missiles from western Iraq toward Israel."
Senior security sources mentioned that if Israel decides to respond to an Iraqi attack, it will have to arrange with the United States to establish a route for its aircraft.
R.H.
The prominent and remarkable success he achieved on that front cannot be denied, at least for the time being.
He fought a fierce internal political battle to carry out important changes in the economic approach and in the nature of the general budget, in order to comply with a number of conditions, or rather requirements, requested by concerned international bodies and donor states that see that implementing such measures is necessary to qualify Lebanon to get aid.
It seems that he succeeded in doing so, at least for the time being.
Does this mean that the road to Paris 2 has now become totally free of obstacles?
This could confuse the entire region and world and would preoccupy the large countries, whether they approve the strike in the Security Council or continue to oppose it.
However, very few of them think that the start of the war shortly after elections is not a remote possibility.
Second, because war in winter can be trouble, although climate is no longer a major factor as in the past because of technological advancements.
This could be true.
History will record that the Francophone group's member states held in Lebanon the most important summit in its history.
Perhaps from this perspective the summit must be viewed as a historical event that surpasses its representation as a cultural and intellectual parade to its indication as a voice of reason screaming advice and warning of slipping toward wildness or barbarity of international relations.
The summit that brought together 51 states, which are one-fourth of the U.N.'s member states, presents a discourse that is the reverse of or disparate to that of the United States.
The issue here goes beyond the American administration's decision to attack Iraq, occupy it, and administer it as past week's news suggested, in order to subjugate the region that extends from North Africa to the depth of the Arab Gulf, including Lebanon and Syria.
But Americans are not good at French!
Part of the statement, which bore the signature of "your brother Usama bin Laden" and was published by two sites, one of which belongs to... The Islamic Studies and Research Center that is generally used by al-Qaeda to pass his messages, read: "We congratulate our Muslim nation for the heroic and audacious jihad operations carried out by its righteous mujahideen sons in Yemen against the crusader oil tanker and in Yemen against the American invasion and occupation forces."
It emphasized, "The simultaneous attacks against an important military target like the U.S. marines forces in Kuwait and the hitting of an economic target like the French oil tanker in Yemen (...) is a clear and strong message to all enemies and friends alike that the mujahideen have not been discouraged, weakened, or subdued by the difficulties they suffered for the sake of Allah (GOD)."
It concluded, "The U.S. administration is now trying to cover its failure in Afghanistan by working toward distracting attention away from that failure by beating the drums of war against Iraq."
A statement by the U.S. embassy in Kuwait read, "Gunshots were fired today (Monday) from two unknown civilian cars at U.S. military units near an exercise area in northern Kuwait."
Kuwaiti Minister of Defense Sheikh Jaber Mubarak al-Sabah stated that it is too early to judge whether the firing was a terrorist attack.
A Marine was killed and another was wounded in Tuesday's attack on U.S. forces conducting maneuvers on the Kuwaiti island of Failaka. The attack was carried out by two Kuwaitis, Anas Ahmad Ibrahim al-Kandari (21 years old) and Jassem Hamad Mubarak al-Hajiri (26 years old). They were shot to death by U.S. forces.
Last week in Kuwait, 15 Kuwaitis were arrested in connection with the Failaka attack and were put before prosecution.
The Saudi government had recently expressed concern over the security of the oil-rich Gulf area after detaining a cell in Kuwait having direct relations with al-Qaeda.
Preparatory meetings for the Francophone heads of states and governments summit were launched yesterday with the opening of the 45th session of the Francophone Permanent Council, which is comprised of representatives of the heads of states.
He explained the issues discussed in the Francophone Permanent Council meeting, as follows:
"Several states considered that the problem is extremely serious as it affects the entire northeastern region of Africa."
Salama continued, saying that all issues that were discussed in this meeting, and others, will also be discussed in the ministerial meetings due to be held today and tomorrow.
He reconfirmed that he will not nominate himself as a candidate for a second term as Francophone Secretary-General.
"Only 7 of the 26 Swiss cantons adopted French as an official language."
The Expatriate University-French Branch called on the Francophone summit to "activate the title of dialogue of civilizations and to consider the multiplicity of Lebanon, which has proven to be a unique environment for co-existence between Christianity and Islam. Accordingly, helping it recover its sovereignty and assisting the Lebanese people in acheiving the right of self-determination will result in launching actual dialog among cultures."
"First: Lebanon is a state occupied by the Syrian army since 1976. We live under an undeclared state of emergency. The democratic system was replaced with an arbitrary totalitarian system that has become well known, as it has been the subject of numerous writings regarding the tragic situation in Lebanon."
"The European Union and Danish representatives have protested repeatedly over the past weeks against such practices, as did the French Foreign Ministry."
"The will of 18 sects in Lebanon to co-exist and this unique examination that the Lebanese people passed successfully a long time before Syrian intervention started, must be the answer to many questions in the troubled Middle East region. To emphasize this unique situation, we call on you to examine the suffering of the Lebanese people and to meet its true leaders. (...)"
In the party's political office and central council meeting, Baqradawani said, "Pumping Al-Wazzani water on October 16, 2002, will represent the day of land and human development."
He indicated, "The presence of Ariel Sharon in Washington, of French President Jacques Chirac in Lebanon, and the holding of the Francophonic Summit in Beirut are all factors representing diplomatic obstacles that make us dismiss the possibility of any rash Israeli military action on the day Al-Wazzani water pumping is launched."
"Such messages were represented recently in the French oil tanker explosion in Yemen, the killing of an American soldier in Kuwait, and the shocking explosion on the Indonesian island of Bali-a resort full of western and Australian tourists."
Finally, he said, "From that perspective, the role of the eastern Christians seems immense and important in preventing the world from falling into a new religious rift. Therefore, the Phalange Party declares its intention to convene a regional conference that will host representatives of Arab Christians from the Arab world that aims at opposing the war on Iraq and defending Arab rights."
Paris-"Al-Nahar":
"On October 13, 1990, the oppressors thought they had wiped out Lebanon. They thought they destroyed the homeland, which we had vowed to liberate with our blood, which is what we are still holding on to and crying out for."
"If people vowed to live freely,"
"His Eminence and Beatitude Patriarch Mar Nasralla Boutros Sfair is sending you his blessings and is calling down upon you the blessings and intercession of Notre-Dame du Liban for faith, hope, and love to unify us and to inspire in us the greater good in every thought, word, and deed."
President Emil Lahud received MP Michel al-Mur yesterday morning and reviewed with him local and regional developments.
They sent with him messages of respect and appreciation to Lebanese officials and President Lahud.
Lahud also heard from Minister of Youth and Sports Siboh Hoffnanian, about the latest preparations related to nominating Lebanon for the 2009 Francophone Games, which will finally be decided next year.
Lahud also reviewed with Army Commander General Michel Sulayman the security situation in the country and the state of affairs of the military institution.
Lahud: As We Managed to Liberate 17 Million Meters of Land We Will Succeed in Combating Thirst; Rod-Larsen on a Surprise Visit to Beirut: Discussion over Water; I Will Return Next Week
Upon receiving Rod-Larsen before noon in Ba'abda Palace, he said, "The report that Lebanon has sent to the U.N. contains facts that prove the Lebanese right, on one hand, and specifies Lebanon's needs for water, particularly that flowing from al-Wazzani spring."
"We discussed general issues related to developments in the Middle East, with particular emphasis on those related to the situation in Lebanon."
At eleven o'clock, Rod-Larsen visited Prime Minister Rafeek al-Hareeri in the Government House.
"We also discussed the situation in Lebanon, particularly the difficult living situation because of the water issue in the South."
After the meeting he said, "We talked about the difficult situation in the Middle East in general, and in Lebanon in particular, especially the difficult living situation in the South, and the issue of water, pump building, and pipelines."
"Tonight I will return to Israel, and I am planning to return to Beirut next week to continue discussions over this issue, about which I will give no details at the present time."
In an interview with the Kuwaiti newspaper "al-Anba'a," he said, "I understand the U.S. President's justification for a war against Iraq."
With regard to the dangers of the expected war, Berri said, "What is more dangerous than starting the war is the unprecedented approach of changing a regime by foreign military force."
And with regard to the Palestinian presence in Lebanon and the possibilities of settlement, he said, "We are committed to the sanctity of the Palestinian issue, which is above all an issue of land only."
He mentioned that the French president "knows all the facts about the problem of al-Wazzani spring water and also knows that the issue of drawing the water is one of Lebanon's rights," explaining that "Lebanon accepts that the final judgment in this regard is up to international law."
Later, he met with Parliament Vice-Chairman Eli al-Farazli.
This is particularly true with regard to Iraq and the possible consequences of the United States' attempt to overthrow President Saddam Hussein and his leadership.
However, highly informed sources focused on the importance of the issues on the agenda of the Lebanese-French summit talks, which are:
This is what he told Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres last week and Minister of Defense Benjamin Ben-Eliezir yesterday when he received them in the Elysée Palace.
Among the information received from Paris is that Chirac is interested in providing assurance that Israel will not attempt any attack against al-Wazzani, not only during the launch but particularly if a massive raid is launched against Iraq, and to prevent Israel from taking advantage of that to attack Lebanon.
They noted that the swift and sudden visit made by U.N. Middle East Peace Process Coordinator Terry Rod-Larsen to Beirut was aimed at giving advice for reduction of psychological pressure and to have the launch celebration tomorrow without any Israeli provocation.
In much the same way that he engineered the blue line following Israel's withdrawal in May 2000, he will also engineer the waterline between the two states.
The Federation held a press conference in the Martinez-Beirut hotel yesterday, with participants from human rights organizations, MTV station employees, Palestinian refugees, mothers of several detainees in Syrian prisons, and university students.
He appealed to the Francophone Organization to "commit to struggling against evasion of punishment," and "to protect human rights, within the international framework of combating terrorism, which is also generating human rights violations."
"and must be eliminated."
Some MTV television station employees and St. Joseph University students then presented their testimonies about violations they were exposed to.
General Maronite Patriarchic Representative of Jebbeh, Archbishop Francis Al Baysari, performed the order to promote Clerics Hany Tawk and Miled Makhlouf to Sub-Deacon degree, and Sub-Deacons Khalil Arab and Tony Jebara to Deacon degree.
"The joy is that of the parents, the parishes' sons, friends, and loved ones."
"Hosts having fed the hungry souls to God's Corpus, and being squeezed for the thirsty people to drink, so were the seeds planted by God in this beautiful region, the Cedars and Kannoubine, Bsharre, Baakafra, Hasroun, Diman and others, and these plantings grew and produced thirty, fifty, sixty and a hundred others. Glory to God."
After the celebration the devoted clerics were congratulated.
At 4:00 p.m. yesterday, Monaco Principality Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Patrick Leclere arrived at Beirut airport.
"We all hope that this summit, which we consider to be a glory for Arab Lebanon, will be a success."

Visited "Hezbollah" And Al-Rashidia Camp; Galloway: They Want To Destroy Iraq in Fear of Achieving Balance With Israel
He expressed his respect for "Hezbollah" and said that "The struggle of the Lebanese and Palestinian peoples is on every tongue and lip in Britain."
Following that, he held an extended meeting attended by the Organization and Movement leaders and members, as well as the public and association committees and unions."
"in the place where the Belfour Promise was made. There is another room where Messrs. Sykes and Picot annexed the Arab world to guarantee that it remains divided and weak. They decided to place presidents and kings at the top of these weak regimes. And now I pass through the third room, where they are planning for a second Sykes-Picot.
"If they want, they will face a new division like the past."
"They are not looking to destroy Iraq because Saddam Hussein is its President."
"We are confident that all forms of our struggle will remain until Palestine and its capital return."
Participants in efforts to extinguish the huge fire that erupted last Thursday in the pine and oak forests of the Andakt town area are experiencing an impassioned and unequal race with the hell-fire erupting for five days in that area's forests.  Campaigners are members of the army, civil defense, and internal security, along with the forest wardens and folks who have been making a nonstop effort. In addition, there are three military helicopters, each of which carries out a mission every three minutes throughout the day to drop quantities of water provided by fire engines at the airstrip established in a plaza near the southern entrance to Andakt. All combined efforts have failed so far to surround or control the fire.
Everyone is concerned that the winds may carry the flames toward agricultural lands and houses, some of which are very close to the fire site.
Akar Regional Police Chief Lieutenant Major Bassam al-Ayyoubi inspected the fire site with police officers, who observed on the spot the progress of firefighting operations and the scale of the environmental disaster that hit the forest.
Civil defense firemen managed to surround and extinguish it after 5 p.m.
Sayda-"al-Nahar":
Elham Mahmoud Jasir (35 years old) said, "I have five children, and all of them are lost and without a ration card."
"I demand my rights and the rights of my children as refugees."
"My husband suffers from heart disease, and we cannot provide him with medication."
Patient Muhammad Shibli revealed the location of his thrombus and said, "I am ill and have no supporter but God."
Before departing, the delegation delivered to "al-Nahar" a statement in which they requested donor states to "form an investigative committee as soon as possible to reveal facts, thefts, and commissions."
South Council Director Qublan Qublan received the al-Wazzani Spring Water project from the contractor, Sherif Wahbi, yesterday afternoon. Among the attendees were Council Deputy Director Jean Makhayel, Nabitiya Governor Mahmoud al-Moula, the project's supervising engineer Rasheed Falha, and all the engineers, technicians, and laborers who participated in executing the project, in preparation for launching it at 3 p.m. tomorrow under the sponsorship of Parliament Chairman Nabeeh Berri.
He said in a statement: "The historical moment will be (tomorrow) on Wednesday, when the water starts pumping into the liberated villages of the South. With it, the dream of all southerners, who were always calling for restoration of the water seized and stolen by Israel, will come true."
"It is the project of challenge in all measures, even in terms of time."
His tour included inspecting the pumps and the filter chamber inside the spring, its basin, waterway, and the level of water in it.
"In this context, it is both necessary and important to make field-based verifications for the perception to be correct and accurate."
He replied, "We support Lebanon in obtaining its rights. If there is a problem, then it must be solved through international legitimacy."
They stayed in the place for more than two hours.
He explained that he represents the European envoy for the Middle East process, Miguel Enjel Mauratinus.
Because the part parallel to required internal procedures, as provided for in the 2003 budget that represents the government policy's executive program, is anchored on the external support expected from the donor states Paris 2 conference, from which the government is hoping to obtain facilitated loans close to 5 billion dollars that are to save approximately 300 million dollars of the debt service (estimated in the 2003 budget), the external efforts of the prime minister were directed toward states effective in securing the required funds. As such, the combination of countries expected to be invited to participate in the conference is as follows: the United States, Canada, some European Union states-France, Italy, and Spain-the European Investment Bank, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, Malaysia, Japan, Britain, and the GCC states.
- Remarkable French support expressed through the special care given by French President Jacques Chirac to the conference and its success. This was represented in his determination to hold it early next November, although the preparations are not yet complete, which postponed the timing to somewhere between the middle and end of next month. That is in addition to his supportive position that he declared before Chairman Nabeeh Berri during his recent visit to Paris.
- The importance of Lebanon's location on the area's map and its regional role, which was further pronounced after September 11.
Such is the essence of the two business visits to Japan and Malaysia. The Lebanese government requested aid of one billion dollars from the two countries, hoping to receive this assistance from them in addition to a Canadian contribution, according to the required loan profile.
Industrialists Society Deputy Director Ghabi Thamer held a press conference on behalf of Director Fadi Abboud yesterday in the Movenpic Hotel to launch the campaign. Among the attendees were the Society's Media and Advertising Committee Head Charles Erbeid, "/" company General Manager Danny Richa, and a number of members of the Society's board of directors.
"2- Building long-term loyalty from the consumer side toward Lebanese products."
He added: "We are sure that these campaigns will increase sales of Lebanese products in our local markets and will contribute to developing exports and  providing job opportunities, which will have a positive impact on the economy."
The campaign will be launched in French during the Francophone Summit in the exports center.
Cameras of a number of students fed the exhibit: 15 students from the fourth year of the ALBA advertising section and others from the High National Institute Lui Lumiere, Paris.
The selection of sites was in line with the other event Beirut is experiencing, namely the Francophone Summit.
Francois Donabelle, who is in charge of the High National Institute Lui Lumiere, wrote about the exhibition and its purpose. In brief, she said the students accomplished a survey of the area and photographed the basic sites that reflect the city's historical dimension and its spiritual and cultural heritage that continued in spite of the changes that happened to it throughout the ages.
The set focusing on the Phoenician site was produced by Reena Abi-Rashed, Rana Abu-Murad, Sana Asia, and Abboud Shibli.
In addition, the Mar Girguis Cathedral was photographed by Rali Abboud, Hala El-Saad, Lama Sufeer, and Waseem Muawwad.
The participation of the guitar player Jad Azkol in "Aranjuaz" Concerto by Joaquin Rodrigo, within the show presented by the National Symphonic Orchestra in St. Joseph Church, U.S.J., was a musical event added to two major others in the evening show, the first being dancing musical compositions of a symphonic orchestra in F minor by Jamal Abou Al-Hessen and a symphony by Cesar Franck.

"Beirut of the Overlapped Times" is the title of the show currently taking place in the French Cultural Center, Damascus Road (until this October 15).
The work was supervised by Françoise Denoyelle (France), Ghada and Gilbert Hajj (Lebanon).
The overlapped layers show civilization's wealth coming out of quietness and oblivion to surprise the present and interact with the past.
It was mentioned by mistake in the title of the musical evening show, which took place in the theater of Pierre Abou Khater, U.S.J., that the flute player is Rabih Mrouweh, while the correct thing to say is Nabil Mrouweh; this required clarification and apologies.
This time he is telling the legend of Gilgamesh, from which he takes free basics for dancing performances acquiring materials from an Orient where the divine conflicts with the human and from an Occident where the melodies descending like rain are mating with the rhythms alerting like drums.
The female dancers first, being the poetic side of the show and in the choreography designed for them, and the four of them being as one like intimate, instinctual, human, and liturgical signs, loaded with ambiances based on the Oriental natures saying about the mother, the prostitute, Ishtar, the bar dancer and the one who is always ready for life and death and for life to continue.
Paconnier, who seems to be the choreographer's favorite dancer, is suffering from lazy moves that are easily noticed by the spectator; the reason is probably his tall body which increased physically following its impacts on himself and on his friends on the podium.
Belonging to the near roots is obvious and desired; it is even totally colored when singing in Arabic becomes an effective element in the formation of the dancing rhythmic cover.
It tells the story of the legendary man Gilgamesh and his companion Ankido when the human memory first started the fatalist meeting between the divine face and the human face in a last conviction of the meanings of life on this earth.
A security report indicated that Shadi Shukr-Allah Kanaan (19 years old) of Al-Rayhana town was brought to the Sayedat Al-Maounat hospital in Jubayl Jutha after drowning in the sea in the town of Al-Barbara as a result of diving without oxygen to fish.
"The Public Security General Directorate and other law enforcement bodies often receive assignments or warrants from prosecutors, magistrates, and courts related to statements of certain individuals or resumption of investigations into a certain case to complete clarification of all its elements. However, these assignments or warrants do not include the complete identities or addresses and telephone numbers of the concerned individuals, which impedes the work of the law enforcement body in executing the assigned requirement."
He referred the file to the Prosecution General of Appeal for review.
The Sunday issue of "Al-Nahar" mentioned that the Justice Palace delegate to the Attorneys Association in Beirut, Seleem Garios, attended in Justice Sameer Alia's chamber to part of the pleadings related to the issue of closing the MT
While Hassan Ali Al-Attar (34 years old), Ali Hassan Zaraqit (44 years old), Ali Muhammad Shmseddin (46 years old), and Bilal Ramiz Sulayman (23 years old), all of whom are employees of Lebanon Electricity Organization, were removing unlawful fixtures from a light pole in the Airport road area, more than ten people attacked them, beat them, and shattered the windshield of a Volkswagen car carrying number 101282 and belonging to the Organization, then fled.
He suspected a car that returned after a period, and its driver, Ali Muhammad
A security report indicated that tension is predominant in the Ein Al-Helwa camp and that the Palestinian factions are in a state of alert, as are other armed groups affiliated with other factions.
, his uncle Atif, and three armed men affiliated with the Fath movement beat Ahmad Najm and threatened to kill him, upon which the latter was injured in his face and lip and was also bruised.
The committee released the following statement yesterday:
"Additionally, Lebanese authorities took no advantage, through the Hearing Committee for Complaints of Families of the Missing headed by Minister Fuad Al-Saad, of the favorable opportunity, which was brought forth by the families committee through their unprecedented visit to the Syrian Ministry of Interior, to present all the information, proof, and witnesses of which it has evidence of the presence of Lebanese detainees in Syrian prisons."
"It would have been most preferable if Lebanese officials, during their decoration of former Security and Reconnaissance Director of Syrian Forces in Lebanon Staff General Ghazi Kanaan with medals, had asked him about the destiny of the Lebanese who were detained by Syrian forces and then transferred to Syrian prisons."
Demanding U.N. Commissioner's Office to Cover His Treatment Expenses, Iraqi Refugees Sat in Solidarity With Their Fellow Citizen Who Was Admitted to the Hospital and 14,000 Dollars Required to be Secured for His Treatment... We Refuse Procrastination; Commissioner's Office Awaiting Response; Medical Report: Skull and Thigh Fractures
That is the demonstrators' concern.
Attempts succeeded with the Beirut-Al-Ramla Al-Bayda hospital, "after we provided 1,000 dollars," according to one of them. He also mentioned, "After three days, during which the injured was subjected to head surgery, the hospital administration suspended treatment for lack of financial coverage. It is noteworthy that the Commissioner's Office is supposed to cover 70% of the treatment expenses."
"What we do not accept is the Commissioner Office's procrastination and stalling in medical emergencies."
She resumed, "The refugee was driving a motorcycle without a license."
She does not deny that "the situation is difficult. I commiserate with the injured refugee, and we are working to obtain assistance."
"I can say no more."
Also, a number of Iraqi refugees addressed a call to human rights organizations demanding "elimination of injustice and lending a hand of aid and assistance to the refugee Muhammad Ali."
"He was placed in the intensive care unit and put on an artificial respiration system."
"He needs to continue treatment in the intensive care unit, as a second head surgery and another surgery to fit the thigh fracture with metal medical equipment are required, as well as being hospitalized for two weeks at least, unless unexpected complications occur."
A series of celebrations were held in the districts to honor pupils. Also, the Islamic Business Administration College graduated its students in the Akkar branch.
Mr. Ali Fadl-Allah spoke in his address about the charity organizations of "mabarra" that "were motivated to act through Islam and endeavored to have Islam that is open to life as their heading. They did not act through Islam as a reaction to others who acted through other religions or positions, but rather to complement all efforts exerted to repel ignorance and retardation."
"Therefore, I speak to you frankly, blame not Al-Hareeri nor Al-Senyora, but blame your MPs who vote for laws presented by this government. We will stand by the rights of teachers today, tomorrow, and in the parliamentary symposium."
Speeches were delivered by Islamic Center Trustees Council Chairman Tawfeek Huri, Al-Imam Al-Awzai Islamic Studies College Manager Sheikh Kamel Mousa, and student Abd El-Kareem Khadr in the name of the graduates.
The board of delegates held its ordinary session yesterday and decided the following:
"3- Stressing the necessity of completing the two university compounds in Al-Hadath and Al-Fanar, and commencement of execution of other compounds in all governorates."
"The conferees agreed to program priorities in this regard for projects considered by the university people and the officials. These projects are headed by the preservation of the university's academic, financial, and administrative independence and the accomplishment of a new bill that matches the requirements of progress and achievement of remarkable academic standards."
"3- Legitimize the representative council so as to allow independence of the university in terms of appointing its officials regardless of their variant positions."
"The board of delegates approved the action plan submitted by the executive board, particularly in terms of counteracting the bill budget through continued coordination of action with other sectors that fall under the framework of the coordination body of leagues of professors, teachers, and public sector employees. They considered that the recent educational festival in the UNESCO Palace was a prelude to pressure movements, and that the October 24th strike will be its springboard."
He told the Cypriot Turkish News Agency that "granting the Greek Cypriot administration full membership status in the European Union (...) will damage peace and stability in the island and will lead the region to a permanent crisis."
Uzkok expressed an opinion that unifying the island must be based on "a new partnership between two states enjoying sovereignty. (...) That is the only way to ensure the establishment of just and permanent peace in Cyprus."
He repeated his country's objections with regard to the arrangements for land redistribution as mentioned in the document, which stipulates that the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus is to return lands to Greek Cypriots.
"We have to maintain our guidelines: First, political criteria must be satisfied, and then a time is set."

Disagreement on Construing Resolution 1441 and Its Implementation; Arab States Face Embarrassment if U.S. Attacks Iraq
Therefore, the U.S. administration will look for any excuse to justify launching a military strike aiming at overthrowing President Saddam Hussein's regime.
Moreover, a U.S. military strike against Iraq without reference to the Security Council to consider reasons for launching such a strike will renew its disagreement with a number of Security Council member states, particularly France and Russia. It will also place the Arab League in an awkward position, as it will have to meet at the Presidential level, not just the ministerial level, to assume a stance regarding the U.S. military strike, should it take place. Such a stance could very well stop at the limit of strongly deploring and condemning the strike, and refusing to participate in it in any manner or to provide America with military facilities from any Arab state.
"They imagined that it is possible to overthrow the regime in Baghdad and establish a U.S.-loyal government, then exercise massive pressure on Syria and Iran so as to develop somehow a Middle East that is fully loyal to Israel and America. This is a dangerous fantasy."
Emil Khuri
Until very recently, Prime Minister Hareeri was defying his opponents and criticizers by refusing to yield to the principle of developing an economic plan, on the pretext that it is one of the remnants of socialist concepts.
In reality, it is far from clichés and formalities.
There is always room in Al-Taif and U.N. resolutions for "constructive ambiguity" or "positive obscurity," as well as the opposite, i.e., negative ambiguity and obscurity.
The government found no problem in doing so.
The other interesting issue is that it also announces unabashed that social and economic stability is at stake unless external support is provided.
Then comes the most important question: the government's plan involves a hypothetical scenario to overcome the deficit.

"In the Likud conference center in Tel Aviv, the two candidates competing for Likud leadership and for party candidacy to head the government delivered speeches."
"Benjamin Netanyahu was keen to emphasize the difference between Sharon and him by stressing his decisive decision to expel Arafat as the first task he would undertake upon assuming office, and that he would give economic revival top priority."
"He linked solving the economic crisis of increasing severity to finding a political solution, thus making the impression that such a solution will be his priority from now on."
"The differences in view among the three candidates are relatively small, and it seems this time that Labor voters will need to focus on the personality of their candidate and his ability to lead the party toward a clear goal under the political, security, and economic status quo that is more difficult than any previous situation."
It is Paris 2, which seems in its objectives and incentives to be out of the current regional and international context. In fact, it even introduces a contradictory context to the political atmosphere that is dominating the momentum of international relations since September 11 of last year.
In saying this, we definitely do not intend to give the Paris 2 convention the status of a coalition, nor even of axes, although supporting a country such as Lebanon, with all its characteristics and uniqueness, does deserve an international coalition, at least because it presents the world with a formula for creative coexistence among multiple sects and ethnic groups at a time when the world is slipping toward struggle between ethnic groups and civilizations and toward primitiveness in relations between states and ignorance in dealing with societies.
On the other hand, holding the conference coincides with a politically indicative turn in terms of the French political position against the global policy that Washington is trying to dictate in an imperialistic style that is not free of arrogance. This doubles the significance of Paris 2, which is further increased by the American participation in the conference.
Those who are going there are keen on giving their attendance an indication more than the souvenir photograph.
Lebanese Consumption Talk
Conversely, any speech meant for internal consumption is not within his purview, except on exceptional occasions.
The event that elicits such talk, i.e., the Baabda Palace visit, falls under messages addressed to the United States.
But from another aspect, that talk is different from the discourse meant for sheer internal consumption.
Lebanon is also the only country in the world where the proposition of "the difficult choice" and "Syrian tenacity" with all its implications of "reassurances to Syria" finds listening ears, in much the same way as it was a few years ago the only country in the world where there was a prevalent belief that Syria's abandonment of Kurdish leader Ojalan was a genius maneuver, not a result of horrendous disturbance of the power balance with Turkey.
But the necessity does not show in the Iraqi issue. It is now obvious that Resolution 1441 was not subject to give and take, except for the other permanent members (and within tight limits even with those).

Noteworthy is that the electricity sector represents, with the telecommunications sector, the cornerstone of the privatization project on which the government is depending to obtain from it and from assignment transactions 5 billion dollars next year.
And the legal report, the preparation of which was assigned to a law firm.
He found it more likely for that to happen after some time and expressed optimism regarding "completion of stages required for privatization." He noted that Lebanon Electricity currently has due debts worth 150 million dollars that must be paid.
On its part, the cabinet approved the bylaws of the National Quarries Council and selling of facilities allocated to the Ministry of Interior to construct prisons.

At a quarter to one, the members convened in a plenary session coordinated by Bishop Jean Tiroz. Father Eli Nasr, the Lebanese envoy and General Guide for prisons, read a report about the General Guidance Authority for prisons in Lebanon. He was then re-elected as General Guide for a third term.
He called for securing "a political truce for the Paris 2 conference."
"It also gives Iraq an opportunity to defeat all excuses and pretexts, if it so wishes."
With regard to the Paris 2 conference and the Lebanese paper to the conference, he said: "We must first commit to an internal truce that would enable Lebanon to overcome the Iraqi problem, with all its potential ramifications on the Lebanese arena and the Paris 2 issue. Regardless of any internal difference of opinion about its political or economic aspects, and regardless of our disagreement on estimating its importance, Paris 2 remains a gain that can enable Lebanon to replace debts imposing excessive interest with less burdensome debts in terms of interest."
"Even if we neither share the magnitude of optimism expressed by some in its regard nor the magnitude of pessimism expressed by others, we still consider it to be a necessary dose of oxygen, regardless of the actual size of its numeric success."
He delivered a speech in which he said: "Thought must be confronted with thought, not with bullets and violence. Let your thought be violent with reason in opposing thought attempting to refute your reason."
"We were confused because Islam is with leniency, not violence, but some seniors in their scientific and cultural positions consider that ruling countries should be carried out using swords. The issue is that the atmosphere made people search for a religious license to kill, blast, and destroy. We are still hearing in several locations of a place blasted here and a person there. Therefore, we need a new culture to practice our values and to learn the spirituality of dialog and the meaning of unity."
"If the MPs refer to those who elected them from various areas and sects, they will find a public consensus on this direction."
* The Shiite Islamic Sect Endowments Committee held a fast-breaking banquet in the Movenpick hotel under the sponsorship of Higher Shiite Islamic Council Vice-President Sheikh Abd Elameer Qublan.

Mrs. Rabab Al-Sadr spoke and said: "We have all been following the newspaper articles regarding the issue of Imam Al-Sudr and his two companions. It is strange that all our folks are aware of the value of this issue and at the same time are asking us to respond."
He considered that "such support expresses a genuine fraternal spirit characterizing the relations between both countries." He also commended the contributions of the Kuwaiti Fund for Economic and Social Development to project execution.
Following that, Miqati reviewed with President and General Manager of Beirut Port Hassan Quraytam the progress of work in the port and the stages completed for purchase of container station equipment.
He was also visited by Beirut Catholic Romans Metropolit Bishop Yusuf Klais and a delegation of the Catholic Romans Charity Society presided over by Roger Nisnas. Ministry of Works Roads and Buildings Director General Fadi Al-Nammar participated in the meeting.
He received from him a memorandum of requests, which involve admission of goods unloaded in Lebanese ports to Syrian markets, facilitating export of goods dispatched from Lebanon to Iraq in transit via Syria, reduction of port charges and unloading and storage costs in the port, and the necessity of charging on the basis of quantity of goods unloaded in Beirut rather than the shipload.
Qirnat Shahwan Invited to New Strategy and Current Truce Necessary to Clear Atmosphere
But there is a team within the Qirna that seems today and more than ever before inclined to calm things down, not to appease the authority but rather out of keenness to maintain the existence of the gathering and its continuity as a political force that has proven to be effective. This is evinced by the authority's severity in dealing with it and the intensification of attacks against it.
Those do not act on the sole basis that the "Qirna is a necessity" in the Christian arena nor on the continuity of its coverage by Bakraki, but rather on restoring stability to the political discourse that was almost demolished by the blows of the authority.
2- Defining its political direction after performing a process of deep disclosure between its members.
Conversely, supportive parties have the view that "the current truce experienced in the arena is attributed to the Qirna's understanding of the authority's seriousness in going all the way in the confrontation, and that any new escalation will waste the current truce once again."
They absolutely deny "any current inclination for comprehensive dialog."
There is no doubt that the current truce, even if unintentional, could form a suitable framework for the Qirna to calmly review its accounts, so that it can regain its political role and not remain a mere monthly meeting that does nothing but release political statements.
Lahud congratulated Akl for "the new position he deserved" and lauded his "efficiency, virtuosity, and distinguished professional presence," considering that "the confidence placed by the attorneys of the world in Mr. Akl is also large confidence in Lebanon and its represented legal values throughout history."
"Lebanon's presidency of the International Attorneys Union for two years makes us feel proud and delighted, as it is the first time in the history of the Union for a Lebanese or an Arab to assume this position."
Akl said that he presented President Lahud with the general outlines of his work during his term, most important of which is a summit conference for attorneys that will be held in New York next January 31, and several symposia in a number of countries around the world, one of which will be held in Lebanon under Lahud's sponsorship next May 20. It will discuss the issue of banking confidentiality in confronting money laundering.
Commenting on this matter, Minister of Health Sulayman Franjiya said to reporters: "If the two presidents disagree the country suffers, and if the two presidents agree we and the country suffer."

Greek Ambassador George Gabrialis, whose country represents Denmark, the current European Union President, due to the absence of a resident Danish embassy in Beirut, announced that he delivered in the name of the Union a message from Danish Foreign Minister Bersbieg Muller to Foreign and Expatriates Minister Mahmoud Hammoud regarding the International Criminal Tribunal.
Judge Lahud delivered the following speech: "Your Highness the President, dear beloved brother. I do not know how to express my feelings while I am now at the peak of an emotional shake affecting my senses, feelings, and self.
Nothing is known about the destiny of the file on leased governmental buildings, or about the file on lands and joint property of the state and municipalities.
Because of the absence of a solution for the Palestinian refugee problem, the U.N. General Assembly continuously renewed UNRWA's term for a period of three years.
A Palestinian refugee by the UNRWA functional definition is a person who was living in Palestine between June 1946 and May 1948, lost his home and source of livelihood as a result of the Arab-Israeli conflict in 1948, and sought refuge in Jordan, Lebanon, the Arab Republic of Syria, the West Bank, or the Gaza Strip.
UNRWA's mission implied provision of emergency aid to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who were displaced by the Arab-Israeli conflict in 1948.
Mention needs to be made of the fact that the international family considers UNRWA to be a stabilizing element in the Middle East. On the other hand, the refugees consider UNRWA programs to be a reassurance from the international family that their demand for a comprehensive and just solution has not been forgotten.
UNRWA administers its educational program through a network comprised of 644 schools and 8 vocational centers in the Near East.
UNRWA supports the families of disadvantaged refugees in providing for basic needs and assists the refugee community in self-sufficiency through social development efforts.
UNRWA is also bound by technical assistance agreements over a long period of time with other U.N. organizations such as UNESCO, WHO, UNICEF, the Higher Commissioner Office for Refugees, and the U.N. Population Fund.
As UNRWA is the agency for employing Palestinian refugees in the Near East, 99 percent of its employees are Palestinians.
In spite of the wishes of sincere people that such optimism be justified, the following notes have to be made:
If we move on to the public level, we find ourselves facing opposing antagonistic currents among Qirnat Shahwan, the Consultative Meeting, the Hamad cell, Shamana, and the shattered Blockists, everyone pursuing his own fancies.
All that is permitted in this regard is the mere repetition of calling for it, far from actually establishing it, on the basis of restricting any delving into aspects of the basic issue that justifies calling for it, under subjection to torture, mistrust, and release of cursing and threatening tongues.
If each one of them refers back to himself, he would find comfort in the saying of a Bedouin who was once asked:
Who is responsible for this situation?
In all cases, we hope this matter is taken seriously, and that maintenance of such projects is carried out regularly after completion of their construction, to avoid repetition of what happened to the Chevrolet Bridge, in which case the damage exceeds what is observed above the surface.
At six o'clock in the evening, the head of the convent Father Mokhawal Farha headed a celebration Mass during which the final vows of the Carmelite brothers Josef Shlala and Thomas were announced.

Hasibia-"Al-Nahar":
When I watched Prime Minister Al-Hareeri's delegation receiving encouragement from international financial institutions in New York and their urging him to expedite privatization of the public sector, I wondered if Lebanon will experience by virtue of policy what was experienced by the state of Argentina, whose economic policy led to demonstrations, dismissal of the government, and changing five heads of state in less than two weeks.
In Lebanon, the ruling political layer and the administration are infected with the same diseases rampant in Argentina. If they are not rehabilitated, and if the waste and corruption are not eliminated before the public sector is privatized, then the proceeds of selling the public sector-and of course selling under the current atmosphere will be at the cheapest of prices-will impoverish the state and the people and will multiply the wealth of the whales of money and politics, as is the case today.

The reactions of Iraqi opposition parties generally welcomed with caution Resolution 1441 issued by the International Security Council, on the basis that this resolution will lead to the "overthrow of the Iraqi regime sooner or later," as mentioned in the statements released by the Iraqi organizations.
The statement of Al-Dawa wonders whether Saddam and his regime have any remains of national sense that would oblige him to relinquish authority and leave Iraq, or would delusion push him toward his bleak fate with a catastrophe that would inevitably overthrow him but which will also leave its marks on this afflicted country?
On the other hand, the Kurdish Democratic Party led by Masud Al-Barzani received the international resolution with emphasis that "it will not change the inevitability of some kind of confrontation between Iraq and America or with the U.N."
This opposing Iraqi organization believes that "Saddam Hussein, to remain in the ruling seat, will accept the new resolution. He is willing to relinquish everything, away from hollow slogans and boastings that deceive a broad sector of the Arab and Islamic street."
He considered that the contemplated support is neither charity nor aid, "but rather a fundamental investment in regional peace and security."

Lebanese-Canadian Bank Chairman and Managing Director George Zard Abu-Juda announced that the ISO 2000/9001 certification recently awarded to the bank qualifies it, if properly applied, to exercise international criteria in banking operations, in management, and in human development, "thus enabling us to emerge into the international market: to Canada soon, then to the Arab Gulf and Europe."
He wondered, "What will happen to the educational sector?"
Finally he said, "Application"
He stressed that had it not been for the endurance of the Lebanese banking sector, Lebanon would have never risen, attracted capital and deposits, and achieved Paris 2, which it deserved.
He announced that the Union believes that financial reforms carried out by Lebanon this year, and which it will continue to work on with determination and persistence, are on the right track "because it has no other choice beyond these corrective steps that are being closely observed by the Banks Union."
He indicated that the Arab Banks Union, which now consists of more than 300 banking institutions and maintains business relations with a large group of financial decision-making centers in the region and the world, is present in the international arena to defend the interests of Arab banks and, concurrently, to assist them in adapting to developments emerging in the international arena in protection of themselves and their clients. This is done through the Union's intensive training activity and its Financial and Banking Sciences Academy, and through its Arab and international conferences that have become an advanced forum for the treatment of Arab and international financial and banking affairs.
V television station and Jebel Lebanon Radio to appeal against the decision of closing the two media organizations since last September 4.
Adoum's memorandum presented an overview of the reasons that combined politics with law in the language of the Distinction Attorney General and which led to closing the station.
He added: "Instigation against the judiciary, questioning its integrity, and offending it during the restriction period continued to the post-elections period, particularly following the closure decision, where there was dramatic increase in slander, censure, and false allegations against judges and accusing them of various accusations, in addition to inciting associations and the majority."
It was said that this organization is not Lebanese.

Following is today's program, mentioning the host team first:
Immaculate Conception: the Unique Creature
The ideal is, according to the common definition, a goal for the human being who knows he will never reach it on earth.
He did not call her by her known real name but with a special characteristic or with a title of high dimensions, as this title is enough to clearly identify her and declares a message or a purpose that is not in this existence.
God wanted her that way, because that is the way she has to be.
The privacy of the Immaculate Conception of Virgin Mary proves and assures the extraordinary divine intervention in human history, particularly in the salvation history.
Fathers and saints of the church, writers, and artists have always praised her and left in literature, as prose and poems, in art as photography, sculpture, structure, and music, verses telling of their devotion and affection for the Virgin.
The vessel "Su Sun" carrying the shipment arrived yesterday at dawn at Al-Hudayyida Red Sea port 300 kilometers east of Sana'a and unloaded the shipment of missiles.
These launching pads were used during the civil war in Yemen in 1994 between southern separatists and government forces.
Washington agreed to return the missiles to Yemen against guarantees that they will not be used by a third party.
The Yemeni News Agency Saba reported that the Yemeni president will assure his Russian counterpart of "Yemen's desire to realize security and stability on the basis of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, topped by their right to establish their independent state on their land with Jerusalem as its capital, respecting Iraq's sovereignty, and dealing with the Iraqi issue within the framework of international legitimacy."
Yemen had made a contract with Russia in 2001 to buy 16 aircraft of this type.
U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell invited yesterday his Russian and Chinese counterparts and European Union Foreign Policy and Common Security High Commissioner Javier Solana to discuss means of solving the crisis raised by North Korea's nuclear program.
The crisis was aggravated when the United States revealed last October that North Korea admitted to implementing a nuclear program based on enriched uranium, which can be used to produce nuclear weapons, thus violating an agreement with Washington signed in 1994.
It emphasized that the North Korean army and people, who bear deep hatred for the Americans, are fully prepared to fight a battle of death and challenge.
South Korean soldiers cleared mines in an area of approximately 100 meters in width and approximately two kilometers in length to the center of the demilitarized zone, as did North Korean soldiers on their side.
Afghan President Hameed Karzai started yesterday a tour to a number of European states in an bid to get more international aid for his country, which was destroyed by war, and personnel from the new Afghan army have joined the forces of the international coalition against terrorism, the bases of which were subjected to new attacks.
"The size of the aid this year was not sufficient with regard to the required works."
He explained, "Their task will be to participate in the operation of combing and restoring security and preserving it."
But the process of constructing the army is slow.
The bases of the coalition that is leading the "Firm Liberty" operation against the Taliban and its allies from Al-Qaeda are exposed to regular attacks since the start of the operation a year ago in Afghanistan and particularly in the country's east and  south-east near the Pakistani border.
Abu-Musaab was detained and placed in confinement under the investigation.
"Al-Ahram" newspaper mentioned that he was assigned to gather press information about Al-Qaeda and the other Islamic organizations, including Al-Jihad organization under the leadership of Ayman Al-Zawahri and Al-Jamaa Al-Islamiya.
He headed in 1988 to London for treatment, then returned to Pakistan where he participated in the news bulletin of Al-Qaeda.
The Iranian government repeated yesterday that it is expecting the visit of experts of the International Nuclear Energy Agency to prove that the two nuclear sites that are being constructed currently have no military uses and to confront the American "slander" campaign.
After the White House expressed the day before yesterday its "extreme concern" regarding the issue of the two sites that it said can be used secretly to produce nuclear weapons, Kharazi confirmed anew that "Iran has no program to produce nuclear weapons, and all actions taken in the nuclear field were only taken for civilian purposes."
Iran is building, in cooperation with the Russians, its first nuclear station in Bushahr, which will start its operation in June 2004.
The "Tehran Times" conservative newspaper's headline was "Liars" while the "Iran News" reformist newspaper considered that these maneuvers of "intimidation" are the "last act in the attempt to limit the participation of Iran and its influence" in Iraq in the phase after President Saddam Hussein.
With this decision it is in the capacity of the 15 Union states to access "with immediate effect" NATO's logistic and planning capabilities, including the intelligence level to use them to conduct in the future joint military operations, as in Macedonia for example.
The joint European defense policy, which was announced ready for application at the end of 2001, had faced setbacks since that time because of the absence of this agreement, which prevented, for example, the European Union from replacing the NATO force deployed in Macedonia as of this year and was settled.
On its part, Greece had obstructed the agreement for a long period.
It remains for the states to negotiate some details for actual application of the agreement between the Union and NATO "by March 1, 2003," according to Robertson.
He added, "These forces alone enjoy flexibility and speed to respond to threats when they emerge."
Chavez, who is resisting immense pressure from the opposition to resign, said that the member states of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) offered to send technicians to Venezuela to assist in restoring work in oil wells and refineries and ports that have been paralyzed by the strike.
Washington increased pressure on Chavez by calling on him to hold early elections.
Chavez is trying to limit the effects of the strike that constricted Venezuela's oil production and paralyzed operations of the huge governmental oil company BEDVISA, led to closing companies and shops, and caused a shortage in food and gasoline in some cities.
He hinted at the possibility of firing more striking employees in the government oil company.
Hundreds of Chavez supporters gathered outside the Presidency Palace on Friday while they were dancing and launching fireworks.
Cairo-from Jamal Fahmy:
He added that for the past year he "notified the central authorities in Cairo, particularly the Foreign and Environment Ministries, of the condition's details and development" and requested legal measures be taken according to provisions of the international law "against the Hebrew state" and said that the Foreign Ministry actually filed a complaint with the United Nations against Israel.
On his part, Minister of Environment Dr. Mamdouh Riyad told "Al-Nahar," "Those experts have completed preparation of a comprehensive and detailed scientific report of the details of the environmental condition in the Rafah area, in preparation for the Foreign Ministry's filing soon of a complaint with the United Nations against Israel."
He was born in 1945 in Iraq and was thirteen when his family fled during the 1958 revolution that unseated King Faisal the Second.
With support from the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), he moved in 1993 to live in Iraqi Kurdistan, and he led in 1995 an assault campaign against Saddam Hussein.
As he is a former banker and a businessman, for Al-Chalabi manages the Card-Tech company that sells computer software to banks and financial institutions, criticisms were made of his leadership of the Iraqi National Conference.
In September 2000, two of his brothers were convicted in Switzerland on charges of "forgery in accounts" for their involvement in the bankruptcy of other financial institutions that he was said to have assisted in financing from the funds of the Petra Bank.
He has strong support from Republican Senator Sam Brownback, member of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Senate and who is participating in the London conference.
Turkey opted to focus on the positive side after it obtained an invitation to commence negotiations for joining the Union's membership in 2005, although it was hoping to start the process two years before that.
Afghan President Hameed Karzai started yesterday a tour to a number of European states in an endeavor to obtain more international aid for his country, which was destroyed by the war, and personnel from the new Afghan army have joined the forces of the international coalition against terrorism, the bases of which were subjected to new attacks.

A booby-trapped car exploded Friday night outside a restaurant in Pristina, the capital of the Kosovo province, which led to the injury of at least 30 people.
The blast came one day before the visit of the ambassadors of the International Security Council's member states to assess the situation in Kosovo.
The advice given by Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations Reema Khalaf Heneidi to Arab youth on the lectern of the American University in its celebration of the Founding Fathers Day is worth attention, and the advice gains further weight in consideration that its giver was the supervisor of the Arab human development report that stirred and settled our area when it revealed how much the liberties here are in a state of misery, how much the knowledge in our homes is in a pathetic state, and in what state of anguish the women in our country are for their loss of fundamental liberties.
Why differ?
So where are our children in saying the truth?
- If the boy or girl seems to be troublesome and defiant, refusing obedience and head bowing, he or she is flooded with the descriptions of insolence, rudeness, poor breeding, and the book is read from its title.
Anyone who wants to continue along this thorny track must be prepared to leave the homeland and friends or otherwise prepare for all sorts of humiliation before the sight of family and brothers.

Over those two years, the decree regulating the cabinet's operations was raised more than once, as was the necessity of complying with its complete provisions, but the criterion of governmental stability and disturbance continued to depend on the personal relationship between Lahud and Al-Hareeri, who were not enthusiastic for the suggestion to make the decree regulating the cabinet's operations a law.
And that with this behavior of theirs, they have reduced in the cabinet's roles such that it is only presented with the project that enjoys the approval of both presidents, although that means on the other end that presenting the project in the cabinet session must lead to approving it in the manner considered by the agreement of both presidents.
This is also what is meant by this government being the government of the three major forces that won in the 2000 elections, meaning President Nabeeh Berri and Al-Hareeri and Jumblat, it is obvious that the role that was assumed by the new government has come to represent the steps of the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister.
The same matter is said about the disagreement of both presidents at the doors of the Beirut Arab Summit over the limits of constitutional authorities.
In fact, he behaves as a partner of the Prime Minister in the cabinet and not a partner of the cabinet, like the tens of times where he found conclusive reasons for disagreement and dispute, the last of which was about the cell phone, which started months ago, and the concerned minister Jean Louis Qirdahi did not then have the role he ended up with in recent days, but rather it was confrontation, with its severity between the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister, exchanging accusations directly and through the medium, until when they finally agreed, they accomplished, as two partners, the settlement over the cell phone via a political understanding that surprised the cabinet itself.
No one needed to wait for the American reactions to the "Iraqi report" to discover that matter, because it was absolutely clear even before the arrival of the inspectors in Baghdad that the basic bet is not based on the element of searching for the "needle" of weapons of mass destruction in a huge stack of Iraqi geographic "hay," but rather on the element of exploring for the secrets in the chests of Iraqis, who can lead the inspectors to those weapons if they exist and reveal to them the secrets and information they know about them.
To that end, Blix announced that he does not want to turn into an official in charge of an "asylum agency" that attracts Iraqi scientists, because basically he leads a team searching for prohibited weapons and not for scientists who want to exit the "Garden of Eden."
Information leaked out of the American administration last Thursday, confirming a name list of 500 experts from among approximately 20,000 scientists, engineers, and technicians who previously participated in manufacturing the restricted Iraqi weapons.

This was obvious through the decisive American procedure on the item of interrogation that will include the Iraqi scientists and technicians, particularly the part that stated explicitly the permissibility of interrogating those outside Iraq after transferring their families, to eliminate the possibility of their being exposed to pressure or punishment if they reveal the confidential information they possess.
But the story is not dependent on what Mr. Blix wants or refuses. In view of the escalating threats to wage war against Iraq, America will find a number of whispering scientists who are haunted by the "American Dream" as it haunted before them the German scientists during World War II and after it and as it haunted Soviet scientists before the Perestroika and after it, but it is not clear in the end if there really is anything worth whispering of weapons or information supporting the excuses of Bush, who regularly beats the drums of war.
And when we talk about 500 scientists, then we must find among them a "Judas" or a number of "Judases," unless the "disciples" of Saddam Hussein are of a different type.
The first experiment in privatization crossed yesterday its first hurdle to start a new stage burdened with much political struggle and private accounts, and little economic clarity.
Hoping that the days of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein have become few, more than 350 delegates representing seven factions and independent figures met in London in an attempt to bury their differences and discuss developing a common vision for a "democratic parliamentary multiplicity federal" Iraq with the help of the United States, while United Nations experts spent an eventful day in the inspection operations of sites linked to Iraqi weapons programs where carrying out inspection operations in 11 sites was announced and a list of Iraqi scientists who will be interrogated was requested.

He also said, "We want to help the European Union in solving the problem of tax on saving but within the framework of our legislative system," adding that "we, with our proposal, succeeded in maintaining our legislative system."
Switzerland is suggesting to increase the taxes at the source by a rate of 35 percent on the profits of European savings deposited in Swiss banks, while the European Union has refused this suggestion until now, preferring exchange of information about the owners of European accounts in Switzerland; this assumes lifting confidentiality from banking accounts.

At a later time, a statement released from the office of Minister of Information Jean Louis Qirdahi included that the Ministry delivered to the two companies yesterday and last Thursday "an explanatory letter (...) related to the commitment of the Ministry to settle the dispute about the issue of the two collection documents with the arbitration that was agreed upon, emphasizing at the same time no passing of time for the two collection documents and no application of them before issuing the arbitration award."

He added, "And in the meantime the mentioned two were conducting reconnaissance operations of foreign targets in Amman, and they selected Foley, in charge of the American aid program in the embassy, when they noticed that he represented an easy target for them, and on the date of 1/27/2002, they rented a private car from one of the citizens in order to use it to execute their crime without informing him of their aim."
The American embassy in Amman thanked the Jordanian government for its efforts in revealing the details of this incident and emphasized the continuation of cooperation with it in this case.

Without the initiative of the Northern "cultures" association, we would not have this honor.
Former Minister of Telecommunications Essam Numan specified "three defects" in the transfer of ownership agreement for the cellular sector to the state, as signed by the two companies.
"The second defect is that even if we assume the arbitration conditions will enable the state to demand all its rights and indemnities due to it, then not stipulating presentation of collateral from the two companies to the state to guarantee collecting them as a result of issuing an arbitration award in its favor makes the contemplated arbitration award merely ink on paper due to lack of possession on the part of the two companies of any assets after terminating the contract with them and their signing on the ownership transfer contract and their receipt of the book value of their assets entirely, to enable the state to sequester them as guarantee to fulfill its rights."
He called on the parties, bodies, political forces, and parliamentary blocs "that objected to the privatization and criticize now the defects of signing the ownership transfer contract to organize a wide national campaign against the selling of the two cellular phone networks."7

The rule of individuals does not secure the country's interests. We must get out of our current situation, he pointed out.
He added that currently, there is no issue of disagreement between Lebanon and Syria. The president of the republic is the one entitled to direct the dialogue between Lebanon and Syria to a peaceful and rational discussion, not the Syrian side.
He affirmed that he supports Bakraki in keeping the Syrian issue out of political life and political debate in Lebanon," and that he "supports the Bakraki point of view of not turning the issue into a daily topic used by the leaderships for their own purposes and fabrications, because this would consequently establish a culture of hostility between Lebanon and Syria, which is against the interests of Lebanon and the Lebanese Christians.
"His Excellency the Ambassador could have requested the literal wording of the speech from the proper authorities. It would have provided his government with the accuracy and objectivity needed for proper judgment, instead of falling into such a trap of hearsay."
"By mentioning this, the Ambassador contradicted himself and proved that the Canadian decision is based on allegations."
The statement mentioned: By such unjust decision, the Canadian government puts itself in a position where we and the Canadian people do not want it to be, which is in the anti-Arab and anti-Islamic alliance. This may provoke the sentiments of Arabs and Muslims against such a position, as occurred toward the biased American policies.
He also called upon all Arab and Islamic public powers to express their disapproval of this decision, which rewards aggression and crime and is prejudiced against the resistance and determination of the nation.
In an open dialogue with a group of young people, held in the La Segal hotel at the invitation of Parliament Member Jean Augaspian, Al-Aridi criticized the absence of a comprehensive political project through which youth can take part in life.

President Al-Jamil's message is one of opposition to the policy of the present authority, whilst that of Al-Saifi is unreservedly loyal to some of the authority's figures.
This coordination committee has not missed a single occasion on which to stand shoulder to shoulder in demonstrations and marchers, thereby reminding us of those that Sheikh Pierre used to lead demanding sovereignty, freedom and independence. In contrast, Mr. Risha believes this is to be "led away by emotions, for which we see no benefit(...)".

It really is a worrying feeling to be different, to be looked at as if you are from another planet for just enquiring about the damage done by corruption. It's as if you are unique in your restraint, either because you're not benefiting or because you're stupid. You must choose...
Corruption takes many forms in politics, as in administration.
One of the reasons for needing this law was to develop banking and financial work and to help develop the financial markets with the aim of encouraging investment and capital influx by permitting the setting up of credit contracts.
We enumerated the benefits of the credit technology, thereby proving that the application of common ownership, which most developed countries do not use, was infeasible, especially given that the Credit Contracts Law essentially aims to be a useful tool for all the various financial operations, including those of collective investment and support organizations.
The Law on Practice and Experience, which brought out breaches and worked to avoid disputes and make municipal work more productive and effective as part of clear legal rules and financial independence, was included in the text of the proposed draft.

* Position of President of the Syndicate:
* General Authority:
It was noticeable that the difference in votes between the last winner for the General Authority and the first loser, George Numan (Free), was only 10 votes, with Numan scoring 2533 votes.
Immediately after the results were announced, the new President of the Syndicate was greeted by the previous President, Samir Dumat, and new and former members. He gave a speech thanking those who had voted for him and those who had allied themselves with him for their confidence in him.

For his part, Hamad rejected the accusations saying, "This great support for our list from the graduates of the American, Arab, Lebanese, Jesuit, Al-Alba, Al-Kaslik, and the graduates from America, Europe and the Arab States, not to mention the support of the engineering forces in the Al-Mustaqbal current, "Amal", the "Lebanese Forces, the Progressive Socialist Party, the National Bloc, the Brigades and the Baath, has scared them."
With these words, which were spoken by Chairman Arafat from his besieged headquarters in Ramallah, began the program "Under Siege" on "Aljazeera". The timing of the daily broadcast, after midnight, has encouraged most Arab viewers to try the hot and open political line, which has carried a wave of expressions of stinging criticism and sarcasm directed against Arab regimes. At times, some of it has even attacked or libeled Arab rulers. A large number of those ringing in have not hesitated to accuse them of conspiring with Israel in respect of events in the occupied Palestinian territories. Others have sarcastically asked for the program to be shown earlier because Arab leaders are fast asleep at that time.
It was also striking that most participants avoided rhetorical language and exaltation of the Arab nations. Nationalist language dominated and characterized the views of most of those contacting by telephone, fax or Internet.

The Directors of "Soyuzmultfilm" note the "brain-drain", which was the worst problem faced by the Russian film industry, not to mention that this necessitated that new specialists be trained, which requires not insignificant sums of money.

"Soyuzmultfilm" remains true to its old tradition of creating characters that are, above all else, kind and human.
The first event was the opening of the Al-Rashidiyyah school and the inauguration of the Al-Khayyarah school, followed by the laying of the foundation stone for the Al-Sultan Yaaqub School and Lucy School. Foundations stones were then laid at schools in Khirbat Ruha, then in Jub Farah and Izz Al-Arab. Foundations stones were also laid for two secondary schools in Al-Qaraun and Jub Jenin.

They asked that it continue in view of the elements of forbearance it provided.
He added, "We will overcome the deadly administrative routine, which prevents the wishes and needs of these areas being carried out in the south, the western Beqaa, Rashia and other areas."
The street responds by saying that this fact does not mean that the street and the masses accept their rulers, but that they fear them and the practices of their suppressive regimes, and that whilst they hide behind their pictures and banners, they conceal hatred for them and want rapid change. They accuse the Arab powers of not allowing societies to produce young leaders out of fear for themselves, despite having become weakness and incapable.
It is not possible to answer that - it is a dialogue and debate between the forces of the people first and then between them and the ruler.

He dealt with the elements of the culture of citizenship in Lebanon, identifying the relationship to place, people and authority, stressing that the self-confidence of citizens was the most important element of the culture of citizenship because there was no hope for the situation when the will gives in.

Minister Jan Lui Qirdahi then spoke, saying, "We must first get out of the division of the country on sectarian or religious grounds and work together so that we have a common sense of patriotism and citizenship, and of belonging to this country, which we must believe to be more than just a place of residence.
He then discussed the issue of justice, saying that sometimes it was relative. "We cannot build Plato's Republic but must interact with circumstances which are not always positive (...) I therefore call on the young people to be a permanent presence in their society with responsible citizenship, which will drive them to interact directly with the affairs of their towns and community and to participate in a significant way in this responsibility."
The meeting began with prayer. Participants were then split into discussion groups where they discussed topics relating to the concept of citizenship, ways to practice it, the obstacles before it, the relationship of the Lebanese to public place, the earth and the environment, the relationship with the other, the concept of the state, its role and the elements of democracy and civil society.

Baalbak - "Al-Nahar":
The garden that bears the name of the poet in which stands the statue hardly resembles a garden. There is no greenery, flowers or water and even the iron fence is broken. There is no electrical lighting and the electricity station remains before the statue in the middle of the Boulevard - one of a range of major and chronic blemishes obstructing the view.
Despite the Baalbak festivals the existing picture of the area remains as it was. Even the home of Khalil Mutran a few meters away is on the point of collapse with most of its walls cracked. Just looking at it makes one feel worse. Even the marble plaque bearing the name of the poet Mutran is showing the effects of nature and corrosion. The letters have lost their black color.

United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Anan yesterday began a visit to Cyprus, the first by the highest representative of the international organization in more than 20 years, in an attempt to get the suspended talks between the Greek and Turkish communities moving, as part of what he viewed as an "historic opportunity" and a message to the international community confirming its commitment to apply pressure for a settlement of the issue of the island, which has been partitioned since 1974.
He explained that the aim of his visit was "to confirm the major responsibility borne by the two leaders", with whom he wishes to discuss "a way to bring about progress in a more effective way, one that will allow the settlement of the key issues by the end of June". This is the deadline set by the two parties to complete the negotiations.
No information was available about discussions at the meeting, which journalists were prevented from covering, as had been the case on previous occasions.
Spokesman for the Cypriot Government Mikhalis Bababtro told "Al-Nahar" that the Cypriot side hoped that the visit would create an atmosphere conducive to progress, confirming, "The only solution is the implementation of United Nations resolutions".
Following his visit to Turkey last month he said, "No one expects the Greek Cypriots to agree to a solution after they have secured all these guarantees from the European Union."
It is the best of times for American Jews.
With the deterioration in the situation in the Middle East, which has reached a level not seen since the 1973 war, American Jews believe that Israel faces real danger.
On the other side, American Arabs, who number three million, and whose interests are represented by the American-Arab Institute and other groups, have recently strengthened their standing and influence, and politicians have increasingly begun to address their wishes as well.
Many analysts have sought an explanation for the American stance of strong support for Israel at a time when Washington needs the support of Arab countries for any potential action against the Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and for President George Bush's international war on "terror".
It showed that "the vast majority" prefer that the United States does not ally itself with either side, in order that it can be a more sincere and effective mediator.

He clarified that Bush slept at 9:30 pm after having watched local news and only read a few lines of reports written about the Middle East in the morning.
I said to him you are the President of the largest and most powerful state in the world and you have established political principles and values that focus on human rights and the application of justice. You have the ability to move along the path of a solution, justice and peace (...) I saw in American President George Bush junior a man with noble moral characteristics. He is sincere, brave and emotional. These are positive signs that show the potential for him to realize the just demands of the Palestinian issue and the Palestinian people."
He noted that Bush had laughed and told him, "Yes, you may be right. But I want to stress to you, Highness Prince Abdallah, that relations over 60 years between the Kingdom and the United States of America cannot be changed by a President or an administration because they are firm, solid strategic relations."
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Anan yesterday began a visit to Cyprus, the first by the highest representative of the international organization in more than 20 years, in an attempt to get the suspended talks between the Greek and Turkish communities moving, as part of what he viewed as an "historic opportunity" and a message to the international community confirming its commitment to apply pressure for a settlement of the issue of the island, which has been partitioned since 1974.
The Afghan Islamic News Agency, which is based in Islamabad, quoted witnesses as saying that at least three rockets fell near Khost airport in an attack at dawn yesterday. This is the most recent in a series of rocket attacks, which usually have no effect on the region and which target American and coalition forces.
The Israeli army yesterday assassinated the head of Palestinian General Intelligence in Halhul, Kahlid Abu Khiran, and his deputy, Ahmad Abd Al-Aziz Al-Zamahrah, in an attack on the town, which is situated north of the town of Hebron, the aim of which was to pursue and detain wanted activists.
14 others were detained in similar incursions in some of the villages under self-rule in the same area.

He compared the present situation "to the disaster of a train coming off its rails".
He also believed that any military action against Iraq would have "destructive" results for the Middle East and would "harm" the interests of the United States in the region.
This summit is the first held by the Federation since 1994.
A source in the Egyptian police reported yesterday that security forces have detained three cadres from the "Muslim Brothers" group in Alexandria on charges of "attempting to revive the banned organization" and to establish "illegal associations".
The group used to hold meetings in the home of its leader, Sayyid Tulbah (aged 28), who is accused of claiming to be a prophet and of claiming the ability to cure some diseases.
She said, "The release of the documents after this time comes in response to a British Law that declassifies the documents, which are owned by the institutions of the British state, after forty years."

14 others were detained in similar incursions in some of the villages under self-rule in the same area, including one in Dura, near Hebron, nine in Dir Al-Ghusun, near Tulkarem and three from Mazraah, near Jenin.
The Israeli Army accused the two officers of being responsible for "many of the attacks on Israelis" in the Hebron area.
The Izz Al-Din Al-Qassam Battalions, the military wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, have announced that one of its members, Amjad Al-Qutb, aged 26, was shot and killed by Israeli soldiers after he had managed to penetrate a military camp in the Jordan valley on Monday morning.
These officials at the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces visited in particular the strip close to the Arab Israeli town of Umm Al-Fahm, situated to the north of Jenin, and the strip close to the Tulkarem-Qalqilyah axis parallel to Israel.
They said that the court adopted the view of the General Security Agency Shin Bet, which believed that the meeting between Al-Barghuti and his lawyer Jawad Bulus could not take place for "security reasons".
He added at Al-Shaikh Zaid Hospital in Ramallah where he is being treated, "This act is strange to Palestinian manners, to the Palestinian people and our principles."

He added, "The world is not as it was before the 11 September attacks." He noted, "Multilateral maneuvers like Cobra Gold are essential for us all to be able to frustrate those terrorists and eliminate their networks in the region and the world."
18 countries were invited to attend the maneuvers as observers, compared with four two years ago. They include: Australia, Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Fiji, France, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mongolia, the Philippines, Russia, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Tonga and Vietnam.
Relations between Malaysia and the United States became tense when the American administration declared its opposition to the isolation and imprisonment of Mahatir's rival, former Vice President Anwar Ibrahim in 1998.
Following his meeting with the American Defense Minister Donald Rumsfield he said, "The response is no because this is not our foreign policy and we still trust the capability of our national police and army to confront these dangers."

She said that she was "completely innocent of the charges of broadcasting news inside Jordan and abroad that contained falsehood and threatened the authority and reputation of the state, insulted the respect of its personnel and incited to disturbances and the committing of crimes". She added, "Throughout her life she had defended the Jordanian people and its fundamental issues, foremost of which is to combat all forms of corruption and to confront those who betray the trust with which they have been charged."
Jordanian officials have branded her "a liar" and demanded that she provide evidence of her claims.
In her defense Faisal revealed that Abu Al-Ragheb had offered her a bribe in return for her ending her criticisms of him. "The bribe included three cars and a sum of money the value of which he left me to determine. I responded that I refused this, which has led to my trial."
She read her defense in a loud voice and sharp tone. The Chief Judge of the Court Col. Tail Al-Raqqad interrupted her repeatedly and warned her that she must stop "insulting and libeling the court, the public prosecution and the government".
In a "friendly" meeting between the communist leader and Carter, who is on the first visit by an American President to this country since 1959, during which they exchanged handshakes, smiles and expressions of admiration, there appeared clear and irresolvable differences between the two men on these two issues.
He began his day by meeting two human rights activists who had spent time in prison.
Castro had confirmed that Carter had the freedom to visit all research centers on the island following American accusations that Cuba was working to deploy biological weapons and pass on sophisticated equipment in this field to countries that Washington believes to be pariah states.
Whilst Carter was visiting scientific establishments on the island, American Secretary of State Colin Powell told the ABC American television network before heading for Reykjavik to attend a NATO meeting, "We believe that Cuba is capable of conducting research in the sphere of biological attacks".
He said that the White House was worried at Castro's biological program.

The Palestinian people have left bleeding.
There is no civilian or military institution that has not been ruined.
But no one has surrendered.
The Palestinian civil war has not taken place.
Is that not much?
This charter would include a condemnation of every Palestinian action that went outside the national consensus, whether in respect of operations inside the 1948 territory or which harm civilians, whatever the considerations.
Is it not fundamentally shameful that the demand for transparency should be American instead of being exclusively an Arab democratic demand?
He who was once considered a loss, by being raised on the cross, was the same person to appear triumphant.
There is no place in pure democratic logic for an agreement to a settlement candidate, to recommend a candidate, or for a collective withdrawal of candidates in the interest of a principle of congruence, in the manner that is today proposed in the by-election battle in Al-Matan, irrespective of whether the motive therefor is the wish of religious authorities or the efforts of political leaders to avoid the cup of victory and defeat.
For so long as the oppositionists have adopted the by-election battle as the ground for a political and democratic struggle with the authority, which constitutes the best, most successful and most important means in terms of its yield in the context of the domestic democratic struggle, any retreat from the battle in its multi-candidacy form would constitute a dangerous withdrawal for this camp, which is morally superior to the authority despite the imbalance in powers imposed by the political reality from which the authority draws its strength.
For the "Qarnat Forum" enjoys an unusual flexibility in this form of agreement and settlement after its pillars were unable to put forward a candidate in the Forum's name under regional pretexts that could not hide the structural weaknesses that continues to tarnish this gathering, which succeeded in seeking shade under the Bikirki roof in respect of the issue of Syrian influence but was then shaken to its depths when it entered the maze of its first electoral test, which appeared to provide an outlet for personal and self-centered accounts.
So long as part of the opposition are convinced that the election game is an effective means for democratic struggle then they must continue down that path without turning back.
Something of democracy has begun to afflict the opposition and there is no scope to deny or conceal the fact.
On the 14th of May this year the Iranians celebrated the 110th anniversary of Al-Mirza Al-Shirazi, the strongest religious authority in Iran at that time, issuing his famous fatwa prohibiting the use of tobacco. The people obeyed and threw the water pipes off the roofs of their buildings into the streets, in what was known as the "tobacco uprising", thereby causing the British authorities to submit to the volition of the Iranians.
There are many studies and views in the history of contemporary Iran that analyze the phenomenon of the men of religion and their place in Iranian society, and whether they constitute a social class or not.
In the Safavid period their political strength grew after they grew closer to the Safavid "Shahs", who relied on the scholars as one of the pillars of their rule. But many of them removed themselves from government and turned to the teaching of the religious sciences alone.
The clerics would walk in the streets and the people would bow before them putting their right hand on their chest in respect, as is the social custom in Iran.
And many Iranian clerics have confessed to making mistakes when they came to official positions.
The circle of associates demanding that the Authority conduct fundamental reforms to the administrative structure is widening around Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat.
Voices said that it was not the time for reforms because that was to meet with American demands and the statements of George Bush.
Amidst this disastrous confusion, in which Ramallah is drowning, anything can happen.
It is an obsolete habit to link every democratic trend, every free and liberal movement and every call for honest, straight and just administration with the American or Zionist conspiracy.
The issue between him and the Palestinians who have been left by Sharon to see Arafat as a man who bargains even as he ends his 100 days of solitude, as in the Garcia Marquez title.
This is a natural phenomenon.
His opponents move between Professor Edward Said, who, initially, was one of his supporters, and now Nabil Amr, who was one of his confidantes.
And that is not how the situation is.

The present case, which was brought by the attorneys for 23 Palestinians in June 2001 against Sharon, has led to tension in relations between Israel and Belgium.
But the session to be held today follows two rulings in separate cases relating to accusations against former Congolese Foreign Minister  Yerodia Abdoulaye Ndombasi of committing war crimes in 2000, which were issued by the International Court of Justice in The Hague and the Appeals Court in Brussels confirming the immunity of the Congolese minister from prosecution in Belgium.
And there is nothing to link Sharon with Belgium."
No arrest warrant has yet been issued against Sharon, but this is likely if the case is accepted.
Syriac Catholic Patriarch Receives "Palestinian-Lebanese Monitoring Committee".
I, in my position as Patriarch of the Catholic Antioch Syriacs in the world, found the spotlight on me despite the fact that for over 36 years I have been working in a modest way and in secret to help any group of the Palestinian people in its trial, which has continued for a long time.
Al-Khatib then spoke, saying, "We promise the Patriarch that we will not betray the blood of the martyrs. The Patriarch was silent, working in secret, and has come down into the arena to embody his true Christianity as it was embodied in the person of the Messiah on the day he confronted the blind leaders, the Pharisees and the thieves, raising his voice and expelling them from the Temple.
We praise God that this foundation has been built, in our Lebanon, on an everlasting rock, namely the sense of justice, which is firmly established in the conscience of the Lebanese.
(Christ).
As for the government, it is supported by the people of this world and religion, and so is not peaceable.
Everyone mistakenly agrees that it must be increased, just as they agree to violate the following explicit provisions:
And so we said, write in the name of the Lebanese people with the exception of Matanius Eid."
This explicit text limits the powers of urgent justice to an individual judge in whose competency the basis of the dispute lies.
And that the urgent measure be taken in cases of rent by a single judge competent in cases of rent.
"The judge in the matter of the case, as with the judge in urgent matters, may... take...all temporary measures."
May God protect these articles against being updated or revoked, as is the case with every just and fair law!

The Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine organized a protest in front of Al-Askua, in which Deputies Nasir Qandil and Walid Eido, Head of Journalists Syndicate Muhammad Baalbaki and member of the Front's Political Bureau Ali Faisal spoke.
The Association of Private Organizations organized a march in which two hundred boys and girls took part. It set off from the Ailbun Club for the "Abu Jihad" Minister sports ground under the slogan "No Return from Right to Return". Those participating bore pictures of the Catastrophe and the Intifada.
The Parties condemned "the suspicious international silence at what took place in Jenin Camp and the expulsion of the owners of the land from their land, which constitutes a precedent that cannot be accepted".
The Foreign Affairs and Expatriates Committee has discussed the work of the ministerial committee for the Arab peace initiative, which will hold its first meeting at the end of this week in Beirut "to approve its procedural mechanism, especially following the challenges that have arisen since the summit meeting was held at the end of last March in Beirut".
He continued, "Holding a conference will lead to the proposal of a new formula derived from the priorities of American policy in the region, especially after the events of the 11th of last September, which are exploited by Israel and which are in the interest of Israel.
The committee asserted "the need for the establishment of an effective Arab movement, in diplomacy, politics and the media, towards the capitals of the resolution and the United Nations, the European Union and friendly states."
- The draft law laid down in Decree number 7604 (concluding an agreement to encourage and protect mutual investments between the Lebanese Republic and the Republic of Gabon.
- The draft law laid down in Decree number 7548 ratifying an agreement to strengthen and protect investments between the Lebanese Republic and the Republic of Hungary.
The Public Works, Transportation and Energy Committee has ratified a draft law laid down in Decree number 7656 to exempt the Lebanon Electricity Organization from charges payable on the issue of collection orders related to arrears accumulated by subscribers. It continued with discussion of the plan to rescue and develop the company by focusing on collection and violations.
He added that the committee had confirmed its support for the company to deal with these obstacles, to seek the assistance of the security forces when necessary and to inform it of the results within one month.
Sealing in Sidon, Jubb Jenin and Rayaq has begun.
There is optimism for the future of the electricity sector in spite of the magnitude of the problems facing it, and there is hope that a financial balance will be attained at the beginning of the coming year if there are no adverse surprises, such as strikes, and provided that the sector can by moved from loss to profit in the near future."
The law has not yet been issued, and there is no connection between this information and privatization.
If we took the highest proportion of invoicing, which is in Beirut, the proportion of invoicing in Administrative Beirut is 87.6%, which means that 12.4% of invoices have not been issued.
If we attain collection of 90 per cent it will be very good.
No Agreement on One Candidate in Al-Matan; Mukhaibar Submits Candidacy to Interior.

At the same time the communications led by Archbishop Joseph Basharah, who yesterday visited President of the Republic Emil Lahud, continued.
He said, "I will take a stance on this subject later, especially given that the battle is still at its early stages.
Is there a readiness for a consensus for the national interest?
"The Federation of Lebanese Christian Unions" condemned the explosion that took place in Tripoli and targeted a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant. They demanded that the perpetrators be pursued and brought to justice.
If the constitution does not hold sway, its text is not binding and the mechanisms for which it provides are not implemented when there is a difference of views on public matters affecting the interests of citizens and the state at the same time.
The Federation strongly condemns such an approach and believes that it represents a serious setback for the security credibility of the state at a time when the twin factors of security and stability are being exploited to attract tourists and investments.
The Federation also condemns the explosion that took place in Tripoli, the capital of the North, which strikes at the heart of the Lebanese economy, affects the interests of the people, harms individual initiative and helps "export" capital abroad at a time when the state is working and offering facilities, at times tempting, to attract it. It also demands that the state pursue the perpetrators and those who pushed them to this act and bring them to justice."
When Arafat is no longer able to meet the Palestinian people at the sites of their misfortune when he wishes and for whatever reason, this constitutes a major source of imbalance in the relationship between the head of the Authority and the people.
From this perspective, one must examine the fact that the American President has reached the maximum in his stances in support of Israel, whilst having dropped to the bare minimum in preserving the nominal and symbolic support for President Arafat, after some Arab friends warned him of the consequence of getting rid of Arafat and creating an alternative authority, one that would implement Israeli orders, because that would be tantamount to treating the error from which Israel and America complain with a greater error.
However, the vote of the Likud Party against the establishment of the Palestinian state does not address the Palestinians as much as it addresses the Israeli people, who wander about and become embroiled with themselves over this and other issues, with many supporting the idea of establishing a state in return for a secure life.
But the state of Palestine is still on paper in the delusions of some and a reality in the dreams of others.
All the evidence shows that the dual American-Israeli election auctions, which are automatically inter-related, will see further escalation in the field.
The hope remains that Bush will recall that it was he who committed himself to establish the Palestinian state some months earlier, whether by conviction or by compulsion.

In the Central Audit Authority, a member has been appointed as a proxy member (Atif Al-Muqallid). He is a member of the Supreme Disciplinary Authority, and this has aroused comments on the duality of tasks assigned to him and the need to separate the members of the Authority, those which accuse the employee and those that try him.
The issue of vacancies is also casting its shadow on the Ministry of Information amidst a state of confusion.
According to the same sources, a temporary solution to the current problem may be adopted, which will lead to entrusting the tasks laid down in the contracts to those concerned, with compensation for the difference in salary stated in the contracts with allowances for production given to the contractors by a decision of the minister.
The Ministry has received visits from contractors, who have complained that departments have refused to receive them, even though they have obtained the required certificates and qualifications.
At the same time as the ministerial sources hope that the atmosphere of quiet prevailing currently will be reflected positively on appointments to the Civil Service, they do not deny that the recovery of confidence and respect for the project proposed by the Minister, Ghazi Al-Uraidi, might require some time, especially after absenteeism has returned to the departments in the ministry.

"Banking Business Horizons Conference in Syria in Light of Arab Experiments" did not issue its recommendations on concluding its business yesterday.

The translation was carried out by Hartmut Fendrich, who believed in his introduction that "Additional Days" was not just a specifically Lebanese novel. The reader discovers Lebanon as a background, as a screen on which the writer projects his "literary canvas", which is about human experience: the slow withdrawal and gradual isolation of a man retreating from the world, from his world.
The translator continues, saying that the European reader may be surprised at the writer beginning the writing of the novel in 1983, at the height of the Lebanese war, and awaiting the events of that war, which he does not find.
Since the 1950s many Arab writers and educated elite believed literature to be part of or a social-political duty.
In Lebanon, we can find the influence of Sartre literature, which has dominated more than that of Andre Jayyid or Proust.

The spread of religion in Andalusia bore the same circumstances as the French "mandate", with the latter representing the great expansion of colonialism and the industrial age.
And just as the Umayyad Kings fled fearing the tyranny of the Abbasids, and became princes in Andalusia, so too the most important reason for the Ottoman "conquest", as we have studied in the curriculum, was the extension of Safavid rule in the Levant.
In the relationship of the Arabs, the most famous, with the West in Andalusia, three messages emerged: the first was the Aristotelian rationality of Ibn Rushd; the second was the Sufi "control" and irrationality, by means of sanctifying specific spiritual terms, of Muhyi Al-Din Ibn Arabi; and the third was the so-called immorality and permissiveness of the Muwashah poetry of that era.

And when the clash took place for a second time, with force, many Arab regimes threw the West's cards into the oven (the campaigns of treachery following the revolution of the Free Officers in Egypt in 1952, the campaigns of treachery following 1967 and the most famous example of treachery that took place in the 1980s when shots were fired in all directions).

The first of the pictures hanging on the wall of the Sarsaq Museum edited by the Brazilian photographer Carlos Farrer on "Marguerite Yourcenar the Last Journey" that attracted my attention was the watercolor surrounded by plants which bore the date of birth of the great writer. But the date of death remained blank, and under it there was an expression from her, she who came to her grave before her death:
The photographs will be exhibited in Beirut and Sidon as major events on this occasion.
"If it entered my mind that Lebanon would be my next project, it would be because on my way to the Sarsaq Museum from my hotel, where I was welcomed like a prince, I was dazzled by the light. This light that will enter into the heart of the matter."
My father, the publisher, put me in a warm atmosphere of books.
How did Carlos Farrer come to know Marguerite Yourcenar?
This question led to a number of meetings.
On the day she came to France I prepared for her a visit to the Sulfur Sciences Museum in the Horticultural Gardens to see the set of stones of Rojet Kayua, whom she succeeded in the French Academy.
How were her daily dealings with her friends?

The Mar Elias Maronite Sisters of the Holy Family Secondary School in Al-Batrun opened an exhibition of books and literary publications under the title "Reading is the Food of the Spirit and Intellectual Development". It was attended by the Deputy Patriarch General to the diocese of Al-Jubbah, Bishop Francis Al-Bisri, Director of the Convent, Mother Josephine Wahbah, members of the teaching staff and a large number of pupils' families and interested persons.

He announced, "The Directorate General of Antiquities at the Ministry of Culture carried out works to qualify the archaeological site in Jubail, with the assistance of the Canadian province of Quebec. The site has become easier and clearer for the development of history and architecture to be understood in Jubail from the Neolithic Age to the present time, passing through all the stages through which Jubail passed through over more than seven thousand years. A museum has been established inside the citadel, which will be opened shortly.
The Al-Hikmah University has announced that its Chancellor, Monsignor Joseph Murhij, will participate in the European Mediterranean Universities Conference to be held in the Al-Wasat University in the Tunisian City of Susa.

These men were placed under heavy security guard on the top floor of the "Flamingo Beach" Hotel in the tourist city of Larnaca.
Tens of times has the Greek phrase for "Welcome" rung in my ears whenever I have set foot on the land of the natural island close to Lebanon. It was the first possible land when the flames of war spread and burnt the lives of the Lebanese and those living in our land.
It was a stop for tens of thousands of them during the Lebanese war, including politicians, media figures, artists, businessmen and ordinary citizens.
How many people met friends whom they had not seen since childhood. How many families met and discovered that their members were alive after contacts between people collapsed during the dark days.
Should we return?
What is this fate?
I whispered in gratitude, "Afkharyesto, Afkharyesto."
This is Germany's second defeat in 13 games with Wales since 1968. The first was in 1991, with the same result, in the European Nations Championship qualifiers, also in Cardiff.
* In Al-Riyadh, Saudi Arabia defeated Senegal 3-2 (first half 1-1).
For the winning side, goals were scored by Fratislav Grisko, Joseph Kozli (2) and Marik Mintal in the 5th, 47th, 79th and 85th minutes. For the losing side, goals were scored by Zain Al-Din Tujiev in the 48th minute.
On Liverpool's web site the player said, "The recovery period from this operation is six weeks.
Arsenal's Swedish midfielders Fredrik Ljungberg was chosen best player in the league, whilst his French team mate Thierry Henry received the "golden boot" for achieving the title of leading goal scorer with 24 goals. Newcastle United trainer Bobby Robson received an achievement award for leading his team to fourth place and for participation in the European Champions League next season.
Two weeks ago this vision was put under a hot flame when it was said that Bush was shifting towards announcing a conception for a solution based on "a program for settlement and a schedule". This set matters alight on two fronts:
At the same time as Powell stressed that "the international conference" would be held in the second half of next July under "my chairmanship", Bush told journalists on the fringe of his meeting with Sharon a few days ago, "The time is not appropriate for this conference to be held, because no one trusts the new Palestinian government under Yasir Arafat's leadership".
And what is the something that "resembles territory but is not determined in its final form"?
The Promised Plan.
So Bush, who is extremely eager for a second term, will not run the risk of not ensuring a Republican majority, and has given an example of his power to please when he employed all his powers in his recent meeting with Ariel Sharon.
The fact is that Sharon's intimation surpasses the conditional "if" which he has placed in relation to the plan because it will not please him if it refers to a temporary, transitional or permanent Palestinian state. Nor will it please him if it relies to some extent on the content of the Saudi initiative. Nor will any talk about an international conference in which Syria participates please him, nor etc. Perhaps what is most important is that it is not probable, even if he wanted, that he would say "Yes" to any plan, because his Likud opponent, Benyamin Netanyahu, dreams about pouncing upon it, just as the non-Likud extreme right dreams about it.

Fundamentalism is a contradiction of Lebanon, its spirit, its mission and its message, to the same extent that it is the contradiction of the Gospel and Christian churches.
The investigation has begun with the bishop's attacker, who is called Carlos Abbud, and also with Raymun Makhluf, who are from the Zaghrata District.
They wondered about "the feasibility of security personnel standing as false witnesses in the face of this abhorrent crime".
Harb in Bikirki: Al-Matan Elections a Message, Government Must Respond.
The truth that must be said is that no opportunity must be given for any mistaken interpretation. The elections were an occasion on which the people expressed their opinion at what is taking place. It was a clear message to the government, calling it to take into account that the practices in which it engaged in the recent past were not acceptable to the people, and that the people have rejected them and given expression to them via the ballot box.
This victory is no more than a step on a long road and what is required of us all is that we plan in order to move forward successfully.
In his sermon Deputy Chairman of the Supreme People's Islamic Council Sheikh Abd Al-Amir Qablan believed, "The conditions of the people are suffocating and we see nothing to reassure us and satisfy the people in the existing treatments. Poverty has reached frightening levels and need sometimes is so desperate that reality is denied and confronted with unsatisfactory consequences. When this happens it will drag us into problems and disasters that we do not need.
We say to officials: Give back the people the rights that you previously gave them before taking them back through the new laws. This can only happen when natural alternatives are provided for them, which allow them to continue.
Following the cancellation of Serbian presidential elections after failing to achieve the participation of 50% of eligible voters, political chaos dominated Serbia.  Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica vowed to topple the Serbian government of Prime Minister Zoran Djindic, who supported Miroljub Labus, his rival in the elections.
Kostunica said he will use his popularity to topple Djindic's government, which he accused of corruption, establishing links with organized crime groups, and adopting "dictatorial" policies similar to those of Milosevic.
Kostunica indicated that before holding new elections, new laws must be adopted.
The dispute hindered the parliament's work and kept pro-democracy elements away from their leaders.
League Party Close To Musharaf Willing To Form Government With Islamists; Joint Exercises; Kashmir
Although Azhar was defeated in the elections, his party won 77 out of 272 seats in the National Assembly.
"We do not need U.S. bases. (...) We do not need foreign soldiers on our land."
Asked his opinion of the activities of U.S. forces on Pakistani bases while F.B.I. agents continue to chase members of al-Qaeda led by Usama bin Laden, he replied, "It is a negotiable matter. Yes, negotiable."
A statement from the Pakistan army reported that U.S. Operations Commander in Afghanistan General Tommy Franks will head a high-ranking delegation to Pakistan this week to attend part of the exercises.
The ruling National Party, which has had the greater say in determining Kashmir's  policies for more than 50 years, announced it will continue to be in the competition to form the government, in spite of its defeat in the elections.
It was expected that the two major opposition parties would get enough support to form a coalition government before the constitutional period ends on October 17, but after the events of yesterday's meetings, it seems that the issue is not yet finalized.
In an interview with television news network NTV, he said, "A large-enough force can form a security belt inside the Iraqi territory to preserve the security of our borders," if the United States intervenes in Iraq.
On Saturday, Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit expressed his displeasure with the demands of the two Kurdish factions in northern Iraq, which want Kirkuk to be the "capital" of Iraq's Kurdistan, and he considered that things are going "too far."
It fears that such a state might trigger once again a separatist sentiment in some of Turkey's Kurdish areas, which launched a 15-year armed rebellion from 1984 to 1999 against the Turkish government.
Ecevit was not surprised to hear the crowds cry, "No to war," but he was undoubtedly surprised when they shouted, "Death to America."
"But America as a country is a friendly ally, and we will make every possible effort to keep it away from war."
Tehran confirmed that it objects to any unilateral military action against Iraq, and it condemned American plans to establish an American military junta in Iraq after toppling President Saddam Hussein.
Khatami added, "The world and our region reject any unilateral military action against Iraq."
Former Iranian President Hujjatul Islam Ali Akbar Hashimi Rafsanjani said, "I hope there will be no war, but if an American attack against Iraq takes place, we will assume a neutral position."
The head of an international team of experts investigating Ukraine's sale of a military radar system to Iraq, Alan Van Igmond, described his meeting with officials in Kiev yesterday as "very encouraging." This was at the start of a ten-day mission. The mission agenda does not include meeting President Leonid Kuchma.
"They are built on sand and are nothing serious."
Presidency spokesman Anatoli Cocerinco explained that the experts held talks with Medfidcoc and "representatives of the Ministry of Defense and the Military- Industrial Organization" in their first formal meeting. U.S. Ambassador Carlos Pascual and British Ambassador Robert Brinkley also attended the meeting.
Melenitcinco, who was granted political asylum in the United States, refused to hand over the recordings to Kiev.
In Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad said, "It is not easy to organize an [Islamic Conference] Organization  meeting, but we will try."
One of assumptions that the Yemeni detectives are investigating is the possibility of remote-controlled bombing.
Meanwhile, Yemeni officials said that at least seven sailors who were near the Limpor at the time of the blast claimed seeing a flash on board the tanker but saw no boat heading towards it.
A police official later stated that police are interrogating a British employee unknown to the Canadian company Nixon Incorporated. The Briton was investigated after a tiny piece from a small boat was found in the company's offices inside the Dabba oil exporting dock in Al-Mukalla port.
No reason for that was clear.
It was understood that most of them can leave Yemen as of Tuesday, except for the captain and one of the sailors, both of whom are required to stay by the Yemeni authorities for a few more days "for investigation purposes."
Compared to what is happening in many places around the world (Yemen, Indonesia, Pakistan, Kashmir, and other places), and threats looming in the region (Iraq and Palestine), some internal Lebanese issues seem beyond our times, such as the useless arguments over election polls (two and a half years before the elections), the Lebanese-Lebanese rivalry, and even conflict with Israel over the al-Wazzani River water pump.
In the middle of this hell we are heading for, we still have some parties in Lebanon that find it appropriate to use and promote extremism in dealing with internal political issues, which have become not more than a ordinary detail compared to what will happen to Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the entire Arab Gulf area in the coming weeks.
Toppling the Iraqi regime and occupying the country, overthrowing the Palestinian Authority and cracking down on the Intifada (uprising), and reoccupying Palestinian territories-and moreover, things may even develop to the point of mass displacement ... Here lies the difference between major and minor issues.
Briefly, Lebanon will be better protected if it absorbs the significance of the coming phase, which will be the stage of "superiors."
The 16th Annual Cairo International Film Festival will be inaugurated in the Egyptian Opera House tonight, Tuesday. Festival events will continue until October 26.
Greek director Michael Cacoyannis and the Spanish Carlos Saura and Merchant besides the French directors Alain Corneau, Maren Carmitz and the Greek actress Irene Papas.
A special celebration will also be organized commemorating the 50th anniversary of the July 23rd Revolution. A series of films titled "Thawratun Hazzat al A'alam" will be shown.
And after "Palestine and the Peace," the Laic Activities Union and Famic Social City (organizers of the Festival) selected this year to highlight the art of Egyptian film by showing four fiction films and one short film and by organizing a fair for the Egyptian art of painting.
"The Red Dragon," in which Hopkins plays the role of Doctor Hannibal Lecter, remained on top of the list for the third time in the second week, generating USD 17.6 million in three days after it was first shown last Friday.
The movie "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" has dropped one rank from the fourth position to the fifth, generating USD 7.9 million.
Benigni, who won the Oscar Award for his role in "Life is Beautiful," dominated the Pinocchio movie in which he is the hero, i.e., the wooden toy-boy whose nose gets longer whenever he lies.

He promised to remain alert for any sign of change in the behavior of Palestinians in order to achieve peace next year.
It is also said that the start of that tendency was the "strong" message delivered to him by the U.S. ambassador in Israel, criticizing the Israeli government's failure to reduce the Palestinians' humanitarian suffering.
That is, of course, in addition to the tendency expressed by the hawks of the U.S. administration, which does not recognize Israel's presence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as an occupation. Even if the administration wants to control Sharon's reactions, then there would be two questions: Can Bush convince Sharon not to do something he is not capable of preventing himself from doing, namely controlling the use of power? Does he really want to do so, or will he try to postpone any Israeli reaction?
And now he sees the American attack against Iraq as a unique opportunity to force his will on the Palestinians.
Sahar Baasiri
Part of the statement read:
"Mr. Junbulat has participated or has been represented in all the successive governments since Al-Taif Pact was approved. As an MP, minister, and leader, he bears the responsibility of participating in the ungainly settlements that have been made against people's interests. He bears the responsibility of participating in issuing decrees and laws violating the constitution and the National Accord document, as well as the responsibility of participating in economic policies that destroyed people and forced them to emigrate."
"We would like to invite Mr. Junbulat to a calm debate around the mishandled issues, such as the citizenship issue, and ask him if he accepts, in the name of the Lebanese that he represents, granting citizenship to people who have nothing to do at all with Lebanon and have never visited or lived in it."
"We are asking these questions from the patriotic, not sectarian, point of view. We have concerns for the identity and Arabism of Lebanon."
"We are not in possession of talents for verbal defense of the Lebanese poor while participating with the big guys in sucking the blood of the poor."
"We lack the talent for adopting double standards. Rather, we have adopted simplicity, sincerity, transparency, modesty, and boldness in defending Lebanon and its Arabism, exactly as did Kamal Junbulat and, before him, Nadheera Junbulat."
He lectured in Arabic.
These documents highlighted several matters, the most important of which are:
- Securing permanent military bases in the Arab Gulf instead of temporary ones.
- Launching preemptive strikes or wars if American interests and security are threatened.
This current enjoys a powerful influence on all classes, as it basically depends on religion and politics, and it also cooperates with the Israeli lobby.
- Controlling the strategic location of Iraq, as it remains a gap in the chain of U.S. military bases spread out from the Balkans to Central Asia, passing through Southeast Asia all the way to the Arab Gulf. So, the only remaining opponents of the new world order among this combination are Iraq and Iran.
- Weakening the European influence in the region.
Once again, Lebanon is victorious through its self-confidence, which it accompanied by deeds and succeeded in incorporating itself with developed countries.
The Hebrew state has historical ambitions towards the Lebanese water resources that have remained unchanged since the French-British negotiations in 1916 to draw the borders between Lebanon and Palestine.
As such, the water issue remained pending until the project of drawing al-Wazzani water came to stir anew an alleged Israeli dream associated with the logic of piracy and might, which is refuted by the international community despite the complicated circumstances that the region is witnessing, through which Israel is trying to seize water after having failed to seize land, neither of which belong to it.
Wadee Al-Khazin
The Arab position is clear. In fact it is extremely clear in its ambiguity, weakness, and helplessness, to the extent that the outlines of this position are starting to fade out, and they need a miracle to be redrawn properly.
Arabs are practicing their daily lives in a state of paranoia, so there is no need to take the initiative for anything.
"As such, we cannot deceive the Arab people once again, as happened after 1990."
However, the other war might not take place in the known, traditional manner. Rather, this war might produce its "fruits" in accordance with what al-Hajjaj bin Yusuf al-Thaqafi said to the people of Iraq in his first address to them: "I can see ripe heads, and now is the time to reap them."
Some circles in Washington expect the following sequence of events:
The American policy is currently working on "borrowing" the style of the historic Arab character, Antara.
Everyone is asking about timing: When, where, and how?
It is clear so far that the Iraqi opposition, who appear constantly in the media and on TV in particular, might not be the natural alternative to any radical change in the Baghdad ruling hierarchy.
Stop this hypocrisy! We will not shed many tears if the Iraqi regime is changed and the rest of the Iraqi people are kept well and safe.
- Demanding withdrawal of the Syrian army from Lebanese territory is extremism, whereas finding a minor withdrawal at its end is moderation and wisdom.
- Finding it strange to see mutual slander between ministers and their superior and among one another is extremism that must be exchanged with a view that such soft disagreements are merely a slight and normal variation in points of view stemming from their excellencies' desire to feed the hungry and put an end to the emigration of Lebanese youth.
- The passing of a week or more without praising the merits of guests in our land is negative extremism, as opposed to the moderation in daily recognition of the blessing of having them among us.
Dear Reader, truth and righteousness do not know moderation, because they are part of the essence of the absolute, no matter how harsh they get.
They are like fire. The faster it ignites, the faster it is extinguished.
For in the end a human, no matter how high he rises, will be laid in a wooden coffin.
Some of them even avoided passing by the place where he was sitting with a number of his friends and preferred to pass a few meters away from him to avoid greeting him.
Usually, there are many visitors to this garden in summer, as Sofer's climate is somewhat cool. Hence, the hotel management hires a musical band to play all day long every Sunday in the spacious garden, which is frequently filled with tourists and residents of the hotel, its neighbors, and/or some rich people. Tables and chairs are also spread around this place.
He turned to his friends around him, shocked by the initiative of the lady who had been his friend for years and who was also the president's sister. She went on, "Come on.... Come on."
Shortly afterwards, Yomna learned that Sheikh Beshara and Sheikh Fuad requested to see her as soon as possible.
"We do not accept it, but we do not want make a problem out of it."
After listening very carefully, she answered him, "And do you know that nothing lasts forever?"
"And do not forget also that authority is not eternal."
"And we may never rejoice at the misfortunes of others."
Two or more weeks ago, you published in al-Nahar an Amal movement banner with a linguistic error in its text.
Needles to say, the error here was a misprint.
Perhaps this was more than a response to the hostile media campaigns against announcing some plans.
This is the reason why the Jordanian king is always trying to jump over the classic Jordanian position, which says that it is too early to discuss Jordanian-Palestinian federalism, and it could be discussed "when the independent Palestinian state is established." The new king is making the following contribution: "The confederation issue is absolutely improbable, both in the present and in the future."
As such, there is no more to say: Jordan is getting itself out of the Palestinian issue and will not deal with any negotiations or scenarios, whether closely or remotely, with the sole exception of the return of Palestinian refugees resident in its territory to their homeland in Palestine.
I believe this position has become obsolete. However, the alternative is not yet available.
However, he "suspended" the handing of administration of the West Bank to the Palestinian Liberation Organization after it was made in terms of overseeing the gradual emigrations through open bridges, persisting with the Jordanian role in Jerusalem, the ambiguous alliance with the Islamic Resistance Movement in Palestine (Hamas), intensive and continuous intervention in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, the attempt to influence the Israeli decision from within, and so on.
I do not find it likely that the current situation of those people will be approved. Most probably, the Jordanian position will be similar to what happened in Lebanon, where there was insistence that all refugees and emigrants return to their homeland under any final settlement of the Palestinian issue.
It was quite remarkable that in response to a question regarding a potential role for Prince al-Hassan in Iraq, he said, "The leadership of any country must be chosen by its people."  He continued, "Jordan is not thinking of playing any role in Iraq, either closely or remotely," and "If you are talking about the Hashemite family, I am the leader of that family, and I am saying it very clearly: the Hashemite family has no desires to rule Iraq again."
It is time for Iraqis to enjoy peace of mind following the promise of President George Bush that their salvation is drawing nearer, and that he will not rest before saving them from the injustice they are suffering and granting them liberty, welfare, and prosperity.
Bush relieved the hearts of the people of Iraq and neighboring countries when he told them that his war against that country is to recover Iraq's unity after it was torn apart through the practices of its rulers.
The oil of Iraq will be for Iraqis and only Iraqis.
The budget surplus will be transferred to the benefit of scientific research and technological development, after the Iraqis had become close to being plunged into a state of ignorance and illiteracy.
And as this stage will be extremely sensitive and crucial, the new after-war-ruler will assign the task of running the country to an American General who will be a neutral person and does not discriminate among Iraqis.
This is because it is the best guarantee of sovereignty, independence, and freedom of decision for peoples who are not strong enough to build their independence, sovereignty, and free decision-making.
Soon, the suppressed peoples all over the world will be jealous of them.
In the name of making history they were driven to their deaths, and in the name of erasing that history they are now being driven to the same fate. In the name of their honor and dignity they were dragged into war, and in the name of relieving them of their suffering they are being dragged into it once again.
In fact, one of the things that drove me to attend the late Dr. Jamal Attassi's forum was that this forum was established for us to train ourselves in how to accept one another.
To me, belief in God is unquestionable, and I consider the existence of God and the Day of Judgment as indisputable.
To me, atheism or belief is an option a person chooses by himself and for himself.
(10/11/2002) made local observers wonder whether the young Jordanian king has been hasty in announcing the new political thinking of the fourth kingdom, especially since ambiguous scenarios regarding Jordan and its future regional policies are circulating in political circles.
That is why the king is promptly attempting to skip over the typically ambiguous form of the Jordanian position (which was along the lines of saying that the confederation issue is not yet "mature" or that it is "to be discussed when the independent Palestinian state is established") in favor of the following explicit declaration: "The confederation issue is absolutely improbable, both in the present and in the future."

Zionism in a Hundred Years
What happened in Failaka is an attempt to draw attention and achieve maximum political gain from an organization that has members who receive orders and carry them out regardless of the ultimate interests of their homeland. This is because they have been stripped of the ability to think properly. However, their goals are clear, and the methods
"I want," says Sharon, "to be fully clear on this point, and we are willing to give this issue the concern needed."
No doubt and definitely Sharon knows that Lebanon has no intention of "provoking" him and that it does not need such an adventure to trigger Sharon's tendency toward destruction, which will lead to the destruction of Lebanon's infrastructure, with the result that its people "long for a bite of the loaf" because of taxes, charges, and asceticism.
It seems Sharon is keeping pace with two issues, namely the internal Palestinian issue, and the external Iraqi issue, and is forming his positions, including his position on al-Wazzani, based on their development.
He also is still not able to grasp the huge disaster that hit the halo of his "invincible" army at the hands of Lebanese resistance. That army, which inflicted catastrophes and defeats on the mightiest of Arab armies, was driven out of Lebanon with its morale destroyed.
Perhaps Sharon, who received in cash the price of drawing a few meters back from the Palestinian Authority president's premises as an American recognition (awaited for decades) of Jerusalem as capital of the Hebrew state, is now attempting to magnify the al-Wazzani issue to extort from Washington a new price to be paid to him, in cash as well, within a time period limited by its starting signal for the war against Iraq.
National Council for Research Director Mueen Hamza, Water and Electricity Sources Director General Fadi Qumeer, and deans from the universities of Paris 6 and Paris 7 and from the Syrian University attended the signing ceremony, which followed the completion of the thermal survey project for Lebanese coasts.
He considered the agreement to be the start of a partnership among governmental departments, the Lebanese University, and the National Council for Scientific Research. He hopes that it will be the foundation for developing ministerial operations and for opening the way for researchers and students to acquire new opportunities for work and contribution.
Article 4 of the agreement specified the University's compensation at "a total sum of 612 million 500 thousand liras, according to executed quantities."
Because the part parallel to required internal procedures, as per the 2003 budget that represents the government executive program policy, is based on the external support expected from the Paris 2 donor states conference, from which the government is hoping to obtain low-interest loans of close to 5 billion dollars that are to provide approximately 300 million dollars of the debt service (estimated in the 2003 budget), the external efforts of the Prime Minister were directed toward states effective in securing the required funds. As such, countries expected to be invited to participate in the conference are as follows:

National Council for Research Director Mueen Hamza attended the signing ceremony, which followed the completion of the thermal survey project for Lebanese coasts.
He announced that he will present the elements of that contract to the Cypriot Ministry of Health to study it and benefit the therapeutic sector from it.
He said that the Insurance Companies Society is working toward reduction or elimination of charges on maritime insurance and is monitoring the decimal insurance on buildings and the application details of compulsory insurance on machinery "so that we are ready on 1/1/2003 with the issuing of the special decree."
He suggested finding ways to benefit from the therapeutic sector in Lebanon and from the experience of its insurance sector, suggesting that an insurance program be developed at a national level to cover at reduced prices all Cypriot citizens under the age of 25.
Insurance Supervision Authority Director Waleed Janadiry spoke on behalf of Minister Bassem Flayhan and said that growth starts with the foundation stone and needs a clear futuristic vision that places human potentials and modern management methods in their position. He stressed that the distinguished human reservoir enjoyed by Lebanon "should preserve this progress and encourage technical development as part of a strategy to make the insurance sector a pole in the area."
It is well worthy of Abd-Allah Khaleefa to select the period of English occupation of his country as a theater for his novel "The Uncircumcised" (*), although what came after that to these days of ours hosted a wealth of events and changes that would be sufficient for more than one novel. We cannot call it a historical novel, because that type would have its "historical" characters, the lives and achievements of whom would be bases for new views suitable to write a novel about them.
The above does not mean that the novel is unreadable to simple amateurs, especially as they follow, perhaps eagerly, the author's attempt to join in wedlock Mary, the nun, and Yahia, the uncircumcised convert to Christianity who does not completely abandon Islam, as he never actually knew it from the only person he knew in his childhood (his grandmother).
The writer adopts a language loaded with insinuation, similitude, and figurative expressions to the extent of overflowing beyond the characters and events. This overflow stretches it into forty-one chapters in 169 pages, each chapter being no more than five pages, sometimes going down to two pages full of linguistic construction more than story events. It will still have its reader who can find enough time and perhaps gain from it some benefit.
The participation of the guitar player Jad Azkol in the "Aranjuaz" Concerto by Joaquin Rodrigo, within the show presented by the National Symphonic Orchestra in St. Joseph Church, U.S.J., was a musical event added to two major others in the evening show, the first being dancing musical compositions of a symphonic orchestra in F minor by Jamal Abou Al-Hessen and a symphony by Cesar Franck.
These popular songs living in the conscience of Jamal Abou Al Hessen, and the sample on which he worked his experiments and creativities, displayed in the evening show on Friday its capabilities to be an unlimited flirting and nostalgia with this successful composition of the instruments, whereas each player has his own participation in coloring the melody and introducing it into a painting engraved on the walls of our memory, being familiar and widely dynamic, full of new energy and ways probably started from years so that the international music world celebrates a wealth being hidden and satisfied with its place, so it was launched with strong rhythm and complete balance between the geometry and the sentences' synchronization, while the melody is not hidden in the strong orchestral structure.
But it was rare and did not impact the general performance ambiance, especially since "Aranjuaz" was between the hands of a scientist with its delicate composition requiring lightness and eloquence. He was not away from the colored effects one time and dark effects another time.
In the opening of a new season with the symphonic orchestra, this collective fire moves the human music and promises seventeen performances until next June, where orchestras' maestros and solo players will perform from all over the world.

He then went around the manager's desk and started to shout loudly. The manager went around his desk toward the defendant and asked him to leave.
After the situation settled, it was found that the manager's spectacles fell on the floor during the fight and were broken. Also, his door's locks were broken too. Defendant H.G. admitted
So far, sources believe that the incident's causes might be personal.
Within the same context, Beirut Engineers Association Chairman Subhi Al-Bisat released the following statement: "Several days have passed since our colleague Engineer Wadee Abi-Rashid has disappeared, and his whereabouts have not been known yet."
Also,  he requested that the Private School Teachers Compensation Fund, as a corporate and independent body, be called through its legal representative before courts, "under its financial liability for the acts of its employee Ahmad Mansour to bear in solidarity and joint liability the financial obligations that will be ruled by your honorable council to the benefit of the claimants, pursuant to Article 142 of the Penal Code and to the provisions of Penal Trial Fundamentals Law."

In the past hours, three accidents happened. One of them was at the President Sulayman Franjiya Palace roundabout in Ahden between two Mercedes cars. The first is a 1990 model with license plates 171292T, and the other is a 1979 model with license plates 55587. According to Expert Jabour Qabshi's report, the accident was caused by emergence of the second Mercedes from a private road without the driver securing his route due to his use of a cell phone.
A Mercedes truck driven by Muhammad Hussein Qumra in Al-Luweiza-Baabda area hit a Mercedes car carrying license plates number 130444, driven by its owner Muhammad Reda Ishaqi (19 years old) who was accompanied by his father Abdelrasoul (56 years old), who was killed.
Beirut Investigation Magistrate Shawqi Al-Hajjar considered that the crime for which the defendant is being pursued is a capital offense as stipulated in Article 459 of the Penal Code. He requested him to be tried before the criminal court in Beirut, on the basis of that article and Article 454 of the same code, for his use of a forged power of attorney.
Shortly thereafter, the defendant went to the attorney's office and deluded him into believing that he had an assigned power of attorney on behalf of the real estate owners, who are living in Egypt and whom he knew through his aunt who is also resident there. The attorney requested an official authorization be issued so that he could assume the case and prepare its file. The defendant came back two days later, left some documents in the office, and asked the attorney to give him ten days to travel to Egypt to arrange for the official authorization. He also agreed with him as to his fees.
and her six children issued two proxies from the Lebanese embassy in Washington and the Lebanese consulate in Los Angeles authorizing their partner in the matter of the compensations for acquisition of their inherited buildings. In turn, he authorized an attorney to complete the required procedures, who in turn assigned to a person the task of issuing the real estate deeds and the financial and municipal clearances for buildings 29, 441, 442, 1111, 1157, 1158, 1565, and 1566 of the Sofer estate area, which were owned by the late Sulayman Darweesh, one of the Jewish owners. While the assignee was in the town of Sofer to issue the clearance for these buildings, the defendant was coincidentally issuing clearance for the same buildings. The Sofer municipality employee was puzzled about this matter, wondering how both were issuing clearance for the same buildings.
It appeared in the meantime that the Egyptian embassy in Lebanon denied the validity of the power of attorney  presented by the defendant or its connection with individuals resident in the Arab Republic of Egypt.
From now on, the beacon of Beirut that was as high-spirited as vigor itself, as radiant as truth itself, and as shining in its giving as innovation itself, will be absent from sessions with disciples and fans.
Zahia Qaddura actually did attend the first of the conference sessions, when all participants rose in respect for her soul. She also did actually attend through many who wondered, as the great deceased used to wonder: How long will blood remain frozen in the veins of Arab officials as they watch the atrocities in Palestine and the horrors being plotted for Iraq?
Instead of wasting her life yelling for the role of women in our society, she advanced with all simplicity and eligibility and seized that role for herself. As such, she became the leader among students of Beirut and Cairo. She was the first dean in the Lebanese University, and she was the elected president for innumerable organizations and societies.
Her life was rich with beautiful indications like a garden full of "bright" (Zahia) colors, and her personality had "ability" (Iqtidar) that enabled her to remain throughout the decades of her life an attraction of sights and a resort for love and giving.

The U.S. Fox television network reported on Wednesday that the F.B.I. received information on Wednesday regarding attacks against hospitals in Washington, San Francisco, Chicago, and Houston between the coming December and next April.
The police arrested on Wednesday the Moroccan Imam of the Buto Mosque in the western outskirts of Paris and two of his assistants on suspicion of their involvement in a "terrorism conspiracy."
Before that, German Minister of Interior Otto Shili stated that the initial results "are progressing toward authenticity of the recording" and "this supports the assumption that Bin Laden is still alive." He recommended avoidance of panic, because "the attitude to be assumed is keeping calm on one hand and being alert on the other."
The federal government published a name list of four Islamic "terrorist" groups, which are Abu-Sayyaf of the Philippines, Al-Jama Al-Islamiya Al-Muslaha and Al-Majmua Al-Salafiya Lil-Dawa Wal-Qital of Algeria, and the Mujahideen Movement of Pakistan.
They also mentioned that a meeting was held in London in late October between a senior Al-Jazeera official and two affluent men from the Gulf who support Al-Qaeda to obtain an amount beyond the ten million dollar agreement for coverage of losses to result from the GCC ministerial decision to boycott the station and the advertising companies that provide it with advertisements.
The minister assigned to European affairs, Roco Botilioni, announced at the end of a cabinet session that Berlesconi assumed responsibility of the intelligence authority.
She emphasized that her husband refuses to appeal against the death sentence. She said, "They urged us to ask Agagari to appeal against the sentence, but he believes that he committed no crime and does not consider himself guilty to file an appeal."
He said that "Iran's image is strong around the world, and no action by an official or judge should affect this image."
In a press conference he held in Tunisia, he said that "the Middle East is at the center of our attention."
He also mentioned that French Minister of Interior Nicola Sarkuzi also discussed terrorism-related issues during his recent visit to Tunisia after last April's attack on a synagogue on the island of Jerba was claimed by the Al-Qaeda organization led by Osama Bin Laden.
Blix will make a stop in Paris on his way to Baghdad, where he will arrive on Monday.
"This matter represents part of the intensive dialog between France and Tunisia (...) our wish is to proceed, settle problems, and progress (...) We are here in an attempt to settle the problems so that we can advance together."
The extremist Jordanian Islamist Muhammad Al-Shalabi, alias Abu-Sayyaf, remains at large. This means that the campaign launched by Jordanian army and security forces since last Sunday will continue "until all members of the armed gang are arrested," in the words of a security source.
It added, "A considerable number of folks promptly turned in their personal weapons to the city's police administration (...) Most of them hold prior licensing to possess arms."
While Abu-Sayyaf and his group remain in hiding, one of the residents quoted to Al-Nahar a security source as saying, "The campaign will continue until mid Ramadan," without explaining the reason behind such timing.
It also said that students of the College of Education attacked the Imam of its mosque and beat their dormitory officer, who was transferred to the hospital for treatment.
He accused the "politically impulsive" students of attempting to prevent the Fund from executing the Islamic guidance program during the month of Ramadan, considering that it damages the students' unity.
Noteworthy is that student protests in 1985 resulted in the toppling of former President Jafar Numeiri's regime and the seizing of authority by the army under the leadership of Lieutenant General Abd Al-Rahman Sewar Al-Thahab. Authority was subsequently shifted to Al-Sadek Al-Mahdi, who was elected democratically.
In response to a question regarding Khartoum's accusation to Asmara of supporting Public Army for Sudan Liberation rebels and interfering with internal Sudanese affairs, he said, "The Sudanese statements are unsuccessful in this regard. The problems between Eritrea and Sudan do not call for such media clamor."
Mussolini's Granddaughter Considers Him "a Political Event and Important Moment"; In a Historic Speech Before Italian Parliament Pope Calls for Increased Birthrate and Adherence to Values; Italy News
Until 1870, the Catholic Church ruled a large portion of central Italy.
The situation continued as such until 1929, when the Vatican and Italy signed a mutual sovereignty recognition agreement.
The Pope, who seemed to be in good health, summarized in his address the issues he dealt with throughout his 24-year presidency of the Church, the most prominent of which were respect for human dignity, democracy, peace, and justice.
However, he also called on them not to ignore "the seriousness of current threats." Noteworthy in this context is that the Vatican was a potential target of terrorist attacks.
He touched on the issue of abortion, which is legitimate in Italy since 1978 despite the Church's objection to it.
He requested that prisoners' sentences be mitigated to solve the problem of overcrowded prisons on one hand, and to contribute to the their rehabilitation on the other.
"It is an important moment for Italy, and we will listen to him very carefully, while taking into consideration that we are a civil state."
China started yesterday a new political era, after the most substantial change at the system leadership level since 13 years was approved and its change of philosophy was formalized by amending the Communist Party charter so as to allow capitalists to join it.
People's Conference President Li Tieying, Prime Minister Zu Rungi (both 74), and three other members also left the committee.
The central committee is comprised of 198 major members and 158 ancillary members, more than half of whom are new.
Whether he will maintain the position of armed forces commander will also be an important relevant indicator.
Xinhua explained, "The conference approved unanimously to include the idea of triple representation in the Party's guidelines along with Lenin Marxism, the thought of Mao Zedong, and the theory of Ding Cghiao Ping."
In a speech he delivered at the end of the conference, which is held once every five years, Giang said: "It is a conference for unity, a conference for victory, and a conference for development.... All of this will encourage the entire party and all ethnic groups of the Chinese to preserve development and excellence in other areas with a pioneering spirit, and to continue to push ahead the issue of communism in the Chinese style with confidence."
This criticism was made while the Senate prepares to resume discussion of the bill for establishing an internal security department.
He expected the Senate to approve the bill for establishing an internal security department next week, although the Democrats are disgruntled with the issue of the committee and the articles they say limit the rights of the new agency's staff.
The new department requires 170,000 employees.
Congress Chairman Dennis Hastert said that the law "will enable our nation to possess the instruments needed for surveillance, tracking, and averting terrorist acts in the future."
The Senate showed an inclination to approve the bill through the prior 50:47 vote to remove the Democrats' version of the bill, which provides more guarantees for the staff.
Israeli commentators are of the opinion that Sharon is the winner of the first confrontation of the Likud conference this week, with his good aim of strikes against his competitor.
He added, "Netanyahu is in an extremely difficult situation because he is not loved by most of the people."
Meanwhile, Mitzna won 45% of Labor Party votes, compared to 23% for Ben- Eliezir and 14% for Ramon.
Geocartographia Firm conducted this poll, which included a sample of 500 people, with an error margin of 4.5%.
Former Foreign Minister Shimon Peres declined to reveal the identity of the candidate he will vote for as leader of the Labor Party, "to avoid eruption of any divisions inside the party."
At a time when the drums of war are being beaten in attempts to establish alliances that are to lead states and regions into wars and tragedies, it is not trivial that bugles should be blown in the French capital to establish a throng, or demonstration as was said in Beirut, with a view to leading Lebanon's stumbling economic hand and help it through its difficulties toward a normal situation that enables it to regain its health and growth.
A country such as Lebanon also deserves a coalition for good, in an age hosting excessive reference to "axes of evil."
However, Lebanon, which is radically refreshed with intangibles, is not only expecting intangible yields and gains from Paris 2, as summarized by Rafeek Al-Hareeri: "One of the factors of international support for Lebanon is to preserve its stability due to its ramifications in the area."
If the conference is going to open parentheses or arms for us, it would be more worthy of us to open parentheses or arms for ourselves. It would be truly interesting should Hareeri manage to gather a demonstration of 17 states to support and assist Lebanon, while we almost totally fail to find a similar gathering of Lebanese politicians and "leaders" who stand in deeds not words beside Lebanon.
No one can deny the sharp division within the Christian political circle.
Anyone who takes a deep look into the political discourse of the two Christian sides, that of it which is announced of course, almost reaches a confusing and puzzling conclusion.
However, such interests and details, in spite of their importance and role in Lebanese political life since independence and during and after the war, are not enough to justify the lack of understanding that will inevitably damage the Christian presence and role in Lebanon.
The most prominent of these currents are two.
and standing against the belief that Lebanese Christians and Lebanese Muslims are incapable of mutual understanding and of solving all their problems without external, particularly Syrian, interference,
The mentioned protection can only be secured in one of two ways.
The principle-based current believes that realism will end Lebanon's independence and will transform the Christians in it to an instrument for Syria and that they will definitely be penalized in the future, as nothing is permanent in politics. This will end their effective and distinguished presence. Conversely, raising the national case standard might unite them with the Muslims, particularly those of them who are loyal to Syria by virtue of status quo and power, not conviction.
Serkis Naum
However, official Egyptian sources said that Sulayman's visit to Ramalla, then to Jerusalem where he met with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and President Moushe Catsaf, was made on direct request from Sharon, who expressed a desire to make way for Egyptian efforts to control the security situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Analysts in Cairo noted that Sharon's request to activate the Egyptian role and the intensified communications with Cairo at this stage could be an election maneuver by the Israeli prime minister, who faces a double challenge within the Likud bloc, over which he presides. He is rivaled for leadership of the bloc by Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, then in the general elections scheduled for next January 28.
It also linked its approval of it with Israel's cessation of assassination operations that affect Palestinian civilians.
* In Damascus, Hamas Political Bureau Director Khaled Mishal said that the Islamic Resistance Movement and Fatah agreed during their talks in Cairo on some issues but disagreed over other issues, among which was stopping the attacks.
In response to a question whether the President stopped exercising his influence over Israel, he said, "Absolutely not."
Works Subcommittee Discussed Traffic Law and Defense Subcommittee Completes Hunting Law; Defense Subcommittee
In addition, they focused on handling complaints about motorcycles and arrived at decisions that will be translated into proposed laws dealing with: regulating motorcycle trading, obligatory insurance on motorcycles, requiring license plates on every motorcycle, increasing the severity of penalties, and legislating a mechanism for police pursuit and seizure of motorcycles.
"And now, we have kept our promise and finished this bill in the subcommittee."
He was asked if the committee set new criteria and restrictions to regulate wild hunting, or if this has become a random law.
Only two days were sufficient to gather more than a thousand signatures from journalists, media people, and technicians working in various written, visual, and audio media services; 546 signed personally, and 450 was the total of LB
The law should serve people, not people serve the law. That is our driving principle.
From this point, from people in particular, was the start: We were a group of journalists, men and women, when we heard the news of rejecting the objections and keeping the MTV station and Jebel Lebanon radio closed.
We decided something had to be done.
Naturally, we received the message, but we journalists are still determined to say our word ourselves, not through any proxy.
In some firms, the presidents and managers carried the petition and circulated it around to employees to sign.
2- When danger pounces on the media and its people, they all stand shoulder to shoulder and raise their voices together, in spite of their association with various political orientations, parties, and sects, as the freedom of opinion and expression and a dignified life is the common factor among them.
May Abboud Abi-Akl
- "The Meeting dwelled on the teaching in some schools of a textbook titled "History of the Modern World" originating from the United States that describes Hezbollah, the Hamas movement, and the Islamic Jihad movement as terrorist organizations and mobilizes students for the war against terrorism in the Middle East region."
"This American position reveals the hostile intentions of the administration of (American) President George Bush, who tries to picture the resolution as an American victory, whereas in fact it is a retreat from the previous position before the strong opposition of Syria, Russia, France, and China."
Its Number to Drop to Two Thousand by the End of the Year; International Force is the Safety Valve of the South
The UNIFIL mandate included three clear objectives: ensure the withdrawal of Israeli forces, restore international peace and security, and assist the government of Lebanon in securing its retrieval of actual authority in the area.
In June 1982, after heavy exchange of fire in southern Lebanon and across the Israeli-Lebanese borders, Israel reinvaded Lebanon and reached and besieged Beirut.
In spite of the extension of the crisis in applying Resolution 425, the Security Council always made term renewal decisions for UNIFIL upon request from the Lebanese government and recommendation of the Secretary-General.
As of May 16, much earlier than expected, the IDF and the Army of Southern Lebanon started evacuating their positions amid exchange of gunfire.
However, such demarcation was not a formal demarcation of borders, as it was intended to determine a line on the ground that matched the internationally recognized boundaries of Lebanon, based on the best available cartographic evidence and other documentary evidence.
UNIFIL also continued providing local civil inhabitants with assistance in the form of providing medical care, establishing water projects, providing schools and orphanages with equipment or services, and providing social services to the needy.
Of equal concern are Israeli air violations of the blue line, as it penetrates the depth of the Lebanese air space.
The President, the Resistance, and the Devil's Hour
The President and the country have no other option at a less national cost that can preserve land long usurped by Israel under a prescribed American tent that is refuted by a book titled "Cursed be the Peacemaker," of which Al-Nahar is currently publishing chapters, in the words of a man of knowledge and that can protect people in whom local and regional wars cultivated a generation that "does" then regrets what it premeditatedly did to the homeland, and a generation that comes to "do" under the belief that it will not regret.
However, today the relationship between the rule and the resistance has surpassed the complexities of the past and its experiences and has become direct without intermediaries in many of its affairs and concerns and without passing through Syria except in major cases. With that, Syria spared itself many previous "accusations" that it is imposing accord between both sides without conviction from the ends of the relationship. It had exerted exceptional effort in the first years of the cooperation in converging views along the basic line of thought, as well as the field details between them, until a large proportion of the blocking questions was eliminated.
Khalil Fayhan wrote:
They said that Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri's message to U.N. Secretary- General Kofi Annan was not clear of ill-willed accusations toward U.S. President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair for their accusations against Iraq of "actually producing chemical and biological weapons" after the inspectors' departure in 1998. The message described this as "unfounded calumny."
The anxiety is based on two matters:
The first side says that the Council must meet to consider this violation of Resolution 1441.
This resembles what happened between Lebanon and Israel in the wake of the military withdrawal from the South in May 2000, in connection with the maps of mines planted in southern territories. Lebanon had no conviction that the first list was final and demanded again what remained. It was then found that Israel was untruthful.
Will the same causes lead to the same effects if the inspectors act provocatively, and will Iraqi authorities stop their work or complain against them to the Security Council to assess their objectivity, neutrality, and performance?
The Public Committees and Leagues Assembly organized a meeting on the "Means of Encountering Dangers Jeopardizing Sudan's Unity and Arab National Security" at the Commodore Hotel in Al-Hamraa.
A grenade was thrown around a quarter past five yesterday morning at a Fath movement military center in Al-Bereksat area at the northern entrance of Ein El-Helwa camp. The explosion caused a member of the movement named Abd El-Kadir Hawali (25 years old) various injuries, and he was transferred to Al-Hamshari hospital.
"As such, we confirm that those who threw the explosives this morning are the same suspicious group that threw the previous explosives, which is connected with the Zionist enemy. We are confident that, in cooperation with all national and Islamic forces in the camp, we will discover this group, and they will be detained and handed in to Lebanese authorities."
Participation of the Republican Guards was noticeable, as was the "mobile hospital" ambulance escorting the delegation.
Students of Lebanese Forces called for a "solidarity standing" with Eleano Almir, "detained without justification or an arrest warrant," at noon today in the second branch of the College of Law in the Lebanese University.
Essam Baroudi, in cooperation with Prince Yusuf Dandan, placed Lebanese scouting on the right track through their cooperation with all scouting societies to open the door of hope before youth so that they never leave Lebanon in search of a better tomorrow in foreign countries.
One of the affected filed a complaint with the Kisrawan District Presidency, which in turn referred the documents to the Ministry of Health section in Junieh. Upon inspection by that section, which it registered under report number 342/2002 dated 9/18/2002, the documents were referred to the Kisrawan District President. The report read as follows:
Israeli Text, Arab and Israeli Writers: "The Issue of the Individual in the Middle East"
According to this book, the struggle against Israel represents the sole link preventing the disassembly of the "Arab nation."
In the introduction of the book, which is marked by suppressed intellectual anger, we read: "Is there any nation in the world that can claim proceeding along the path of progress without allowing for the development of a critical individuality?"
In the book there is also a discussion of the Israeli version of this conflict between the "private" and the "public," as written by Ghadi Taob, Emanuel Seifan, and Yaron Azrahi.
The author ascribes the roots of this crisis, or at least its aggravation, to the eruption of conflict between Sunnis and Shiites (in the eighth century).
There is no doubt that this work presents itself as a dark view of contemporary Arab world conditions.
Lebanese-Canadian Bank Chairman and Managing Director George Zard Abu-Juda announced that the ISO 2000/9001 certification recently awarded to the bank qualifies it, if properly applied, to exercise international criteria in banking operations, in management, and in human development, "thus enabling us to emerge into the international market: to Canada soon, then to the Arab Gulf and Europe."
He noted that banks, under directions from the Monetary Authority and the Banks Society, adopted international criteria "because the local sector is operating in a market open to international markets. This is an option reiterated by Lebanon and our banks on a daily basis, not only verbally but also in terms of the size of assets (resources and investments), external trade funding, and the savings of nonresident Lebanese."
He said that Lebanese-Canadian wanted to qualify in order to turn the variables imposed as a result of globalization into opportunities reinforcing its boost. "That is why we endeavored to obtain the international certification that proves the institution has a quality policy anchored on the customer and customer satisfaction through sound operational systems."
He noted that the Lebanese-Canadian Bank Academy provides necessary training for development of the skills required for those variables, so as to ensure the building of a culture based on maintaining customer satisfaction and development of services provided by the bank to its customers.
The application of the certification focuses on reducing waste in the institution, which represents 20 to 25 percent of its turnover, in addition to reducing routine work that requires double the effort, standardizing specifications for several years, imposing non-financial supervisory auditing of the institution's systems and internal regulations, standardizing criteria under globalization, and gaining customer satisfaction with the institution's performance.
The Turkish businessmen's delegation, presided over by Muhammad Habbab, had started its meetings yesterday with a visit to Quraytam, where it was received by Prime Minister Rafeek Al-Hareeri, accompanied by Turkish Ambassador Jalal El-Deen Cart and a delegation from the Economic Forum presided over by Wajeeh Al-Bezri.
In the Chamber of Industry, Commerce, and Agriculture, the delegation attended a presentation by Chamber Chairman Adnan Al-Qassar on the Lebanese economic situation and the fields of work and investment in Lebanon.
He also commended Lebanese economic activity and called for familiarization with the sound atmospheres prevalent in Turkey "which encourage joint cooperation."
On his part, Economic Forum Chairman Wajeeh Al-Bezri noted in his speech that signing the agreement comes at the end of negotiations that went on for months between the Forum and the Turkish External Relations Council, which culminated in a visit to Turkey by a delegation from the Forum last January.
The head of the Turkish delegation, Muhammad Habbad, also spoke and called on businessmen in both countries to cooperate in number of economic fields.
The Turkish Ambassador lauded the efforts of those who contributed to preparing this agreement, particularly the businessmen of both countries.
After the signing, Al-Hemeidi said: "We contributed in the past to the sectors of electricity, water, telephone, and roads, but this is the first time for the Kuwaiti Fund to use its own funds to invest in infrastructure projects, by which I mean school projects."
"We made contributions in the past and will continue to do so, God willing. Such contributions are an expression of friendship between the State of Kuwait and the Lebanese Republic."
Before the signing, Al-Hareeri had received Al-Hemeidi and his accompanying delegation in the presence of Al-Senyora and Eitani.
With this, the Kuwaiti Fund has presented Lebanon with 14 loans totaling 433 million dollars, in addition to 6 grants at an approximate value of 9 million dollars.
The delegation got first-hand experience of the problems of 25,000 families in the South and Al-Nabatiya who invest approximately 180 million square meters in growing olives.
"We have previously warned of the aggravated problem and requested assistance and intervention from concerned governmental authorities to secure the marketing of olives and create untraditional markets, to no avail."
"- That olive oil be prepared in quantities controlled by IDAL after the Authority regulates the relationship between growers and exporters and obliges growers to sign the exporters' purchase invoices of their produce, and after control companies confirm the quality of exported oil and ensure that it is of Lebanese origin."
European schoolbooks dealing with the history of Arabs east of Suez are nothing but confirmation of the author's very same saying. He himself admits that his concern with this proposition goes back to the experience of his residence with his wife and four children in Jerusalem during the first four months of 1981, when he was a visiting professor in the field of religious studies.
Farhan Saleh is a phenomenon worth study and long reflection to analogize with many axioms and values with which we deal and which society uses to categorize us, thus subjecting us to their provisions.
I believe anyone who is familiar with ancient Iraqi art would recall upon meeting Farhan Saleh the drawings of "Ornachi," "Gudi," or the writer from Sumer whose business was culture and who defended the rights and relations of people.
Where does an author start to build his novel?
Theresa in the South Land
Then isn't it logical to say that the people there were blessed too?
The wonderful courage was shown in the women who resisted with their children and defied death bombs with their bodies, which makes the Southern woman an example for all the women in the world.
I shouted, cheering, and cried from joy and happiness.
Each of them held a red rose, symbol of love and honor, also of that great Saint, to put on her relics.
A word of love is the biggest, most endless, and strongest.
These scenes reminded me of what the Southern leader, rather the great Lebanese leader, Nabih Berry, said: "Each Lebanese Christian has inside something in common with the Lebanese Muslim."
It is true our country is small, but our actions are great.
But it is enough that we are still the sons of glory and we will bring back those glory days!
In each village and town, in each house there is a wedding! All Lebanon was celebrating a wedding with dancing, applause, love, and fireworks in the sky along with joy and cries of joy.
If only we can realize that the greatest graces of God are love! Love makes even the rocks blossom, how then if it is shown in the national unity as it was during the stay of that Great Saint between us?
Before you leave Lebanon, pray over its soil and spread heavily over us the roses of your love, thus you bless us so we remain brothers living under the cover of love and peace on our land.
The matter is not only applicable to us but to the entire region, which will inevitably be hit by part of this quake and its aftershocks.
For a better understanding of what is being plotted for us and what is ahead, we need to read what Ghassan Tuweini wrote in his recent weekly article and pause for a moment before his request to President Saddam Hussein to resign. This will help us realize that he does not exaggerate in the reasons that drove him to advise and urge him to resign. In fact, it is the sole salvation logic for the obscure crisis to save Iraq and the area and in mercy for his people who have been subdued and helpless since Desert Storm.
Iraq's situation today has come to ramming a rock. No matter how hard the ramming horns are, they can only break at the end.
This is not meant to be disheartening but is rather our painful reality in which we search for a gap from which to emerge toward salvation.
"We request professors and teachers to dedicate some classes to talk richly about loving, defending, dignifying, and advancing the homeland."
Dr. Muhammad Abd Al-Rahman Atwi will autograph two books: the first is about "Israel's Next Wars" and the second about "The Zionist Danger against Lebanon" at 7 p.m. in the Dar Al-Hadi booth.
Attorney Kabi Fuad Daboul autographed his poetry collection "Bakra Maraq" in the Antonic Institute of Baabda in the presence of Parliament Vice Chairman Eli Al-Farazli and a gathering of MPs, in addition to State Consultation Council Chairman Judge Ghaleb Ghanem; Supreme Judiciary Council member Judge Bishara Matta; former Minister Edmond Rizk; Attorneys Association Chairman Rimon Shedid; a large number of former association chairmen, attorneys, intellectuals and literates; Abbott Samaan Atalla; Father Qustantine Nassar on behalf of Bishop Elias Ouda; and Abbott Hanna Seleem.
Then the poet recited a number of his poems from the collection, after which he started the autographing.
In this context, a videoconference about the topic was held simultaneously via large screens in France, Senegal, Bulgaria, and Lebanon.
General Assistance Director Trigua talked about the dangers of diabetes to the patient's health and its effect on the heart, kidneys, arteries, and eyes, in addition to its financial burdens.

Carthage (Tunis News Agency) The activities and agenda of the government for the next few days were the subjects of the meeting held yesterday morning between President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and the Prime Minister Mr. Mohamed Ghannouchi.
In addition, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali focused on Tunisian-Algerian relations on the occasion of the fourteenth session of the Joint High Commission on September 28th and 29th in Algiers, and recommended to actively explore all available resources to strengthen and enrich bilateral cooperation in various areas. He also recommended reinforcing the lines of communication and integration in order to serve the mutual interests and meet the aspirations of the two brotherly peoples.
The Movement of Socialist Democrats (MDS) has so far received twenty-two final receipts, the last of which was for the district of Medenine won by the Movement's list yesterday evening. Meanwhile, the leadership of the Movement expects to receive the remaining receipts between today and tomorrow, and those are for the districts of  Monastir, Bizerte, Jendouba and Siliana whose lists were re-created because of some legal violations.
Mr. Mohamed Al Qaoumani, a member of the political bureau of the party, said in a telephone statement to As-Sabah that, "three lists were excluded and dropped in the districts of Sfax II, Bin Arous and Sousse."

Tunis -	 As-Sabah. The family in the Arab world continues to face many challenges and difficulties that are associated with population, reproductive health, demographic growth and sexually-transmitted diseases .. And these are issues that require programs and action strategies to confront them, given how they reflect on the status of development in these countries.
And to comprehend these problems and challenges related to population which confront the family in the Arab world, and the status of the Tunisian family in particular, As-Sabah spoke briefly with Dr. Mounsef Ben Ibrahim, President of the Tunisian Family Planning Association and chairman of the current session of the Arab World Family Planning Associations.

Far from being an attempt to fall into the numerical operation of merely inspecting the crop of another year of the Al Aqsa Intifada or the second Intifada, which Sharon inflamed with his provocative election campaign visit to the Al Aqsa Mosque guarded by more than 300 Israeli soldiers, the truth is that this anniversary prompts more than one reason to stop and ponder about what it has or has not achieved for the Palestinian people. In either case, one ought to look for the internal and external reasons behind it and work to benefit from the lessons and trials of the past in a way that serves the Palestinian cause or helps bringing it back to the fore of diplomacy so as to ensure that it is among the highest of priorities on the political agenda, after a noticeable and dangerous loss of concern in the declining condition of the Palestinian people at the various levels of media and diplomacy...

Follow-up On Presidential Decisions Announced At The Supreme Judicial Council Meeting:
By virtue of the first decree, judges of the first rank who have satisfied the 6-year seniority requirement in their rank are given bonuses and privileges that are typically allowed to positions such as that of chief officers of a central administration, and these privileges were normally earned by the judge after his promotion to the second rank, or after working no less than ten years.
- Revoke the trial system in place at the central appellate court to the benefit of the lower courts in each of Ariana, Bin Arus and Manouba, and this is to be done gradually and according to the available human resources.
- Allow for the transportation of judges under the best conditions when carrying out duties that require them to go to the same place.
The Ministry of Justice and Human Rights is also preparing to begin within the next few months the set up of a communications administration in order to build a web site for the ministry on the Internet and provide various judicial services and extract legal certificates from a distance.
28% of all kindergartens are in violation of regulations and are deficient.
In this context is included the field survey of kindergartens that the Ministry of Women, Family Affairs and Childhood in its first and second versions, whereby the first survey was timed with the beginning of the 2003 school year, and the second with its closing. The goal was to monitor the progress of kindergarten education and counter the phenomenon of chaotic opposition to it, and sensitize those who violate the terms of the normal course of the activity so that they improve their services and their interaction with the directives and officially approved programs and abide by their contents.
As to the second survey, it saw a reduction in the number of cases reflecting violations and personal infractions that were identified in the first survey. This does not necessarily mean that those cases have been completely eliminated, in spite of the evident reduction in the negative cases.  It may be that the current season will turn out better given the cyclical nature of the surveys. In any case, the data shows that the trend in the numbers is one of decline as the proportion of deficient kindergartens was down to 8.28% and the number of institutions that have been notified by the authorities was down to 63 kindergartens, and only 18 institution owners decided to shut down their kindergartens themselves.  This reflects the desire of these owners to comply with the legal regulations and improve the quality of the services.
"Whoever leaves the computer at home and goes to kindergarten, expects to find computers there too, and not only toys and swings.." said Mrs. Nazihah Ben Yader, and asserted that the era when kindergartens consisted of a space equipped only with some toys has passed.  She did not deny the need for this kind of kindergartens given their limited ability to provide information-related equipment.
Information Science Centers for Handicapped Children:
During a visit by As-Sabah to the center, we noted the spontaneous interaction between the handicapped children and their computers, as well as the atmosphere of friendliness that ties the children with their educators and all those who work at this center.
Registration is not restricted to a specific date.

This phenomenon is basically a constant increase in the price index and is attributed to three main causes: first, inflation due to the cost of production such as an increase in the cost of wages.
On the other hand, the liberals consider that allowing a specific rate of inflation does not drive the economy on the long term. Instead, this contributes to entrenching the phenomenon of inflation. In their analysis, they utilize the chart of the New Zealander economist, the Phillips Curve, which shows a natural rate of unemployment.
These strategies could result in the same outcome at the economic level in terms of controlling the rate of inflation, but in reality they could lead to very different consumption cycles.
Others see that periods of expansion and contraction are linked to the political characteristics of the economy such as the gross domestic product and currency reserves, and have nothing to do with the stabilization of inflation.

The other thing is that I see that in order for the cinema to shine and give a good image of our country Tunisia, there is a requirement for renewal and courage, and we badly need these two things...

Release Of The Two Italian Female Hostages in Iraq
Simona Pari and Simona Torretta, who are both 29 years of age, were kidnapped from their office in Baghdad last September 7.
Simona Torretta's sister was quick to appear on Italian television, expressing her happiness at the news of her sister's rescue from her ordeal.
The spokesman mentioned that these were the four Egyptians who were kidnapped last Wednesday evening with two Iraqis near the city of Al-Qaem in western Iraq.
Ten arrested pending the investigation and losses in the thousands of dinars
After he revealed the identity of the suspect, members of the security patrol went and arrested him and began interrogating him. Afterwards, the relatives of the suspect reported that the suspect's house was burglarized by the wounded man's relatives, who then set the house on fire.

Only 9% of all students used remote registration to complete their registration
Even though this proportion of students is not very high relative to the total number of students, since this remote registration service was available to all of them, it still represents an important and respectable percentage, according to the same source, because the service was not easily available last year. The remote registration site was actually set up this year, whereas the service was previously available only by connecting through other university institution sites. Still, approximately 5,700 students did make use of the remote registration service last year, indicating a 4-fold increase for this year.
A special site for university services
It should be noted that the remote registration site is always open and can be visited and its services used, as it will allow students to do remote registration during the second semester or to register remotely for Master's Degree and the third stage.

Tunis - As-Sabah (Agencies): Information sources in Italy revealed that shortly after the return of the two Italian hostages, Simona Torretta and Simona Pari, to Rome after 3 weeks of detention in Iraq, Italian investigators have met the two hostages in order to shed light on their 21 days of abduction.
Simona Torretta also expressed her readiness to return to Iraq even though she regrets the suffering she caused her mother .
The two former hostages said that they were blindfolded almost all the time and that they never did see the faces of their captors, and that they did not know if the captors who spoke English were changed.
Simona Torretta said, "We learned what the Iraqi people did for our sake, and this is the result of the humanitarian work we have done in Iraq during the past years."
The happy conclusion of the kidnapping of the two Italian female hostages captured the interest of the Italian press yesterday. The "Corriere della Sera" newspaper declared, "Free: The nightmare is over", and the "L'Unità" newspaper said, "Wounded Iraq gave us back our two female Italians". The "Stampa" newspaper said, "Simona and Simona are smiling, we are fine".
The British hostage is shown again
In a telephone conversation, he added "There were no negotiations and nothing was paid to the kidnappers".
And in response to a question concerning the presence of a French envoy in Baghdad in charge of the release operation of the two journalists Christian Chesnot and Georges Malbrunot, the French spokeswoman replied, "We are not aware of an envoy who has met the hostages".
The British hostage appeared sitting shackled at the hands, feet and the neck.
The group behind the kidnapping is demanding the release of Iraqi women prisoners held in Iraq.
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi went personally with the families of the two young women aboard the military helicopter that brought them to Italy accompanied by the head of the Italian Red Cross Maurizio Celli.
Death penalty sentence for two of the accused in the case of the American destroyer "Cole"
The death sentence judgment was issued on the two accused after they were convicted by the court on charges of "organizing an armed gang and participating in the preparation for, and the execution of the attack on the destroyer Cole and committing acts of murder", according to the statement read by Judge Najeeb Al-Qaderi as he announced his judgment after a court session that lasted one hour.
The two accused Ali Mohamed Saleh Al-Markab (30 years old) and Murad Said Al-Sirouri (27 years old) each received a 5-year prison sentence for their conviction on charges of "falsifying official documents and identification papers for several members of the group, including Al-Nashiri".
He told Agence France Presse, "The court built its case on unclear evidence and confessions that were merely extracted from the accused while in jail".
Foiled Coup in Mauritania
He also accused Mustafa Liman Shafi, the personal adviser of President Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso, of "preparing and financing these criminal acts" with the support of the regime in Burkina Faso and financing from Libya.
Due To The Actions Of American Forces
The officer, who requested anonymity, said that he too had submitted his resignation, saying we were caught between two fires... On the one hand, death threats by members of the Iraqi resistance and, on the other hand, complying with orders of the American forces which we could not execute under any circumstance.
The cities of Doulouiya and Samarra, both with a Sunni majority and located near Tikrit, the birthplace of the former Iraqi president, have seen numerous armed confrontations between Iraqi fighters and the American forces in which tens of civilians were killed as a result of repeated American bombings of the cities. American forces believe that the attackers come from the two cities to strike at their military bases and their patrols which traverse the area.
Prices of calls
To the question of whether mobile phones and the installations that are being set up for their operation have any effect on human health, Mr. Jean-Pierre Roland stated that no study has ever shown the existence of effects on health, and Mr. Mohamed Fethi Houidi added that many citizens ask that the installations be moved to remote places or to the mountains, whereas their effectiveness can only be benefited from if they are located within inhabited areas.
Organizing the sector.. When?
As-Sabah paid visits to various taxi service stations in the capital and here is the investigation:
In addition to the diminishing work opportunities for the car owners caused by the growth of the fleet and the increase in licenses, an illegal kind of work methodology has appeared, adopted by a number of drivers and car owners who have become known as "the falaka", as a solution to making a living, since waiting for their turn costs them three full days worth of wages and since the procedures for assigning turns are themselves fraught with suspicion and doubt.
Passengers complain about the behavior of some drivers.. Car owners are themselves disturbed by what some of their colleagues are doing.
The increase in the number of licenses is seen by many as one of the main reasons that have led the sector to a state of disorganization and chaos. The number of licenses has grown dramatically and the formalities for obtaining them have become very easy. This has transformed the sector into a focus for absolutely anyone, a point raised by Mr. Rabah Lakrami, member of a professional section at the station of Bab Saadoun. He explains: The increase in the number of licenses is the principal and logical reason that has contributed to a large degree to the aggravation of the problems and made the sector as a whole like a vicious circle.. This is inflation because the growing number will inevitably cause the available space to shrink; this is exactly what has happened. The proof is that this station, for example, cannot take more than 400 cars, when in fact the number has exceeded 750 cars.
This point was specifically raised by Mr. Lhabib Bou Zidi, a union member at the Bab Saadoun station: In winter, mud and puddles bother the passenger and the professional and in the summer, dust and blistering sun rays.. The Bab Aleiwa station is another picture of a tiny station where the fleet of cars has exceeded 1,800, yet it can only contain 1,000. So where are the rest?
We met with Mr. Adel Ben Amar, president of the Regional Union of Industry and Commerce and Traditional Industries in Tunis. He discussed this subject and sees that "the main problem focuses on the lack of space, which can no longer accommodate the huge number of cars.  On the other hand, we find that new entrants into the profession are growing by the day.
Mr. Adel Ben Amar also said, "I think that the burned down market in Mouncef Bey is the best space to accommodate the cars and that is likely to put a limit on the "falaka" phenomenon and some of the other problems".
Mr. Youssef Al-Zouaoui says, "For-rent licenses have hurt us, the old professional license holders and those with clean consciences. They steal away the passenger from you by deception and by force, and they park their cars in the roads and the alleyways."
The decision about the passengers drop off place, which calls for "utilizing every segment that makes up the line providing that dropping off a passenger takes place only in those spots listed in the line for use with license", was an important point that was addressed by almost every party in the investigation.
It is important to understand the situation. What makes a passenger walk ten kilometers when the car goes right in front of his house".

The Board Council of the Young Lawyers Association recently contacted the Ministry of Commerce with the purpose of enabling young lawyers to benefit from loans that entitle them to own four-horsepower cars. The agreement makes possible in the immediate future a first installment of these cars estimated at 15 cars, after they meet the conditions and submit the required documents to complete an application for this purpose, and these documents are for the benefit of those lawyers wishing to take advantage of the cars.
Preparations are proceeding rapidly within the Association on the occasion of the opening of the judicial year, and in this context the Board Council paid a visit to the offices of the Bar Association during which a program of joint action was laid out, aiming at presenting one lecture on the occasion of the opening of the judicial year.
The seventh art is being celebrated. Welcome to the participants.
It is a celebration of the twentieth anniversary of this festival that began modestly but with great ambition in the mid-sixties.
It is true that the spirit of struggle with its desire to establish a cinema different from what exists outside the Arab nation and the African continent has been incompatible and declined over time because of global changes and human cultural transformations that have witnessed great convulsions as a result of the domination by one pole and the lack of desire by that pole to promote a deep culture capable of advancing mankind.
And so this festival takes off with a new spirit, a spirit that springs out of a mature self that is about forty years old, since it convenes once every other year, counting from its first launch...
Because they are foreign ambassadors of Tunisian culture, they have the ability to raise the name of Tunisia high in all international venues, cultural or otherwise...
Intensification Of Acts Of Violence In Iraq:
The second and third explosions took place as American forces were assisting the victims of the first explosion.
Hours before, the American Army had announced that a suicide bomber killed an American soldier and two members of the Iraqi police when he detonated his car west of the Iraqi capital Baghdad yesterday near a busy American checkpoint in the town of Abu Ghraib. An Iraqi doctor said that about 60 people were hurt, including women and children.
Hospital officials said that four civilians were killed and 16 were injured, and four police officers were injured as well.

For his part, Minister of Education Mario Oporto said that two female students and one male student were killed immediately, while a fourth one died after being transferred to a hospital.
Hosting Writer Alain Soral, Author Of A Book On The Struggle Of The Palestinian People:
The radio station added that the Jewish extremists, who belong to the radical rightist movement in Israel, destroyed the bookstore, tore up books and demolished its contents while repeating "slogans glorifying Israel".
Chief among those is the story of the lady in the subway, who claimed to have been beaten up by Arabs and Africans because she was Jewish and the burning of the Jewish Center which turned out to have been set on fire by a Jew in order to assign the blame for the act on Arabs and accuse them of anti-Semitism. In addition to the stabbing of the representative of the Likud Party in France who turned out to have been stabbed by one of his colleague inside a Jewish synagogue to give the impression that he was stabbed by a Muslim.
Members of Parliament said the day before yesterday that they have gathered enough signatures on a motion that forces the speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council to call for an extraordinary session possibly in early October on the future of the Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei and his government.
In spite of the intention by many members of the Fatah Movement to oust the government, it was decided at the end of the meeting to activate the mediation committee of the Legislative Council that will act to bridge differences one more time between Abu Ala' and Yasser Arafat.
The Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Council, Hassan Khraisheh, expressed his hope that the demands for change and for the ousting of ministers whose names appeared in reports on corruption or who failed to perform their duties will be met.

Tunis - As-Sabah. Following the statement issued on the first of October by the Ministry of Public Health in which the medical and pharmaceutical corps and the public were instructed to stop promoting all medicines manufactured with the substance Rofecoxib, marketed under the commercial name of Vioxx, which is manufactured by MSD Laboratory in the market.
The Director of Pharmacy & Drug Administration said that most uses of the medicine in Tunisia are limited to rheumatism, which makes for a short period of consumption not exceeding a few weeks, and there is no reason for fear or panic from side effects. But the decision to withdraw the medicine is a precautionary and protective measure since the manufacturing laboratory no longer supports the medicine. As to the request by the Ministry that patients who use Vioxx consult with their physician, this is not a matter of urgency nor is it to look into the residual effects of the medicine on the health of the patient, but rather to take a substitute medicine. Mr. Omar Al-Toumi also confirmed that there are substitutes for the medicine in the markets in sufficient quantities and that there were no cases in Tunisia where the use of Vioxx exceeded 18 months of extensive use. It is important to note that the Drug and Pharmacy Administration at the Ministry of Public Health has set up a committee that met yesterday morning to look into the measure to be adopted in the aftermath of the withdrawal of the medicine and to take future precautions, keeping in mind that the withdrawal decision does not apply to other medicines produced by MSD Laboratory.
Tunis - As-Sabah: Electronic commerce and the virtual economy have received a lot of support given the importance of this field in driving the economy and advancing exchanges. Encouragement to join this system was launched a long time ago with the State offering 50% of the cost of establishing sites on the spidery web to all Tunisian institutions.
A broad national consultation on the status and future of the commercial sector, and specifically in a survey that included a number of consumers (720 families) on a number of subjects related to commerce, of which electronic commerce was one, the data revealed a relative lag in the consumer's understanding of the electronic commerce system or on-line commerce, with 63% having some idea about this type of commerce while 82% do not have the equipment to resort to this kind of commerce.

These are repercussions of random exploitation of fish resources.
and appropriate quantities sold in the markets - then what is the main reason for the spread of this phenomenon. And is it to the extent that fish are no longer within the reach of all segments of society, except during certain periods and seasons when there is an upturn for a few kinds of sea products?
Shrinking of the natural reserves of fish.
And in order to continue to provide more details in answering our basic question, studies have shown that more than a quarter of worldwide fisheries suffer from overexploitation, and more than half cannot sustain an increase in the fishing effort. The situation is particularly exacerbated in the Mediterranean where most deep sea reserves are in a state of excessive exploitation, and the data is true to a large extent for the state of marine fishing in Tunisia, since scientific studies conducted by the National Institute of Marine Sciences and Technologies on evaluating the exploitable reserves in Tunisia have shown that the bulk of organisms, especially those present in the south, is in a state of exploitation that exceeds the productive capacity of the reserves. In order to preserve the permanence of the output of the sector - according to this study - and protect the ability of the fishing resource to renew itself and guide the exploitation of the fisheries, the biological recuperation of marine organisms must be respected and selective methods must be utilized that target one species without hurting other species. Fish reproductive and hatching seasons must also be respected, and small size fish that have the ability to grow further must not be caught and restrictions must be placed on the fishing effort with respect to the seasons and areas of fishing. As an example, we mention that fishing of bluefish occurs in two periods, the first one from the end of September through the middle of December, and the second one from the second half of May through the beginning of July. The fishing season for the octopus goes from October through early May, and trawling in the Gulf of Tunis lasts from early October to the middle of May, and even dam fishing season has been restricted to two stages, the first one from early September to the beginning of March and the second one from May to the end of August.
Tunis- As-Sabah: In seeking to establish a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area by 2010, either bilaterally or regionally, Tunisia had for some time started signing several free trade agreements, either with the European Union in a framework of cooperation between the north and south Mediterranean regions or with the countries of the south Mediterranean region. These agreements will reach final phases in 2008 with the European Union and in 2005 with each of Morocco, Egypt and Jordan. The partnership agreement for a free trade area that was finally signed with Turkey represents a new stage in the expansion of commercial and economic activity and the increase of exchanges and investment, in addition to the establishment of joint projects and foundations for strong institutional and technical cooperation, especially considering that Turkey ranks as the eleventh biggest customer and supplier of Tunisia with the volume of commercial exchanges between the two countries having grown from 289 million dinars in 2002 to 358 million dinars in 2003. Phosphate and its derivatives, cables, leather and dates are the most important Tunisian exports to Turkey, whereas iron, steel and mechanical and electrical equipment are the main Turkish imports to Tunisia.

After Samarra
Baghdad (News Agencies) - The US occupation forces in Iraq continued yesterday to expand their military operations to include the city of Falluja again and Sadr city in Baghdad after it had launched the day before yesterday a large scale operation in Samarra with the support of Iraqi National Guard forces in which more than one hundred were killed, including a large number of women and children.
He denied that there were Arab fighters in the city and said that statements in this regard were not realistic.
The same station had been targeted by two booby-trapped cars five days ago.
The US Army, however, spoke of precision strikes made - as it said - against dens used by Abu-Musab Al-Zarqawi.
Sharon's massacres continue in Gaza and 10 Palestinians have been martyred.
According to Israeli military sources, the four had infiltrated hundreds of meters inside Israel through the Karni checkpoint, benefiting from the morning fog that covered the area.
Also martyred was an older Palestinian man (63 years old) who died when he was fired at from the settlement of Moragh in Rafah.
Palestinian armed men had taken positions inside the camp to resist the occupation soldiers.
Meanwhile, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat called on the international, Arab and Islamic world communities for an "immediate and rapid mobilization" to stop what he called the "racist crimes" that are being committed by Israel in the Gaza Strip.
The government announced in a statement the state of emergency throughout the Palestinian territories, and urged all ministries and public institutions to intensify their efforts in assisting the Palestinians in the north of the Gaza Strip.
Erakat said that "what is happening in Gaza is a repetition of the operation of re-occupying the West Bank that the Israeli forces carried out about two years ago".
Bush accuses Kerry of seeking to subject American national security to the will of countries like France.
Many Americans remain angry because of the opposition by Paris to the war that the United States launched against Iraq in March 2003, which led Americans to boycott French products and rename fried potatoes, known as "French potatoes" (French fries), as "Freedom fries" (Freedom fries).
Bush said to the delighted crowd, "Listen, I will continue to work with our allies and the international community, but I will never subject American national security to a global test".
It was mentioned that no less than 62.5 million Americans watched the televised debate that took place between George Bush and his opponent John Kerry last Thursday, which is more than those who watched the debate between Bush and his opponent Al Gore four years ago. The numbers published the day before yesterday, Friday, by the Nielsen Media Research Institution made it clear that this number remains much lower than the record number of viewers of a debate between a president and his challenger, which is 80.6 million recorded in the debate between former President Jimmy Carter and his republican opponent Ronald Reagan in 1980.

Of all the commemorative monuments, perhaps the most recent is the memorial, erected in May of this year, for the deceased of the Second World War from all the American States, along with countries that fought alongside America in the war. These places are a very obvious source of pride for the American citizen because they contribute to a great extent in demonstrating the youth of American civilization in comparison to other human civilizations.
Then he corrected himself saying: "Of course, I will convey your remark to the management of the museum...
These testimonials and realities confirm the extent of the control that the Jews of America have on the most prominent of American institutions and on the direction of its foreign policy.
Taking a poisonous substance
Early findings reveal that the deceased suffered a case of poisoning after taking a poisonous substance. Whereas it was believed that he had accidentally took the substance, police investigations conducted in the stated matter that the victim had deliberately ingested the substance.
In Kairouan
As to the present case, early available findings about her indicate that the accused would intend to monitor luxurious homes then approach them and knock on the door. And if the owners came out, she would tell them that she came looking for work as a maid. But if she found no answer, she would make sure that the house is empty, then proceed to sneak inside and steal whatever her hands could reach.
They tied up the gas station guard and took what was in the safe.
According to statements made by the victim, he was in the process of starting his work at the fuel supply station when a car arrived at about 2:00 AM on the day of the incident with three young men in it who asked to be supplied with an amount of gasoline.
Women In The Nest Of Matrimony Without Love
What happens if the matter is connected with wives who live in the nest of matrimony without love, let alone if they are controlled by feelings of hatred and resentment towards their husbands?
That a wife prefers to stay in the confines of married life and live with a husband she no longer loves or towards whom she no longer feels a heartbeat of love or any similar feeling, is a difficult choice, especially with the increasing difficulties and pressures of life and the multitude of problems between spouses and the inability of some to overcome them. While divorce is the inevitable outcome to such problems and the result of differences, many women prefer to live without tranquility and stay with a husband whom they no longer desire or have any attraction to. Such a wife is content in maintaining her family's existence and sacrificing for the children so that a breakup of the family bond does not impact their lives and their future. She sacrifices her happiness and an important part of her life so that her children feel the warmth of family life, and these families are ruled by the illusion of stability and tranquility.
Since reasons for love are available when love is present, the same applies to hatred since it is a human emotion, and violence takes up a large proportion of these reasons, whether it is material or verbal, and shatters and destroys the inner lives and relationships. Perhaps the testimony of Mrs. Malika is the best proof of this when she says: "The calamity of the violence I was subjected to by my husband not only destroyed my life, my self, and was an obstacle to my professional success, but it went beyond that to destroy the present and the future of my children. My husband is older than me by many years and my marriage to him was not by choice, but in spite of my repeated attempts to accept him and love him, there were too many differences between us that contributed to deepening the gulf and widening the distance between us and losing feelings of love and then of respect because of the harshness of his words and his suspicions... I accepted to stay with him and pretend that we had a successful marriage in order to avoid divorce and homelessness and the impact this would have on my children, but that sacrifice and this concession drove me twice to attempt suicide, and here I am going to psychiatric wards because of that marriage relationship in which love was never present".

Tunis- The Weekly. Upon entering the second half of the month of Shabban, Tunisian families have begun the preparation to welcome the month of fasting and perform the usual traditional practices they have performed for ages. Since everyone's interest during the month of Ramadan will be the availability of food products in a continuous manner, the relevant agencies at the Ministry of Commerce have been monitoring the status of the market for a while and following the preparations for the supply and storage, in order to provide the necessities throughout the blessed month of Ramadan and so that there are no shortages such as what happened last year with onions and potatoes.
For fruits, it is expected during Ramadan that huge quantities of bananas will be supplied and an increase has been registered in the production of apples from 99 thousand tons last year to 121 thousand tons this year.
It is worth noting also that vegetable oil is available in huge quantities and 5,000 tons of olive oil have been designated for the public. It has been priced at 2.9 dinars for one liter.
From medical purposes to... showing off and renewing "the look"
Noha M. is a 23-year old student. She says, I like buying colored lenses and wearing them, especially in the summertime. I wear green at the sea because their sparkle has greater radiance with the water, and blue for evening soirees and parties, and I like wearing the honey-colored lenses in winter and fall because they have the colors of nature, and I also change them with the clothes I wear, and this costs me a lot. But in exchange, I feel great psychological rest and I am renewed every day with these colors because my temperament dislikes routine. To have the same "look" every day of the year makes me feel extremely bored and I resist this boredom by changing the color of my eyes. Noha added saying, although my view of life is the same with all these eyes, and I always see it rosy.

In another development, correspondents in Gaza reported that yesterday Palestinian medical teams found the body of a martyr who was hit by an Israeli tank shell on the eastern outskirts of the Jabaliya camp, and Israeli sources also cited another martyr in Beit Hanoun, but this was not confirmed by any Palestinian source.
Sharon said that the large scale military operation, which is the largest since the beginning of the Intifada four years ago, will continue indefinitely until it achieves its objectives.
Meanwhile, the Negotiations Minister of the Palestinian Authority, Saeb Erakat, warned yesterday that the Israeli military operation in the northern Gaza Strip will lead to "more violence, extremism, chaos and bloodshed".
This is what Sharon wants to accomplish and this is the final plan of the Israeli government.

They snatched her away from her male friend, kidnapped her into the woods and savagely assaulted her.
The investigators initiated a search warrant in the matter for which they recorded the statements of the plaintiff and according to preliminary information were able to obtain that the girl met a friend of hers on the day of the incident and agreed to go for a walk with him.
And this is what the suspects exploited. They kidnapped the girl to an abandoned place in the middle of dense woods and they took turns savagely on her, releasing her after satisfying their desires.
Hours of terror a student spent in the claws of a drunk!
According to some data, the victim left the home of his parents around 9:00 p.m. on the day of the incident and intended to go to the house of one of the neighbors. But as he was on the road, he was suddenly approached by a young man under the cover of darkness who restrained him and kidnapped him to another darker place with the goal of assaulting him.
A First At The Court House
Between the lawyers and their clerks!
We note that the branch is the structure in charge of intervening to resolve difficulties and problems that sometimes confront the task of lawyers in the courts.
Towards the end of last week, a young man was arrested and referred to the Attorney General of the primary court in Sidi Bu Zayd, after he was involved in a case with multiple allegations, most important of which is the attempt to damage property of others, threatening with what necessitates penalty punishment, and creation of chaos and inconvenience.
An informed and trusted source mentioned to the "Usbou'i" periodical that around 9 pm one evening last week, the young man mentioned that he went to a public place in the Awlad Haffouz area and climbed an electric pole with many high pressure voltage wires and threatened to touch the wires or throw himself from that height.
When the suspect was brought into the police station, he had no solution to his dilemma except to confess.  He justified it by saying that it was due to his bitter feeling and secondary to being wronged as he claimed.
The dream of immigration and wealth accumulation is an obsession for most young men especially after the return of expatriates during the summer vacation. The hope gets renewed whenever they hear that the Italian authorities is going to open up new periods for accepting requests for residency.  Hence the determination to immigrate and seize the opportunity no matter what the means to achieve the goal are. The important things is immigration regardless of the dangers and threat to one's life. There is a determination to take the risk. All means are OK including those with an unknown outcome. This applies to the situation of one of the young men from the middle of the country who took a risk to cross the Italian borders in the company of his female Italian friend who placed him in the cargo area of her car (the car's trunk). It seems that she fastened the lock until she crossed her country's borders. Away from any eyes, she wanted to let her Tunisian friend out but found a dead corpse.
A boat crashed after sailing from Shatt Mariam with 75 illegal passengers on board.
The afflicted boat had sailed from Shatt Mariam's coast in an illegal trip towards the Italian Island of Lampedusa. 75 illegal immigrants were on board the boat (70 Moroccans; 5 Tunisians).
We learned that the search for the 42 missing passengers continues till this minute at the site of the incident and its surroundings.
On the other hand, we learned that the personnel at the Jahawiyyah district of the National Guard of Sidi Bu Zayd have arrested a Tunisian middleman yesterday (Monday morning) who is a native of one of the province's towns before handing him over to the Security division in Sousse where they will investigate his gathering of the passengers on this illegal trip in association with another person of Moroccan origin.
An intelligence piece of information had reached the security personnel telling them that a large group of people, seemingly foreigners, had gathered near the coast of Sidi al-Mahrisi. They were probably getting ready to participate in an illegal trip towards the other side of the Mediterranean sea.
The young men (of Moroccan origin) mentioned that they agreed with the organizer of the "illegal" operations to secretly transport them to Sicily district, south of Italy. Each participant had paid 1,000 euros -equivalent to 1,500 Tunisian dinars. He assigned the place and the date of their gathering, but the officers of the judicial police squad of Hammamet foiled their plan and arrested them shortly before their illegal sea trip was to start.
According to the available information, secret information reached the investigators about the arrival of a large number of Moroccans to a popular hostel and their residing in it.
And so, the number of illegal Moroccan immigrants who were arrested in the past two days has reached 161 persons in addition to 60 others who reached their fate or are still missing.

Tunis- As-Sabah. To eliminate anything that might hinder the normal supply of markets during Ramadan and days before its start, and to avoid some displays of monopoly, unwise consumption, the Minister of Commerce Mr. Mundhir al-Zanaydi issued his instructions yesterday to start the dispatch of part of the available supplies for all products, effective yesterday. This will reflect on the supply situation and help in satiating the routes of distribution early on and eliminate overcrowding which can be brought on by late distribution of products. He stressed that the last ten days of Ramadan are the grill for the supply situation. There is a need to take all precautions to insure the organized distribution which will cater to the needs of all areas with no exception including small and far ones.
Monia
Not caring about the seriousness of the consequences, those houses are, after all, storage areas not equipped with any facility of hygiene and safety and in addition lack many other services. The college private housing facilities, however, have to be approved by the University Services Bureau and the Ministry of Education which approves the accommodations only after evaluation by a committee that visits the accommodations and makes sure that all the requirements needed for the student's comfort and safety are available.
Mr. Mohamed Azzouz says:
This investor, who received a grant in the field of university private housing, added: "There are many problems. The field is disorganized. Some private owners in turn exceed their limits, which reflects badly on the business. The students' guardians care a lot about safety and security, but some facilities are leased for workers not students, which violates the law. The law dictates that the students should be enrolled in one of the colleges or universities. Some dormitories have turned into furnished apartments which forced many parents and students to avoid these housing facilities. This is a loss to us as new investors. Therefore I request the supervising authorities to gather all those working in the field to form a syndicate and make sure that business is running well as dictated by law."
Under the microscope, many shortages
In order to know how appropriate the specialisations of the vocational training and its programs are to the requirements of the manufacturing sector, the outcomes of graduates from vocational training centers were followed.

The US army had said in a statement that "large numbers" of armed individuals were killed in the strike.
The American forces estimated the number of fighters hiding in Samarra to be around a thousand but it is not clear what happened to most of them after the fierce offensive that has been going on for 36 hours.

He also indicated that he will meet the Secretary General of the Liberal International Organization, "Mrs. Federica Sabbati".
Tunis- As-Sabah: Technology hubs are like transitional stations from traditional economy to knowledge economy. That is why the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research and Technology is very keen to focus on it as much as possible. Towards the end of this decade, it is expected that ten technology hubs will be created. Six of them have already been planned during the Tenth Plan for Development. Along that, business incubators will be built within these hubs and in the engineering schools and in the higher institutes for technology studies. Information from the ministry about the assessment of achievement of the technology hubs' projects says that, starting in 2002 till 2006, six hubs have been planned in each of Bourj Essidriya, Sidi Thabet, Sousse, Sfax, Monastir and Bizerte. In addition to, creating management centers, in accordance to the goals, to consolidate hubs and appointing coordinators for each of the technology hubs in Bourj Essidriya, Sidi Thabet, Sousse and Sfax.

Three more bodies were picked up while search operations are still underway for 39 missing persons.
Along with the search operations for the missing persons in this tragedy which is considered the worst this year in our territorial waters, a team of the intelligence and investigation of the National Guard in Sousse are still continuing their investigations with the 11 survivors after they received the necessary emergency help.
With successful arrangements and precautions, the participants were able to get on board an old small boat of 30-person capacity and head towards their destination. However, the tragedy happened and the boat was split into two after one hour of navigating. This resulted in the drowning of 64 young men (60 Moroccan and 4 Tunisian). Only 11 participants were able to survive, one of whom one Tunisian, and are kept in custody for investigation.
We have learnt that during one night this week, a mobile unit of the National Navy equipped with modern technologies of inspection control has been able to foil a new clandestine sea journey far away in the middle of the sea.
The crew then knew that the boat had on board a number of illegal immigrants so they moved swiftly and arrested them.

Privatization and competition
To start with, privatization is generally defined as the transfer of ownership from public to private. This happens through the transfer of assets or by dismantling production units or the merger of companies. The goals of privatization can be summarized as follows:
Similarly, the competition will be limited to price levels (we didn't notice any real initiative for lowering the cost of calling which remained amongst the highest in the area) given that the sector belongs to high technology. Accordingly, in this case, one cannot address this sector's situation from the perspective of general competition which prohibits any establishment from controlling 70% of the market when there is more than one company or 83% in the case of a monopoly. The law, therefore, does not include the sectors of high technology and the drug industry.
Ecological Tourism File in Tunisia
And why has this touristic product not been favored with the care needed to impose itself among the other touristic products and contribute successively in enriching and giving variety to the tourist scene in order to go beyond the negativity of seasonal tourism and to embody the principle of decentralization of tourism.
And despite the great interest which the supervisory authorities of marketing and promotion show for the promising touristic products like educational and desert tourism along with sports (golf), the strategy of promoting the ecological tourism remained somewhat marginalized and was never favored with the needed interest that whets the investors' appetite to invest seriously and enrich the infrastructure for this young touristic product.
Given the sea, the mountains and the forest, the northwest side is considered without doubt the capital of ecological tourism in Tunisia. And to get more detailed information about this subject, As-Sabah met with Wahid Bin Yussef, the tourism representative in Tabarka- Ain Drahem area, who showed that environmental tourism in Tunisia is a new product still in its first stages, adding that the northwest area has a suitable natural framework in addition to the ruins and historical sites that the area possesses. Based on this, touristic paths were prepared in the Ain Drahem's forest for a distance of 15 kilometers and these routes will present an opportunity to wander on foot, horses or bicycles.
Treasures on the Tunisian shores but they are military sites!
The movie "Gate of the Throne" (Tunisia) incoming Tunisian cinema.
The film tells the story of a young journalist by the name of Hamid who dreams to be outstanding in his work but he faces a media reality that does not coincide with his professional reality. This affected his emotional state and even his personality and leads him to a psychological state of mind which made him, on his wedding night,  refrain from approaching his bride and run away from the marital house, knowing that this marriage was forced on him by members of his family, since he did not want to get married in the first place.
And those are details that make this cinematic dialogue strange and far from the true current social reality.  In other words, the social reality in such films is usually an imagined (with an -ed) reality for the purpose of creating a folkloric and miraculous character of the film which might please the foreign viewers but does not please the Arab or Tunisian viewers.

Khalid Al-Hagar who lives between Cairo and London because of his many commitments is one of the new faces of the Egyptian cinema who came to the Carthage Film Festival to present his new movie "Girl's Love." We had the following interview.
How do you explain this direction?
In my movies, there are new names such as Ahmad Ezz and Hana Sheha.
Which context did you work to present?
The lack of love in the family is one of the main reasons for psychological diseases which affect the society and limit its effectiveness...
What we notice in the new direction that the Arabic cinema is undertaking is the absence of the single hero around whom events revolve?
But whoever watches this film might have some kind of shock.

How do you perceive the movie experience of the director Inas Al Degheidy in this direction?
And I consider that Inas Al Degheidy played a big role in this direction.
And the Carthage Film Festival; how is the relationship?
I was impressed by the "Silences of the Palace" film by Moufida Tlatli and "Wind of the Dam" produced by Nouri Bouzid, the latter of whom I respect for his bold outlook on cinema.
"What is happening in the Middle East now is a new Sykes-Picot"
Mandela became the first black president of South Africa (1994 - 1999) after he was the longest political detainee during the Apartheid period.
And when asked about the person who can assume the leadership ranks after him, he said jokingly, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, his media advisor. He insinuated that he would run in the upcoming presidential elections. He said, "I am committed to accepting whatever the leadership decides." He further confirmed that the Israeli attempts to impose a Palestinian leadership on the Palestinian people will fail, "because they will not find a "Karzai" among their ranks."
He further emphasized the fact that the '"road map" still remains the way out of the predicament the region is living in, affirming that this will not be possible except with strong international support.
Arafat refused adamantly to consider the Intifada as a mistake as some Palestinian and world leaders would say. He further refuted strongly what is being said that "the Arab leaders have forgotten his phone number."
The Italian police exposed last Sunday evening a second drug smuggling network in several Italian areas when they arrested 2 Tunisians and one Algerian which raised the number of detainees to 13, among whom 12 are Tunisians.

Players, directors and trainers at sports' institutions, universities and associations realize the health, educational benefits and social gains of sports activity.

It is noteworthy that these briefings with the teachers will continue throughout the first half of the current month October. In the second half, meetings with the guardians of first year secondary students will follow. Even though, the Ministry of Education and Training had announced at the beginning of this academic year the start of work on the necessities of the new structure for secondary teaching, beginning with this year. It has taken a gradual approach in revealing its details.
They also asked other questions about the difference between the old counseling and new system. It is worth reminding in this regard that in the old counseling system the role of the student was limited due to the absence of preparation for counseling. He received final counseling without any consideration of there being a chance of improving his knowledge qualifications, along with an almost complete lack of the possibility of re-guiding.  Re-guiding is only possible in the case of failure. In addition, there is no mechanism that allows the student to object to the decision of his counseling.
They will receive the counseling cards in the first half of next March to choose one of the following courses: (arts, science, informational technology, economics and services). These courses will split in the third and fourth secondary years into 9 sections.

A Doctor Who Specializes In Radiology "As-Sabah"
What about the symptoms and the reasons?
Dr. Najia Bin Mousa said that the reasons for breast cancer could be because of early puberty, infertility, reaching the age of 35 when giving birth to the first baby,  menopause, and hereditary causes. In addition others reasons are connected with daily diet, consumption of alcohol, smoking or obesity.
Dr. Najia Bin Mousa emphasized the need for campaigns to enlighten doctors and women and to find new ways for campaigning specially considering that so many developed countries have gone very far in this respect by adopting the use of a mobile van  for early detection (DMO , National Campaign for Detection). We wonder why we don't have such things in Tunisia?

In a private interview with the French Press Agency, Dahlan said that he does not see that Israel can achieve anything from its military operation except  the killing of 93 civilians and the demolition of hundreds of homes and this will not bring security or peace but will bring more reprisal and revenge against Israel. He added that any Palestinian who lost a son or brother or even his house is thinking of nothing but revenge.
He described the invasion as an Israeli way of suppressing the Palestinians and the resistance and snatching an illusive victory to satisfy the Israeli people after the death of two babies in Sedorot (south of Israel).

Although he confirmed that there will be no internal fighting, he said that the Palestinian government is able to solve the existing disorder if it will create a sense of stability and security.

Electoral campaign committees
168 lists will compete in the electoral campaign, spread among the 7 parties and the 7 independent lists... and whilst 3 parties, which are the Constitutional Rally, Popular Unity and the Socialist Democrats, have attained endorsements in all of the constituencies, the Democratic Party must be content with a smaller number (16 lists) after 5 of its lists were turned down...

What of the training incentives placed at companies' disposal?
Having comparatively progressed from a level of computer illiteracy, it has become necessary to consider skills training for obtaining qualifications which are recognized worldwide. This is the primary concept which the Chamber desired to convey to the participants. Specialization in this field has become a necessity even for those whose educational background falls in an area completely removed from the world of computing and information. This further training ensures a greater employment potential for the holders of high degrees, even outside of the country's borders. It also ensures a high profitability for the companies involved in terms of internationally recognized training, and guarantees competitive strength within the context of the advancement and economic liberalization the world is seeing both in public and private enterprise. It should also be taken into account that the multinational companies which have branches in Tunis will provide the opportunity for companies desiring to train their staff to undertake educational courses, with the state contributing a large portion of their costs by way of the incentives provided in co-operation with the National Center for Continuing Education and Vocational Advancement, which will place at their disposal a guide for the financing educational activities.

And what was the objective?
Rashwan says that in his opinion the explosion assists the Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon in distributing propaganda all over the world regarding the existence of terrorists attacking his country from all sides, just as it aids the American president George Bush in his claims regarding the spread of terrorism in the world, which require him to be re-elected in the presidential elections to be held next month.
The interesting matter is that this explosion occurred days after Israeli warnings to its citizens traveling in Sinai to refrain from visiting Egyptian Red Sea resorts, saying that they would perhaps form the target of Palestinian activities within the framework of the Intifada, which has been underway for four years, or of unspecified fundamentalist groups and perhaps the Al-Qaida organization.
Iran's nuclear dossier...
So how will the American Administration conduct itself with regard to Iran's nuclear dossier?
Who really benefits from this supposed support?
Certainly, each time they are issued anew from the strategic reports, the accusations are not without obscurity and deliberate vagueness.
Do not only threaten Israeli security, but also the security of the entire world
It is in the nature of this acknowledgement to provide an arena for initiative and action in which France, Germany and Russia may modulate and control the projection of American/Israeli unilateralism with their power and influence... an initiative which could cause the triumph of politicking and diplomatic dialogue over intentions to militarize pressure and increase it to its ultimate extent - military intervention: just as the arena for initiative and action succeeded when France and the European Union brought America to the Security Council to agree on Resolution 1599, the ruling which represented the solution to the Lebanese crisis. This gave birth to the general impression within international opinion that American unilateralist ambitions for the extension of its power and unilateral influence within the world had been weakened and quashed, and this had forced its compliance, albeit just as a matter of form, with international will - of which it showed its contempt with its war on the states of the Axis of Evil, just as it continues its biased and discriminatory use of the right of veto, especially in relation to Israeli affairs.
Dubai (News Agencies) There are conflicting reports concerning the veracity of news broadcast by both the Al-Arabiya and Aljazeera channels, which reported from two different sources that Tariq Aziz, the former Iraqi deputy prime minister, had died in prison in Iraq.

Gaza (News Agencies) - in a new crime indicating the extent of the concealed hatred filling the hearts of Zionist troops and their delight in killing Palestinians young or old, women or children, the newspaper "Yediot Ahronot" the day before yesterday revealed a repulsive crime perpetrated by an Israeli military commander in the Gaza Strip.

In Khaznadar: A fall from the third floor A fatal industrial accident was reported in Khaznadar on the 21st September, involving the fall of a 23-year-old laborer from the third floor at a building site. He was transported to the emergency wing of the Ambulance Association Hospital, where he was kept under medical observation because of his critical condition.

Under the Title "All That is Forbidden is Desired":
Within the context of a report, we posed this question to a number of men of law, psychologists, sociologists, and also to some citizens.
It is in everyone's interests to obey the law, and human conscience should be the best restraint... i. e., people themselves should ensure they do not commit infractions for which they will be punished... nonetheless, a greater sensitivity and consciousness are needed in order for self-restraint to manifest itself when needed.
Regarding the state of Manouba, 256 demolition rulings were issued of which 58 were carried out, and in the department of Sfax 671 were issued of which 206 were carried out...
As for the phenomenon of disorderly construction, this is an infraction of the law. Some people undertake to sell goods in the public highway without permission, occasionally in front of commercial shops, thus creating a dishonest, unlawful competition for those shops... to treat this phenomenon, one must recognize the origins of those goods and prevent them from being distributed...
Breaking the law may be explained by the pressures of everyday life
So then, if we attempted in this restricted manner to analyze the reasons behind the infringement of traffic laws, we would have found that they are linked at base to a level of awareness; i.e. to the maturity of the citizen and the extent of his saturation with the concept of citizenship. Citizenship means saturation with the values of living alongside the other, preserving a concord between general freedom and rights and duties. The awareness of some individuals has weakened, leading them to break laws, and among them, for example, those related to traffic ...
Etc...
In truth, there is no single answer, but rather a number of answers to explain the lack of respect some people have for the law...
And this problem could go on and on before being resolved!
Then I think of re-examining the school curriculum. Instruction in the principles of civilized behavior is moving out of the family remit and passing to the educational institutions... it is no surprise that a committee has been set up for civilized behavior... because the crucial matter is that not only a law must exist in an area, but it must also be obeyed, since the Legislature has put it in place to serve the general interest...

Sources close to the Egyptian investigators stated that a citizen from among the bedouin of Sinai had been arrested, suspected of selling explosives to the perpetrators of the attacks which took place last Thursday night in the Taba Hilton hotel and two other tourist centers in South Sinai.
A source close to the National High Prosecution for Security confirmed that the Egyptian investigators were looking into two possibilities: that the Sinai attacks were the work of the Al-Qaida organization, or that they were planned by a small Egyptian group in the interior, espousing the concept of "Jihad".
For its part, the Israeli police in Occupied Jerusalem said yesterday that the number of Israelis who had been killed in the Sinai bombings had yesterday grown to 11 after the identification of four additional bodies.
The agency added that the two bodies had been in a laboratory in Tel Aviv for analysis, and that their identity had been established through identification of DNA from Italy. It explained that the results had been confirmed to the Italian journalists who had contacted the laboratory.
According to the initial information we received, the suspect, who is no more than 16 years of age, was irrevocably expelled from the educational institution where he was studying after making violent verbal attacks on his teacher.
When the news reached security officers, units of the regional area of the National Guard came swiftly to Sidi Bou Zid where inspectors arrested the suspect. And, upon searching him, they discovered a razor and love letters(!
This love of independence constitutes the mainstay of the republic which sanctifies it; therefore, he proclaimed the need for media freedom, considering the right to access information as having become a sacred right, in particular with regard to the fact that the communication society is founded upon freedom of information and speed in obtaining it. He indicated that within the framework of his party's program he would aim to realize a creative harmony... between provision of a space to practice press freedom and upholding respect for the morals of the profession. The basis, according to this party, for bringing about complete freedom in the media sector, is its belief that state monopoly over press discourse has become obsolete. He called in his address for a council to be set up with an agenda of diversification within the national radio and television corporation.
Following that, Mr. Mohamed Bouchiha departed to the island of Kerkena where he visited the tomb of the deceased trade unionist leader Al-Habib Achour and laid a wreath of flowers at his grave, before meeting with the island's trade unionists and intellectuals. He had a discursive "chat" with them regarding the standpoints of the party and their similarity to the trade union portfolio, as well as its stakes in the presidential and legislative elections...
A 0.39% rise for TUNINDEX and important movements on "SIAME"
Likewise the shares of TUNISIE LEASING, UBCI and SIAME rose (+0.200 in each case).
With regards to the remainder of the companies, with the exception of relative movements recorded in the share prices of TUNIS AIR (8103 shares), TUNISIE LEASING (2700 shares), STIP (3749 shares), UIB (2450 shares) and SOMOCER (1420 shares), dealings were restricted to the other companies, noting that 21 companies did not see any real exchange on their shares.
The killing of two American soldiers and injuring of 5 in Baghdad, and a suicide bombing in Mosul
They explained that it had been a very large explosion, causing a crater two meters deep and four meters across, adding that the American army had closed off the area.
Likewise eight others were killed as the result of a Hawn rocket landing near the site of the first explosion.
An American army spokesman said that at two police stations in the areas of Jaza'ir and Al-Habibia, arms were being handed over in exchange for "sums of money".
Release of detainees
Among those released from Camp Buka was Sheikh Moayed Al-Khazraji, one of the aides of the extremist Shiite leader Moqtada Sadr.
Blix added, "it is the new straw at which the governments concerned have begun to clutch" in order to justify the war.
The chief of the American delegation of inspectors, Charles Duelfer, clarified in a statement published last week that Saddam Hussein had destroyed most of the chemical and biological weapons following the 1991 Gulf War, and that the nuclear program "had tailed off". However, he added that the former Iraqi president had been hoping to resume the armaments program if international sanctions had been lifted.
When they turned they saw a group of young men riding two motorcycles. They continued on their way, but one of the men called out to the first brother and, just as he turned, stabbed him in the chest. Following what happened the two brothers separated and the injured man ran to the El Attar office whilst the second fled toward the Zahour neighborhood. However, the criminals pursued the stabbed youth, who could not withstand the injury and collapsed. Despite attempts of paramedics to save him, he died as a result of the stabbing which had damaged his heart.
* Tunisia - South Africa * Dialogue between Presidents Ben Ali and Mbeki
In this respect, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali underlined the importance of both sides' efforts in striving together to construct a common plan in designated areas, such as communications technology, and technical co-operation, whether in bilateral or multilateral frameworks.
President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, currently president of the Arab Summit, stressed the need for urgent action to put an end to the aggression faced by the Palestinian people and to secure them the requisite international protection, alongside the necessity of carrying out the Road Map at the soonest possible time, considering that negotiations are the most appropriate option and guarantee for bringing about a peaceful, just and complete solution to the problems of the region.
President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali greeted the delegation accompanying President Thabo Mbeki. The First Deputy to the Constitutional Democratic Assembly, the First Minister and the President of the Council of Deputies also came to welcome him, along with members of the assembly's political administration and a number of members of government.
The first agreement, established between the countries' international centers of commerce, "the locus of international commerce in Tunis and the locus of international commerce in Pretoria", relates to the promotion of commercial exchanges, exchange of technical expertise and information about business opportunities, and inter-body programs involving the two countries and in co-operation with other world states.
He stated that the sphere of co-operation between the countries was still poorer than it could be since it had not been exploited to the full, indicating the possibility for expansion from the area of exchange of commodities and services into other areas.
For his part, Mr. Mandisi Mpahlwa expressed his country's commitment to supporting the efforts of the Tunisian and South African private sectors within the scope of promoting partnership, highlighting the fact that the two countries both enjoyed varied economies but in different ways, to say nothing of good all-round economic progress, which allowed them to overcome the difficulties of increasing foreign investment.
"Assabah" hopes to receive the assistance of party officials and their candidates in order to reflect the campaign in all of its varied colors and personalities...
A Tour
Popular Unity Party meetings in Sfax, Kerkena, Gabes, and Gafsa were characterized by precise organization at the hands of the areas' heads of party lists. Among them are Messrs. Monir Al-Iyadi and Suhail Al-Bahri in the constituencies of Sfax I and II, Zahir Al-Haj Salim in the constituency of Gabes and its environs, and Shukri Al-Harmasi in the constituency of Gafsa.

Deanery of the Lawyers
Although a committee of the Deanery has been commissioned to attend to this portfolio, that does not mean that its taxes will be composed only in accordance with what the members of this committee might propose. Rather, it will be undertaken with the examination of different studies and proposals which have arisen in the context of the insurance issue, and likewise the study of all rulings and standpoints which former bodies have taken in relation to this area. The current body has resolved to treat the standpoints of former bodies with special interest, and they will be judged as having an equal weight to the new proposals. It is expected that a final scheme on the issue of social coverage and insurance for lawyers will be put forward based on the workings of former bodies, and valuable new proposals...
It seems that the "Timbre" for the legal profession is the essential pivot around which the various aspects of this question revolve. A source in the National Association of Lawyers stated to us that the Ministry of Finance had expressed its agreement for working sessions to be conducted in the coming term with the aim of settling the status of the "Timbre" and its attributes through the necessary investigations.
Astronomically, Ramadan is on Friday, in expectation of the verdict of the sighting
Theoretically, relying on astronomical calculations and the ruling of the Istanbul conference, a sighting of the crescent in any Islamic country before the middle of the night on the day of observation may announce the entrance of the month in Islamic countries; however, this ruling remains ink on paper.
Hafez Gharibi
Within a different sphere, the National Committee has been charged with forming frameworks for study, proposing better means of co-ordination in the organization of training courses and clubs, executing scientific research in the field of sport, and defining the sporting specialisms with support for international co-operation and research on training methods. This committee will undertake to study all measures capable of moving on the formation of the frameworks in accordance with modern pedagogical and technical facts.

Rice provision
In contrast with some varieties of blue fish, other fish varieties have remained highly priced; is this due to a lack of produce as a result of climatic factors, or a want in marine produce prepared for distribution?
With regards to returns, Arabia-SICAV has maintained first place among the ranks of the variable capital investment companies (SICAV) during the first nine months of this year.
With the exception of the weak performance of SICAV L'INVESTISSEUR (-4.68%) and UBCI-UNIVERS ACTIONS SICAV (-1.35%), the entirety of Mixed SICAVs realized a growth in settlement price during the first nine months of this year. Returns have not fallen below 3%, and reached just below 4.5% in the best cases.
Economic Situation: The Season of the South 2004-2005 following Recent Measures in its Favor:
Likewise, yield per hectare has risen from 4.4 kantars to 19.1 kantars.
Kantar at 650 million
It is worth noting that the local market is considered a promising one, especially in view of the fact that the Tunisian consumption takes second place worldwide after the Italian, accounting for a total productive capacity approaching 345 thousand tons (of dough foods and couscous) per year.
President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali recently revealed a campaign of economic measures within the context of his electoral program for the term of 2005-2009, , represented by the following:
*Enabling export firms to retain foreign currency under the heading of export.
*Development of telephone coverage to reach 80% by the year 2009.
*Easing fiscal pressure and the employment burden on firms.
*Progress towards total freedom of the dinar.
*Multiplying biological production by a rate of 200%.
Tunis - Assabah: In 1952 a European coal and iron group was created, which had six members: Belgium, West Germany, Luxembourg, France, Italy and Holland. This nucleus, over the period of 47 years, developed into the largest economic bloc in the world. 1999 witnessed the birth of the Euro, announcing the European Union's arrival at the ultimate point of economic integration: monetary integration.
Walid Ad-Dara'i
Economic Assabah has undertaken the following investigation in an attempt to evaluate the past season, and observed the initial estimates of the quantity of produce anticipated for this year.
Mohamed Al-Fiqi mentioned the healthy state of the olives and explained how interventions had been made to treat the soils for olive moth with regard to 57 thousand plants, using grants of over 25 thousand dinars. Likewise, 51 thousand olive plants were treated against the honeybee.
Furthermore, we contacted the director of the Zaytouna Institute in Sfax, Tayyeb Jardaq, who confirmed these estimates to us. It is worth mentioning that this institute is estimating the quantity of produce scientifically: through the aeropalynological method, or measuring the spread of pollen in the air. This method, which came into use around 6 years ago, is capable of  estimating the harvest on a provincial or local level.
So, initial estimates for this season's harvest anticipate a reduction in production of 65%; produce will fluctuate between 140 thousand tons and 160 thousand tons of olives. These figures are very mediocre in relation to the past season, and remain linked to climatic circumstances, with this autumn's rains improving the quality of the season's olives and forecasting a better season for 2004-2005.
Tunis - Assabah Revenues from tourism in Tunisia have recorded a growth of 16% during the past nine months of the current year, passing from 1.417 billion dinars up until 30th September 2003, to 1.645 billion dinars during the same period of 2004.
What Tunisian tourism lacks, according to the monetary analysts of Tunisia Values, is a synthesis between tourism and rented accommodation; in most of the competitor countries (Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco) we find that tourism in apartments attracts a significant slice of visitors within the high-yield context of what is known as family tourism. We notice an absence of this in Tunisia, despite its importance with regard to the number of tourists staying in various lodgings.
These gaps, and others, are exploited by the Chinese - in spite of our geographic proximity to Europe, and in addition to the fact that this market is considered to be the number one provider for Tunisian tourism, accounting for around three-quarters of visitors, and in spite of the expertise of sector managers in the customs and traditions of Europeans,  the Chinese have been able, through provision of a "green card", to attract a larger number of European visitors. We mean by the green card one which approximates to the card of long-term residence in the United States of America. Thus it is necessary for sector officials to be more dynamic in this area.
Attacks on Gaza Enter their Third Week:
The Prime Minister said on Israeli public radio on behalf of the Minister of Commerce and Industry that the Laborites constituted a priority in broadening the governing coalition, considering it was necessary for the Labor Party to recognize the extent of the gravity of sharing what he described as the conclusive decisions of the authority.
Furthermore, Olmert described the current political situation of Sharon as "dangerous", criticizing the "extremists" in the Likud party who voted against the party leader last Monday evening. In his opinion, it is possible that "they will cause the Likud to splinter and the government to collapse".
Continued operations in Gaza
The Israeli army had detained him 4 years ago, for a period of 26 months.

In a New Israeli Escalation
An army statement said that 10 Israeli warplanes penetrated the airspace the day before yesterday and flew over a number of areas, confirming that it had confronted them with artillery.
Mr. Hassan Nasrallah said during a speech delivered at the inauguration of a health foundation in Dahiya in Shiite south Beirut, "since the Security Council made Resolution 1559 and up until today, the movements of Israeli planes over Lebanon have escalated, and they have multiplied."
Nasrallah added that "since this Resolution (1559) was made, Israel (...
The day before yesterday, the United Nations expressed "the degree of its concern" about the increase in Israel's violations of Lebanese skies following the previous period of relative calm.
In another aspect, Nasrallah praised the speech given by Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad on Saturday in which he vigorously attacked Resolution 1559 and the Lebanese opposition which supports this resolution.
Killing of 3 suspects and injury of 12 policemen in confrontations in Riyadh
He added that "with the commencement of investigation procedures, intensive fire, using machine guns and hand grenades, was opened on security men from the second floor."
The Agence France Presse correspondent at the location stated that ambulances headed to the site of the clashes.
19 Killed and 56 Injured in Several Iraqi Cities:
A source in the Iraqi National Guard in Hallah stated to a German news agency (DPA) correspondent that at dawn yesterday, on Tuesday, the combined forces of the American army, the National Guard and the police, with 55 tanks, troop carriers, fighter planes and helicopters commenced a raiding operation, targeting what were described as "nests of armed elements" in the town of Rashid, one of the suburbs of the city of Hallah.
The American army commenced two aerial attacks on Falluja, to the west of Baghdad, shortly before dawn yesterday, claiming to target sites believed to be hideouts of the Abu Musab Al-Zarkawi group. A medical source explained that the bombardment, which lead to the death of six people, had targeted a popular restaurant in the city.
For its part, the American army said in a statement that the Iraqi security forces and the American army had undertaken a raid on seven mosques which it suspected of harboring insurgents, shortly before dawn yesterday in Ramadi, the largest of the cities of the Anbar province.
The rebel Sunni city of Ramadi, which lies about one hundred meters west of Baghdad, is witnessing continued confrontations between fighters and American soldiers.
He explained that armed men in a car fired on Antar's car of at around nine o'clock local time in Mosul, the largest city of the Nineveh province, leading to his instant death.
Nabil Kamil, high up in the police, said to Agence France Presse that "the charge exploded at 09.00 local time and lead to the death of a woman, a man and a boy on the road four kilometers away from Samra."
Following Bashar Al-Assad's Criticism of the Lebanese Opposition:
Kandil vigorously criticized one of the foremost Syrian spokespersons in Lebanon, the Druze leader Walid Junblatt, stressing "there is no need for anyone who is not participating in the resistance to give advice on how to defend it."
Al-Assad vigorously attacked Junblatt on Saturday without naming him, stressing that Syria intervened at the beginning of the Lebanese war in 1976 to save Christians from the "massacre" which they faced "in the name of socialism, justice, and reform of the political regime."
Syria set out at the end of September to undertake a redeployment of its forces in Lebanon during which around three thousand soldiers were withdrawn. Around 15 thousand of its soldiers remain in Lebanon.
Well-informed sources see the formation of a government limited to the followers (of Syria) as "giving a bad impression to the outside", whilst Syria, and with it Lebanon, are the subject of United Nations attention.
Last year, Britain, France and Germany reached an agreement with Tehran in the context of which Tehran promised to halt the enrichment of atomic fuels, a process which could be used for producing fuel for energy-production stations or atomic bombs.
Delegation from the International Atomic Energy Agency in Iran
Following the withdrawal of the Vioxx drug from worldwide markets:
Reasons for the withdrawal
Since April 2002, doubts have been worrying experts in medical watchdogs - and particularly in drugs watchdogs - as to its effectiveness, and the possibility of side-effects emerging, following a growing pile-up of complaints here and there about a number of side-effects resulting from medicines with this type of scientific description.
These are what led to the withdrawal of the Vioxx drug from worldwide markets, and likewise the cessation of clinical testing measures out of fear for the health of the people upon whom the tests were carried out.
This means that patients who took this medicine frequently over a period of less than a year and a half are not touched at all by this announcement and they may rest easy, but as for those who became used to using the Vioxx drug for a period of 18 consecutive months or more, and they are few thank God, they are touched by the matter.
In Soliman
We learnt that investigations into the four detainees were still underway at the hands of officers of the Office of the National Guard in Soliman, in co-ordination with officers of the Regional Province of the National Guard in Grombalia (within their jurisdiction).
They stated that they had agreed among themselves to carry out excavations at that site because of their belief in the presence of rich treasures buried there. The four suspects (one from the city of Gabes, two from Kasserine and the fourth from El Haouaria) admitted that they had met inside the domain and set to work under the cover of night for fear that they would be discovered; except that what they had feared and dreaded came to pass.
The day before yesterday, on Monday, the city of Jilma witnessed a bizarre incident in which a pupil entered the classroom in a state of drunkenness, insulted the teacher and smashed window panes, causing a commotion and disrupting the normal progress of study.
The teacher attempted to put a stop to his behavior, but the suspect insulted him until the teacher realized that he was in front of a drunk (!
S. Al-Moshkar
The two presidents saluted the flag during the countries' official national anthems, before inspecting a troop of the presidential guard which saluted them.
The official spokesman for the Presidency of the Republic explained that the presidents reviewed the prospects for promotion of greater co-operation between the two countries, in the light of existing agreements between the two sides and the achievements of the Third Congress of Businessmen which reached a number of agreements for co-operation between the bodies concerned.
Likewise the dialogue touched upon the World Summit on the Information Society which, in its second phase, takes place in Tunis in 2005; along with the importance of intensified partnership between the African countries at this international event, considering the driving role of modern communication technology in reinforcing the fundamentals of development and progress.
His Excellency the President welcomed this invitation, with a date for the visit to be set down at a later time.
Common investments
We ratified a treaty for co-operation between our chamber and its counterpart in South Africa... with an exchange of visits to promote investment and discover new opportunities for economic partnerships between our two countries, in particular in view of the desire displayed by the South African businessmen to benefit from the excellent relations between Tunisia and the European countries, and the rest of the Arab and Mediterranean countries...
*Do you expect the rest of the northern states of the African continent to become involved with the efforts to develop economic partnership with rich, important countries such as the Republic of South Africa?
Johannesburg - Tunis - New York
*In practice, do you believe, as a businessman and head of the Tunis Chamber of Industry and Commerce and the Union of Mediterranean Chambers, opportunities to develop economic relations with South Africa really do exist?
The permanent loss of 19 thousand hectares of land per year
A group of proposals and guidelines resulted from this workshop, aiming to strengthen co-operation in combating desertification and erosion, and to support environmental programs in the area, in particular with regard to research into the mobilization of additional resources for funding these programs, and aiding poor and developing countries to carry out the best of their policies in the field of combating desertification and continuous land erosion.
Tunisia prepared a national program of action to combat desertification in 1998, alongside appointing a special apparatus for the co-ordination and creation of a national anti-desertification fund, in accordance with the Convention to Combat Desertification ratified in Paris in June 1994. The aforementioned program aims to combat desertification and decrease the effects of drought, by strengthening the integrated and participative approach, with undertakings of partnership and co-operation between inhabitants, foundations, professional organizations and non-governmental organizations, through the execution of programs and long-term projects on the national, regional and local levels for the improvement of land productivity and raising of inhabitants' living standards.

The afternoon session yesterday witnessed a drift towards a decrease in the share movements of a number of first-class companies, a fact which influenced the performance of the TUNINDEX index, which mirrored this regression to close at a level of 1317.08 points with a rating of 0.13%.
With regards to prices, the largest falls concerned STEQ (-2.86% at a price of 9.160D), SOTRAPIL (-1.87% at a price of 14.700D), the BIAT (-1.33% at a price of 18.600%), BS (-1.33% at a price of 7.400D), and SOTETEL (-1.21% at a price of 37.100D), whilst the remainder of the falls were very slight, concerning SFBT (-100mi.) and TUNISAIR (-20mi.).
Tunis - Assabah: The Dutch ambassador to Tunisia, Rita Dulci Rahman, confirmed during the partnership conference organized yesterday by the Dutch embassy in cooperation with the Center for Foreign Export Promotion in Export House, that Holland will work with Tunisia towards the development of trade and the promotion of foreign investment.
Rita Dulci Rahman stated that the third point, concerning the reinforcement of bilateral trade relations, will focus on a direct support for partnerships between Dutch and Tunisian organizations by means of a program of support for Dutch export goods, which will enter the implementation stage in the near future, promoting Dutch export goods so that the financing of Dutch export goods in the modern communications technology and service sectors will reach around 45 million Euro.
He added that the majority of Tunisia exports to Holland, were related to the textile and clothing sector which represents 75% of all exports, followed by the chemical manufacturing sector at 14% and the shoes and leather sector at 4%.

"The Art of Photography and Modern Technology"
For his part, Wissam Gharsallah, lecturer at the High Institute of Multimedia Art, indicated that the appearance of non-analogue or digital cameras, which he described as non-material photography, must be considered as constituting a revolution in the field of photography, whether with regard to the degree of quality of the image or its content. However, a significant number of professional photographers do not consider digital photography in the least professional. According to the same contributor, up until today some do not accept the mind-boggling speed at with which the digital image is produced, robbing the photographer of the pleasure of treating the photograph with his own hands in the laboratory, and scrutinizing with his own eyes the gradual results of his efforts. He added that the role of the camera is still secondary to that of the eye which represents the principal element in the process of photography.
As for the third and last day, it presented an opportunity for the participants in the events' activities to undertake some exploratory visits in the forests of Ain Draham and its enchanting natural setting.
Last Thursday morning, the Criminal Chamber at the Court of First Instance in Sfax postponed until November the examination of a case of a woman and her accomplices involved in a drugs affair, for further study of the case dossier, and at the request of the defense. For a reminder of the details of the case, you are informed that as a result of a security patrol undertaken in southern Sfax in the area of the Bahri neighborhood, officers of the legal team saw a girl and a youth who got rid of his cigarette at their approach, and then fled. Following the seizure of the cigarette, and the arrest of the suspect and his subjection to interrogation, he admitted consuming the narcotic substance cannabis by means of cigarettes, denying an accusation of addiction which was proved by the results of analysis, and describing his adventure with drugs for the ears of the officers, which began with a cigarette which a friend living in Italy had invited him to smoke, without informing him of its origin.
In Ghardimaou
At the same time, the investigating judge at the Court of First Instance in Jendouba issued a request for judicial assistance, delegating inspectors from the investigation and inspection team of the provincial region of the National Guard in Jendouba for its requirements to investigate the details of the crime, with the aim of discovering the conditions surrounding it, its development, and the identity of its perpetrator.
Faced with the contradicting statements of the three relatives, all were taken into custody up until the present time for continued investigation by the investigation and inspection team of the provincial region of the National Guard in Jendouba, in particular since other information supplied to the investigators indicated the existence of disagreements between the two families.
Carthage (TAP) For the occasion of the beginning of Glorious Ramadan, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali addressed the Tunisian people yesterday evening with the following words: "Oh citizens, men and women, our country, along with the rest of the Islamic peoples, welcomes the glorious month of Ramadan. May God restore it to you, and all Muslims, with all prosperity, good, and blessings.
It is not possible for us, as we welcome this blessed month in a world climate in which tensions are increasing and struggles are becoming more grave, to do other than express our hope that concord, peace, and a deepening of the spirit of co-operation and solidarity will prevail in the world among all individuals, groups, and peoples.
Ramadan greetings to Tunisia,
Tunis - Assabah Within the framework of the election campaign and the announcement of the electoral program of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, the Provincial Committee for Culture in the department of Tunis organized an electoral meeting the day before yesterday evening, attended by Mr. Abdelaziz Ben Dhia, Minister of State and Special Adviser to the President of the Republic, and the official spokesman for the Presidency of the Republic, along with Mr. Abdelbaki Hermassi, Minister of Culture, Youth and Recreation, in the presence of a number of intellectuals and artists.
Mr. Abdelaziz Ben Dhia went on to say that the electoral manifesto confirmed a continuing support for culture and artists in all areas of thought, literature and the fine arts, from the belief that culture is the prop of reform and development and it is not possible to construct a society without a solid and deep-rooted culture to contribute to protecting the national identity and character from the symptoms of cultural invasion which threaten some states in the world.
Gain and profitability in a time of challenges
There is no doubt that a tour inside the new headquarters is guaranteed to give a clear idea of their role, which is that of the backbone of all the company's activities in France, in addition to that of corporate headquarters. They unite a number of departments, both commercial, financial, and those related to quality and customer complaints.
In view of the pattern of growth seen in tourism, especially in the period following the stagnation resulting from the events of 11th September  2001, the question of oil prices remains one of the company's concerns. This was expressed by the general manager in his words, "Tunisair is not in danger but it expects danger", explaining that whenever the price of a barrel of oil went over 40 dollars, it would lead to a deficit, and in addition, a large question mark remains over the matter of fuel prices.
There is no doubt that whatever the intensive intellectual and spiritual movement which the country may experience, by way of lectures, soirees, studies, conferences, impressions or competitions, through to the special place allocated to the True Islamic Faith in the Tunis of the Change under the guidance of His Excellency the President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, there will be an opportunity to remember the virtues of this holy month, and an invitation to make use of it to increasingly take on board the contents of the Quran, which was revealed during this month. Carried out under the name of fasting, it will call for the abandonment of some depraved behaviors and reprehensible habits such as excessive spending, immoderate consumption, and customary shortcomings and carelessness in the performance of duties, in order to embrace loftiness and holiness. In fact the religious texts, the Quran and the Sunna, are clear in their call for moderation and balance, and unambiguously call for labor, striving, endeavor, the discarding of complacency and idleness, and a refraining from self-pity, to such an extent that these were revealed with the status of forms of worship.
We ask God to restore this blessed occasion to us, and the whole Islamic community, with a bestowing of general good everywhere, and to His Excellency the President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and his eminent consort Mrs. Leila Ben Ali with an abundance of health and perpetual happiness; and that He may protect them, just as He protects the Noble Quran.
Tunis - Assabah: Preparations are in full swing in all markets, and nothing occupies the citizen these days but the Ramadan basket, and that which fills the eye before the stomach.

Why did the municipality not think of providing an appropriate site for the market in the short term, rather than leaving this to the personal judgment of the vendors, who often may not be successful - this could have a negative effect on the health of the citizen.
The surplus value of the sector, or what professionals call the net banking product (such as commission and interest on loans).. has experienced relative stability in comparison to the first half of 2003, when a slight decrease of 0.3% was recorded as a result of a narrowing in the margin of interest at 8.2% which is linked to a great extent to the decision to lower the rate of interest in the past year.
The Day After Allawi Threatens to Attack Falluja:
Likewise, an American soldier was killed and two others injured in a bomb explosion on a road situated to the east of Baghdad, which raises the toll of human losses suffered by the American occupation in Iraq to nine deaths in less than two days.
An American military official told Agence France Presse that the two explosions which shook the Khadra area were not due to a bombardment, but rather to explosive devices which had been brought into the area.
A medical source said that the hospital had "received five dead and 13 injured."
Meanwhile, 15 members of the Iraqi National Guard were killed the day before yesterday evening (Wednesday) in an attack carried out by armed individuals on their base in the Al-Qaim area near the Syrian border, and their weapons taken, as was stated in a wire sent to police administration in the Anbar province.
They added that the attack did not result in any victims from among the ranks of the National Guard.
In Baghdad, unknown individuals assassinated an investigating judge and a journalist in two separate incidents yesterday morning.
In Baquba two Iraqi army officers were killed at the hands of unknown men who opened fire on their car in the city, which is located to the north east of Baghdad.
The day before yesterday, the president of the Iraqi provisional government, Ayad Allawi, had threatened to carry out a wide-ranging attack on the city of Falluja if the Jordanian Abu Musab Al-Zarkawi was not handed over with his group.
Gaza (news agencies) - Occupation forces widened the scope of their attack on Gaza Strip to include operations in the Rafah camp in the south of the Sector, in addition to the continuing incursions into the Jabalia camp and Beit Lahia in the north of the Strip.
In retaliation, Hamas avowed to improve the Qassam rockets and continue launching them despite the new warning system.
Sharon also announced on Israeli public radio in an address he made before the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, generally holding its discussions in closed sessions, that "as long as Israeli citizens are under attack, the operations will continue."
With the events
What does he care about the absence of security in Iraq, in Chechnya, in Sudan, and in Somalia.. Why would it bother him that the Palestinian people are living under the yoke of occupation, humiliation, starvation, genocide, perpetual blockade, forced deportations and deliberate neglect. What would it matter to the United States that Afghanistan is in ruins, its people in poverty and its schools closed under Taliban and after Taliban fell.
And of course the world is safe after the fatal hit copped by the Israelis in Taba and other tourist destinations on the Egyptian Sinai peninsula..
Did he let the Afghani people carry out their election process freely?
Is the world today safer only because Muslim countries, in addition to Palestine and Iraq, live daily through death and terror.
But what is the solution?

Tunis - Assabah. Four persons were infected the day before yesterday with Hepatitis A. The source of the infection remains unknown. They were later transported in a critical state to the local hospital in Al Khirbah where they were kept.
It should be mentioned that Al Khirbah local hospital had admitted this past year 27 persons afflicted with the disease. All of them were treated and the number shrunk this season to only 4 affected.
Our contact assured that the principal cause of infection is not proven.
Tunis - Assabah: Officers at the National Guard station in El Amra forestalled three operations of clandestine departure by sea this week, the latest being on the night of last Wednesday to Thursday.
The second operation forestalled at its inception by the National Guard indicates that ten persons gathered in El Amra forest awaiting the time to be moved to the Jabinyanah Beach where they were to take part in a clandestine departure by sea. They had previously arranged this with an organizer and paid him various sums of money ranging from 900 to a thousand Dinars.
Health Services in Public Hospitals
These privileges made us question the level if health services in public hospitals.
Ads Fatima: "The citizen shuns resorting to private health institutions to avoid the expenses, but falls victim to these numerous fees especially if the diagnosis of the illness takes a long time and there is a prolonged rehabilitation period."
About the same issue, Mrs. Sakina Assaghir, a clerk, says: "I avoid going to public hospitals because I hate waiting. I have been waiting since eight in the morning, and it is half past nine now and my turn has not yet come."
Paramedical milieu
Mrs. Amal Chouwachi, a receptionist at a public hospital, said in regards to the waiting times, "What the patient has not understood is that he has to wait for the doctor who manages his case. In reality, the phenomenon of waiting for long hours is no longer there, and usually all patients finish their tests by midday."
Inside the Abattoir of the Meat Company:
On the other hand, the supply was available and the dressed and sorted meats exhibited at prices defined and made known to all. The maximum did not exceed 8,500D for beef and 8,700D for lamb. During our visit we also saw the arrival at the abattoir of trucks carrying loads of frozen lamb meat, specifically to the dressing and marketing outlet. On the other hand, a number of the meat transporting cars were getting ready to travel to external retail outlets to ensure the markets' supply on the first day of the fast.
On the other hand, covering needs and meeting them with required amounts is not limited to the Province of Tunis, as trucks are being sent to the inner parts of the Republic, specifically to the provinces of El-Kef, Bizerte, Sfax and Kairouan.
During the conversation with Dr.
"At Tunisia Telecom":
The company has also adopted an easier way of payment, with 10 Dinars as the first installment, and 20 Dinars which can be paid in two installments over two months. This was announced by Mr. Ahmed Mahjoub, president and CEO of Tunisia Telecom, at a press conference which took place yesterday to introduce the new commercial offers in the mobile phone sector, in response to the contents of the election program of the President Zine El-Abidine Bin Ali and in the context of moving towards a knowledge society.

It seems that the Progressive Democratic Party will hold its legislative elections campaign without agreeing to an election manifesto, after it found it impossible to distribute the manifesto it had prepared years ago..
Popular Unity Party, the opposition party with the largest number of women candidates, is preparing for the legislative elections. Its lists are headed by 4 women in addition to the membership of other women on additional lists.
In addition to the traditional means, such as posters, distribution of pamphlets and regional meetings, the Party prepared magnetic stickers and electronic correspondence via e-mail or mobile phones. It also sent messages to the public via regular post.

.. and nothing more
On the contrary, for the play "The Queue", directed by Slim Sanhaji and written by Sabah Bouzouita , is a faultless piece of theatrical work...
I disregard those promoters of symbolism who accuse the intelligent of stupidity while unaware that they are themselves more stupid than a parrot...
Weapons of denial were absent from the show, and art attended in all its prime and supremacy, imbued with dignity and pride...
Five characters with nothing in common...
is a work that tells the story of people who arrived in a specific place at an unknown time to attend to some business ..
manipulating values and laws, abandoning Man's humanity to the winds, so that chaos replaces order, violence peace, and the queue disappears and the brawl starts...?
If you are one of those who love engaging in deep thought and abstain from superficiality, you can travel far in your thoughts and immerse yourself in metaphors. The play easily and simply takes you back to a view you see repeatedly, on the bus, in the spice shop, or in front of the Embassy of the planet Saturn...
The five characters have no past and don't know each other. They have met for the very first time. Slowly they start communicating and we travel with them and explore them, feeling their torment and anguish, their humility and meanness, richness and poverty, impotence and pain, simplicity and small ruses used to cover up their internal painful world...
but in an attempt to obtain a tacit admission that they have more right to existence than the other at the other's expense or - to put it simply - to attaining the first place...

At least 7 dead left behind and a number of wounded:
An American army communique said that two air raids were launched against targets the American army says are hideouts for the supporters of Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi.
The American naval infantry (the Marines) and the Iraqi forces continue operations on the ground.
It added that not even the American forces themselves were able to capture him, and that Al-Zarqawi is not present among them.
Suicide Explosion
A police officer who wished to remain anonymous said that "a person drove his car close to a police patrol and exploded it."
On the other hand, border guards in Iraq yesterday announced that during a raid on villages bordering with Iran, they detained 135 Pakistanis and Afghanis who had infiltrated into Iraq.
Iraqi authorities continually announce the detention of tens of Afghanis who enter clandestinely to visit the Shia holy shrines in the south.
Belkhadem added that the issue of the Algerian-Moroccan border has been dealt with through international accord and documents sanctioned by the United Nations.

Presidential Elections in Afghanistan:
The only female candidate in the presidential race, Massouda Jalal, comes fourth, with 2.5% of the votes, while the ethnic Hazara nominee Mohammed Mohaqiq achieved 2% of the votes.
The Electoral Commission responsible for organizing the entitlements has distributed 10.5 million ballot cards to voters in Afghanistan.
Results of the first round in the first Afghani elections were expected the day before last. According to the United Nations, 18 candidates have nominated themselves between late October and early November.
The investigations in the matter started after the aggrieved Tunisian lodged a complain stating that he was a victim of fraud by Africans who robbed him of a significant sum of money which he estimated at a few thousand Dinars.
The Africans, however, disappeared on that day and changed residence, leaving the aggrieved stranded after he became sure that he was a victim of a fraud. He immediately went to the Guard station and informed the officers.
14 apprehended and goods of unidentified origin seized in two public motels
The first operation started after the security officers learned that a group of young men had stored valuable goods in a public motel in the area. The goods consisted of mobile phone covers, clothes, and toys of various types and sizes. Accordingly, the place was first placed under surveillance, and subsequently stormed. Goods of unidentified origin were found in the eight suspects' rooms and they admitted to the charges. They were referred to the court after investigations with them were completed.
By the way
This initiative had positive effects and reverberations on the ground, invigorating market movement both in supply and demand during the past days, registering no commotion, disorder or dearth of any goods in distribution outlets. The effect was seen clearly in prices, with processed milk abundant and piled up in main squares and distribution outlets. We did not notice any of the long queues in front of these, as was usual at this time of the year. Vegetable and crop alleys had potatoes, onions and tomatoes in exceptional amounts, breaking with its last year's record of scarcity and absence of these items.
(May)
The Party entered into negotiations with the Administration, conceding to amend some of the paragraphs, especially in form, while keeping the Party's position intact.
It seems that there wasn't enough coordination between the Observation Committee and the leadership of the Party, pushing the Party to adopt this kind of an attitude towards the Elections Program, despite the fact that the Administration settled for the second lot of amendments to the Elections Program.
"I am doubly happy - once to support President Ben Ali, and once to meet the Tunisian public"
From his side, the singer Ragheb Alama expressed his happiness at contributing with his singing to the concert. He said, "I feel proud to contribute in the election campaign of a president well known for his goodness, and a leader who deserves all love and respect for what he offered the Tunisian people in great and pioneering acts in different fields."
Ragheb Alama then moved on to talk about many issues that relate to his artistic journey, and stressed that he is an artist who rejects media compromises. He is an artist for the people, and he noted in this context that he refuses to succeed through the good offices of others, just as he refused to have the Mazzika Channel monopolize his songs. He does not ask production companies to correctly distribute his productions, since he is in charge of this production. The company he deals with, "Alam El Phan", is hugely reknown artistically and this helps him a lot in distributing his artistic productions.

Dr Ambrogio Manenti, a local representative of the World Health Organization, said that "malnutrition, deteriorating psychological conditions, anemia among pregnant women and child mortality rates have all reached worrisome levels as a result of these closure operations" which the Israeli army carries out in Palestinian areas.
On the other hand, Dr. Mohammed Skafi, in charge of the emergency section at the Union of Palestinian Medical Relief Committees, says that search procedures at Israeli checkpoints cause huge delays in the passage of ambulances.
To this end,  the representative of the World Health Organization Dr Ambrogio Manenti warned of "impeding humanitarian crisis in Gaza Strip" where the Israeli forces carried out extensive military operations for more than two weeks, resulting in 128 martyrs among the Palestinians.
Baghdad (news agencies) - Security situation in Iraq continued to deteriorate with Baghdad witnessing no less than two powerful explosions in the areas surrounding Andalus Square, and bomb attacks on five churches, while tensions continued to rise in the city of Fallujah amidst indications of American military preparations for an extensive attack on the insurgent Sunni city.
An official Iraqi spokesman said that the explosions occurred at four in the morning, local time (one Greenwich Time) and that nothing was immediately known about the identity or motive of the attackers.
Reinforcements and Siege
This coincided with a series of air raids waged on Fallujah, west of Baghdad, by the American military aircraft in the evening of the day before last.
While these military actions and developments take place, the British media disclosed yesterday that British forces currently stationed in the south of Iraq received an official request from the Americans to replace the American battalion which will be relocated to take part in combat in other places in Iraq. This information was confirmed by the British Ministry of Defense, mentioning at the same time that no decision was yet made in this regard.
During this, it was announced in Baghdad that the Iraqi government has extended by two days the period for handing over of arms in Sadr City, which was supposed to end on Friday, the day before yesterday.
An Americal military official confirmed, however, that what has been handed over so far is only a tiny part and may be just scrap metal.
Tunis (TNA) A rural assembly met yesterday at the Exhibitions Palace in Al-Karam chaired by Mr. Hamed Karoui, first deputy chairman of Democratic Constitutional Rally and in the presence of a significant number of farmers and seamen, to show their absolute support for the President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali during the presidential elections.
On the other hand, Mr. Hamed Karoui touched on the election program of the president Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali during the presidential period 2004-2009, noting that this futuristic program is integrative and comprehensive of all sectors and responds to the aspirations and worries of all classes in the Tunisian society. He pointed out that the tenth paragraph of the said ambitious program includes ways to guarantee the strengthening of food security, the improvement of farmers' conditions and the achievement of a higher competitive level for national products, calling for a motion towards such promising sectors as organic farming.

Increasing tardiness  in colleges:
This issue can lead to tensions between the teacher and the student, and sometimes to failure and expulsion. Tardiness also constitutes a big problem for the administration in colleges, with long queues forming in front entry tickets windows and difficulties in dealing with the tardiness.
Among the causes for student tardiness, according to him, are: school transport which has to put much effort into performing its job, as the fleet is decrepit, distances long and the custom of gathering students in one place absent, all of which lead to the students' inability to always reach school on time.
Our source confirmed that the role of parents in following up on their children must be more supportive to diminish the extent of wasting academic time, so that their children's tardiness because an exception, not a norm.
Our interviewee also presented another very important issue, saying that the directive legislation for school education and teaching permits colleges autonomous management. However, we find that these educational institutions have not so far utilized this to ensure that teaching times are appropriate to their needs and the needs of their students, in terms of college opening times, the organization of space within, outlining timetables and operating within the human and financial resources available to them. Our interviewee confirmed that directors of educational institutions are required to take responsibility for this issue and to utilize the flexibility provided by the directive legislation for school education and teaching in time management.
Private tuition for students in first year primary:
Parent Ali has a daughter attending first year primary at a school in one of the southern suburbs of the capital. She gets private tuition at her teacher's house in addition to those at school. Ali says, "I thought that my daughter's attending school will lower the expenses to some extent, since I won't have to pay as much as I paid for the kindergarten. What scared me was when the teacher approached me and demanded I must enroll her with some of her classmates in private tuition which she organizes at her home, some distance away from my house. My wife and I don't know what to do."
As regards the results of this tuition and the benefits the students may obtain from them, quite a number of both parents and students interviewed by the Weekly indicated that they are useless, occurring at the end of the day when the student is unable to concentrate. Minia, a mother, says, "her daughter gets up with her at six in the morning to attend day classes, then stays at the kindergarten revising what she has learnt, and comes home with her at five. Then she is forced to attend private tuition at six thirty, without being able to rest. Her ability to concentrate will decrease, and her capacity to absorb diminish as a result. I am aware that this is not in her benefit, but I cannot refuse."
Toys sold in Flea Markets
Thus it becomes important to seek the advice of a doctor and the seller of the toys. However, what kind of an advice will be provided by the seller of toys in Hafsia or any other market close by, with the toys piled up in heaps and huge bags?
Will the shop owner and the client really keep their promises?
Surely, such excesses from both parties to the hiring process constitute a joint responsibility if any problems or breaches of duty occur between them. Maybe the most important among the presented complications are the motorcycles' official documents, since some of the infringers rent out motorcycles that have incomplete papers. This is also the responsibility of the client who does not ask for his rights in this matter and accepts riding a transport vehicle which does not offer him a minimum insurance in case of an accident of which he is either a victim or causes harm to another. This point specifically invites the question: Do owners of motorcycle rental shops really insure all the motorcycles?
Wearing a helmet is also a compulsory regulation while riding motorcycles. Every motorcycle rental should be accompanied by a helmet handed out to the renter. However, despite the importance of this procedure, it is considered secondary by both parties to their primary aim: making money for the shop owner, and the lowest possible price and having a good time on the motorcycle without having to resort to these comprehensive procedures even if they provided the ideal protection from breaches and hazards on the road. Not to mention that there are those who use motorcycles for suspect activities such as theft and pick pocketing in addition to those renters who have not yet reached 12 years of age.
She is a lively Palestinian actress, her features reflecting the picture of an educated activist woman who in her life has gone through both sweet and bitter experiences. This woman of Bedouin beauty is the actress Nisreen Ali, among us with the first long movie on her journey, "In the 9th Month", directed by Ali Nassar.
- There is always hope of opening inroads at festivals, especially such prestigious festival as the Carthage Film Festival which I consider a gateway to the Arab areas. I want here to send a quick message to every Arab who believes in the Arab-Palestinian interaction, let us all cooperate to get the Palestinian film out of the "veto" from which it suffers and which is imposed on it by the occupying authorities. Although we are dispersed, our culture is united and our art similar. We are proud of our nationalism and embedded identity, despite all the enemies of humanity who want to undo it and deface it. The Palestinian film is what carries our worries, fears and hopes across to you, reflecting our bitter reality. It lights the way towards the liberation of the homeland.
- This director is my teacher, and my first discoverer in the seventh art. ?My success in embodying the lead role of his film is due to him, as he does not mind me discussing things with him and exchanging opinions in certain aspects related to the work.
* Does this mean that you will have to accept roles regardless to their standards?
Anan dismisses accusations that France and Russia were bribed by Saddam, and confirms that the Iraqi war did not improve security in the world.
The report stated that important persons in Russia and France were targeted on account of the two countries' permanent membership in the UN Security Council.
He added, "In my opinion this is inconceivable. These are very important and serious governments."
He continued, "I cannot say the world is safer.
In the Czech Republic
The founding document of the party states that the time has come to change the inequality of women with men at work, within the family and in society, and to change the current pattern of what the document calls "false liberation".
She assured that the party will deal with issues which the current politicians in the Czech Republic are not solving despite them being important to women who constitute half of the society.
Contrary to that, the previous head of the Freedom Union Party, Hana Marvanova, sees the establishment of a women's party an interesting idea and asserts that women's issues are strong and have to be brought into the open.
Opposition members of the British Parliament also expressed their concern regarding plans to free American forces by deploying British forces in Baghdad.
The correspondent said, "If the British forces go to cover up for the American forces operating in Iraq, they must be stationed in a relatively safe position south of Baghdad, like a base in Basra where the British forces are currently stationed."
Nicholas Soames, the British Shadow Foreign Minister, said that keeping peace is "a concept alien to the American forces" and deemed it necessary that Britain have a say equal to that of America in dealing with Iraqi combatants.
6 American soldiers killed and two helicopters destroyed in 24 hours
Medical sources did not immediately report any losses because ambulances were not able to get into the combat zone.
In Baqubah yesterday morning, a National Guard soldier was killed by unknown fire on his way to his base in Khalis, north of this town.
An American military statement said investigations are being carried out to discover the circumstances behind the crash of the two helicopters.
9 Iraqi policemen killed
It should be pointed out that Latifiyah is considered one of the areas were there is much armed activity against the foreign presence in Iraq.
The statement continued, "The Government has previously assured that it will not resort to the use of force in Fallujah or anywhere else except as a last resort and after exhausting all peaceful means," adding that "the continuation by the terrorists to threaten our people and their use of certain areas and cities as harbors is something very difficult for the Government to accept or indefinitely continue tolerating."
New York Times quoted soldiers at the base and intelligence sources saying that detainees who don't cooperate in investigations are regularly suffering mistreatment and abuse for prolonged periods.
On the other hand, officials in the Pentagon refused to comment about these reports and the American Army limited itself to issuing a statement confirming that detention conditions in Guantanamo are safe and humane.
It should be pointed out that the scandals of torturing of Iraqi prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison by the American Army forces have brought similar practices in the American base in Cuba to attention, especially after a number of released detainees made statements.
The accused in this case is a young man with a previous criminal record, which made him notorious among all the residents of western Al Karm. On the night of the incident which, as we have mentioned, coincided with the first night of Ramadan, he smoked a cigarette stuffed with narcotics and after getting high on it went to a nearby cafe, armed with an 80 cm knife and a bottle of paralyzing gas.

In the afternoon of the day before yesterday, El Beji convened a general meeting in the capital under the slogan "Real Political and National Practice For a Promising Civil Society". The meeting was characterized by the attendance of a number of young people and party members.
Liberalization of the economic sector...
In regards to his aspirations, Mr. Mounir El Beji assured that he does not aspire to any responsibilities in the government except "to continue activism for the establishment of real multi-party democracy in Tunisia." In this context he said, "I do not aspire to any responsibilities in the government except "to continue activism for the establishment of real multi-party democracy in Tunisia, and I have not ceased playing my role as a democratic, patriotic, moderate, law-respecting and abiding opposition figure."
With members of the community abroad
On the occasion of Ramadan:
Will there be a special timing for the great month of Ramadan, or will the voting process continue till after the Iftar?
Ballot counting open to all
In response to this questions, Mr. Abdelwaheb El Behi stated that the law dictates that ballot counting occurs immediately after the closure of voting.
Complaints
Some of these complaints, in fact, are not the responsibility of the National Observatory but are covered by the Constitutional Assembly.
In regards to the banning of the election statement of the Progressive Democratic Party's lists led by Ahmed Nejib Chebbi, the Chairman of the Observatory said that he had interceded with the Ministry of Interior and was informed that "initially a conflict had arisen regarding the content of the election statement in its first version, but the statement was amended after both sides agreed. After the Ministry agreed to the amended version, the leadership of the Progressive Democratic Party recanted and refused to distribute it."
World Award of the President of the Republic for Islamic Studies
Also, local Koranic competitions were organized at the municipal level, in turn preparing for the regional competitions through which nominations were made to the National Competition and the International Holy Koran Memorization, Recitation and Interpretation Competition which will be organized in the last ten nights of the great Ramadan month.
Praiseworthy presidential traditions
The judging committee of this important international Koranic competition, says the Minister, is formed of sheikhs who have memorized God's Book and are schooled in it, from Egypt, Palestine, Morocco, Iran and Tunis (the hosting country).
Other various activities
Work will start on a hotel on Ave. Mohamed V soon
Speaking about the meeting, the Chairman of the Group said that he felt the Tunisian state's determination to confer a special importance on tourism, and that it is very careful - through the decisions made in this regard - to improve the quality of services, rehabilitate hotel units and get a handle on training specialized staff. This will contribute, as he said, in improving the destination of Tunis at the qualitative level, this destination being the cheapest worldwide as a week is sold for only 130 EU. According to him, supplying such prices means there is a problem, and that is why the state has adopted an important reform plan to rehabilitate the sector, taking into account all the required factors for success.
The Conference Palace, according to him, is a necessity but with a reasonable capacity. They had rethought it again but, according to him, these kinds of projects have to be prepared by the state.
Considering that Accor Group is classified as the second worldwide, Mr. Pelisson said about the future of the sector that tourism worldwide has been affected by the recession in international economies, first and foremost the American economy. It has also been affected by the phenomenon of terrorism. As such, 2003 was a bad year and 2004 a little better. We hope that 2005 will be better than 2004, especially as the supply has increased and consequently international demand will have to grow, particularly with the opening up of the Chinese tourist market onto the world.

At the end of August 2004: 1013 French corporations investing in Tunisia
Majority (82%) of the European investments are concentrated in the laboratory industry sector (textiles, clothing, chemicals and electronics). The remaining investments are distributed among services sector (7%), tourism sector (6%), farming sector (3%) and energy sector (2%).
The Lebanese singer Ragheb Alama has maintained his wide popularity with the young people despite new voices of the one-hit-wonder kind inundating all musical and public spaces. A huge audience showed up at El-Menzah Sports Palace on Saturday evening for the concert organized by the support committee for President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in Hammadi Ben Ammar's sector in Halq Al-Wadi as part of the presidential and legislative election campaign.
To start with, one must give each person their due. Singer Insaf Bel Ghalia proved being exceptional through a soft voice and strong performance of the most difficult songs she ever dealt with.
With Walid Tawfik, followed by Ragheb Alama, it can be said that song entered the world of eurhythmics without losing its Lebanese mountain spirit or its lyrics which are often strikingly balladic and close to the collective Arab imagination.
- It isn't my custom to release my new songs at performances before the album is released, but today I am going to sing you a new song that has not been yet released in a specific album."

Tunis - Assabah: When talent joins culture and acute awareness of surroundings, the artistic result itself in turn becomes an extension that has uniformity and vision and a mark that is perceived and so understood.
This linguistic research did not lack cultural and political implications which Adel Bouallag defined in terms of our relationship to rhetoric after we have clashed with the material reality that makes one revert back and criticize one's rhetoric.
Although the first scene is important in getting to know the desert, yet it obliterates its original appearance and the hardships of the nomad. It does away with the issues of moving and existence, and we no longer question the need to live in the desert. This has created a differential balance between two desert worlds: the first furnished by absence and the second by presence.
As such, it is expected that Adel Bouallag's "Caravan" will ring multiple bells and that the work contains a number of dimensions linking the artistic with the humanistic, natural, cultural, civilizational and political.

On the other hand, American forces released at dawn yesterday Sheikh Khaled Hamoud, chief negotiator of Fallujah city who was detained on Friday.
Members of the Fallujah delegation to talks with Iraqi authorities had decided last Thursday to "suspend any negotiations" with the government which they described as "puny" in objection to what the Prime Minister Iyad Allawi announced about the necessity to hand over the Jordanian Abu Musab Al Zarqawi and his group.
He said, "Next week we will announce a nation-wide campaign to collect arms."
Jerusalem (News Agencies) It seems that the Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and the Israeli settlers are moving towards a definite confrontation over Sharon's plan to withdraw from the Gaza Strip, after the two teams parted the day before yesterday over irreconcilable positions following a meeting in Al-Quds.
The meeting, being the first since Sharon proposed his plan to withdraw from Gaza on December 18th 2003, continued for almost two hours at Sharon's office in Al-Quds.
We did not receive any serious answers to our request that he heeds the nation's decision."

Carthage (TNA) The government's activity and plan of action for the coming days were the focus of the meeting yesterday morning between President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and the Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi.
In a different milieu, the head of the state also discussed the issue of energy control, being  briefed in this context about progress in realizing the national program for rationalizing energy usage and promoting the usage of renewable energy sources, especially in the light of continually rising consumption of traditional energy sources and increasing fuel prices in international markets that have reached record numbers.
The integration of the social project during the period of blessed change results from the continual concern of his Excellency President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali with various sectors, to which he gave his immense attention and great care. This from the start paved the way for the rise of a harmonious structure that cared for people and buildings and provided an appropriate basis that allows the Tunisian citizen to work, create and actively participate in building the glory of present and future Tunisia.
Viewing these places makes one aware of the care this vital sector receives, in its capacity as one of the aspects of the comprehensive structure which manifests the constructive and positive interaction of the Tunisian cultural project, proud of its heritage and past, and protecting its characteristics and specifics as much as being open onto other civilizations and cultures.
"I shall never pay!"
The situation placed in focus the role of states and its direct relationship with the market. The world in general has seen an unprecedented boom from 1945 to 1975, known as the rosy period, during which the role of the state saw an active contribution to the economic cycle, based essentially on the market imbalance that legitimated its intervention. These imbalances were essentially represented in:
-Imprecise information.
This failure continues to be reflected until now, as the poverty rate increases and state bankruptcy continues (Argentina).
Tunis - Assabah: Production indicator of the financial leasing sector in Tunisia has seen a growth of 25% during the first six months of 2004 for the five companies listed on the stock exchange that constitute 80% of the sector's market share.

Traditional handicrafts strive to serve Tunisian tourism
It should be mentioned that the National Office for Traditional Handicrafts has regularly participated in the largest international exhibitions since 2000, the most important of these being the international trade fair for antiques and gifts in the German city of Frankfurt, and the international exhibition for decor, gifts and decorative arts in Paris. An official source in the Office informed us that Tunisian participation in the International Crafts Selling Exhibition in Milan between December 4th and 12th will be massive, with an 81 sq. m. wing being booked to include 7 specialized fields in traditional handicrafts.
As a reminder, funding of traditional handicraft projects was previously limited to the National Fund for the Promotion of Handicrafts and Small Businesses (Fonapram) with a funding limit not exceeding 4000 Dinars.
Iraq
Iraqi security sources said that 6 Howitzer mortars fell on the headquarters, 40 km north of the Iraqi capital, and pointed out that American Black Hawk helicopters helped evacuate the injured.
Eye witnesses said that the arrests came after violent confrontations between a number of armed men and the American forces during which helicopters were called in to shell the orchards surrounding the city.
Iraqi authorities said that the attack which occurred near Baiji did not stop oil pumping and that exports are continuing.
American military aircraft carry out night raids on Fallujah on an almost daily basis, while American and Iraqi forces made up of one thousand men has besieged the city five days ago after a warning issued by the President of the interim Iraqi government Iyad Allawi to the city's residents to hand over Al Zarqawi and his followers or face a massive attack.
What after the Human Rights report and Peter Hansen's statements?
This is not the first time that Israeli occupation forces gave free rein to their helicopters and tanks to destroy those Palestinian towns, villages and camps under the pretext of pursuing Palestinian activists or demolish the alleged tunnels for smuggling weapons. And yet the fact is that sights of the destruction and devastation and the pictures of homeless women, children and elderly making their way through the ruins of Jabalaya refugee camp awaiting the Iftar raise many questions about the international community's responsibility on the various legislative, political and ethical levels for the daily crimes committed against the Palestinian people.
Maybe the events of Rafah camp and the massacre of Jenin are still in memory. Two years later the fate of the investigation into that massacre, called for by the Secretary General of the United Nations, is still only ink on paper.
And if the international community is incapable of stopping the occupation, it could at least as a basic measure concentrate efforts to prevent providing Israel with various machineries for destruction, devastation and mass murder which it uses to terrorize the Palestinians and force them into accepting the politics of occupation or look for ways to leave.
Marlton (United States) (News Agencies) -
John Kerry responded in the same sarcastic vein as Bush, accusing him of "being stuck on the notion" that great progress is being made in Iraq and hiding the truth concerning the situation in Iraq from the American people.
Kerry asserted that "The President is still making very resolute speeches about the things he did for the good of the forces" but without providing them with the necessary provisions for the war in Iraq.
On the other hand, the "September 11 Widows" who support Kerry aimed similar criticism at the performance of the American administration.

Occupied Al-Quds (News Agencies) The French Foreign Affairs Minister, Michel Barnier, said yesterday during his visit to Israel that "no one chooses one's adversary" adding that nothing can be achieved without or against the President of the Palestinian Authority, Yasser Arafat. In a speech he gave at the Tel Aviv University on the third and last day of his visit to Israel that "history teaches us that we don't choose our adversary and it is with him that we make peace." Barnier said, "I know very well what is being said here about the President of the Palestinian Authority and those who meet him, but we still believe that nothing can be achieved without or against Arafat, and that keeping him a prisoner reduces the chances of seeing the Palestinian political system open up to the new generations."
He concluded by saying, "Europe has witnessed war and closed borders and walls, but it knows that peace is first and foremost built and established in the minds."
He added, "the homes being destroyed, the families thrown out on the street, the curfews, the re-occupations, the targeted operations which also mow down the innocent
More than half of Americans trust Kerry can solve economic problems better than Bush.

Tunis - Assabah: During the month of Ramadan, commercial activity in the centre of the capital, in the markets and in the Arab quarter is distinguished by a specific character and heavy activity that add glamour to the city - staying late in cafes, strolling around shops and attending the cultural and religious events organized for the occasion.
Although the heat encourages going out and strolling in the city, yet one week into the month of Ramadan and shopping activity has not taken off well. Shops and shopping malls have not until yesterday opened their doors to the public, and all movement was limited to cafes which were so crowded with citizens that obtaining a place in them was an impossible feat.

"The approach will be gradual... and does not mean the dinar will be completely liberalized by 2009"
With regard to the banking system, the speaker revealed that future orientation is aimed at changing the structure of bank capital through privatization or a combination by making them 1/3 state-owned, 1/3 privately owned and 1/3 owned with foreign capital. This future program is also aimed at preparing for the requirements of Basel II by strengthening cautious banking. The program also suggests moving beyond traditional banking operations so as to make it an efficient partner to the customer and his associates by updating banking methods and improving the mechanisms of transaction, for example in the area of cash and electronic payment with efforts made to reduce the use of notes, which grows at a yearly rate of 8 to 10%, contrary to developed countries where credit cards are the most common method of transaction between commercial partners.
It should also be mentioned that liberalizing the dinar will also increase the precision of commercial operators in the Tunisian economy, and therefore attract more foreign investment.
Situation boiling in Israel
In the midst of this heated political climate, defense minister Shaoul Movaz  and Chief of Staff Moshe Ya'alon warned political and religious leaders of the settlers against inciting disobedience which "threatens Zionism."
Yehusho Moher Yosef, spokesman for the "Council for Jewish Settlements in Judea, Samaria (West Bank) and Gaza," the settler's main organization, said "we will blockade the Knesset building (Israeli parliament) on the day voting is conducted" on withdrawal.
Movaz met the party's spiritual leader again, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, to convince him not to oppose the withdrawal plan.

behind bars for six months. He left prison a few days ago, after serving his sentence, fully determined to carry out his plan. On the day of the incident, the suspect spotted his prey and waited for him to pass by a soccer field and, given the relative absence of passers-by, the offender attacked his enemy who was unable to defend himself. Using a broken bottle, the offender hit the victim on the head and face, causing severe injuries, then fled. The victim was taken to the hospital for first aid and was kept under medical care given the seriousness of his condition. In parallel, police officers at the West Marsa center promised to investigate the case and were able to arrest the offender within a short span of time who admitted what he was accused of, saying he carried out this act of revenge against the victim because he had testified against him in the past.
Police officers in Dar Shu'ban al-Fahri arrested six people (males and females) last Thursday afternoon who were involved in a case involving secret prostitution and intermediation.

Tunis - Assabah The modern communications and information technology sector is seeing exceptional activity and development on all fronts in its capacity as a means of supporting broad economic growth, an effective mechanism to prepare future generations and an arena for cultural and educational contact with brotherly and friendly nations and peoples. With faith in the importance of the communications and information technology in our modern times, Tunisia has subscribed to a broad-ranging national strategy based on developing the foundations for communications and broadening its scope by creating a national digital network to cover all regions and an integrated legal framework to ensure it is linked into e-commerce, as well as to spread computer literacy by generalizing internet usage among young people, media studies and modern language studies at every educational stage.
Doctor Firyal al-Baji says that in the coming years, communications technology will play a bigger and more fundamental role in stimulating the economic fabric. Saying "the future is in out hands" is not impossible in Tunisia in order to make our country a regional pole for promising activities, an aim which will reinforce Tunisia's position on the international scene and give it the means to stand out and shine within its Arab, African, Mediterranean and international surroundings.

An intense debate is underway these days within the Tunisian Geographical Society which is preparing to host the International Geographical Convention here on Tunisian soil.
In the case in question, allow me to borrow a doctrinal structure that what is right is obvious and what is wrong obvious and the position of members of the Tunisian Geographical Society is the required honorable position at a time when standards are muddled and place of expressed symbolic positions has diminished, for the question is not one of Israeli sportsmen or artists or poets but of Israeli geographers, in other words land and map experts and is not our whole battle with Israel a battle of land and maps?!
We reject their presence because there is a central disagreement between us and them, specifically the battle of geography.

In preparation for voting day and in order for voting to take place in an optimum manner and under conditions in keeping with the legal provisions and the voters' will, I would like to point out that we have, by amending the Electoral Code, provided all the conditions for transparency and fairness in the voting process.

Brigadier Mujtaba Ahmed al-Hitti, police chief for Hit to the west of Ramadi, one of the biggest towns in the province of Anbar, said that "a suicide bomber drove into the police academy where a number of police were training and blew himself up."
Captain Bill Cobronell of the 1st Infantry division told Agence France Presse that the fighting in Bahrez broke out at 07h20 (GMT 04h20) when gunmen fired at an American patrol in the area, leading to widespread clashes which lasted seven hours.

By Asia al-Atrous
Apart from another review of the various humiliations and setbacks which the United Nations has been linked to since the start of the Iraq crisis, whether regarding the false reality of weapons of mass destruction and what followed in terms of declaring war against this country and subjecting it to occupation, destruction and ruin, the truth is also that one of the firmest principles stated in the United Nations charter, concerning maintaining security and peace in the world and working to resolve disputes by peaceful means, has become an absent priority as a result of the bureaucracy the organization is drowning in, turning it into a machine whose crucial decisions are subject to a game of interests between the big countries with permanent membership in the Security Council.
There is no doubt that the road ahead for the organization to salvage what it can salvage and reinstate its image in the world is to follow a single direction that allows for no duality and requires a return to the principles of international law and the United Nations charter, for without them there is no way of regaining what has been lost.
came up with the fiendish idea and created a whole scenario to appropriate land belonging to another person. To carry out his plan, he approached a poor man and enticed him with money to help him with his mission which consisted in accompanying him to a notary's office to pretend he was the owner of that land and wished to sell it but that he had lost his national identity card. The old man agreed after he was promised one thousand dinars and they headed for the notary's office and misled him with this idea. However, the notary asked for two witnesses, at which point the first young man brought in two other young men as witnesses to that sale and the procedure was over. However, the real owner of the land found out and made a complaint, following which the four perpetrators were arrested. They were sentenced to imprisonment by the Tunis Court of First Instance. On appearing before the Court of Appeals, they asked for pardon but the attorney general's representative asked that the preliminary ruling be upheld and the sentence to be implemented. The final word remains with the Court.
Vote casting for the presidential and legislative elections was conducted from seven thirty yesterday morning until about four thirty the same day in different regions of the republic in an atmosphere permeated by a spirit of citizenship and civic sentiment.

Foreign Observers: Elections within the Confines of Transparency and Credibility
Mr. Ahmed Ben Hali, assistant secretary-general of the Arab League:
"We observed the voting process in several polling stations and noted elections were conducted normally in a normal atmosphere and within the confines of security and confidence. All the necessary conditions for the physical voting process, including preparation, were available and similar to what we see in advanced countries. Consequently, the elections in Tunisia were a celebration of democracy."
"Firstly, I would like to offer my deep thanks to the Tunisian government for the honor of allowing me to observe the presidential and legislative elections. My visits to several polling stations showed me that voting took place in an atmosphere of calmness and I particularly noticed the sign requiring privacy, an important matter for voters and for the course of the election process. I believe that Tunisia has taken important steps forward along the path of establishing democracy."

Hasn't this basic right evolved into a legal obligation imposed by trade legislation according to section 22 of law number 1991 concerning competition and prices...?
The weekly, Assabah, went for a walk and observed citizens' concerns in this area.  It discovered many breaches by traders.
It so happened that price inspectors were there. They became aware of the matter and took the necessary measures in spite of some traders resorting to convoluted ways to prove their goodwill and blame their "workers" for not putting out price labels and said it would not happen again.
Mr. Ali Bou Aziz said that many breaches occur and in nearly all sectors: "Some don't care about prices, especially in cafes and restaurants, and the consumer often suffers simply because he doesn't know anything about the prices."
A study by the National Observatory for Provisions and Pricing found 43.7% of consumers ask for prices to be displayed, 36% of them resort to a consumer protection organization while a small percentage resorts to the Ministry of Tourism, Trade and Crafts and 10.6% accept the situation in order to avoid problems with the vendors, most of whom resort to flexing their muscle with consumers... because profit margins control most of them and they disregard many regulations.

Simply a matter of convention:
This issue concerns the married women we met as well and we tried to find out their views on the matter. A large number of them agreed that they are not happy with their husbands not wearing their wedding rings. Some of them see this as a betrayal or near-betrayal. Mrs. Munira Ben Ibrahim spoke to us about her experiences: "I thought it was normal at first because my faith in my husband was blind but I was shocked when I found out the painful truth but too late. My husband stopped wearing his wedding ring after we married on the pretext that he didn't want any metal on his hand and I believed him like a fool but eventually, I found out he was having an affair with a young woman who he deceived into believing he was single."
But as simple and trivial as this issue is, it has nonetheless adversely affected many people, especially the gentler sex.

Massacre north of Baghdad and death of American diplomat near the airport
At the same time, Iraqi security sources said the bodies of 49 people, recent recruits to the Iraqi army, were found near the Iranian border to the northeast of the country.
General al-Azawi expressed his view that the soldiers were ambushed by "a large, armed group with good information about the target."

Tunis - Assabah  The Minister of the Interior and Local Development described the Progressive Democratic Party's withdrawal from the elections as "an attempt to attract attention" and saw this withdrawal as being legally unacceptable because it came after the permitted legal deadline... the minister made it clear that the yellow leaflets which refer to this party were supplied later and that the party also benefited from 209,54 thousand dinars worth of public funds for the election campaign as well as radio and television slots "so withdrawing loses any meaning," in the minister's opinion.
The minister denied that the party was subject to harassment during its election campaign, saying that it received 80 minutes of radio and television time out of a total of 710 minutes for all opposition political parties...
Tunis - Assabah  As soon as the final results for the presidential and legislative elections were published, Mr Mohamed Bouchiha, secretary-general of the Popular Unity Party and one of the candidates for the presidency, made the following statement: "no doubt a comprehensive assessment of the vote count results for the presidential and legislative elections requires more time to make a careful reading of these results and their likely impact on political life.
Before I talk about the significance of the presidential election campaign results and what they reveal, I would like to express my great satisfaction with the energy and dynamism shown by different party structures. This is an indicator which confirms that the Popular Unity Party is a vital component of our country's political life.
and "Hamas" claims responsibility for death of 3 occupation soldiers
Palestinian sources said that "the Israeli army destroyed at least three residential buildings where over sixty people lived."
Israeli military sources said two Israeli soldiers suffered minor injuries in the incursion operation.
This came as the "Izzedine al-Qassam Brigade" claimed responsibility for the killing of three Israeli soldiers and the wounding of others as their tanks entered Khan Younis.
These attacks come after the Israeli government  voted the day before yesterday in favor of a draft bill to compensate Jewish settlers leaving Gaza as part of Sharon's plan to withdraw from the sector and on the eve of the Knesset's (parliament) decisive meeting today Tuesday to vote on this.
Israel Allows Arafat to Leave his Headquarters for Treatment in Ramallah Hospital
Shortly before this, Israeli television cut short the news to announce Movaz' decision, confirming the deterioration in Arafat's health.
Doctor Ashraf al-Kurdi, Arafat's private doctor who lives in Amman, stated that the Palestinian president is well and said that there was no change in his health to affect his decisions or accomplishing his tasks as usual, pointing out that Israeli rumors aimed at getting at President Arafat on a health and political level would not affect his morale.
indicating that he follows Palestinian issues and the state of affairs in light of Israeli atrocities.
Tomorrow Before the Court of First Instance in Tunis:
The details of the case reveal that a security patrol from the National Guard's investigation and inspection team in the neighborhood of Khalid Ben Alwalid was watching the road one night when officers saw a young man staggering about. They arrested him and took him to the security team's headquarters where he was searched and found to be in possession of a cigarette filled with marijuana and, on being asked about its source, he said he was in the habit it of acquiring it from a dealer living in a nearby area for his personal consumption.
In a Press Statement by Observers from the African Union:
The statement said that the delegation which arrived in Tunisia on October 18, 2004 "held a series of meetings with the Tunisian authorities concerned with preparing the election process and with political parties and Tunisian non-government organizations.
The delegation closed its statement by saying "and on the basis of this, the delegation of observers from the African Union call on the Tunisian people to protect the advantages gained which support those factors enabling social and economic progress and which constitute not only a position of honor for Tunisia but also a source of pride for the continent of Africa as a whole."
While awaiting a solution for the rest, information received by "Assabah" from the National Services Company and Services and from the two airline companies reveals that more than 1700 pilgrims were transported on two planes while others chose to use other airlines to take them from Tunisia to Arab capitals and then on to Jeddah... according to the National Services Company, there are still around 400 to 450 cases which will be worked on gradually to find a solution...
Roundtrips in the form of direct flights to Medina during the second half of Ramadan which only allow holders to go on to Mecca after the 27th day of Ramadan for less than 400 dinars was the reason behind a considerable number of pilgrims refraining from traveling during the first half of Ramadan and opting for the second half. This led to a number of scheduled flights being cancelled and increased pressure on flights in the second half.
On another level, there are still some 1000 Tunisians who remain who had contracts with a travel agency to perform the rites of pilgrimage illicitly because the agency dealt directly with a pilgrimage guide who promised to find accommodation and make it easier to get a visa. However, Tunisian law gave the National Services and Residency Company sole rights to organizing pilgrimage and Hajj trips. The guide was therefore not successful in getting visas for these people with the result that all those with a contract with the agency were not able to perform the rites of pilgrimage.
Tunis - Assabah: It is expected that the preliminary results of the national general population and housing census, conducted between the months of last May and June, are to be made public in the coming week to various national media agencies, according to official sources at the Ministry of Supervision.

On the other hand, Tunisia's ranking makes sense especially if we consider that income, i.e. gross domestic product, plays the biggest role in making up the Human Development Index and this is why we find most countries with a high income ranking high in this index.
However, the index reveals some shortcomings, mainly in the form of data supplied by countries which have to be taken with reservation as a result of material obstacles related to the gathering and processing of data.
20% Target
In spite of the way in which Tunisian shares are listed on foreign stock exchanges, this opening to other stock exchanges is in itself a winning card for companies as it opens broader horizons in terms of financing in addition to providing experience and marketing their activities beyond local market borders, especially in an area like the Gulf in this condition, as it is a market considered to still be in the exploratory stage.
And from the money market...
Appraisal of the industrial certification program indicates, according to the Ministry of Industry, that industrial companies which have received approval have benefited from subsidies worth 4.403 million dinars of which 3.257 million dinars is in the form of financial grants and 6.129 million dinars in the form of non-financial grants and 5.16 million dinars as grants for identifying.

Euro-Mediterranean Partnership: A White Wedding
In truth, the Euro-Mediterranean partnership is based on three fundamental pillars: political, economic and social.
As for the economic aspect, belonging to one of the three points of the triangle - Europe, North America, Japan, and through this the southeast Asian countries - was the crucial element in the southern Mediterranean countries signing up to the partnership agreement, with its consequences in terms of funding and aid.

Faisal Bilzain's curriculum vitae became even more distinguished with "Manama Mama Aroussia" followed by the series "Ind Aziz" and other productions that were an important addition to this actor's curriculum vitae which combines stage acting and television acting.
How does he define the qualities of this character?
* Do you think the role of "Asil" is up to your standards?
* How is that?
contrary to "Asil" which I see as an ordinary role but in spite of that, I still say I like the role.
** But there is a lot of criticism of this series, especially some episodes that are characterized as weak, something a lot of the public agrees on?

17 Palestinians killed and 83 wounded and widespread destruction in Khan Younis
The most recent Palestinian martyr, called Mahmoud al-Muna'ama (22 years), was killed yesterday in a dawn raid by the Israeli air force in the Khan Younis camp while four others were wounded. Two Israeli soldiers were also seriously injured in the operation.
Bulldozing operations also damaged a large part of the water, electricity and road systems to the west of the camp, in addition to damaging graves at the Alshuhada cemetery in Khan Younis close to the settlements of Jan Tal and Naveh Dikalim near which Israeli armored vehicles and tanks are stationed, according to the same source.
Elsewhere, a Palestinian medical source said a Palestinian died as a result of wounds after being shot by the Israeli army early yesterday morning in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip.
Knesset Approves Withdrawal Plan
The voting came after two days of heated debates where deputies examined, for the first time in Israel's history, the possibility of withdrawing from land the Palestinians are claiming for their future state.
Statements by Sharon and those close to him recently raised fears about the issue because they hinted that withdrawal from the Gaza Strip could bury the Road Map, the most recent international peace plan to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
He said "Israel, which is striving to be one of the best democratic countries, cannot put up with such a state."
He said "we are not in need of anyone teaching us about Greater Israel."
The former general added "I have never in my life as a fighter, politician, deputy and minister faced such a difficult decision."
By Asia al-Atrous
Other than reiterating listing the various scandals that have shaken the American administration and its intelligence agencies, beginning with the fictitious weapons of mass destruction and what followed in terms of reports and admissions and facts, followed by the Abu Ghraib scandal and the photos and documents of violations and crimes against Iraqi prisoners via the failed performance that preceded Paul Bremmer's departure and the surprise constitution of an Iraqi government under the cover of concealment and secrecy, what is clear is that with every new crisis, even more erroneous American choices in Iraq emerge and it becomes clear that the decision to go to war was subject to considerations and possibilities totally unrelated to the reality of Iraq and the aspirations of its people, and that it was largely based on the image the Americans expected of being greeted with flowers by the Iraqis.

Available information shows that the suspect drank a quantity of alcohol on the night of the incident then went out onto the road and started using vulgar, abusive language. The victim (his neighbor) tried to stop him from doing this but the suspect became enraged and even angrier with a desire to seek revenge on his neighbor. The suspect took a quantity of gas and went to his neighbor's house under cover of darkness. He entered it then set fire to the contents after pouring fuel on them then fled.
Tunis Assabah: Ambassador Mukhlis Qutb, secretary-general of the National Council for Human Rights in Egypt and former chief of the diplomatic corps in Tunisia, was one of the Arab observers in the elections which took place in our country last Sunday. During his visit to Tunisia, we held the following interview with him: first of all, what are your observations about how the election process took place in Tunisia according to the information available to you on the field?
It is clear that prevailing standards for the appraisal of the election process and progress in the political situation in Tunisia or other Arab countries cannot be the same as prevailing standards in Europe. Evidently gradual progress, realism and the specificities of the political and administrative state of affairs in Arab countries are necessary.
In this context, we can learn from the experience of the National Observatory in Tunisia and similar Arab and international organizations.
- I think the conference of the National Democratic Party was an occasion for open and courageous dialogue. President Hosni Mubarak also stressed political reform and extending the democratic course on that occasion. But achieving the desired reform has to be done gradually.
Interview by Kamal Ben Younis
The report on the election campaign between October 10 and 22 made the following comments:
* The Tunisian state marshaled all means and capabilities needed to make this important stage in the election course a success. The use of media outlets was also respected by all participants in accordance with a predetermined schedule agreed by all sides.
Adding that "all human and material resources were provided in order to make the plural democratic course a success and this by:
- The presence of candidate representatives in the polling stations in total freedom and allowing them to monitor voting operations.
Paradigm shift
- The report concluded with: We congratulate the Tunisian people on this wonderful achievement and refined democratic practices, and we congratulate President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali for this magnificent success which demonstrates the Tunisian people's confidence in his wise leadership, his pure mettle and the great achievements accomplished during his auspicious reign.

Eman al-Hamidi
The two incidents here, which took place in the capital's center the day before yesterday just before the breaking of the fast, are occurrences which fall within this context.
Second incident: a women smashes Metro glass
Local red meat prices fall in spite of being priced at 10 dinars for mutton and 9 dinars for beef. The price of local red meat stabilized at the start of the month of Ramadan at 11 to 12 dinars for beef and 12 dinars and above for mutton.
There is a tendency, as is customary, to import quantities of this fish in order to regulate prices and provide the required quantities of this product.
The National Communications Center for Children is organizing intensive multimedia communications and internet training sessions during the third semester break from November 2 to 7 for children aged between 5 and 18 years. Those interested can join these sessions by registering this October 26 to 30.
The secretary-general of the council of ministers, Saheel Bouji, announced the composition of the new government which includes twenty new ministers after a meeting between president of the republic Emile Lahud and Omar Karameh, joined later on by parliament speaker Nabih Berri.
The new government includes ministers close to Lahud. They are Minister of Communication Jean-Louis Qardahi, Minister of Justice Adnan Adhoum, Interior Minister Mahmoud Hamoud and Minister of Industry Layla al-Salh.
Karameh's government replaces the government of Rafiq Hariri who resigned on October 20 after he was unable to reach an agreement with Lahud on the government.
The government became possible after former Interior Minister Elias al-Mur, son-in-law of the country's president and an ally of Syria, was dismissed from government following the insistence of former Health Minister Suleiman Franjieh, also a strong Christian ally of Syria, of being given the interior portfolio monopolized by the al-Mur family for eleven years.
This extension came a few hours after the Security Council's decision was issued regarding France and the United States' initiative calling on Syria to withdraw its forces from Lebanon and to end its interference in the internal affairs of Lebanon.
"As-Safir" newspaper said the government was characterized by "a game of reconciliation to placate this or that leader and confrontations with the opposition, especially with Druze leader Walid Jumblatt", who spearheads the opposition, to extend the term of President Lahud for three years at Damascus' request.
Gaza (news agencies) - Press reporters in Gaza reported that the occupation army began operations to blow up Palestinian houses, destroy Palestinian security sites and bulldoze land surrounding Israeli settlements on the pretext of providing security cover for the intended withdrawal plan from Gaza.
The occupation soldiers also fired at a Palestinian in the town killing him.
For its part, a United Nations refugee aid and employment agency said the occupation army caused massive destruction in the area and destroyed 23 houses in the course of a military operation and damaged roads and water and waste disposal systems.
She Smashed Her Mother's Head with a Tape Recorder and Claimed that her Two Relatives Killed Her
The investigation was launched when officers at the National Guard center in Ghar Aldima' received a message from a man who said his neighbor died in suspicious circumstances. The operations room and the judicial authorities were informed and they all went to the site of the crime.
In the context, she said an argument broke out between her and her mother late at night because of her bad behavior and that she became unbalanced and picked up a big tape recorder and hit her mother repeatedly on the head until she killed her on the spot.
Tunis/Assabah   Will the new parliament push for a political dialogue thus making it part of a political dynamic the country appears to have signed up to for the coming period, as the Interior Minister and Internal Development said during a press conference held last Monday?
True that some deputies of the Democratic Constitutional Rally in the new parliament and in previous multiplural parliaments were not political stars, but deputies of the opposition political parties are not all from the political classes... for some of them have taken the political course as a profession and many of them continue to deal in politics and party workings, seeing it as an "administrative position" in conventional terms. They are not able to crystallize a political position or to come up with a "legislative" initiative within parliament, on the pretext of party discipline which has frequently been more akin to "muzzle" on the mouths of opposition deputies who fear "angering" the party's secretary-general and, consequently, being subject to "punishment" which could reach the level of dismissal from the party, as has been seen in some parties in the previous chamber period and before.
This is what has caused a rather strange paradox because insofar as positions within parliament are deep and responsible, be it by the opposition or by deputies of the Constitutional Rally, laws were all handled in one way since every law was passed with almost total consensus and the ceiling of political parties never went beyond "conservatism" at best, in spite of the volume of laws passing before parliament, and their variety and importance for the country's future.
Will the parliamentary elite in the new chamber of deputies be able to accomplish this minimum level over the coming period?
Tunis - Assabah: Field research has been underway over the past three years on how to protect foodstuff against contamination by the Listeria germ which enters humans via food. Listeriosis is a relatively recent disease as it was rare to come across it prior to the Sixties but, with changes in diet and social behavior, it has spread in many countries, especially through the use of cold storage and increased demand for fresh, frozen and ready-made food.
Technical committee for protection
The types of food covered by the research included milk and its derivatives, ice-creams, and meat derivatives from fresh chopped meat (and here we have the most important advice that Dr. Hakeem gives regarding the conditions for consumption of chopped meat) and processed meats such as salami, and white meat. It also included marine and plant products and a list of foods that were examined. So what were the results of the analysis of certain samples?
Starting the Second Half of Ramadan
Amid such environments, discussions between traders have recently taken place through meetings organized by the Dealers Association to decide on the discount rates that will be applied effective the second half of the fasting month and to specify the list of items to be covered in the discount.  These discussions have resulted in approximately 75% of the merchants honoring an automatic reduction, following the posting of the discount sign on the façades of their stores.  The discount covered children's apparel, shoes, and most kinds of sweets at the rate of 5% and children's toys at the rate of 10%.  The discount will continue to be in effect until the day of Eid El Fitr.

Farouk Al Kaddoumi to Al Sabah
Meanwhile, various sources have confirmed the presence of a high-level medical delegation - including 5 prominent specialists - which has been in Ramallah for days to examine and treat the prominent Palestinian leader...
And how true is what has been reported about designating a three-member commission to take his place in the leadership?
- President Arafat is fine and I am in constant touch with him and with the brothers who are accompanying him and with members of the Palestinian leadership on the inside...
Abu Ammar has expressed astonishment during my contacts with him about the media hype about his condition.
Neither a three-member commission nor any similar commission has been formed...
Who will succeed Arafat?
As for the Liberation Organization - the political and legislative authoritative source for the self-rule authority - the Executive Committee and the Central Council - and perhaps the National Council - will have to meet to decide on the issue of filling the vacancy temporarily or progressively...
* How far back does your relationship with the leader Yasser Arafat go?
And since the late fifties, we struggled together politically and media-wise - through the Fateh magazine - and then in the early sixties, we established the Palestinian gorilla movement, known as the Fateh Movement, together.
In the year 1969, 6 Palestinian gorilla organizations joined forces under the banner of the Liberation Organization, and a new Executive Committee, for which brother Abu Ammar was chairman, was elected... We then continued to move together on various national action fronts...
An American soldier and 12 Iraqis are killed in separate attacks
Meanwhile, the American army confirmed that it launched an massive raid on Fallujah yesterday morning that resulted in killing at least three individuals suspected of belonging to the Abu Musab Al Zarqawi group, who is believed to have a strong link to the Al Qaeda Organization.
Meanwhile, sporadic shelling continues on the city of Ramadi.
An American military spokesman said that the two victims fell during clashes with armed men after the American army conducted a search operation in Dhuloeya.
With her killing, the number of reporters and media organization personnel killed since the beginning of the war in March 2003 rises to 45 people, according to statistics by the Reporters Without Borders Organization.
Following his return from the Emirates, Saleh assumed a high-level position at the Iraqi Foreign Ministry.
Police said that fighters fired three rockets at an American base and a regional government office in Ramadi, located 110 kilometers west of Baghdad.
The interim Iraqi government, which is backed by the United States, vowed to crush the insurgents in Ramadi and other sanctuaries before the National Assembly elections due to be held next January.
Algeria
His comments were more conciliatory than usual.
Nevertheless, the Algerian president did not clarify in his speech whether his offer includes a general amnesty for hardliners suspected of committing attacks that resulted in inflicting deaths and threatening the security of the country.
The secular army was apprehensive of a revolution modeled after the Iranian revolution.
Bouteflika had last year laid out a national reconciliation plan following the limited amnesty offer to the gunmen in order to end the conflict that has isolated Algeria and deprived the oil-rich country of many foreign investments.
Following the success of agents with the National Guard's Judicial Investigation Unit in Sfax in uncovering a multitude of serious cases, the most notable of which are probably a case that excited public opinion about someone who claimed to be a prophet, and the Al Azzama case in which she scammed a female lawyer and members of her family.
We have learned that agents of the Judicial Investigation Unit in Sfax were able to apprehend all of those involved, numbered at eight, and confiscated media devices and scanner equipment that the group members were using to produce these documents.  They also found some of the finished documents that some of the customers were waiting to receive.  We have also learned that cases have been opened against all of those involved who managed to move recently to France and even those who left two years ago.
Details of the case show that the student, Imtinan Al Yahyawi, who is studying in her the third-year at one of the colleges in Sousse, came to the capital to have the doctorate dissertation, which she planned to present on the 28th of October, printed at one of printing presses in the capital.
She also hopes to find someone who can help her heal the damage and print her dissertation anew because the large sum that was stolen from her cost her family dearly, and she will not be able to come up with it again..
Steps to boost employment
2) Granting 36 thousand loans a year in accordance with the new regulations related to raising the ceiling of these types of loans from 2000 to 4000 dinars and putting this measure into effect starting on the first of November 2004.  The council has also approved giving the beneficiaries of such loans access to proper training in the area of project development.
6) Designating special incentive mechanisms for employing the handicapped in a special provision in the draft directive law announced by the president of the republic in his electoral program dealing with this group that will be sent to the next meeting of the Council of Ministers.

A helicopter transported Arafat and his medical team from the Villacoublay Airbase to Percy Military Hospital in Clamart near Paris.
Abu Redina added that he received guarantees from the United States, Europe, and the Arab World and that Israel has also consented.
Arafat, wearing a military uniform, waved to officials and to his security detail as he left the presidential compound in Ramallah Friday morning for the first time in two-and-a-half years.
He added that Arafat became frail and very weak, and he had lost a lot of weight due to an illness that began 16 days before.
On hand during his brief stop in Amman were the Jordanian Foreign Minister, Hani Al Malqi, the ambassadors of France and Jordan, and the Chief UN Envoy to Jordan.
He is more than a Godfather, he is a father, he is everything to us.
Suha Arafat, the Palestinian leader's wife, had arrived at the headquarters the day before yesterday, Thursday, to see her husband for the first time in four years.
Jordanian, Egyptian, and Tunisian doctors had examined Arafat in recent days.
The spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Zhang Qiyue, said that the Chinese leaders and government are very concerned about the health of the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
The signing ceremony took place in a hall at the Rome Municipality Headquarters, the same hall which witnessed the signing of the Rome Treaty for establishing the European Union in March 1957.
The new President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel, issued a similar appeal to the European leaders and said that the new constitution will give a new impetus to the course of democracy in the European Union.
It's worth noting that the new European constitution requires the ratification of all member countries by the end of the year 2006 to go into effect starting in the year 2009.
They have arrested him and confiscated variable sums of money, passports, and forged documents before he was transferred to the public prosecutor's office at the Elementary Court in Tunis for continuation of the investigations before putting him on trial.
Also, he was asking them for large sums of money that in some cases exceeded five thousand dinars in return for his services.
In Manuba
The scam worked.
Lawyers Association
Registration for rebuttal With regards to the integrity condition, it was decided to reject the registration application for those who were subject to disciplinary action by the council, regardless of appeal, and also for those colleagues who intentionally and frequently do not apply the legal profession's code to their legal practice.  It was decided on the need to adopt the reports of the director of the authorized regional branch office and member in-charge with regards to the colleagues who have pending disciplinary cases or were known for disregarding the profession's ethics.
It was also decided to follow up on information reported to the association regarding judicial prosecutions and adding copies of them to the professional files as well as adopting an attendance log for the training lectures which will be prepared by the Council of the National Lawyers Association and will specifically include the dates of the lectures attended by the lawyer in-training every year.
With regards to the qualification certificate for the legal profession, it was decided to only accept none other than the Tunisian qualification certificate for the legal profession.  It was also decided to investigate the ethics of candidates for the legal profession by the member in-charge, in addition to requiring candidates for the legal profession, who reach the age of twenty six, to provide proof that they are not members in social funds.
But what about quality at public institutions?
About 235 staff members from the medical and semi-medical establishments who work at private medical institutions will benefit from this agreement by attending training classes for 84 days outside of the institutions and 162 days inside the institutions themselves.
The importance of the private sector in the health field stems from its support for the public sector, and also that it contributes to developing health service exports, especially in the tourism sector.
If qualifying the private institutions sector to adopt quality systems is considered a positive step, the public sector may be more in need of such systems and such agreements dealing with continued training and improving the quality of services because public sector services in the health institutions when compared with the private sector may be, as we have said, come first in terms of their need to take care of the conditions of reception, stay and operation.
Tunis - Al Sabah: Mr. Abdel Wahab Ben Ayyad, project developer of the grand cultural tourism project the Mediterranean City at the Yasmin Hammamat Tourist Station, announced in a press conference attended by French director Margaret Mary Luzac the development of a grand animated theatrical show entitled Hannibal Under the Walls of Rome..

Abu Mazen calls on Palestinians for "solidarity" and declares allegiance to Arafat
Following statements made by the network C.
The organization's representative in France explained that Arafat woke up in the morning in good condition and asked to get in contact with his daughter, who lives in Tunisia.
A Palestinian doctor accompanying Arafat said, This is wrong information.
Palestinian sources had explained in a special interview with the network C.
The sources affirmed that the four medical teams that were overseeing Arafat's treatment in Ramallah before moving him to Paris have unanimously concluded he is most likely suffering from leukemia, but they preferred to leave making the final decision to the French doctors and therefore announce it officially.
Jibril Al Rajub, one of Arafat's top aides, denied in an interview with the Qatari satellite channel Al Jazeerah the stories about Arafat's infliction with cancer.
Nabil Abu Redina, advisor to the Palestinian president, affirmed, in turn, that the health condition of Yasser Arafat will be known after 48 hours.
Chirac said that he has no reason not to believe the official Israeli guarantees.
Abu Mazen's statements were made to reporters at the conclusion of a meeting on Ramallah by the Executive Committee in the Palestine Liberation Organization held for the first time without Yasser Arafat.

The causes of the scuffle go back to some old grudges more than six years ago when members of the two families entered into a dispute.  In this regard, we would like to point out that it is not the first time such scuffles have occurred in the same area; the most recent one took place only a few months ago.  Increasing the security patrols in the area is needed.
Detectives from the Judicial Police Unit at the national security precinct in Hammamat revealed in the past few days the identity of the two youths who had been terrorizing cab (taxi) drivers in the neighborhoods of Bani Kheyar, Dar Shaaban Al Fahri, and Nabel before they managed to catch them in the act.
Due to the recurrence of complaints and the sensitivity of the matter, detectives from the Judicial Police Unit in Hammamat vowed to investigate the circumstances of these incidents recurring in the same pattern.

Between the rock of prices and hard place of sons' wishes
From crisis to crisis
Citizens we spoke with complained about high prices despite the fact that stores which are open to the public during Ramadan nights offer discounts reaching 15%, but the Tunisian is not convinced by the credibility of such discounts.  At this point, Mohamed Al Majiri says: What discounts are they talking about; a pair of shoes for a child who is not older than five years will cost 25 dinars.  I wonder when he turns twenty, how much would he pay for to buy a pair of shoes.
The crowdedness and yearning by parents for the ready-made clothes, which are displayed in a way that dazzles the eyes of adults more than the kids despite the soaring prices, do not underscore another crowdedness and a bigger rush to the flea market stands scattered here and there.  This is because in these places in particular, you may notice all classes with their various affiliations and cross sections.  Perhaps this switch to buy second-hand clothes, even in season, basically goes back to the above-mentioned reason, which is the high prices in addition to quality.  This is a problem for the Tunisian who turns to the flea market when he does not find what he is looking for.  At this point, Amena Al Masakni says, Frankly, I came to this place to look for a dress and a coat for my daughter because the Eid may coincide with the cold weather.  In any case, it would not add up to more than 20 dinars, while buying a coat only from a ready-made clothes store can cost 80 dinars.  You can go there and see for yourself.
Nour Eddine Bin Issa brought up another trend that has become common in the selling and buying process, namely, the suitcase trade.  These are merchants who bring clothes from abroad and sell them at minimum prices with easy payment terms.  Add to that the quality is high, especially with the ever-increasing list of countries from which they are imported (Abu Dhabi - Hong Kong).  This trend has forced parents resort to this solution, which have confused the salesmen of ready-made clothes stores, especially that Eid El Fitr represents their only chance.

Tunis - The Weekly: An official source at the National Bureau of the Consumer Advocacy Organization reported that most contacts received either through the toll-free green number, which the organization made available for the benefit of consumers, or through direct contacts with its regional and local offices deal with raising prices at a rate of more than 59.2% during the first half of the month of Ramadan.
The same source said that the organization is closely monitoring all complaints received and is dealing with violations by merchants of all kinds through coordination with economic and health monitoring teams in all areas.  It also regularly gives these teams its feedback that emanates basically from consumer communications, such as the phenomenon of displaying of bread on street corners, which violates the simplest health rules, or displaying meat on the streets, and other violations that are common during the month of Ramadan in particular.
Female Students: Staying Up Late at Residence Enjoyable
So how do our female students spend the Ramadan evenings?
Monia, who is used to the residence ambiance in Ramadan since this is her third year at the residence, says: Most of our evenings are spent inside the residence as management organizes Ramadan evenings inside, but I always yearn for the Ramadan evenings that are organized along this month, especially the city festival, but the closing time of the residence, which is not later than ten o'clock, does not allow it.
Cafes are the best place for staying late in the evening
As a matter of fact, we are happy to accept these invitations, especially since they make us forget, even relatively speaking, about being away from family during this month.

Why wouldn't Tunisian star singers, like Saber Al Ribai, Sophia Sadeq, Lutfi Bushnak, and Nawal Ghasham, return to the Tunisian Song Festival stage?  But this will not happen until after male and female participants are rated via holding one contest for the Tunisian star singers and another contest for young people and singing amateurs who are at the beginning of their artistic journey.  Therefore, if we want to achieve a quality leap for the Tunisian Song Festival and a real launch for this event, not to mention a strong comeback for Tunisian songs, the festival must rely on rating male and female participants, and, consequently, everyone will come around for the Tunisian song celebration one evening every month..
Occupied Jerusalem (News Agencies) - Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon voiced his willingness to negotiate with a new Palestinian leadership under the framework of the Road Map, provided that - this leadership - is serious and responsible, as he put it.

Available information indicates that a young man in his thirties met a young woman who is about ten years younger than him.  He grew fond of her, then asked her parents for her hand in marriage.
Although the fiance admitted to having had intercourse with his fiancee and showed his willingness to repair the damage, which he is entitled to by law, he nevertheless denied his involvement in the illegal abortion procedure.  This was challenged by the young woman's father and the physician who had examined her, who asserted that he had to abort the fetus after imminent danger threatening the mother - following the examination - became evident due to the death of the fetus inside of her.  He insisted on his statements as the judicial investigations are still continuing as of the time this report is filed.

The growth of the textile and ready-made clothes export revenues also reflects the growth of fabric exports by a rate of6.40% with a value of 11 million 400 thousand dinars as they rose from 178 million 100 thousand dinars to 189 million 500 thousand dinars, according to the Export Development Center's documents.
Most Arab satellite stations have resorted during Ramadan of this year - as you have certainly been noticing - to comic clips to make sure they include humorous pieces in their programming.  These clips are basically German, French, or English. In other words, they are not Arabic at all.  Although they are alien to our heritage and our environment, and they do not utter or talk, they manage to make us laugh to the point where everyone impatiently awaits their airtime because of their light-heartedness and humor.  A clip lasting a few seconds or a gesture in the glimpse of an eye is enough to make us laugh hysterically.
Comic clips were also tried but regrettably, they were not funny.  The end result was that the Arab citizen is in desperate need of something to make him laugh and entertain him, but what can he do when the imagination of his creators in the art of creating laughter has become so narrow-minded and stiff it is no longer capable of stimulating a smile, not to mention a laugh.

The first curtain falls today on the American presidential election in the aftermath of an intense media campaign that extended over a period of eight months during which the two main opponents, the Republican Bush and Democrat Kerry, blatantly flexed their muscles in various social, economic, security, and other political arenas in order to win the American electorate votes.  At the end of the day, another curtain will be raised on all probable predictions that may relate to delaying the final results of the White House race, and the possibility of repeating the last election scenario between Al Gore and Bush, which was decided by the American justice system.
The scenario was repeated with Bush, the son, who is running an election campaign to win the White House seat at a time when his armies are still continuing to conduct their complex war in Iraq, and face more material and human losses day after day while the majority of Americans are still unable to give one convincing answer for the reasons that made their president insists on launching this war.
There is also no doubt that this election campaign helped shed a lot of light on the future of American Arab relations or on the challenges and crises they might face in the future.
During the time of every American presidential election, the question asked remains when will all those in the Arab World who thrive on anticipating the results of the American elections be able to change the interests game so that becomes a gauge that defines Arab American relations?
A spokesman for the Brigades said that the one who carried out the operation was one of its members called Amer Al Far (18 years) from the Askar Camp in the city of Nablus.

Prior to this operation, 16 Israelis were killed in a guerrilla operation against a bus in Beersheba on the 31st of last August.

Will machine one day replace man?
Experts in demographics science think that the human race will witness in the next fifty years a population growth at a lower rate than normal, shrinking from 1.25% now to 0.25% in the next period.  This means that the aging rate will rise exponentially in Western European countries and Japan, and to a lesser degree in the United States of America, where immigration and the fertility of European races play a role in stabilizing the 15 to 59 years age group beyond 2025.
These facts necessitate changing the economic policies in place through raising the productive capacities of the population by re-allocating the expenditures that were previously directed toward education and basic infrastructure.. This can be accomplished by relying on assimilating technologies such as robotics and information applications, for the purpose of compensating for the deficit in human workforce and progressively rely on machines, which is one of the solutions made available by scientific research.

Rains during the night of the day before yesterday and yesterday
The south, excluding the Governorate of Gafsa, only received amounts of rain that ranged between 3 and 7 ml.
Other areas on the coast and center also received these rains but at lower amounts.
Although only a few weeks remain until the start of the olive picking season, the rains of the past two days, which covered the regions of the south, coast, and center will have a significant impact on the quality of the beans and their return.  Perhaps the important aspects about the olive sector benefiting from these rains are the saturation of olive beans, the delay in picking them, and the increase in production although it is moderate, according to the Oil Bureau, the Ministry of Agriculture, and their regional offices.

Third, adopting production specifications appropriate for export markets so as to ensure the quality and safety of products; fourth, integrating modern practices at institutions dealing with agricultural production; and fifth, introducing new biological agriculture production sectors, developing the fish-raising and marine fishing sector, and exploiting existing desert resources.. In order to achieve all of these objectives, the following program has been designed
The development of the irrigated regions requires the exploitation of every single drop of rainwater.  Therefore, a new generation of mega dams will be built, and work on 11 mega dams will be completed by the advent of 2010, in addition to finishing construction of 11 dams currently being built.. In addition, a network to connect the dams will be completed via linking these giant water installations as part of the program planned by the country to mobilize water resources.. Side by side, water conservation technologies will be instituted not only in agriculture but also in all other uses, in addition to adopting a national program for water desalination using the latest technologies and developing them locally to suit our country's conditions and achieve better results.
Developing agricultural production presumes the availability of first-rate seeds and nurseries, for which an integral national plan will be designed in order to ensure the products' quality and diversity.. It is noted in this regards that a plan was laid out to develop the biological agricultural production to reach about 200%, as compared with what it is today, by the end of the current decade.. Also, within the framework of improving quality, it is expected to establish a new system for quality and safety standards for agricultural products.
Despite the opening of the Southeastern University in Gabes two years ago leading to the opening of the Gafsa University for the southwest, the number of students in the south is steadily increasing but has leveled this year at about 45 thousand male and female students distributed in 19 academic institutions of various specialties.

And Bush wins by points
Media sources in Boston thought that Kerry and many of his aides became convinced that it is impossible to overcome the large difference in votes attained by Bush, and therefore, they decided to withdraw from the race in order not to be criticized for trying to stall, and consequently, negatively affecting the United States efforts in fighting terrorism and in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Demonstrating the conservative religious tone of this election, 78% of those who preferred Bush stated that the most important motives behind their choices were the moral values he represents, while 19% of those who voted for Kerry indicated this factor as a basis for finalizing their decision.

After Doctors Conclusively Ruled Out His Infliction With Cancer:
Paris (News Agencies) - As French doctors rule out his infliction with cancer and Palestinian officials were reiterating his need to stay about three weeks in the Parisian hospital to try to arrive at the nature of President Arafat's illness, sources close to Brigadier General Jibril Al Rajoob, Arafat's security advisor, disclosed that an investigation has been initiated to check the possibility that a slow-acting poison had been slipped into Arafat, as suspicions are hovering over two of the latter's entourage.
Palestinian officials privately said that they expect Arafat (75 years) to remain in the hospital, located in a suburb southwest of Paris, for at least three more weeks.
But it all depends on the doctors' prognosis.
People around Arafat asserted that he walks in his room, eats his meals normally, and makes contacts with other presidents while waiting for the results of medical tests and final prognosis.
Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot quoted Israeli officials as saying, based on Western intelligence reports, that Arafat's condition is much less serious than initially thought and that his life is not in danger, but he is suffering from a serious contamination, the cause of which is not yet known, and which will heighten the suspicions of the Palestinian Authority of the likelihood that the cause of illness is external.
It is noted that the second channel of Israeli television had announced the day before yesterday that Arafat owns a 13-square-meters piece of land near the Olive Mount in East Jerusalem, but Israeli authorities confiscated it a while ago.
The French Defense Ministry released the text the night before last.

Under this headline, Dr. Abdullah Jomm'a Al-Haj, the cultural advisor to the UAE embassy in Washington wrote an article which runs to the following effect: Vis a vis the USA desire to strike Iraq, the declared Iranian position is outright rejection. Any country's foreign policy, nevertheless, cannot have such fixed final attitudes as the latter are always attached to national interests.
There were various times when officials in both Washington and Moscow believed that strengthening Iraq militarily would help it rein in Iran's regional ambitions. Since its defeat in 1991, however, and the continuation of being sieged, Iraq has become unable to play that role. It is even facing new difficulties as a result of the USA threats to invade it, besides its difficult economic and military position.
Now that the USA is threatening Iraq with an imminent invasion, could Iraq and Iran come closer and forget their differences so that they might cooperate in the face of American threats?
On the other hand, if the current Iraqi regime was replaced by another one hostile to the West and with national inclinations, it would be possible, then, to have an Iraqi-Iranian rapprochement.
Then Iran would feel that it was besieged by three fronts - the Afghan, the Iraqi and the Turkish.

- As per the existing laws, we should have a political party.
- It is not a religious party and we reject this term for it came to us from the West.

AL-HUDHEIBI: ATTEMPTING TO FOUND A PARTY IS A VAIN EFFORT WE WOULD NOT MAKE
The reverse might be true as that might bring upon us further harm."

The first came from the radical organizations - Jihad, Gamaa Islamiya (Islamic Group), Takfeer and Hijera (an organization that renders the society infidel), Taliban and Al-Qaeda - that have adopted violence and practiced terrorism over the past years. The second shock came from the sharpness of the American pounce, which placed all trends - moderates and extremists alike - in one basket and under one hammer, although the strikes against them differ from one trend to another. The third shock came from the ruling regimes in some Arab and Muslim countries. They found it a suitable opportunity to get rid of the trend of political Islam in general and move from the stage of besieging and containing it to the stage of elimination, especially as it is one of the strongest political active movements that can polarize the people's feelings in the name of religion; something that makes it challenge the ruling regimes.
It is clear that accumulative efforts inside this movement have helped in effecting this remarkable change from the phase of "absolute loyalty to the Imam or Guide through swearing by the Holy Quran to obey him through thick and thin" to the phase of the freedom of differences, multi-opinions and views. It is to be mentioned that the stage of "absolute loyalty" was established by the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) Group, Sheikh Hassan Al-Banna, in 1928 and is also observed by the Shiite Movement, considered to be the most ancient organization of political Islam, as it was founded more than 1400 years ago.
This movement will have to either sit fortified behind its outmoded methods and leaderships, return to violence an extremism, or develop their ideas and update its methods and policies; i.e. involve in the political social movement that aspires after democracy, justice and human development. Main Surgeries:
Other Challenges: Moreover, there are other challenges before these trends, if they are desirous to live in harmony, coexist and participate in the aspired-after democratic change. The most important challenges are represented in modernizing political ideology, updating religious discourse, renewing their leaderships, as the old ones are outdated, changing the "adventurous" leaders who were involved in armed violence. The challenges are also represented in introducing new leaders that are open to the domestic and international developments, benefiting from the wave of democracy and human rights that is spread worldwide, making use of the modern mass media and technology, which, among other points, destabilized the policy of the iron fist.
However, we here try to handle some aspects of this thorny issue from a different point of view. We call for reforming our conditions with our own hands in order to respond to necessary needs that stem from inside our societies, which suffer from poverty, backwardness and persecution, and which have the feelings of anger, hatred and rebellion. Such reform, for which we call, is not a mere response to American pressure or Western temptation that sees its vital interest in modifying, updating and modernizing Islam, the Arabs and the Muslims and pushing them forcibly towards the path this pressure and temptation want!

Economic milieus in Egypt are witnessing a controversy regarding the Government treatment of exchange companies that suffer from having their demands officially ignored since October 2001 while some voices asked for striking off those companies (whose number had risen from 46 to 125) or at least minimizing their activities. This may reflect on exchange markets in the country.

There is a tendency, therefore, to strike off such companies at this stage until the Egyptian pound gets better after effecting a balance between exports and imports or at least when a surplus in the balance of payment is achieved together with a return to the previous foreign exchange reserve figures - $21 billion.

He, nevertheless, did not provide evidence for any objective basis for such optimism.
The disaster should also be partly blamed on the main deficit in the banking system which is represented in keeping the CEB subordinated to the executive estate ranging from the Ministry of Foreign Trade to the President of the Republic as well as the Premier. The first step towards facing that disaster is this: the CBE should be a body independent of all executive agencies in order to run the banking system with transparency ensuring the preservation of depositors' funds and the performance of its role in drawing up monetary policies and implementing them with the required efficiency and to ensure its accountability to the Parliament.
They pointed out that the American Embassy report estimated them at 15% to 20%.
It added that one client had established four illusory companies and got loans through their assets from one bank.
He added that most loans were granted without in-kind collateral and that 38% of the loans value had been granted without collateral according to this month data.
According to Egyptian statistics the Government owes Social Insurance Authority (SIA) LE146 billion i.e. $31.4 billion. The statistics also showed that the number of the insured (under SIA umbrella) hit 17.8 million citizens including 4.4 million of governmental sector personnel, 915 thousands of Public Enterprise Sector personnel, 1.876 million employers, 18 thousands expatriates and 5.922 million seasonal workers. It is noteworthy that the insured are paid monthly pensions to the tune of LE7.6 million a year in return for annual subscriptions that stand at LE12.9 billion.
The bank has offered itself as an easy prey to anybody who wants to grab by the millions, thus encouraging wild wolves to scramble both in packs and singly to grab as much booty as they can.
Excitingly, a considerable percentage of the bank facilities was devoted to the service of just one client or a group of companies and that Mohamed Nussier obtained LE2.4 billion in the name of Vodafone and then failed to offer the insurance collateral of the loan.
In accordance with the increase in population during the reporting period, a 2.7% retreat of poverty rates means a big decrease in the number of the poor.
DEFAULTING LOANS STILL WITHIN SAFE LIMITS
This came during the inauguration of a symposium on the reasons for insolvency and their solutions, organized on Sunday by Egyptian Businessmen's Society under chairmanship of Gamal Al-Nazer.
FALTERING LOANS CRISIS THREATENS EGYPTIAN BANKING SYSTEM STABILITY
Citing some reasons to prove this argument, Abdel Halim said that the rate of bad loans reached 11.3%, while the usual safe rate is in the range of 5% only.
For his part, Egypt's Banks Union member, Ahmed Qura, said that any statistics or estimates issued away from the CBE would be inaccurate, adding that according to the latest CBE issued statistic, faltering loans amounted to 11.3%, i.e. the equivalent of LE33 billion.
The remarks were made by the former prime minister while addressing the Press Syndicate Economic Committee on Monday evening. No foreign investor can come to a country where a person can be put in custody for two months without any obvious reasons, he said.
"Why does not it recognize the failure of policies, while insisting on the same figures, even though they proved failure?", wondered the former prime minister.
Pointing out that the constitution bans ministers from doing business tasks, he said a minister awarded contracts worth 7 million pounds to a consulting office owned by a relative of his.
PALESTINIAN OFFICERS TRAINING IN PREVENTING HAMAS OPERATIONS AGAINST ISRAEL
Some elements of that unit have specialized in searching, investigation and penetration of Palestinian groups especially in mosques and Islamic action centers and Al-Zakat (religious endowment) committees, where their focal point is Hamas movement in the Western Bank and the villages neighbouring occupied Jerusalem.
In her speech, Wafaa Mashhour said Islam guarantees equity between men and women. But, there are now restrictions on Muslim ladies in their societies, she added.
The deputies pointed out reports that confirm that those Egyptians arrested without any charges or even pending investigations as was the case with the eight Egyptian sailors who faced no charges.
The deputies pointed out a report by Egypt Immigration and Passport Department uncovering that 750 Egyptian youths had abandoned their nationality in the last 9 months.
The deputies said that nationality to the unemployed becomes worthless unless it provides them with the minimum necessities of life.
Also to be reconsidered is all U.S. aid to Egypt as part of a U.S. partnership initiative in the Middle East region.
U.S. aid to Egypt is mostly allocated for infrastructure, service and educational projects.
The sources said that the resumption of dialogue with Labour Party symbols did not mean interference in Israel's internal affairs but only reflects Egypt's keenness on dialogue with the categories that seek peace whether they come from the Labour Party or even the Likud.
Yesterday, Al-Hudheibi ruled out the possibility, during this period, of making any attempts to found a legal political party for the group. He said, "It is useless now to make such an attempt even though we have been for long demanding such a chance. The officialdom, nevertheless, would not give it to us and it would not be positive, therefore, to get involved in it.
The American wave of armed pounce managed to break the backs of the Islamic radical organizations, particularly Al-Qaeda and Taliban, and dismantled several rings of extremism and terrorism in more than a state - Pakistan and Indonesia in the East, Germany and Spain in the West and in Yemen, Somalia and Sudan as well. At the same degree, the political Islamic trend in general was shocked and embarrassed. The shock and embarrassment came from two or three sources.
Thus, the latest stormy incidents, internally and externally, have placed the movement of political Islam in situations of challenge, pressure and siege on the one hand, and in situations of temptation and attraction on the other. This Islamic movement is now standing in a very difficult U-turn. It is trapped between return to radicalism and armed violence, which were adopted by some of its factions in the past twenty years, and rush towards ideological and systematic development and modernization. If the movement opts for the second option, it will amalgamate with the move of the Arab and Muslim society that "voluntarily" seeks to bring about limited democracy or that is being pressurized by foreign forces to change towards open democracy.
I believe that the success of moderate organizations and parties in more than one Arab and Muslim country will tempt their counterparts in the other countries to do the same. This success also puts the general trend of the movement of political Islam in situations of challenge and response.
It is clear that the latest success of the Islamic parties in more than a country, as mentioned above, depended on this essential change that was an alternative to the slogan of "Islam is the solution" that was raised by the political Islamic trends in the past decades.
I daresay that these two different parties are placed together under horrible American pressures. These pressures begin with accusations that both parties are directly responsible for terrorism, violence and extremism. These pressures do not, at the same time, end with an urge to bring about radical reforms to the ruling regimes but want them to "modernize Islam" itself, something that causes increasing sensitivity.
This needs essential surgeries in the march of our lives and homelands.
The Libyan leader likened the attempt to get Turkey admitted to the European Union to an attempt to transplant an organ from a human body into another that did not have even the same blood group or any other biological tie with the donor.
It is a Sunnite Muslim country with Eastern customs, traditions, history, culture, manners and taste. Even its Latin alphabet is not purely Latin, as the Turks have distorted the Latin alphabet."
GAMAL MUBARAK CALLS ON NDP TO WIN THE CONFIDENCE OF ORDINARY PEOPLE
"The new challenge is to move the new thought of the party from inside the corridors of the party to the street to acquaint the layman of work and development processes and to solve problems and achieve the party's programs and policies in political, social and economic reform processes."

*The Democratic National Gathering under the leadership of Deputy Azmi Beshra. He contests elections alone after his former coalition with Deputy El-Taiby, lasted for a few days, proved a fiasco.
Olwi emphasized that the international figure contradicted the Egyptian official figure.
He added that such difference emanated from the fact that Egypt had adopted a different technique of classification regarding the categories lie under poverty line since 1996, which produced more optimistic and politically tinged figures.
It is noteworthy that the highest GDP per capita income is in Canada ($37,170), then in the USA (34,100) while the lowest figures are in Congo ($570) then Burundi ($580).
It is the first time for the draft budget to be discussed ahead of preparation, the minister said.
The managing director of the Egyptian-Saudi Finance Bank Sobhi Badawi told Al-Alam Al-Youm that the bank contributed 15% to the company's capital.

Chairman of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAIFZ) Dr. Mohamed Al-Ghamrawi said the period from January to August 2002 witnessed flow of some LE622 million as fresh capital of investment projects, LE573 million of which are capital of 25 newly-established companies in the free zones which have investment costs to the tune of LE2 billion.
He pointed out that the proposals included granting the earnest investor incentives in case he built and installed equipment, employed labour and started production in one year's time. The incentives are represented in repaying part of the land price in addition to making it easier for investors to pay off the land price by installments provided unified rules and regulations be laid down for pricing lands allocated for investment in governorates. The projects, which would be established in remote areas and outside the old valley, would be granted a 20-year period of tax and customs duties exemption in order to decrease production costs and give these projects a competitive advantage as was the case with Toshka project.
Mostafa added that 40% of San Stefano project had been completed which is expected to be inaugurated in 2004 at a cost of LE1.6 billion. The project had injected LE400 million in the Egyptian market till now through getting construction requirements, i.e. cement, reinforcing iron, timber and whatnot of materials necessary for executing the project, Mostafa pointed out.
Mr.WWalker added that a well-known Egyptian businessman would join them for dinner, but he declined to identify him.

MEDICINE COMPANIES IMPORT RAW MATERIALS FROM INDIA
According to director of External Relations at Indian Chema Tech Company, the Holding Company for Medical Industries promised to study 8 Indian raw materials to be used in the manufacture of several medical drugs in Egypt.
An Indian institution specialized in the field of the manufacture of chemicals, formulas and drugs started to make Egyptian companies offers to establish joint projects to manufacture machines for producing drugs and transfer the Indian technology and expertise in this field to Egypt.
The three companies in control of polypropylene threatened to transfer their factories to Beirut if the great deterioration in its sales continued as a result of similar imported products.
The memo added that the bilateral agreement signed between the Government and Lebanon provided that tariffs be reduced by 100% with Lebanon as of the year 2002, and by 50% with Jordan. This made it reduce its final product prices in order to be able to compete. All such reductions, nevertheless, failed to cope with the big reductions in tariffs.
A report entitled "Investigation into the case of polypropylene imports from Saudi Arabia" issued by the anti-subsidy and dumping body at the Egyptian Foreign Trade Ministry said investigation had been initiated into the cases of dumping, which represent 3% and more.
The partnership requires that Al Wataneya Telecom buy 50% of the shares of Orascom Tunis in return for $113.5 million out of which $90 million should also be allocated for the settlement of the shareholders' loan and for spending on Orascom Tunis operations. Under the contract both Orascom Telecom and Al Wataneya Telecom would participate on equal footing in running the operations of Orascom Tunis.
NEW TECHNIQUE FOR COMPANY PRIVATIZATION
Al-Alam Al-Youm learnt that the new system - capitalization - that would be put forth by Minister of Public Enterprise Sector, Dr. Mukhtar Khattab, would include increasing the capital of companies through inviting new investors to contribute over 51% of the capital to companies.
2-The sum of money used in increasing capital is not regarded as sale proceeds, thus it will not be involved in the accounts of the Ministry of Public Enterprise Sector or Fiance Ministry, but rather allotted to the company's internal activity.
The minister added that Egypt sought a World Bank back-up to activate the privatisation program.
The Cabinet decided to provide the land necessary for the construction of projects through the new tourist and residential bids at reasonable prices. It also decided to streamline procedures of investors dispute settlement.

ATFP GIVES $500 MILLION TO 20 EGYPTIAN BANKS
PRESSURE TO CHANGE WAY OF SETTLEMENT WITH LAME DUCKS OF BANKS
Although this move came late, the Association saw that the timing it chose was the most appropriate after it had left the Government reap the fruit of masses' sympathy ensuing from the escalation shown in the recent businessmen crisis who misused the credits they obtained from banks. While the Association exploited the accumulation of technical obstacles of the way of settlement, it succeeded in polarising prominent leaderships, forefront of whom are former economy minister and prominent banker, Dr. Hassan Abbas Zaki and former Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) governor, Ali Negm.
Besides, most mortgages turned out, after examination, to be difficult to be liquidated now that they are divided into real estate mortgages and durable commodities that can not be disposed of easily in light of the state of recession witnessed by markets.
Hassan called on the Government to announce the volume of defaulting loans, the borrowers' names and the procedures that were taken against officials.
100 EGYPTIAN COMPANIES IN BAGHDAD INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION
The People's Assembly's Plan Committee warned against the deterioration of Egypt's share of commodity exports in comparison to many neighbouring countries. Commodity exports of the GDP plummeted from 14 per cent in 1990/91 to some 7 per cent at present.
For the first time in the last ten years, Egyptian exports to Canada exceeded 40 million Canadian dollars, as they hit 42 million Canadian dollars in 2001 against 36.5 million Canadian dollars in 2000, an increase rate of 15%, said Trade Minister Plenipotentiary and head of Ottawa-based Egyptian Commercial Representation Office, Bahaa Al-Attar.
EGYPTIAN EXPORTS TO JAPAN DOWN
This should synchronise with drawing upon the programmes provided by JETRO to help Egyptian exporters in order to penetrate the Japanese market especially as far as the "Export to Japan Study" and JETRO-affiliated businessmen supporting centres are concerned, the study pointed out.
This trade balance decline, the study points out, is attributed to a decrease in the volume of imports and exports, as the Egyptian exports to Japan went down to 76.1 million dollars in 2001 against 156.7 million dollars in 2000. Egyptian imports from Japan also declined to 574.2 million dollars in 2001 against 731.5 million dollars in 2000, the study pointed out.
The signature ceremonies were attended by Denmark's ambassador in Egypt, Christian Oldenberg, and Industry Modernization Centre director Selim Talatli.
ONE WIFE IS NOT ENOUGH!
Many goals Derbek pointed out that the association had many goals and principles to achieve, including raising women's awareness of the importance and necessity of polygamy especially in case of well-to-do husbands. In addition, it provides advice to women when they face problems concerning their husbands' marriage so that they can deal with such cases reasonably so as to spare homes and children any trouble.
"Every wife should accept this matter, because I know that this idea will be rejected especially by women," Derbek said. "I say to them we should be candid with ourselves. If a woman has no time or if her husband is able to get married to another woman, so why doesn't she approve of her husband getting married to another especially as in this case she'll play a national role in eliminating an nuisance, i.e. singlehood." For her part, former dean of the Faculty of Mass Media and member of the National Council for Women, Dr. Jihan Reshti rejects the association's idea because, according to her, it reflects a malaise in the society's thinking.
Public insistence on political reform in Saudi Arabia is no longer an exception: the exception is what this issue brings about in the way of public political expression, peaceful or violent, or even cultural signals that explain, to a great extent, the magnitude and solidity of the conviction that the kingdom must be pulled out of its grueling crisis through steering it on a democratic reform course.
According to the explanations that have been going around in the inner circles of American politics, the implementation of the American political project will start with the military elimination of the Baghdad regime, then continue in the form of structural changes in the political regimes of Iraq's neighbours.
The American choice: reform or partitioning? The democratization option in Saudi Arabia used to be ruled out of American strategic thinking over the past decades by American political institutions, such as the Middle East Institute, and perhaps by some American political theoreticians like Martin Indyk and Henry Kissinger, as the latter makes no secret, as Sheikh Zaki Yamani recently said, of his opposition to any democratic development in the kingdom.
The state of sheer panic that assaulted the leaders of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as a result of the involvement of Saudi nationals in toppling the Twin Towers was motivated by a serious threat, coming this time from the kingdom's very ally that decided to change the equation of its relationship with Saudi Arabia, with the new factors introduced if the American scheme for overthrowing the Baghdad regime is implemented, as an operation for changing the centre of gravity will take place if the political map of the region is altered. In changing the features of the Middle East, the US Administration will start by redrawing the political map, which will be followed by economic changes. In light of current indications, it is likely that the importance of Saudi oil will be decreased by increasing Iraq's role in the petroleum arena in the future.
To cut a long story short, political reform in Saudi Arabia requires a larger measure of political representation and participation in political decisionmaking that would serve as a solid foundation for any prospective reform process. Now let us take a look at the prevalent political and economic conditions in Saudi Arabia.
However, this attitude has not created a decisive situation or achieved political stability, and its ability to insure the survival of the regime in the future is also doubted.
However, this picture has begun to change, and opposite examples are imposing themselves and are more capable of eliminating the gloomy impressions about monarchic regimes.
The strife between popular forces and the ruling regime in the kingdom is taking place outside the government, not within it. In other words, it is occurring beyond the line of recognition of the Saudi Family as a royal family. But this does not make the problem any easier, as the constitutional monarchy option is supposed to solve the problems of the power struggle within the ruling regime itself. Meanwhile, the current situation threatens to bring about an expansion of the authority of the Saudi royal family as a result of the increasing number of contenders.
The Saudi Kingdom has not yet reached a final position on Iraq as there are two stances uncovering how Saudi Arabia is at a loss regarding this Arab country which threw itself, along with other Arab neighbours, into serious twists.
The following are the three main reasons that kept the Saudis under a policy devised by others.
Therefore, Saudi princes seek to deal positively with the plan of U.S. war on Iraq to avert problems and ease potential pressure.
Thus, Saudi view at Iraq was and is, most likely, still controlled by this security concern.
Iran and Syria stick to some Iraqi opposition lines, whether Shiite, Kurdish, Sunni, Muslim, nationalist or leftist. They can play a future role in Iraq individually or collectively to the extent that they can keep themselves away from potential harm from the next (American) Iraq.
Some members of the Saudi royal family believe that the Kingdom missed a precious opportunity and harmed its reputation when it failed to host them and use them as a military nucleus until the political situation in Iraq became clear, instead of - necessarily - turning them into enemies to the whole Saudi regime.
For their part, the Americans tried to invest Iraqi opposition forces, by attracting some of them (notably, the Iraqi National Congress) and provided them with political support to gain the approval of other neighoubring countries, anticipating an opportunity to change the Iraqi political map in their favour.
Kurds and Shiites, which are mostly likely to take over if the incumbent regime in Iraq is toppled.
Based on the dearth of unequivocal strategy towards the Iraqi issue and waning Saudi position in the expected change, even in the light of U.S. consultation, a development that happened following the September 11, 2001, the Saudi decision-maker has not reached a final decision in this issue just like several internal and external issues, specially on Saudi support for the U.S. military operation in war on Iraq, which is most likely to happen, even though Crown Prince Abdullah gave opposite hints, which started with reconciliation in the recent Beirut Arab summit with Iraqi delegation chairman Taha Yassin Ramadan, and ended in opening the border with Iraq late last October passing with the closure of the anti-Iraqi regime opposition radio station, which used to transmit its programs from Jedda following the Second Gulf War.
This discourse makes the Kingdom appear as a key defender of political rights and quota of (Arab) Iraqi Shiites against the danger of reduction in the post-change period. This discourse, in this wary, may include many temptations and contribute to political mobilization through the (sectarian) block of political and party divergent elements.
If it can not lead a regional alliance that can protect it and Iraqi people under its current circumstances, it naturally should seek to reinforce and cement its political ties with all countries affected by and harmed in the U.S. aggression, and boost and improve its domestic conditions through political opening up, involving the Saudi people in political affairs and investing them in defending their nation against the new aggressors.
He charged America with "creating a sort of insidious siege of Iraq which led to the delay in the repayment of contracts worth $17 billion in the last 6 years. This was carried out through a new mechanism delaying knowledge of the oil barrel price till after sale and delivery, contrary to former positions thus leading to the escape of Iraqi oil buyers.
TOURIST VISITS FROM EGYPT TO VISIT AMR KHALID IN SAUDI ARABIA
No agreement has been reached yet with the two preachers, he said, pointing out that the company hopes they would accept its invitation, which comes in the framework of the Islamic principle of "enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong."
"The journeys' details will be announced once an agreement is reached with Khalid and Ali."
They consider him an amateur preacher. Although journalist Mufid Fawzi denied participation in the conspiracy against Khalid, his followers point the finger at Fawzi as being one of those who banned him from preaching in Egypt.
ISRAELI FENCE ON EGYPTIAN BORDERS!
International law experts affirmed that establishing the fence on that borderline area is a heinous crime against Egypt overstepping all redlines.
Many boys and women seeking work muster before Rafah land crossing where they work in renting blankets for thousands of travelers waiting permission to enter Palestinian self-autonomy areas. Letting a blanket ranges between 2 and 5 Egyptian pounds per night according to the quality of the blanket and the weather. The more biting the atmosphere is, the more difficult it becomes to find blankets at a reasonable price. The more sluggish the Israeli authorities become in opening the crossing from the Palestinian side, the more travelers have to wait.
One of these cases is journalist Intissar Abou Shawish who failed to live in Gaza Strip though her family is living there. She used to live in Cairo for two years and works in "Islamonline" agency. "My chances to join my family in Gaza look extremely poor because I don't have an identity card," she said.
In its report to the Sidi Gabir Police Station, the company claimed that the Boycotting Committee was affiliated to the Medical Association but the association's lawyer who was called on by the police said that the committee was affiliated to all professional syndicates. The committee publishes posters in Alexandria streets, especially the popular districts inciting citizens to boycott the Coca Cola drink, Ariel and McDonalds'.
Al-Ahali got access to a copy of a new government bill, which is still in its preliminary stage. It contains amendments to the current irrigation and drainage law (no. 12 for the year 1984).
Chairman of the People's Assembly Committee on Agriculture and Irrigation, Abu-Bakr Al-Basil told Al-Ahali that the new bill would come within the framework of the government general orientations ranging from reliance on orientated economy to adoption of free economy mechanisms and the policy of supply and demand. He, however, put off talking about the financial burdens of the new bill.
For his part, Director of Islamic Economy Centre in Al Azhar University, Dr. Mohamed Abdel Halim Omar emphasized that the fatwa issued by the Islamic Research Academy had not resolved the issue yet, pointing out that jurisprudence academies and Ifta Houses in the Islamic world concluded that bank interest rates were part of usury.
Yesterday, eminent Muslim Brotherhood deputy in Egypt, Dr. Gamal Heshmat told Al-Hayat that the decision to drop his membership in the People 's Assembly (Parliament) can be a loss for all parties.
The parliament dropped Heshmat's membership with a majority of 337 votes following a report issued by the Cassation Court which showed that an error had been made in sorting out the votes. 1007 votes had been added to the ruling party candidate which allowed him to contest the run-off elections, instead of Al-Wafd Party candidate, Mohmed Kalg. The parliament decided a run-off be held between Heshmat and Kalg in Damanhour constituency.
He warned that all parties would be loss-makers if conflict took place in the next bi-elections.
It goes over my head what harm might befall Egypt if all opinions and trends were given access to free expression or why we should not make use of the fair play for the good of the country against the enemies and foreign pressure?"
He pointed out that they are thus aiming to jump to the rule and regimes not to call for the good of Islam.
Some American researchers have accused fundamentalist groups of distorting the image of Islam and defaming it and its symbols due to their misunderstanding of history and the role played by various symbols in it.
He added that when he interviewed Al Azhar Grand Sheikh and discussed the jihad concept with him, as the head of the greatest religious authority with him, the Grand Sheikh said that Islam was against the September 11th incidents as it did not allow killing unarmed innocent citizens.
On the other hand, Egyptian deputy and head of People's Assembly Arab Affairs Committee, Mostafa Al-Fiqi, called for developing the phraseology of religious discourse directed to the West in order to rectify the image of Islam.
It, nevertheless, failed to do well when it chose to go on ignoring Iraqi opposition forces and even to close the door which was half open with part of it.
It is not in Egypt's interest, to start with, to distance itself from any party to such a big crisis.
Egypt could, therefore, have opened up to genuine nationalist forces, whom it well knows as it can undoubtedly discriminate between American agents and others.
Opening Arab especially Egyptian options for those forces would make them dispense with America.
This means that the Egyptian diplomacy would be risking the future of relations with Iraq if the possibility of changing its political regime came true.
If the Arab order could stand the absence of Iraq for over a decade, while it is under the siege, it might not be able to stand its implicit or explicit withdrawal.
It may notice that it had based its attitude towards Iraq's crisis on its past legacy and experience of confronting foreign intervention rather than on the present requirements and the Egyptian or Arab future requisites.
Israeli military sources said that the Army Staff Command would soon buy a computer programme to tap the world wide web for about $21.7 million from Microsoft.
According to the details of the agreement, the security body will also get technical support and other services for 3 years.
Palestinian sources told Al-Hayat that no date has yet been set for the resumption of dialogue between Hamas and Fatah. This is tied to practical steps that should be taken on the ground in Palestinian territories and meetings that should be held by the coordination committee in line with what was agreed on in the previous sessions to be followed by high-level meetings in the Egyptian capital, the sources said.
The sources did not exclude the possibility of convening expanded sessions of dialogue later to be attended by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine led by Ahmad Saadat and the Democratic Front led by Nayef Hawatmah who had repeatedly informed the Egyptians of his desire to participate.
It is up to Saudi leaders to decide whether they will follow the political reforms of a certain country or design a "unique model", he said.
To unseat the Iraqi regime remains part of a U.S. policy until that regime fully cooperates with the UN to disarm its weapons of mass destruction, he said. It is the former Bill Clinton's administration, rather than the incumbent one, which converted the idea of toppling Saddam's regime in 1998, if it declined to be disarmed, into a U.S. policy, he said.
YEMENI PRESIDENT TALKS IN MOSCOW; MILITARY COOPERATION FIRST
They also expected that the issuance of the Yemeni debts to the former Soviet Union which have been inherited by Russia would also be considered. Most of such debts are military-related and date back to the pre-Yemeni unity mid-1990. Such debts were due on what was called South Yemen and then inherited by the Unified Yemen.
The Human Rights League slammed yesterday the pressure, which it said the authorities exert on the veiled females. The league said women and girls were summoned to the police stations and were stripped of their veils by force and were forced to sign pledges not to wear the veil again.
The league, however, affirmed that campaign against getting religious extended to schools and universities where the veiled were exposed to harassment.
In Amman, there are logical reasons that make it believable that the overt alliance' which was entered into by Islamists and leftists in trade unions may succeed in containing' the Jordanian government declared plans aiming at dominating the syndical body, cutting it to size and ruling out annoying Islamic elements.
The pragmatism of the Islamists in preparing for the elections of the Engineers Syndicate reached an extent of readiness of relinquishing the post of the "Syndicate Chairman" for an independent person, in addition to giving in three or four seats - according to negotiations - in the syndicate board in return for all parties approving a unified list.
Although Abu-Bakr softened the tone of his statements when he alluded to an indirect participation in a national reconciliation government which his trend calls for. The statement, however, expresses the apex of anti-government tactics the Islamists have.
The statement delivered by U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell on December 14th about the American-Middle Eastern partnership is considered a prominent indication for this change. This means that the coming days may be an overture for different tensions between Washington and its allies on top of Arab regimes and between the Arab street and those regimes themselves.
First: the timing of this partnership, i.e. amidst the American preparations for invading Iraq, occupying its lands and controlling its oil.
AUSTRALIA READY TO REINFORCE EGYPTIAN PRESENCE IN ASIA
He also emphasized support for a free trade zone between Egypt and West Australia, saying that he seconds free trade zones worldwide and bilateral deals.
Although trade exchanges with other countries were initially based on agriculture, they were expanded later on to include other goods, with Australia exporting cars worth 1.2 billion U.S. dollars annually to Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, the minister added.
The minister of agriculture said he was confident that Egypt is given a key priority in view of Australian wheat export.
Al-Sa'idi emphasized that the Ministry gave the industry modernization programme a considerable attention as it was considered the main door to the achievement of comprehensive economic development goals.
The Minister reviewed the proposed scenario for industrial development covering the modernization of factories, commercial promotion, incentives plans and foreign investment.
Mustafa Al-Ahwal, head of the Egyptian side to the Council, said the recommendations and remarks, reached by the delegation after the visit, are being considered. Most prominent among these recommendations is benefiting from the concession granted to the South Saharan countries to export their products to the US without quantitative quotas or customs. Production will take place in Kenya and Tanzania and then the products will be exported to the US. The agreement partners also probed the possibilities of cooperation that rose between the Suez Canal Authority and the Egyptian companies for producing wind-generated electricity, as most African countries suffer from sharp shortage in power. The Egyptian and African sides also discussed the possibility of operating one of the floating docks at the Red Sea harbors of Egypt to one of the two above-mentioned countries, especially as there is no floating or dry drainage in the whole region.
At the end of the meeting, Mustafa Al-Ahwal touched on the importance of the issue of personal contacts in dealing with the African countries, whose markets could be invaded through alliances with senior businessmen there.

Foreign Trade Minister Dr. Youssef Botrous Ghali said the Egyptian stock market enters its eleventh year with steady steps towards more activation of its role in economic activity. He pointed out that the bourse is like a channel for financing the activities of companies. The bodies in charge of the bourse including the Ministry of Foreign Trade were keen to activate and raise its efficiency. The report conducted on the developments witnessed by the stock market during 2002 represents the first step to set up the rules of transparency and disclosure, the minister underlined. The performance of the Egyptian stock market during 2002 largely differed and the year's indicators ended as they almost started, after a negative performance in 2001.
The rise in the total market capital is due to the increase in the market capital of public subscription companies, which express more realistically the performance of the circulated companies, by 19% during 2002 to report 33 billion pounds compared with a decline of about 6% during 2001 thus ending at the mark of 28 billion pounds. Thus, some of the losses reported since late 2000 were made up for.
The year 2002 saw the execution of a number of operations for selling the shares of companies to key investors for around two billion pounds, which reflects the ceaseless interest of foreign institutions in the Egyptian market and their entry as long-term investors.

As soon as the Nile water is released into the project lands, the investing companies will increase the cultivated areas up to 10,000 feddans after they have expanded the reclamation of their allocated lands on branches 1 and 2, he concluded.
Standard specifications are being developed particularly as the Egyptian standard specifications are confined to only 10% of the handled commodities, 360 in number, while the remaining commodities use the system of codex, the minister said, stressing the necessity of paying attention to standard specifications as they may limit or protect Egyptian exports.
He added that samples analysis labs are being developed and that the ministry always trains its inspectors and tries to raise their incentives, create more specialties particularly in food safety and provide information for dealers in different fields of trade and investment.

Some banks' officials described the Egyptian American Bank decree as very bold and as a conversion to interest rates' direction in the local market. General manager of Egyptian American Bank, Mohamed Taha, defended this decree, stressing that the Egyptian American Bank took such a step depending on several indicators foremost of which are the results of its studies that showed that the prevailing interest rates' on the market are very high and do not encourage investment in Egypt. These high rates also make the banks and its creditors alike sustain heavy losses whereas it increases the cost of funds in banks and increases burdens on owners of investment projects at the same time.
He also expected that to take place within 3 to 4 months. EGYPTIAN AMERICAN BANK REDUCES INTEREST RATES
Abdel-Wadood said that hammering out this deal under MBO system is due to common aims between the administration and investors who support this process.

CAIRO: IKHWAN PLOTTED TO EXPLOIT IRAQI ISSUE TO DO HARM TO REGIME
It might be mentioned that the security forces had stormed the house of an Ikhwanite key figure, Ibrahim Ramadan, house in Al-Zaytoun (east Cairo) and arrested 10 of the defendants during a meeting regarded by security bodies as "organizational." Later on, other four persons were nabbed from their houses.
STEPPING DOWN SCENARIO!
In fact neither of the two parties has given any signs of peaceful intentions for the last 12 years and especially the recent months. Neither did the American party confine its problem to disarmament nor did the Iraqi party give due care to building up credibility in that area.
The balance of lies and irresponsibility here mismatches as one party is nonchalant about the imminent devastation, while the other regards Iraqi land and population alike as a shooting field for weapons it boasts it had especially invented for that particular strike.
Baghdad's regime is practically over. If its end is not automatically brought about it would cost Iraq enormous devastation and thousands of victims.
Hence the numerous calls on the regime's symbols to step down. Many leakages, that indicate the possibility of the regime's elite resorting to this or that country imply that such an option is on the cards or under consideration.
It is true that it would need another long expanded action that would not be resolved early enough for the results to be used in the election campaigns of George Bush now it is in the US interests that the Iraq regime might prove dogged enough to outweigh all possibilities of flexibility, self-sacrifice and altruism for the good of the country. It is in the interest of this regime itself to go on another adventure even if its catastrophic results are well known to Iraq and its people.
Commenting on this fatwa (religious opinion), IRA member, Dr. Mohamed Ra'fat Othman said that preserving human body sound and strong is a matter that is urged by the Sharia in many religious texts. One of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) traditions runs to the effect that, "A strong, rather than a weak, believer is better and more liked by God. Both, however, are good, (but) be keen on what benefits you, seek the help of God and don't lose hope." Other religious texts make it clear that God has created a remedy for every disease, according to a Prophet's tradition.
ISRAELI FOREIGN AFFAIRS COUNCIL CHAIRMAN IN CAIRO: JERUSALEM POLITICAL CAPITAL OF PALESTINE ON CONDITION
A- My visit coincided with the end of Palestinian meetings by chance, but I am concerned with the outcome of the meetings if they are to lead to the stop of violence, which will be in favour of all parties. Peace is the strategic option of all parties and efforts must be made to achieve it for the state of Israel so that the Jews may live in safety. In my capacity as chairman of the Israeli Foreign Affairs Council, I am visiting Egypt to restore confidence between all the parties involved in the peace process with the help of Egyptian officials mainly including President Mubarak's political advisor Osama Al-Baz, chairman of the Egyptian Foreign Affairs Council ambassador Muhammad Shaker, chairman of Cairo Peace Society Ambassador Adel Al-Adawi, and ambassador Ihab Sorour from the foreign ministry. This comes within the framework of preparation for holding an international peace conference expected to be held in the Danish capital Copenhagen.
Q- But the Israeli side, alas, controls these places in full?
A- The price of peace is exorbitant namely, making painful concessions and abandoning a number of issues we adhered to. Prominent among these issues is the refugees right to return.
A- I mean Israel has the right to be a state for the Jews like Egypt, which is the Arab republic of Egypt or Syria which is an Arab Syrian republic. Israel has thus the right to be the Jewish republic of Israel.
An official source said the Arab countries had told the US Administration that seven countries had signed contracts with Iraq within the framework of the oil-for-food program, launched in 1997, to the tune of more than $9 billion. Egypt ranks first with contracts valued at $3 billion, followed by Jordan with contracts at the value of $2.1 billion, Saudi Arabia with contracts of $1.3 billion, UAE with contracts of $800 million, Tunisia with contracts to the tune of $712 million, Syria with contracts valued at $650 million, and Lebanon with contracts at the value of $485 million, in addition to trade of other countries, also signed contracts with Iraq, will completely stop.
However, big preparations are underway for facing any repercussions.
They are directly commissioned to assess the volume of losses in case of attacking Iraq and deliberate with Arab officials in this context. An initial report has already been made after several visits paid by those officials to the Arab countries last month.
The answer to this question requires more than one level of analysis. The most important level is the silent, but clear, tone, which is now sheepishly carried by different mass media, on the necessity of using the new political and military situation in the region to solve the stubborn regional problems. The top priority is to end the Arab-Israeli conflict, according to Israel's vision, and re-arrange the conditions in line with the requirements of the new US-led international movement and its mechanisms. The other level of analysis is the conception of the new scenario of the post-crisis stage and the conception of the shape of the new regional powers.
The fifth fact is to complete the US control over all oil sources in the Middle East to control the produced quantities, prices, and distribution. From another angle, the US, along with the other world powers, will try to maintain the balance of the regional powers in the other parts of the Arab world according to its own point of view. This would ensure a continuous protection of American and Western interests in the international strategic commodity, which is of the utmost importance (oil). This is the same balance that the US was keen to create in the Arabian Gulf region during the post-Second World War period and after Britain's withdrawal from eastern Suez and after the 1991 Gulf war, which was accompanied by the direct American military presence in the region, which it tries to assert by its expected military strike against Iraq.
JIHAD SCHEME TO SABOTAGE FOREIGN INTERESTS IN CAIRO ABORTED
Supreme State Security Prosecution under Counsellor Maher Abdel-Wahid are investigating the organization members. It has been uncovered that they have prepared large amounts of TNT explosives to use in their sabotage operations. Automatic rifles, pistols, live cartridge and huge sums of money to be spent on their schemes were seized in their hotbeds. Al-Ahram correspondent added other details saying:
Available information emphasized that a certain Ihab Ismail had professed Al-Jihad ideology based on regarding the government as heretic thus lending legitimacy to any rebellious acts against it. He planned for executing terrorist operations targeting public figures and blowing up vital and foreign installations to disrupt public order and damage Egypt's relations with foreign countries.
Ismail formed a military cell comprising three elements known only to him to attend meetings under code names. According to the admission of one of them, they have been attending that cell's lessons for about a year to enhance Jihad ideology regarding the government heresy and hence the necessity of confronting it under the pretext of its failure to implement Islamic Sharia and in order to establish what they alleged as an Islamic state.
When 40 or 60 kilograms of explosives happen to gather on the roof, the person in charge of the blowing up duty carries out the task with a remote control device to blast the building.
The suspended Labour Party has won a limited judiciary victory over the government, as it has got a final ruling from the Supreme Administrative Court entitling Eng. Ibrahim Shukri to lead the party and revoking the Parties' Committee's decision not to recognize the party.
Proponents of the Islamic Trend led by the party's General Secretary Magdi Hussein received the new ruling with disappointment. Their sources said that although the ruling upheld Shukri as being leader of the party, it admitted that newspapers, at the same time could be confiscated under an administrative decision despite the fact that it is unconstitutional. It also made the future of the party unstable as it referred the whole case to the Parties' Court which is an exceptional, administrative court, the sources said.
The Ikhwanite deputy raised that issue months ago. Then, the Administrative Control Authority prepared a report about the violating consignments in which it described that waste as "dangerous". Importation of such dangerous materials is banned according to the Environment Protection Law, the report said, indicating that passage of such wastes into Egyptian lands is even banned and the violator would be fined LE20 thousand.
Some Fatah central committee members were opposed to the Cairo dialogue as a similar 2-month dialogue was earlier held in Gaza among all Palestinian political forces, but, unfortunately, no tangible results were reached, the sources said.
The Palestinian sources unveiled that Mashal said his attendance was contingent upon the involvement of Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Executive Committee Secretary Mahmoud Abbass (Abu Mazen) in the dialogue as a head of Fatah's delegation.
Following his talks with Gul, Moussa said he had discussed the possibility of Turkey joining the Arab League as observer. The Turkish request, Moussa pointed out, would be referred to the next meeting of the Arab League Council for examination. It has been agreed to turn over a new leaf in Turkish-Arab relations, said Moussa.
However, Iraqi diplomatic sources said that it would be silly to talk about Turkey joining the Arab League in any capacity while Ankara was ignoring the principles of neighbourliness and violating Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity quite openly and under various pretexts. In order that Turkey's joining the AL might gain approval in the Arab world, Ankara's rulers should foot the bill of the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers waters and commit themselves to serious endeavors to reach an agreement that would ensure equal rights for the countries of both source and the mouth according to international conventions.
FORMER ARAB LEAGUE SECRETARY-GENERAL TO ASHARQ AL-AWSAT: FRESH SECULAR PALESTINIAN CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES PUBLIC FREEDOMS
WASHINGTON'S FAILURE TO PERSUADE IRAQI TRIBES TO SUPPORT ITS CAMPAIGN CRUCIAL TO DELAYING ATTACK ON BAGHDAD
Out of those 150 tribal gatherings only 30 or 40 may claim worthwhile political influence.
Another concept is being studied now by the American Administration that is inciting the tribes which are waiting for the proper time to revolt against the regime to go ahead with their plans.
That is why the absence of tribal support in any anti-regime revolution is still one of the reasons why the American Administration still hesitates to declare the war due to the lack of support inside Iraq. According to an official source in the Iraqi opposition in London, the main cause of the delay in declaring war and attacking Baghdad is the lack of popular grassroots that would support the termination of the regime.
Palestinian sources were quoted as saying that some Palestinian factions participating in the Cairo dialogue okayed a proposed temporary truce, but Hamas and Jihad did not announce their final decision.
Egyptian General Prosecutor, Consellor Maher Abdel-Wahed referred Essam Hanna Wahba, a Coptic citizen who works as a teacher of English language in Assiut city, to Assiut State Security Court to be tried on a charge of spreading fictitious and tendentious news that might do harm to Egypt's national interests.
EGYPTIANS SPEND LE6.4 BILLION ON EDUCATION ANNUALLY
Oil milieus in Iraq were taken aback by the decision relieving Minister of Oil, Amer Rashid, of his post.

COFFEE SHOPS EARN 1,500 POUNDS DAILY
Illiteracy fell from 31 percent in January 2002 to 27 percent early this year, he said.
Under this headline, Saudi journalist, Dawoud Al-Shuryan wrote an article on page three which ran to the following effect: Last year the accounts of Islamic charities in America, Europe and some Middle Eastern countries were nabbed, harassed and frozen. Such security measures are not the end of the road. The next stage will witness proposals and initiatives to reformulate such organizations and charities in a way that would serve the political purpose of the war against the so-called terrorism ensuring control of its work and ascertaining that their funds will not go to parties or charities which are unknown or accused of extremism and violence.
Dealing with the file in the ways of democracy and education curricula development would complicate matters even more and open the door to underground action.
Unprecedentedly, Mr. Gamal Mubarak, son of President Mubarak and National Democratic Party's Policies Committee chairman, attended the Mass on the eve of January 7th in the Abassiya-based Orthodox Cathedral. Many luminaries, public figures and Copts attended the Mass amid unprecedented celebrations.
CARROT FOR EGYPT, STICK FOR SAUDI ARABIA
Neither message was secret, as both the envoys who carried them to Cairo and Riyadh repeated them in public in press conferences.
This leaves Egypt.
This could well throw suspicion on Egypt's stand, and this sort of suspicion should not be allowed to linger, even for a moment, particularly as we still remember that the United States had already refused to give Egypt an additional aid of $150 million only a short time ago.
My opinion is based on the latest statement by Foreign Minister Maher, who said that Egypt's position was clear, namely that it would not participate in that war or send forces there.
There remains an important point that we must highlight here: America's resorting to the public use of carrots and sticks with Egypt and Saudi Arabia in this regard only means that its undeclared efforts for bringing the two countries to shift their positions have not succeeded.
Egypt wants to bring all Palestinian factions closer in a critical stage bristling with developments pertinent to the Palestinian issue and Arab national security, he said.
The statement said, "The Islamic nation, especially the Arab world, are going through a turning point which might have impacts on the future of the nation for decades to come.
Middle East News Agency quoted the security official as saying that Egyptian security bodies, while seeking to implement their security plans, do not adopt the stimulus and response policy, but rather the policy of following up, accurate monitoring through a database, thus gaining the ability of taking the initiative of full implementation of all security measures to face all criminal phenomena threatening security and stability.
On its part, the AL welcomed the Eritrean move and regarded it as a "positive step" that confirms the depth of Arab-Eritrean relations.
The exported agricultural commodities, mainly vegetables and fruits, were produced by the Special Free Zone in the Southern Barn in northern Al-Aghwar near the Northern Crossing, the sources told Al-Hayat. Jordanian lorries carrying the agricultural shipment entered Israel via the Northern Crossing near Haifa Seaport after vegetables and fruits were packaged by the international Sun Fruit company.
Jordanian vegetable and fruit exports used to be airlifted to Europe after they were transported from northern Al-Aghwar to Amman, a process which is very costly, according to the sources.
The defendants fully admitted to the terrorist schemes and those admissions emphasized that they had not direct relationship with Al-Qaeda Organization.
Some elements of that 43-member terrorist group have tried to infiltrate into the Israeli borders to take direct revenge on the Israelis, but they could not do so owing to the strict security measures taken by Egypt across its borders to prevent any infiltration attempt from or into the Israeli borders.
He also rented a building to serve as a factory for explosives and transferred some terrorist elements to it. Ismail also taught his elements how to manufacture explosives and bought them automatic rifles and pistols to be ready for the planned operations.
They would then be transported to the targeted building or just flown near it.
COURT RULING ENTITLES SHUKRI TO LEAD LABOUR PARTY
There is still a dispute between opponents in this respect, the court said, pointing out that the party is the only body that is competent to settle its internal disputes.
The Egyptian Foreign Ministry filed a lawsuit against the importing company for breaching laws and importation rules, the government said.
Meanwhile, reliable Palestinian sources were quoted as saying that disputes ran deeper within the central committee of the Palestinian mainstream Fatah, led by Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, over the continuity of dialogue between Fatah and the Palestinian Resistance Movement (Hamas) in Cairo, involving Egyptian Intelligence Agency Chief Omar Solyman as a facilitator.
In a recent meeting of the Fatah central committee to discuss the Cairo dialogue, differences cropped up among the members, with most of them objecting to the Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's economic advisor Mohamed Rashid's involvement in the dialogue as a member of the Fatah delegation. Preconditions set by Hamas Political Bureau Chief Khalid Mashal for attending the Cairo dialogue were also given the thumbs down by other central committee members.
In his meeting with the Turkish Premier Abdullah Gul, Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa said Turkey might join the Arab League as an observer.

Andre Azoulai, adviser to Moroccan Monarch Mohamed VI was quoted while inaugurating the Moroccan Jews Objects d'Art Exhibition in Brussels as saying that the number of Moroccan Jewry was about 300,000 in 1960. "They immigrated to different parts of the world but did not conceal their original country's culture even amongst the sons of the second and third generations," he indicated.
Moroccan Jews' contribution to public life in Morocco faded away especially in political life, as the last Jew that held a high-ranking post was Sirj Bridigo who occupied the post of Tourism Minister in 1994.
ARCHIMANDRITE ATTALAH HANNA CALLS UPON CHRISTIANS TO CARRY OUT MARTYRDOM OPERATIONS
He added that they are not "suicide bombers" as some might like to claim. However, he continued, they are "resistance elements" against occupation. We support these martyrdom operations without any reservations whatsoever raised by those who oppose this heroic resistance, he pointed out.
First: At such a time, the waves of sandstorms, in which sight is lost in Kuwait, would be calm in South Iraq.
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD CANDIDATE LOST ELECTIONS THROUGH THUGGERY!
Nor were satellite channel correspondents who recorded how voters were prevented from giving their votes, spared such harassments by security forces, which forced them to flee the scene. Security bodies even resorted to thugs who used swords and chains to prevent voters from entering election stations. They also forced the agents of the Muslim Brotherhood candidate to leave. Some citizens could report the incidents of prevention from voting to the public prosecution.
Tantawi added that Islamic Sharia offers peace to anybody who offers peace. When the Prophet (PBUH) emigrated to Medina, there were some Jews in it. They were neither oppressed nor antagonized by Him, which shows the tolerance of Islam.
PROTESTS AGAINST NEW LABOUR ACT ESCALATE
It might be mentioned that a large number of representatives of national, syndical and labour forces headed by Tagamo'h Party leader, Khalid Mohieddin, Nasserite Party leader Dia'eddin Dawoud and a number of political parties' representatives and MPs including Heidar Baghdadi and Abd Al-Azim Al-Maghrabi participated in the labour conference.
Al-Gibali was one of the luckiest Palestinian workers because he managed to enter Israel to find a job though that job was even a temporary one. However, he did not find an appropriate job, so he headed for a Tel Aviv district, where he used to live and work in the "good old days" to quote his words.
He devised a new technique that does not lack innovation. He noticed a corner in Rothschild Street, downtown Tel Aviv, deserted because of refurbishment works. He put a banner written in Hebrew reading "Parking space". He parked cars for 10 shekels ($2) which is a convenient price in the market of that town.
It is unusual for the Arab and Muslim worlds to have a lady - specialized in Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and religious affairs - who is dedicated to defending women's rights and empowerment. However, this lady has turned up finallyit is Dr. Suad Ibrahim Saleh, who is head of the Fiqh Department, Al-Azhar University's Faculty of Islamic Studies, whose fame has reached the outside world thanks to her struggle to be a first lady mufti in Egypt.
Dr. Saleh has no problems with the state, but rather with the Islamic institution of Al-Azhar, in which she has been involved since the 1960s. Now that all Egyptian religious bodies, including the Dar Al-Ifta' (religious opinion authority headquarters) under the Ministry of Justice, are within the jurisdiction of this institution, represented by Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar Dr. Mohamed Sayed Tantawi, the post of lady mufti is contingent upon the accession of Sheikh Tantawi, who is in the belief that a lady mufti is unneeded.
People's Assembly Speaker, Dr. Ahmed Fatehi Sorour, referred to the Assembly 's committee on proposals a bill to amend some provisions of the law on practicing political rights.

It is worth mentioning that this border area had witnessed, on long intervals, detection of secret tunnels that are about 3-meters deep underground.

Anyway, Abdulla Gul must take into account that the Turkish duality is present in the mind of the international public opinion. The stands he expressed and the questions he raised about the American war on Iraq may bear fears, concerns, and considerations that are uppermost in the minds of the military as much as they are of concern to politicians. It was the first time for Turkey, in almost one century, to find itself forced to think seriously and realistically giving weight to its eastern dimensions. It is Turkey that contented itself with its affiliation to the west and its burning desire to belong to Europe.
Therefore, the involvement of Turkey as well as Israel may constitute such legitimacy, which remains negative in form and content.
In this regard, Turkey may have realized at last that its negligence of its eastern relations, ignorance of the historical and geographical facts and turning a blind eye to the obligations of the future towards the neighbours led it to a situation that aroused all its fears.
The Kurds complex is still a password in the explanation of the political infertility in Turkey, which may even be ready to wink at the re-drawing of the map of the region unless the Kurdish card is touched as this would mean the re-drawing of the map of Turkey itself.
There might be loots, which Turkey could avail itself of, but, anyway, they would not be equal to the problems that Ankara along its neighbours would have to deal with whether in the presence of the Americans or after they do what they want and destroy the region. The Americans would then direct their attention to another area where they might find an enemy encouraging their war industry and allowing them to have a new training in arrogance.
The newspaper added that the fact that Iran's nuclear activity and development of long range ground-to-ground missiles constituted a tremendous threat to Israel. In contrast to Russia, which imposed restrictions on Iran regarding nuclear technology applications to prevent the development of atomic weapons, North Korea is willing to extend unconditional and unlimited support, which might shorten the schedule for the development of non-conventional Iranian weapons.
It added that Syria has also a myriad of ballistic missiles including 500 missiles with 300-700km ranges it had bought from North Korea which also provided it with technology to produce S.S.21 missiles which had been manufactured in the former Soviet Union.
The report concluded by branding the Syrian policy as "rogue" and demanding it be necessarily included in the "axis of evil" or forced to determine its position on the new regional map which might emerge after the imminent war on Iraq and to stop "jamming" the American military scheme in the region and stop backing terrorism in the Middle East.
He added that any movement of Sudanese government forces would run counter to the ceasefire agreement which forces both parties not to redeploy forces in military operation regions currently.

The specialized banks include the Egyptian Arab Land Bank (EALB), Industrial Development Bank (IDB) and the Principal Bank for Development and Agriculture Credit (PBDAC).

The branches of "Citibank", American Express, "Credit Agricole" and "ABC-Egypt" will find no difficulty in reaching this rate. "Citibank" has already exceeded the mark of 50 million dollars. However there are another 16 branches of foreign banks whose capital is less than 10 million dollars and in turn they will face hardships in reaching the rate enshrined by law, something which may push them to choose whether to contiue working on the Egyptian market under this condition or take the required measures to leave it exactly as the branch of the Swiss " Credit First Boston" bank had done before in 2001.
EGYPT EXPECTS ANNUAL $2 BILLION REVENUES FROM GAS EXPORTATION

The Egyptian side, however, presented its Saudi counterpart with a file including the applied measures in selecting grain used in cultivating potato and the areas allocated for it, in addition to other processes of sorting out, packaging, wrapping, transportation and exportation in order to reassure the Saudi officials of safety and good quality of Egyptian potatoes which encouraged the EU to lift the ban imposed on it and demand extra quantities so much so that Egypt has become ninth in terms of potato exporters.
She advised businessmen to necessarily study the Ukrainian market and the timing of exportation.
Regardless of the President's frequent warnings against the gravity of manipulations in foreign exchange markets, the government have contravened those warnings and given free rein to rates of exchange chaos. It allowed banks to raise the dollar and other foreign currencies rates of exchange under the pretext of levying commission for procuring currency at a rate of 12%.

This will take our exports to these countries up after they have declined extremely by 70% following the collapse of the Soviet Union due to economic and financial problems as well as the guarantee of the value of the clinched deals.

LAW ON PRACTICING POLITICAL RIGHTS AMENDED
The bill aims at finding the Assembly a way out of a quandary which it faces in every parliamentary session regarding its members who had not done military service or evaded it.
High-ranking Egyptian security sources disclosed that Israel had introduced new modifications and improvements into its monitoring systems on the Egyptian-Israeli borders to carry out unconventional tasks including detection of secret tunnels on long depth dug by Bedouin smugglers. The new equipment is furnished with remote sensing devices that can detect underground holes and vacuums however deep they are.
Under the above heading, Abdel Wahhab Badrakhan of Al-Hayat writes his article to say: If the Turkish Prime Minister expressed the position of the State rather than his government only, this would mean that it was the first time in ages for the Turkish military to abandon a big part of the pressure they put for a long time on their country's policy.
The US needs Turkey not only to provide it with logistics but also to get the regional legitimacy of war.
This fact may have given Ankara a room to breathe and express opinion. If the war on Iraq is destined to take place, Turkey will find no way but to remember that Iraq is on its borders. Even if the woes of war are not to take place on its land, the war will have regional repercussions and results as well as complications, which Turkey will have to cope with.
The talk about the historical rights to Iraq's land and oil is present in the discourse of the new elected Turks just as it was present in the discourse of dinosaurs that controlled the Turkish political arena for a long time.
However, it was notable that Abdulla Gul devoted his first external tour to a number of Arab capitals. Ending his tour in Saudi Arabia and declaring that both countries agree on the necessity of averting the war may give the Americans a sign that the regional environment does not share them their suspected rush into war.
Quoting senior Israeli sources, Yediot Aharonot newspaper estimated that the Korean decision would give momentum to the Iranian armament programme, expedite the execution of the ballistic missiles plan as well as its nuclear programme so that it might be able, with Korean backing, to possess nuclear weapons in five years' time.
Syria, said the report, has got an enormous arsenal of chemical weapons and nerve gas (sarin) and is seeking to produce even more dangerous gases.
It goes on to say that in addition to the close relations with Lebanese Hizbullah, regarded as a strategic partner and an execution arm, the current Syrian regime has promoted cooperation relations with Iran in various fields and considered it a strategic alliance. It also cooperates with Iraq and provides it with equipment including combat devices regardless of international embargo.
The rebel movement supreme Military Command member told Al-Ittihad in Kampala that the agreement provided that the Sudanese army would move to control the camps which had been occupied by Ugandan Lord Resistance Army led by priest Joseph Coni in the equatorial region.
Under this headline, Salama Ahmed Salama of Al Ahram wrote a column, which ran to the following effect only in part: Arab and foreign mass media has been dominated by an argument to the effect that the mere resignation of President Saddam Hussein or his leaving the country would pave the way to avoiding the outbreak of war against Iraq and stop military escalation as the American Administration carries on with building up forces and fleets for that war and thus sparing the region the consequences of the American wrath.
After the Arabs believed the story of disarming mass destruction weapons and asked Saddam Hussein to respond to the Security Council resolution to spare Iraq the dangers of war, they started once again and with the same naivety to say that his stepping down and quitting Iraq would end Iraq's quandary, but such an argument is far from the truth.
It is only greed for oil!
They confirmed that that step was not conditional upon Jordanian direct participation in the war or even providing logistical support. However, the sources continued, Jordan showed readiness to help the relief of any Iraqi potential refugees fleeing from Iraq to neighbouring Western Iraq desert.
Bargains over prisoners may help release ours. I personally was released twice from prison in deals of exchanging prisoners."
Because Iraq could not face the aggression and because the U.S. knows that we don't have the missiles that can reach south and north America.
The U.S. war on Iraq comes in favour to the Zionist lobby and in order to make Israel expand on our land so that the region may, then, be changed negatively.
The CAIM also okayed the annual reports on the implementation of the third Arab security agreement and the second gradual plan of Arab strategy to fight against terror and illegal drugs.

AN IRAQI MAJORITY SUPPORTS INTERNATIONAL MANDATE AFTER SADDAM
TWO RUSSIAN DELEGATIONS VISITING BAGHDAD TO SIGN A NEW OIL INVESTMENT ACCORD
A source close to Russian Foreign Ministry told Al-Hayat that there were two political and oil delegations, headed by deputy foreign minister, Alexander Sultanove and first deputy of the Ministry of Energy respectively.
A MINISTRY FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
Another reason for my delight is the fact that the Ministry of the Interior has been including human rights activists on the black lists, detaining its members, refraining from dealing with their centers and societies in the field of authenticating information and seeking to undermine or deny such information. In the context of that long stupid history, Egyptian public opinion has become hostage to poisonous propaganda campaigns against human rights organizations in spite of the extremely crucial role they play in Egyptian political life and regardless of the external influence which they could exercise.
NEGOTIATIONS THERE, BUT WAR HERE!
Washington can not run amok in a region where China and Russia can claim a say and influence that can not be overlooked.
If neither regimes has no protection and so long as the crucial aim is disarming those weapons and avoiding their dangers, how can matters be put right through negotiations there, but not here? How can stability be of high priority there, while that priority here is given to anarchy as a possible means of running the region's affairs?
If they meet, there must be a captor and a captive, a winner and loser.
Even more, the executive power is keen to control everything in society so that its culture, policy or even music may become one of security.
Has security become stable in the Arab world so that the interior ministries may be free to pursue the cyber-crimes?
It is as if the official statistics, which showed the Arab region as coming before the last among the world countries in terms of Internet communication and away from the African countries in the south desert by a narrow margin, were not enough.
USAID is reticent about the possibility of signing an agreement with the Egyptian Bar Association on the programme of "scholarships in America". This programme includes training courses in how to use modern technology in addition to English language courses.
For his part, chief of lawyers syndicate Sameh Ashour denied any agreement with the USAID and considered such a government, if any, as "disgraceful to the Bar".
Under this title, Salama Ahmed Salama of Al-Ahram writes his column to say: The current stage of the conflict in the Middle East, whether regarding the Iraqi crisis or the Palestinian problem, obviously depends on what could be called the "parallel war". This war is characterized by using camouflage and deceit means and spreading misleading information to delude the enemy and affect his morale before launching the military attack with minimal possible losses.
Thus, deceit in the Iraqi crisis goes parallel to the Palestinian problem. News about war against terrorism links them together in order to achieve strategic goals that are far a long way from the interests of the Middle East peoples.
The US Administration betted on Iraq's refusal to comply with the Security Council resolution 1441 as the US put it in a provocative way that can hardly be accepted by any country that respects a minimum of its sovereignty. However, the Iraqi leadership surprised all and accepted the humiliating unjust resolution and cooperated with the inspection teams out of the blue. Iraq stifled its anger and overlooked its wounds and pains due to their provocation.
We are wondering about the reasons why the US President went out of patience with Iraq while he is totally away from the end of his tether as far as North Korea, which challenged and insulted him and booted the inspectors out, is concerned.
He was quoted as saying that there were many fields for cooperation between the Egyptian Stock Exchange and Arab stock exchanges, among which was cooperation in the fields of disclosure, remote circulation and the joint registration among those stock exchanges.
As regards the negative impacts that the Egyptian Stock Exchange would suffer from if Iraq was attacked, Al-Torgoman said that such a military attack would affect definitely all sectors of Egyptian economy not only the Stock Exchange.
INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE TO REDUCE VALUE OF EGYPTIAN POUND
The World Bank and the IMF warned that the refrainment from taking such a step would lead to a constant rise in the dollar rate of exchange outside the bank which would require taking measures to face that crisis.

Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Fayza Abul Naga said Egypt is expected to lose around 8 billion U.S. dollars (about 40 billion pounds), if the U.S. goes ahead with its potential war on Iraq.
Most of the Egyptian banks have been involved in speculations in the dollar and the Saudi riyal, as result of misunderstanding the decision of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) governor.
In the meantime government key officials are still divided over the issue of a new depreciation of the pound value. Some of them deem it necessary while others ask for acting slowly waiting for the result of the actions in the region in light of the imminent war on Iraq.
He revealed that Exchange Division had faxed the political leadership a message pointing out the outstanding problems and the harm afflicted on respectable exchange firms due to some government decrees.
This law included several articles aimed at eliminating these firms without real pretexts, Al-Abyad said adding " we have no role now and that 126 companies in addition to their 316-branch are in pursuit of other businesses in light of the stiff stagnation we are undergoing" He confirmed that every entrepreneur has the right to continue working or not and that changing the company's activity is not a binding decision, however he expected the coming period to be the worst of its kind as far as those companies positions are concerned.
Minister of Supply and Domestic Trade, Dr. Hassan Khidr announced the success of negotiations with the Russian side to obtain preferential prices for importation of wheat from Russia under the offset system.
Abul Naga added that the Russian market suffers from an 80% deficit in the field of medicine, vaccine, serum and cosmetics.

During the PA's discussion of the law amendment that decreases charges by 25%, Abol-Enein said that this amendment will streamline real estate credit procedures and would accordingly encourage citizens' investment in real estate. Registering real estate will enable owners to obtain loans under the guarantee of their real estate, added Aboul Inein making it clear that the problem that faces real estate finance law is that a portion of real estate is not registered and, consequently, cannot be deemed as loan guarantee.
Head of the National Democratic Party's Economic Committee, Dr. Mahmoud Mohieddin accused some businessmen of not respecting the banking rules, obtaining a large number of loans and evading paying them off.
This bill includes rules organizing the foreign exchange market.

Israel demanded the two batteries to face any Iraqi missile carrying mass destruction weapons that can be launched by Baghdad in case the US launches a military offensive against it.
At its time, the Israeli demand aroused much criticisms in Germany especially as Israel did not conceal its intention to use such carriers in the Palestinian occupied territories.
The sources told Asharq Al-Awsat that the first suspect's name was Hany Malak Gaber Dous, 30, living in Ameriya district, West Alexandria, married and has a daughter called Aisha.
The members of this group do not belong to "Heresy and Exodus Group" rather they adopt a righteous Salafi doctrine, Sakr concluded.
The Arab citizen cannot be waiting for new initiative reformulating old concepts that proved difficult to apply. He is rather looking forward to direct practical steps which he may see positively reflected on his life and on the future of his posterity.
The enhancement of political participation, as we see it, means holding free parliamentary elections, setting constitution ensuring equality for all citizens, guaranteeing independent and just judiciary, bringing to book those responsible for spending public funds, complete separation between the estates and the release of press freedom.
The peaceful way that would be considered by the participants in the anticipated meeting is how Iraqi President Saddam Hussein could leave Baghdad and hand over his country to General Tommy Franks, head of the U.S. forces that are marching towards the region.
Even if such scenarios do not take place the U.S. administration will push ahead with the change process itself. Many pieces of information were leaked about schemes to divide Saudi Arabia, change the regime in Egypt, punish Syria and put the West Bank and Gaza under an international mandate and NATO forces.
EGYPTIAN MP INQUIRES INTERIOR MINISTER ABOUT DAMANHOUR ELECTION IN WHICH IKHWAN CANDIDATE WENT DOWN
In relation to the opposition Al-Wafd Party crisis over two of its members' opposition to the party decision to okay Hishamt's invalid membership, and the Al-Wafd Party leader No'man Gomaa's order to investigate them, Al-Wafd member of parliament Mahmoud al-Shazly told Asharq Al-Awsat daily that his colleague Khairy Kalag had won access to the parliament through fixed elections at the expense of the Muslim Brotherhood's candidate, forcing the party into a tight corner before public opinion.
He added that their parliamentary activities were not published by the party organ as Munir Fakhry Abdel-Nour, a Christian Al-Wafd member of parliament, monopolized everything within the party's parliamentary office, which is lacking in coordination. "We lodged several relevant complaints with party leader's office, but they were met with no response."
Under the above heading, Khalid Al-Dakhil, professor of political science in Saudi universities writes to say: What happened last week makes it possible to say that there is an indication, just an indication so far, that some Arab leaderships started to come close in their approximation to the Arab reality to the unofficial view or the outlook of the people of thought and opinion of this reality.
This criticism, though limited, had not been allowed in the media before.
Here we should remember that Arab satellite channels began after the 1991 Gulf war to turn into a prevailing phenomenon.
The Gulf crisis was the main factor that resulted in or enforced this type of media.
Silence in this case is per se an indication of either official acknowledgement of the bad reality and therefore the legitimacy of criticism or at worst the realization of the impossibility to prevent criticism within drawn limits vis-à-vis the successive Arab setbacks and Arab weakness that has become clear to everybody.
Who the winner is in this relationship is another question.
Through the statements and movements of their leaders, the governments seem to be as submissive as the peoples who now give in, for example, to what happens in Palestine and to what can happen in Iraq.
Mousa had previously noted that the Arab countries, which were exposed to a fierce western campaign, faced it separately at a time when it was necessary to face it collectively. This is the nearest conclusion reached by an Arab official in the face of the Arab reality as it is and the recognition that the problem lies in not outside the Arab reality.
The second is acknowledging that the self-reform and the development of political participation in the Arab countries are two essential bases for building the Arab capabilities and bringing about a total Arab rebirth.
The other importance of the initiative is that it comes from Saudi Arabia in particular.
The first points out that Saudi Arabia may be on its way to reviewing the defense strategy it has adopted so far.
This points out that the idea of political reform particularly the issue of developing political participation is seriously examined by the Saudi leadership.
It may be clear that any positive development in any Arab country represents a gain and an incentive to the other countries particularly when this development takes place in an important country like Saudi Arabia.
This is a prerequisite for the success of the development of political participation demanded by the Saudi proposal.
The new thing in the Saudi initiative is that it shows that the men of power and decision in the Arab world started to realize the importance of declaring even in an indirect form that they are ready to face the Arab reality as it is.
It must be admitted at the same time that the tendencies and stances of the men of power did not come totally out of nothing.
It may be the pressure of the current stage and the nature of confrontation with the US that has enforced this development.
Feeling the danger of the US targeting was the most outstanding of these conditions as all started to feel they are facing the same danger and that this danger sees no much difference between the governments and their peoples.
He pointed out that the movements of the group can not be legal since they are done in darkness. They are suspicious movements working to arouse students to stage demonstrations or take advantage of national attitudes to propagandize themselves, which runs counter to the national action where the majority and opposition meet.
The bill proposed by Al-Refa'i provides that a national authority for running railways should be established so that joint ventures either single-handed or with other partners might be founded. On establishment authority would be authorized to circulate and put up the stocks of those companies. The bill assigned the authority's board of directors the responsibility of defining the prices of the services offered in accordance with the systems of sound auditing costs, which should, after all, help the authority achieve self-sufficiency.
It should also have a special account where it would deposit its proceeds and carry forward its budget surplus from one year to another.
Reliable sources said the U.S. general consul would hold on Sunday a similar meeting in Alexandria to consider the situation in Egypt and the region.

PALESTINIAN DRAFT CONSTITUTION GRANTS PRESIDENT JUST TWO TERMS
The president is entitled to dissolve the parliament if the majority of citizens vote for this decision in a national plebiscite called by the president.
The Palestinian state's political system is a democratic representative one based on multi-politics.
The Palestinian people also have the permanent right to demand compensations for their land and property seized or destroyed by the Jewish state, along with reparations for their moral and material sufferings in consequence of the establishment of the state of Israel and its invasion of Palestine in 1967, it noted.
Citizens can not be nabbed, searched or denied freedom unless there are judicial decisions in this spirit.
In a lengthy interview with French political weekly newspaper Al-Amari said, "We have broken the backbone of the terrorists and only one thousand of them have been left."
Al-Amari's talk about accepting Islamists reminds those interested in the Algerian affairs of what happened in 1992 when the military, all of a sudden changed the game rules and stopped the elections when they sensed that the Islamic Salvation Front would certainly win and would soon form a government without the need of any others taking part.
He added, "We had difficulty getting even the ammunition used for shooting rifles for municipality guards."
Other banners called on the Arab nation from the Atlantic Ocean as far as the Arab Gulf to get united against the looming U.S.-led aggression on Iraq. The sitters-in also urged churches across the world to protest the potential U.S. aggression on the Arab country. They further commended Palestinian heroic martyrdom operations against Israeli targets, criticizing "Americanized and Zionist-ized persons" who consider such operations as "terrorist attacks".
From the Easter Church, we greet heroic martyrs and their families who should be catered for and supported since they are targeted by the occupation forces."
"Why do infamous western circles linked to Zionism want to describe resistance as terrorism, while winking at the fact that occupation is the real terrorism," he wondered. "It is our duty to resist for resistance is a patriotic action in the first place."
Hizbullah deputy in the Lebanese parliament, Abdullah Qusair made an announcement to the effect that all of Hizbullah operations against Israeli sites were but reactions to Israeli aggression on Lebanese civilians. This announcement raised questions whether Hizbullah intends to suspend its operations against Israeli sites at the time being.
He added that the timing of this announcement did not mean that Hizbullah refrained from launching operations against occupation.
Hizbullah will not intentionally open the South front during the U.S. war against Iraq, but it will be ready to square up to an Israeli move towards the Lebanese lands, he pointed out.
Double that number of refugees have also been monitored by unofficial statistics about whom the Commission is entirely in the dark.
The procedures of official bodies approval of granting political asylum confirms that the guidelines in that regard may be found in the July 1951 agreement and the January 1967 protocol on political refugees status as well as the items of international law.
Secondly, old refugees who came early last century and belong to different nationalities. This categories are mostly Armenians who lived in Cairo and Alexandria, merged with the community and worked in tobacco, jewellery, shoes and photography industries. They just like their counterparts in Lebanon, have become such an organized sect that they were allowed by local authorities to elect a sectarian council and set a constitution of their own.
Now Egypt is considered one of the least refugee hosting countries.

Family expenditure on health care including herbal medicines also increased by 69% in urban areas and 38% in rural areas.
The report said that population of governorate metropolitan cities had the highest annual income, followed by city dwellers and then the rural population. It added that the gap between the lowest and the highest average incomes has widened in the last years, with the lowest reaching LE400 and the highest hitting over LE20 thousand. The citizen with over LE2000 income have constituted the widest base while the most disadvantaged constituted a tiny percentage as their number reached only 6 families out of 48 thousand families from all governorates.
Jordanian officials told Al-Hayat that Jordan's ability to absorb the consequences of the American strike to Iraq has improved after getting international and Arab guarantees to minimize the Kingdom's losses and pledges to preserve Jordan's security and stability during military operations especially regarding its Western borders with Israel.
Israel's entering the war on the USA side would double Jordan's fears of security disruptions in its street strongly sympathizing with Baghdad and would intensify confrontation with the political opposition especially the Islamic opposition which issued a fatwa (religious opinion) forbidding the extension of any form of support to Washington in its imminent war against Iraq.
The sources said that the evacuation decision would likely be left to the nationals' choice. Every EU embassy in Amman will send memos to its nationals in Jordan showing its willingness to help them if they want to leave Jordan and pay cash assistance to them if they have not enough money.
IKHWANITE MP PRESENTS DRAFT LAW BANNING TV COMPETITIONS
"There is a rapid growth in the economy of gambling such as what is so-called TV reward programmes," he said. Such programmes have become an important channel for spreading the "luck culture," which is contrary to work and production. Besides, they drain part of the incomes of those who participate in such programmes, he pointed out.

He called for honouring those martyrs and self-sacrificers by using their names for the streets, facilities and edifices of Palestinian cities, villages and refugee camps.
"We have formed a national delegation of Palestinian Muslim and Christian clergymen, who will head for Iraq to be human shields and to carry our messagea message from our Muslim and Christian holy sites and our struggling Palestinian people to the Iraqi people.
Observers in Beirut see that the timing of this announcement, which came from the Foreign Ministry, has many political indications on international and internal levels.
"Resistance forces are always militarily ready, and its main goal is to liberate Shebaa Farms," he said. What was said by Qusair means that Hizbullah fears that Israel may exploit the U.S. strike on Iraq to assault South Lebanon and, therefore, it would confront such aggression.
EGYPT: 5 MILLION EMIGRANTS & 10 THOUSAND POLITICAL ASYLUM SEEKERS
UN figures point out that the number of legitimate refugees in Egypt amounts to about 10 thousands besides 15 thousand holders of the yellow card waiting for their positions determination. However, there are about two million illegitimate refugees in Egypt, apart from the 3 million Sudanese residents whom Egypt refuses to deal with as illegitimate refugees.
They all confirm that every person has a right to seek political asylum so long as he is exposed to repression of any kind or for any reason.
Thirdly, the category of political refugees to Egypt which claims the largest number as they reach four times as many as the number estimated by the UN Commission on Refugees statistic. There are 30 thousand African students granted scholarships by the commission to continue their education after that proved impossible in their original country. They are looking forward to benefiting by educational utilities in Egypt. They are mostly from Ethiopia, Sudan, Djibouti, Somalia. They used to be top students in their original countries.
The official added that 400 refugees have no nationality. They originally came from various countries like Turkey, Russia and Poland after the Second World War but failed to acquire the Egyptian nationality. Some of their living requirements are now being provided by the Refugees Office.

CAIRO DIALOGUE WHEN DISAGREEMENT IS FAVOURITE OPTION
Undoubtedly, this step was taken only when it was greenlit by the U.S., which can not decide on such questions unless it consults Sharon, the main person interested.
Therefore, Egyptian diplomacy found that the dialogue would send an articulate message to these forces that no one can monopolize Palestinian legitimacy unless it gives its thumbs up.
Well, it did not want resistance to escalate in a way that may lead to an explosive situation outside the occupied Palestinian territories, including Egypt. Still, this does not mean that it wanted Sharon's arrogance or Israel 's general ignorance of its and Palestinian demands to have the upper hand on Palestinian and Arab will.
The "Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades" story, exactly following Tel Aviv martyrdom operation, should not be exaggerated, and to control the situation when necessary is still possible.
Meanwhile, Hamas, along with Islamic Jihad, opined that involvement in Cairo dialogue was a political opportunity as the Egyptian recognition showed an official Arab recognition of resistance and its movements and leaders, a thing which is intrinsically very significant.
But, it is unnecessary to make this public particularly when it is difficult to coerce Sharon into stop targeting Palestinian civilians in revenge for martyrdom operations against Jewish soldiers and settlers in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, a track which seems to be better than the situation on the eve of the Al-Aqsa Intifada late September 2000 when the occupation military was stationed outside residential centers.
Shura Council member Dr. Soad Kamel criticized the Ministry of Industry for preferring American University in Cairo (AUC) graduates to Egyptian universities' to work in small-sized industries sector secretariat, which will be set up to apply new methods and draw upon experiments of other countries.

SMALL BANKS REFUSE TO APPLY CURRENCY PROCUREMENT COMMISSION
On the other hand, most small banks declined to impose commission on their clients whether on operations of procuring foreign exchange or opening credits necessary for financing foreign trade (export-import).
Small banks doubted earlier that many clients fled to major banks which procure their need of foreign exchange after imposing commission. They also doubted that their role in opening documentary credits may retreat.
The commercial attaché with the Dutch embassy in Egypt said the council would hold its first meeting in Cairo in March next while its final formation would be announced later on in order to participate in developing the bilateral relations between the two countries' businessmen as well as increasing the volume of commercial exchange between Egypt and the Netherlands.

There was a serious retreat for credit in Egyptian banks especially in the last months of 2002. According to the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) statistics, credit increased at the end of October 2002 by one million pounds only compared with the end of September, whereas deposits increased by 1.16 billion pounds. In the first half of 2002, deposits increased by about LE10 billion, whereas credit increased by LE600 million only for the same period. The decline synchronized with a decline in interest rates by about 2% and liquidity increased even more as the CBE reduced the bank legal reserve with it. There has been a relative retreat in bank employments in treasury bonds due to the wide differential between interest rates on deposits and the revenues of bonds.
Former CBE senior advisor, Mohamed Al-Barbari thinks that the increase in liquidity and the severe decline in credit banking demand resulted from the introduction of new cadres into businessmen milieus who are capable of submitting projects which have good feasibility studies and quite capable of creating for itself suitable market quotas.
Al-Barbari expressed fears of a negative impact of the circumstances undergone by the region on total economic activity in the Arab world, Egypt and in banks.

BANKS FREE IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEALINGS
In a related development, the prime minister was quoted by the AFP as strongly hinting that his government would float the Egyptian pound against free currencies and that there would be a free market of foreign exchange, with banks playing an active role in buying and selling operations.
Meanwhile, Reuters quoted Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) Governor Mahmoud Abul-Oyoun as saying on Tuesday that the CBE would set fresh exchange rates on Wednesday, but revealed no details of this move.
In the meantime, the state-owned Middle East News Agency (MENA) quoted the premier as noting that the government has lately worked out a package to overhaul the banking system, devise a tightly knit monetary policy and create a free open foreign exchange market where banks may deal effectively in foreign exchange and the exchange rate in full transparency especially regarding business operations.
Federation of the Chamber of Commerce's Exporters Division chairman, Ali Essa, said that this decision will lead to revive exports and reduce imports at the same time in addition to directing producers to depend on local components in manufacture.

MAD RISE IN GOLD PRICES
An official source said that this sum would be distributed among the six banks according to the following:
Germany's giant auto manufacturer BMW intends to turn Egypt into a regional hub for making and exporting its products, including the X-class 4-wheel-drive cars and the new 500-class models that the company plans to put on the market by the end of this year. This new move on the part of BMW aims to push its annual sales of cars assembled in Egypt past the $300 million mark.
Hossam Abul Fotouh has two separate companies, the first is Abul Fotouh Company for Automobiles (ACFA), which is his BMW agency that also assembles BMW cars. The second company, Abul Fotouh Company for Distribution (AFA), specializes in marketing assembled cars.
The plan also anticipates expansion on the Arab world, as this plant will be the only one of its kind in the region.
Al Hayat also learned that Bavaria Company also wishes to build a new plant from scratch and not buy Abul Fotouh's factory. The company's reasons include that although Abul Fotouh's plant has two production lines, one for the 300-class and the other for the 500-class, the latter would be useless because BMW intends to introduce new models of the 500-class that will have completely new body designs as of next October, thus rendering the production line commercially unusable and making only one-half of the factory good for salable production.
Although there will be no sales in the next six months, Al Hayat learned that Bavaria's plan aims at boosting sales to 2,500 cars during the first 12 months after the start of operations at the factory.
The Egyptian Ministry of Petroleum reiterated that the country does not plan to export natural gas to Israel under an Arab natural gas pipeline project. The ministry said it has completely closed this dossier since the late 1990s.
CHARLATANS BUSINESS

The study, further, reported that a large number of quacks is criminals and people on parole who are concentrated in Cairo and Giza, Alexandria, Beheira, Qaliobiya, Assiut and Fayyoum. Sinai comes at the end of the list.
Dr. Ahmed Okasha, psychology professor, had a well-known opinion regarding the case of "Egyptians and Superstition". He stressed the fact that there is a direct correlation between Egyptians' depression and their resorting to superstitions, magic and drugs.
INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE TO REDUCE VALUE OF EGYPTIAN POUND
The World Bank and the IMF warned that the refrainment from taking such a step would lead to a constant rise in the dollar rate of exchange outside the bank which would require taking measures to face that crisis. The IMF also demands that the Egyptian pound be floated and its rate of exchange be fixed through supply and demand.
The World Bank will put forward its vision for facing poverty in accordance with a comprehensive study prepared on this problem and the development of Egyptian economy.
In a development envisaging an expected escalation with Iraq, the U.S. sent messages to all its embassies all over the world to keep U.S. nationals residing abroad on their toes in anticipation of an expected evacuation operation, according to a U.S. senior official.
They added that U.S. officials talked about an interval of less than "a few weeks" ahead of the outbreak of war, as the word "months" has been dubbed as banned.
According to an internal report on soldiers offences by the military police, every 5 minutes an Israeli soldier is arrested as suspected of committing an offence or a crime (105 thousand arrests over a year), a quarter of whom (36 thousand) spent more than one night in prison.
There is, however, a steady rise in the number of deserters for political reasons, who refrain from announcing those reasons. The military police report, nevertheless, says that the highest rate of those deserters desert owing to economic reasons.
Some thefts are big like that which we reported last week and was carried out by a person who managed to drive his car into a military base and then carried hundreds of tools and ammunitions from the stores.
The indictment against him in the courtmartial in Java pointed out that he had looted an alcoholic drinks shop in Bethlehem city, stolen money and gold from eight Palestinian houses in the same city as well as in Ramallah, Nablus and Balatah Refugee Camp. All this happened during the sweep operation called the "Defensive Wall" last April.
Israeli mass media called for "looking at the soldiers' positive aspects rather than focusing on the negative aspects only."
According to a key source, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the ministry in charge of supervising NGOs, the crisis began when a group of human rights associations and another group interested in jurisprudence activities applied for a fatwa (religious opinion) from Al-Azhar Fatwa Committee over the religious status of capital punishment and how far it could be adapted to the changing conditions today.
On the other hand, the issue seemed to have other dimensions related to foreign countries which are said to be exercising pressure so that capital punishment could be rescinded or its cases in the Egyptian law be reduced.
Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh deputy, Sheikh Mahmoud Ashour said, "Punishments in Islam are neither unrestricted nor suspended as this depends on certain conditions and constants in Islamic jurisprudence which provide them with enough flexibility to be used when Islamic sharia permit it.
Sheikh Ashour added that Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh Dr. Tantawi said it was impermissible to argue about capital punishment and warned manipulators and sedition mongers not to probe into issues that might trigger sedition about well known facts with a view to creating confusion that might prejudice public interests and the faith which says the impermissible is quite district from the permissible, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth and a wound for a wound.
This can be seen through the numerous procedures taken by courts and the long time spent on probing into each case in accordance with Islamic jurisprudence. The argument that this penalty is incongruous with contemporary conditions is false as it is these conditions that necessitate this penalty implementation.
Matters are subject to long discussion and probation. In regard with capital punishment, I think that submitting it to discussion is rather difficult.
Israeli Foreign Ministry hopes that the appointment of Elle Scheked would improve the semi-suspended relations with Egypt. It is noteworthy that he played a prominent role in boosting diplomatic and political relations between Tel Aviv and Ankara. To him also is ascribed the growing boom in such relations during the last four years.
Arab diplomatic sources told Asharq Al-Awsat that the Israeli ambassador in Cairo was suffering from complete isolation by the Egyptian society that feels angry due to the Israeli practices against the Palestinian people and their national leadership.
EXPERTS: ARAB ECONOMIC LOSSES AMOUNT TO $30 BILLION IN CASE OF STRIKING IRAQ
Arab Labour Organization Director, Dr. Ibrahim Quedar said that striking Iraq would negatively affect Arab economy especially regarding employment.
For his part, head of Importers Division at the Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Mostafa Zaki pointed out that Egypt's losses would be heavy as trade operations would totally stop. Foreign investors will also withdraw their funds from the Stock Exchange. Arab losses are generally expected to reach $20 billion and Egyptian losses are likely to amount to $10 billion at least.
The amendments allowed accredited banks, which are licensed to deal in foreign exchange, to freely determine rates of exchange in light of the free market.
Modifications banned non-banking bodies from practicing any remittance operation from or to Egypt and that their finance should depend on their resources and capital revenues. Non-banking bodies are not allowed to practice any bank activities enshrined in banks and credit law.
Modifications compelled exchange firms to notify, every hour till 4 p.m., the Central Chamber of Foreign Exchange with the CBE of the volume of dealings and the price of each operation.
Exchange firms are one of the parties of foreign exchange market, he added.
He urged coordination between banks and exchange firms to quickly bring the market back to stability after the chaos witnessed by the market on the first day of the application of the new decisions and the large difference of sale prices between banks.
Abul-Oyoon promised to offer new facilities to exchange firms during the discussion of the new banking law in the current parliamentary session.
Abul-Oyoon revealed that the aim of linking the firms to banks is to control the market and eliminate the manipulative companies branches.
CUSTOMS DOLLAR RATE OF EXCHANGE AMENDED
Al-Alam Al-Youm sources indicated that it was expected that exporters would be treated on the basis of the dollar rate of exchange weekly average.
SPECULATIONS FOR JUMP IN GOLD PRICES AFTER POUND FLOTATION
Last week it dropped from LEE52.43 to LE51.93, he added Head of Gold Traders League, Sherief Al-Sergany, said that this great advance that has never been reported since the beginning of 1990s is attributed to the circumstances witnessed by the region and the continuous threats of war.
It is expected that such a programme would have been completed by 2004. Deputy Premier and Minister of Agriculture, Dr. Youssef Wali said that the government agreed to allocate 14.25 million pounds to make the project a success. This project aims at deregulating pest control services and offering services of information and economic analyses of the cotton policies, he pointed out.
Kammon voiced his hope that the coming session of the joint committee will be appropriate for reviewing all that have been executed concerning protocol. He called for boosting cooperation between the countries in development fields, hoping that other agreements would be clinched in different fields.
Finance of these projects is available, Abu-Zeid said, explaining that a program had been set to finish the studies on the projects by 2005.
PRIVATE SECTOR OWES BANKS 144.4 BILLION POUNDS
The distribution of credit facilities according to the economic sectors' activities points out that loans that were extended to the industrial sector increased by 8.2%. Its debts, therefore, amount to 73.2 billion pounds or 34% of the credit facilities extended by the banks in the Egyptian pound, the report said.
Financial analysts in Dubai said that the Egyptian government decision to float the pound had some different impacts on the economy ranging from consolidating the competitiveness of Egyptian exports on world markets and turning Egypt into a cheap tourist destination on the one hand and harming the interests of investors and depositors whose accounts are estimated in the Egyptian pound together with weakening the pound purchasing power.
Regional Director of Banque du Caire branches in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries Farid Ashini said that liberating the Egyptian pound rate of exchange would have positive impacts on the Egyptian economy performance in the long run. Liberating the pound rate of exchange will make the banks control the market and the exchange firms into subordinates to them in terms of rates of exchange, something that will eliminate the unofficial market, he added.
EGYPTIAN-RUSSIAN BUSINESS COUNCIL TO BE SET UP
He said that it was decided to form a committee from the Federation of Chambers of Commerce to act in concert with Egyptian companies and factories for determining the kinds of products and goods which can be exported to Russia in accordance with the agreement.
An Egyptian-Russian committee, to organize this exhibition, was formed, he concluded.
He added that the decree would help attract more foreign investors to purchase the companies put up for sale due to the low value of the pound. As for the local investor, value of the companies would increase by the same extent of the decrease in the pound value, he said.
WE'VE BURIED HATCHET WITH NASSERITE PARTY: NEW IKHWAN LEADER
We all are targeted by the enemy."

AN EGYPTIAN LAWSUIT TO RESUME MARKING COPTIC CALENDAR BEGINNING AS OFFICIAL HOLIDAY
The lawsuit, therefore, demanded that such a festival (Al Nairuz) be added to the rest of festivals and official holidays which the state marks (10 days throughout the year).
The lawsuit pointed out that , "There are many festivals when the state bodies stop work even though they are not currently significant. Marking this occasion, however, would theoretically and practically enhance national unity concept, develop the principle of citizenship and belonging to the state. This makes it necessary to resume marking "Al Nairuz Day" as a national festival when government offices, state organizations and the public sector stop work.
It is noteworthy that Professional Syndicates Law had been approved in 1993 and caused lots of controversy nationwide, as all professional syndicates had objected to it, considering it an attempt to limit Muslim Brotherhood's control over professional syndicates.
He pointed out that such attitudes had considerably created optimal climates for terrorism.
On the other hand, Muslim Brotherhood Guide Ma'moun Al-Hudhaibi said that the siege imposed in some Arab countries on peoples to prevent them from expressing their wrath against heinous Jewish massacres against the Palestinian people or the ferocious American aggression which is being perpetrated against Iraq as well as assaulting Islam and Muslims in the four corners of the globe have, unfortunately, coincided in Arab and Islamic countries with crackdowns and detentions of youth and using emergency laws and court martials as the sword of Damocles to paralyze people's movement."
NASRULLAH EXPECTS AMERICA TO BE DEFEATED
Nasrullah said that anybody who would face such a technique would certainly lose even if they could fill all the sky with fighter planes or bombers.
People's Assembly deputies have uncovered exciting surprises during their session on 26th Jan.
"Where are the promises and the rosy statements made by the government under the dome of the parliament during last session as far as this file was concerned," the deputies asked.
Head of Youth Committee, Hossam Awad, called for establishing a supreme council to square up to the annual road accidents that exceed LE5 billion in losses, while Foreign Relations Committee deputy, Mansour Amer, described road accidents on the high way as a tragedy for the citizens of Qaliobiya governorate as they suffer from daily accidents on this road from Shubra El-Kheima to Benha.
Engineering Industries Chamber of Commerce board chairman, Nabil Farid Hassanein emphasized that the value of engineering commodities exports to Iraq exceeds $200 million.
He added that for 3 years such exports to the Iraqi market have regularly included tractors, agricultural irrigation equipment, pumps, refrigerators, washing machines, conditioners, coolers, machinery, car spare parts and electronic appliances.
Kuwait is currently witnessing harbingers of a ferocious battle between the state and the media that may destroy the relation between them, which was established by the Constitution over half a century ago.
The Kuwaiti officials' statements reflect an internal crisis. Kuwaiti Foreign Minister, Sobah Al-Ahmed Al-Sobah expressed fears of the variables that will take place from inside rather than from outside.
Newspapers threaten to wage war against the minister himself. In Kuwait, which abound in smells of the U.S. gunpowder, emerge the signs of a battle for which the press is making ready, saying they will not wave the white flag.
The remarks were made by the Egyptian minister at a symposium organized by the Regional Press Institute of the national daily of Al-Ahram on the Egyptian privatization drive for 2003, responding to the latest Al-Mussawar weekly number article by Editor Makram Mohamed Ahmed, saying that the Egyptian government was reconsidering the privatization program and modernizing a set of industrial sectors in a bid to help them resume production as attempts to sell it off were a fiasco. The minister said his relevant statements in a chat with the Al-Mussawar editor-in-chief were misrepresented.
The government has never sought to update the already-privatized state-owned concerns, which were demanded by international bodies, believing that investors would not be satisfied with modernization works carried out by the Egyptian side, the minister added.
Regarding unconventional medicine, produced, thanks to high-tech and genetic engineering, a blueprint is underway to update it. There is also another urgent plan to buttress scientific medicine research thanks to concerted efforts by Egyptian scientists at home and abroad.
The FBI has launched an operation to pursue about 3 thousand Iraqis who, according to the Bureau, had disappeared after their entry into the USA. This step has been taken lest any attacks should take place in case a war is launched against Iraq.
IRAQI FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF: IRAQI ARMY WILL TOPPLE SADDAM BEFORE WAR BREAKS OUT
Change in Iraq has become imminent, he said. Al-Khazraji refused to disclose the results of the contact he is making with Iraqi military men in this respect. He expressed his conviction that the largest part of the Iraqi armed forces and senior commanders will move to topple Saddam before the war breaks out.
The other six scenarios point out the entry of fewer American soldiers into North Iraq. The Turkish army is waiting for the reply of Abdulla Gul's government choosing one of those scenarios in a bid to define the number of Turkish soldiers who would join the American troops to North Iraq. Ankara would stipulate that Turkish troops would participate in American deployment of forces in North Iraq to protect Turkish "interests" there rather than to take part in the war.
Egypt has topped the list of Arab exporters to Iraq within the framework of the Oil for Food and Medicine Agreement till the beginning of the 13th stage of the agreement which started to be put into force last December.
He pointed out that a delegation of Iraqi Inspection and Control Authority in charge of defining the level of quality had had talks in Cairo in the first half of this month with the representative of Standardization Authority and Export and Import Control Authority regarding required standardization of specifications of commodities between Egypt and Iraq and according to the Trade Protocol signed by the two countries in that regard.
The report added that the trade balance surplus with Arab countries that signed free trade agreements with Egypt, i.e. Libya, Syria, Lebanon, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan and Iraq had risen to about $152 million against $71 million in the corresponding period in 2001.
Commander of Armed Forces and Minister of Defence and Military Production, Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi said that keeping permanent and comprehensive peace required reliance on developed military forces that protect and keep it for the sake of the country's security and safety.
Under this headline, Salaheddin Hafiz, deputy chief editor of Al-Ahram wrote an article which ran to the following effect only in part: The pressurizing American policy is obviously driving us to new military political bends to achieve its vital interests especially the enhancement of the concepts of its uni-superpower leadership of the world even by force of arms!
It is no secret at all that the virtual ruler in Afghanistan now has been the military commander of the American forces there since the American overwhelming military attack was launched on Afghanistan in retaliation to the suicidal attacks on New York and Washington on September 11th, 2001.
However, the declared and implemented American policy so far just acts in the opposite direction. While calling for democratic development, it actually makes it devoid of its genuine essence by militarizing democracy as was the case in Afghanistan and as is meant to happen in Iraq and as what might take place in more than one place.
CHURCH OPPOSES WAR: POPE SHENOUDA
JEWS CALL FOR ANNEXING MECCA AND MEDINA TO ISRAEL
The Israeli ambassador added that the Palestinian president Yasser Arafat had asked the former U.S. president Bill Clinton during the unsuccessful Camp David negotiations to convince the Israelis to relinquish Jerusalem as it represents the Islamic world. "Hence and out of this conviction," he added, "The Jewish state asks for its rights in Mecca and Medina."
At the meeting Pope Shenouda called for necessarily renewing thought in destiny issues.
He still believes that not all means have been used to disarm Iraq of its banned weaponry through inspection, said El-Baradei.
With a U.S.-led war on Iraq looming, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Foreign and Defence Ministers are expected to come together for an extraordinary meeting in Saudi Arabia on Feb. 8 on the regional situation and repercussions of a potential war on their countries.
CAIRO TO OPEN UP MORE TO SHARON AS INTER-PALESTINIAN DIALOGUE STUMBLED
The policy comes out of conviction that Sharon, who has been reelected as Israeli premier for the second term, should be given no excuse to maintain his policy, with attempts to be made to drag him into the negotiating table, the sources added. "Thus, the Egyptian initiative was aimed to help Palestinian factions and Arabs. In the discussions (in Cairo), Egyptian officials noted that Abu Mazen, who led the Palestinian mainstream Fatah, said the Palestinian Intifada caused harm to Palestinians, destroying all previously achieved accomplishments'. This is Abu Mazen's opinionthen what about the view of Egyptians?"
EXAMINATION OF LAWSUIT ON BUILDING CHURCHES PUT OFF
The government announced on January 28th the floating of the Egyptian pound against the dollar as of today (January 29th), which means a sharp decline in the pound rate of exchange against foreign currencies.
The decision on floating the Egyptian pound raised experts' deep fears for a big increase of the dollar rate of exchange before the Egyptian pound.
In an exclusive statement to Al-Mussawar, an Egyptian high-level official source said Cairo did not think that the results of the Palestinian dialogue that had been conducted lately in Cairo could help pave the way for resuming Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and activating the peace process. However, the source added, Cairo believed that having the Palestinian factions (13 in number) meet for the first time in the history of Palestinian struggle and their involvement in an extended national dialogue was aimed to close up Palestinian ranks and form a joint higher committee to run the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in a bid to protect Palestinian people's interests, achieve its supreme goals and distinguish between means and ends. These, the source argued, are positive results that should be adhered to. "According to all criteria, these are considered advanced steps in the way of Palestinian struggle," the source said.
Surprisingly and unexpectedly, a number of Saudi thinkers sent a new memo of advice to the Saudi royal family, entitled, "A Vision for the Present and Future of the Homeland." It asked for a number of reforms including the political system, judiciary, decentralization, transparency and fair distribution of wealth.
No sooner had Crown Prince Abdullah read the memo, than he asked his office staff to contact the signatories and invite them to meet him the following day, i.e. last Wednesday evening, Al-Quds Al-Arabi learnt. About thirty signatories immediately attended the meeting, including Dr. Abdullah Al-Hamed, Dr. Matrook Al-Faleh, Abdel-Hamid Mubarak Al Sheikh and Fahd Saleh Jamal.
The memo concentrated on the deterioration of public services in the Saudi Kingdom, the aggravating public debt (about 250 billion US dollars), encroachment upon public funds, remarkable low-incomes, explosion of violence and the increasingly overshadowing role of reformists and those who are interested in public affairs.
Noticeably enough, the signatories of the second memo, which is entitled "A Vision for the Present and Future of the Homeland," reflected a myriad of political, religious and provincial orientations in Saudi Arabia.
It is a war based on interests rather than ethics, has a noble goal named, "Ending the sufferings of the Iraqi people" and has got means, among which the exploitation of the Iraqi people and the achievement of ambitions at its expense is by no means seem the least dirty.
The situation is simply as bad as this: some European countries are keen on sending a support cable to the "Emperor", vehemently approving his plan to use mass destruction weapons which he surely possesses, with a view to removing mass destruction weapons that others might be in possession of.
Some of them even know in advance that the end of the tunnel would not be to their liking, but they simply can not say that the course taken was wrong!
The streets seem more rational than the governments. It is a war that conceals other wars and tries to revive long forgotten domination and colonization policies, which no public opinion would condone.
Even in this malicious campaign both friends and allies do their best to convince Washington that the problem did not lie in unleashing missiles or planes, but in the course of the action that would come next, which is a political and diplomatic action in the first place.
So long as the standard adopted was "for or against us", there should be no new Security Council resolution as such a military action requires no legitimacy and as such a resolution would finally consecrate the World Order Coup, dwarf its ethics and norms in favour of Israel rather than America as it is Israel that has always despised international law and now America is following in its footsteps.
In a nutshell, they are trying to say, "Look how beautiful this war is!

The case of the Arab regional order has become subject to examination as a serious case of disease whose symptoms have extended to all the joint Arab decision-making mechanisms and institutions. Al-Ahram Al-Arabi put the question of the hour to a number of Arab experts about the future of this order if the Arab countries fail to take a unified stance on the imminent war on Iraq.
The strategic challenge requires a strategic reply. The Arabs lack only the will to struggle in defense of their interests and peoples. He sees that what is going on is graver than a mere war to be launched against Iraq. It is an attempt to marginalise, tear apart and seize the Arab world resources, he said. The war effect would not be confined to one country, but it would stretch to all countries without exception.
Libya..eye on Africa As the Libyan view has always been surprising and astonishing to some as it moved from excessive calls for immediate Arab unity to the exploration in the African space, we put our questions to Libyan researcher and writer Sami Latif. He preferred to start his talk by explaining some issues in order to be able to reach a political objective and calm reading under these difficult circumstances. The intellectual, cultural, political, social, and economic structures dominating the Arab world are fully responsible for this backward and catastrophic Arab condition.
He cited the stance of the African countries which are members in the Commonwealth and which reject the imposition of an economic blockade on Zimbabwe. They insisted on solving the internal problems of Zimbabwe within an African framework. Also, Latin American states no longer respond to the White House policies for imposing unjust siege on Cuba. The same case applies to the group of South Asian countries. However, we live in this Arab region under official Arab order that lacks will and management.
Shaaban added that aggression on Iraq would be the first step towards the re-arrangement of conditions in the region within the framework of a new Sykes-Picot that is more dangerous, harmful, and restrictive than the former one. The regional order would collapse not just shake or be marginalised. Here we can remember the failure of the Arab League efforts to solve the Iraqi-Kuwaiti crisis in the wake of the Iraqi forces invasion of Kuwait and the Iraqi government refusal to withdraw and therefore the involvement in a war whose results were previously decided. This increased the factors of Arab weakness, dealt a serious blow to the regional order and Arab solidarity and led to serious harms to the interests of the Arab nation and the region in general.
Zahran affirms that the Arab regional order will be in a critical situation, if the Arab leaders do not seek to rally together and do their utmost to stop the expected US-led aggression on Iraq.
The devaluation of the pound dates back to the 1960s. In 1961 the Egyptian pound witnessed its first decline after the state had run out of the economy 's reserve sterling assets which were estimated at $1 billion at the 1950s rates of exchange.
The risks of the pound flotation at present lead the pound to collapse in the market. Hardly had a month passed after the flotation decision when the pound value went down in spite of the CBE governor's statements that the CBE would not currently intervene which means that the rate fixed for the CBE intervention has not been yet reached in the black market, a rate which may probably range between 700 and 725 pts per dollar.

Egyptian imports from Australia represented in wheat, meat and livestock, declined by 10% in 2002 in comparison to 2001.
Such a position imposed by the CBE as a bid to protect foreign exchange market from using domestic currency surpluses to speculate in the dollar has caused a retreat in long-term planning in banks although the war is still raging. The banks, therefore, would have to expedite transcending such a condition. This applied not only to public banks but to private banks as well. Banks, therefore, must try to upgrade their performance rates which might involve reversing the current orientations regarding deposits interest rates.
Deputy director of the International Arab African Bank, Ahmed Selim, admitted that Egyptian banks were surprised by the war state as they had been busy devising several saving coffers to compensate for their need to the Egyptian pound, but had not prepared strategies for running activities if the war lasted for a long time. Only a few banks could rise up to that point and we as a bank in Egypt did benefit by external intensive presence in Arab countries. We are trying to alter the structure of our coffers or accounts in the present stage to cope with the change in the lifespan of the war, he added.
The source, who preferred to be anonymous, said the public banks would make offers within days, as the NBE would offer to purchase al-Tegaryoon Bank whose capital is LE200 million, and Banque Misr would buy Misr Exterior Bank.

As for the foreign entities that are making ready to enter the Egyptian market and consolidate their existence therein is the British Standard Chartered, which has frozen its attempts for a while after its efforts to buy the Egyptian American Bank two years ago were to no avail. However, it has not abrogated its plans yet especially as far as its aspirations to participate in post-war Iraq rebuilding were concerned.

-The Islamic Dawaa (call) Party, which was the strongest party on the Iraqi arena in the early 1980s.

This party is the only party within the national trend that participated in London opposition conference. Its secretary general was elected a member of the coordination and follow-up committee.
- Socialist Party of Kurdistan led by Mohammad Hag Mahmoud. Its presence is concentrated in Talibani-controlled areas.
-The Iraqi National Congress led by Ahmad Chalabi.
Sixth: Other trends and forces such as:
The Iraqi opposition sources reveal that the picture during the first six months after the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime would not be clear or stable and the main role would indeed be played by the American and British forces with poor participation from the UN so that there would be an international cover. The main concern in this period would be focussed on repairing and constructing infrastructure networks such as water, electricity, hospitals, schools, and relief operations as well as providing human needs. This would be followed by political elections to be conducted to come up with a civil Iraqi rule. The US would try to back up the pro-America organisations in these elections.
This trend would be represented by Ahmad Chalabi if he did not have a place then among the ruling group.
All opposition forces including the Islamic trends are unanimous that the alternative regime that would be chosen by the people, be it Islamic, democratic or federal, would prevail and would win the satisfaction and acceptance of all. In the main, the regime to come would rely on administrative federalism with Islam being given a momentous position in legislation.
NEW AMERICAN PROJECT: BAGHDAD PACT INCLUDES 9 MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES
Baqradoni expected that the "accountability act" of Syria would be raised in Congress as a pressure card to force Syria to respond to the American plans and expel the opposition Palestinian factions from Damascus.
As for Mosul, Barzani ascribed what has taken place there to the Peshmarga's delay to enter it, something that gave the gangs an opportunity to enter and loot. He attributed his forces' delay in entering the city to U.S. hesitation.
There was an agreement with the Americans as per which any move should have been done with coordination with them.

On the contrary, the Jordanian-Iraqi crossing point witnesses the crossing of Iraqis heading back to their country, which baffled Jordanian observers. While international organisations had not reported even a single case of Iraqi refugee until yesterday afternoon, the official Jordanian records said around 500 Iraqi citizens at least crossed the Jordanian-Iraqi borders heading towards Baghdad in a bewildering behaviour that needs much explanation. Among those returnees are five Iraqi diplomats who quickly and "happily" left, to quote in the words of the Iraqi embassy spokesman in Amman Gawad Al-Hamad while speaking about a Jordanian decision that five Iraqi diplomats should leave Jordan.
It has been noticeable so far that big quantities of fresh meals have found no people to eat them near the Jordanian-Iraqi borders. Some of those who are there for whom the meals were not originally prepared get the meals free of charge now so that suppliers may not bear the cost of returning them to Amman.
It seems that foreign reporters know they have nothing to do in eastern Jordan for the Iraqis move in the opposite direction heading to Iraq and the people there are only truck drivers and customs and relief workers and there is no real way to know what happens outside the borderline.
Some local press expressions also entered the circle of fun. Arabs Today local newspaper carried on its front-page yesterday a word of advice to US President George W. Bush saying that he should receive lessons in geography due to his statements in which he said war would last longer because Iraq is a vast and "very rugged" country. The newspaper mentioned that Iraq is a plain and open country rather than mountainous and rugged, which requires that lessons in geography should be given to the ignorant president.
For his part, Dr Ahmed Mahmoud, the researcher at Cairo University and supervisor of the survey, said that excluding Maspero from the competition was not a surprise as there were former indications that confirmed that. At the last months, Maspero's following up of events was very poor.
Kuwaiti First Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister, Sheikh Subah Al-Ahmed threatened to use measures other than protests in reply to Libyans' assault of the Kuwaiti embassy in Tripoli. He said that he would prefer to put off replying to the position of Syria which led an intensive diplomatic attack on Kuwait during Arab foreign ministers' meeting in Cairo until the image is fully clarified by Kuwait's diplomatic mission there.
The idea is summarized that everyone would head to the nearest phone and calls a random phone number in Iraq and talk to the one who answers the call for one minute in order to encourage him. An Egyptian would call 00964 then Baghdad code (1) then any random number provided that it would start with 443, 818 or 527. This way he would ensure that he is randomly calling an Iraqi household.
Further, they called for not feeling disappointed if some attempts to call Iraq did not succeed owing to different circumstances and called on them to re-call before telephone lines are disconnected due to war.
Islamonline.net adopted the idea and presented it through dialogue channels in the website under the title "Alexandria University wipes Baghdad's tears". It started to receive the experiments of those who made phone calls with Iraqis to encourage others. The result was also amazing.
How come that he is more confident than me while he is going through such circumstances?
Just, dear brother, hold on and fight under the banner of "No God but Allah".
It is known that the Egyptian communication companies had devised many new methods for using the mobile phone in order to listen to certain songs, chat or listen to some Fatwas.
1- "Starting an intensified electronic Jihad through dealing media blows to the criminal American Administration by sending pictures of the criminal American build-up to the whole world and all American and British e-mail groups and dialogue groups. They also called for collecting the e-mails of as many American people as possible, including individuals, research centers, elites, magazines and websites. It is preferable to concentrate on the e-mail addresses of individuals, which are easy to be obtained.
3- Concentrating on electronic Jihad via a set of websites and develop these proposals by our computer professionals.
Consequently, Egypt categorically rejected that idea, he said.
"I don't defend that "blood-stained" regime due to all its bad record and the catastrophes it has caused for the region and its peoples," he said. "However, I'm against the brutality and genocide that our brotherly Iraqi people are being exposed to."
Talking about the Egyptian regional role in formulating the prospects of the region, Al-Fiqi called upon Egypt to formulate a new role that is based on educational, democratic and political reform model after Egypt lost its pioneering role in different fields especially education.
In a message he addressed to Muslim Brotherhood, Al-Hudhaibi hailed a fatwa (religious opinion) passed by Al-Azhar two weeks ago regarding Jihad (holy struggle) as an obligation upon Muslims in support of the Iraqi people and to repel aggression.
If those rulers had listened to Muslim Brotherhood's opinion and prepared their peoples for Jihad and brought them up on faith and sacrifice, the Jews would never have thought of sweeping Palestine nor would America have acted so preposterously nor would it have threatened the world, especially the Arab and Islamic worlds or tampered with its destiny and future, killing and capturing, detaining and torturing at will. It is America, after all, that now backs Zionism in Palestine and declares war on Iraq's Muslim unarmed people.
The elections were held in 6700 party units nationwide and ended yesterday after a span of 6 days to renew 25% of the members of those committees in accordance with the party's new constitution.

Barakat indicated that the current circumstances undergone by all Egyptians necessitated joint work to boost bank savings of hard currencies, spur exporters and Egyptian expatriates to deposit in the Egyptian banks in foreign currencies to consolidate bank resources of these currencies; hence banks would have the ability to grant facilities and open documentary credits for exporters in hard currencies.
Abdel-Hamid said funds would give the authority much more flexibility to choose the country of origin of its imports but he did not give any further details.
"Local saving and direct investment rates retreated," revealed Minister of Planning Dr. Othman Mohamed Othman, making it clear that the annual rate of local saving ranged between 12-13%, whereas the development process required for such rate should increase to more than 20%. Achieving the targeted growth rates requires the availability of foreign investments to make up for the shortage of the volume of local savings that might be directed to productive activities in different sectors, added the minister, pointing out that the volume of production is limited due to the retreat of saving and investment.
There are big opportunities to set up a joint project on the grounds that Egypt is considered a gate to many Arab and African countries. We can make full use of the privileges of the production of Egyptian origin in exporting to Arab and African countries without customs duties according to the agreements of the Arab Customs Union and the African COMESA, he added.
Encouragingly, there is a bill before the parliament at present and will be passed shortly. It provides for breaking the government monopoly of importing oil and gas and giving the private sector the opportunity to deal in them and activate and implement a previous agreement signed between Egypt and Turkey but has not been put into force yet, the minister pointed out.
TOURIST RATES DOWN 22.4%
However, he said, more retreat of occupancy rates is expected during April.
The extension of the free zone service to include construction companies aims at attracting scientific expertise in this field, increasing the Egyptian companies making full use of such expertise and transferring their experience in a way that helps set up Egyptian giant entities in this field that can face international competition and urge smaller entities to amalgamate to form overseas companies and big entities, GAIFZ chairman, Dr. Mohamed Al-Ghamrawi said.
He pointed out that that leap was attributed to the efforts made by President Hosni Mubarak, which had led to the exclusion of Egyptian steel exports to the American market from the protectionist measures which had been imposed on such imports.

The Administrative Judiciary Court will hear on Saturday three lawsuits filed by three exchange firms against a decision made by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) governor to cancel the exchangers.
Such shutdown orders are so arbitrary that they do not suit violations the exchangers made, the defence said.
CAA CHIEF: LE34 BILLION GAP BETWEEN REVENUES AND USES
The arrears due to the government on June 30th, 2001 amounted to 39 billion pounds. This necessitates laying down a plan to collect such arrears in order to alleviate the total deficit of the public budget.
He warned against legalizing such excesses in the economic authorities, calling for bringing all the officials who are responsible for such violations to account.
Today (25th March) a donation campaign, organized by Mohamed Bin Rashed Al-Maktoum Charity Institution, will start at 2 pm in the state-owned Dubai TV to help the Iraqi people.
The Iraqis refrainment from resorting to the Jordanian border side represents one of the most outstanding anomalies of war against Iraq on the Jordanian arena. All indications and incidents have so far demonstrated that the big refugee camps set up on the Jordanian side to accommodate not less than 100 thousand Iraqi refugees have received no one yet. Though the war started five days ago, no single Iraqi refugee came, contrary to all expectations.
The Jordanian government had narrowly agreed to set two refugee camps inside Jordanian land on condition that the international organisations be financially in charge of them. Sources told Al-Quds Al-Arabi that the absence of refugee movement harmed international deals with some restaurants and food companies, which signed contracts of tens of thousands of dollars to provide food for hungry men supposed to be Iraqis.
Vis-à-vis this case, tens of media men who took hundreds of thousands of dollars from TV stations to be in Al-Rewaishid had to go back to Amman and impatiently wait for any story or event. From the Jordanian authorities' point of view, this state contributed to the leakage of untrue information and predictions about what is happening in the eastern area of Jordan.
The most outstanding anomaly circulated by Jordanians now through cellular phones is one that conveys a news item supposed to have been carried by CNN station to the effect that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein agreed to leave Baghdad with his family and top aides provided that they head for the White House.
The survey pointed out as well that the number of the viewers of the American CNN news channel has retreated to its lowest rate since the second Gulf War, during which this channel managed to attract a lot of viewers in the Arab world.
"ROAD MAP" DELAYED UNTIL THE END OF WAR ON IRAQ
The new idea presented by the students via their website has proved a great success with their Egyptian relatives, who are searching for any means to support their brethren Iraqi people. They asked that that idea be generalized through electronic forums. This thought was adopted by many websites, which opened dialogue for it. The result was amazing.
The innovators of the idea said that it was discovered, through monitoring those who had called, that those calls made the Iraqis happy upon receiving calls. This had a great influence on raising the morale of the Iraqi people. They added that if each caller was keen on calling even for one minute and some 100,000 persons called, then they would boost the steadfastness of 100,000 Iraqi families.
Some other Egyptian youths made a proposal, via the websites that adopted the idea, to provide free international call cards to anyone who desires to call Iraq and has not enough money.
Another young lady called Mariam said that she succeeded in calling Baghdad after she had failed many times. She added, "I cannot describe to you the sincere feelings of the householder of the Iraqi family whom I talked to. He invoked blessing for me even more than I did for him. My tears betrayed me more than once when I was talking to him.
He quickly replied, "I'm an Egyptian and we here call random numbers to tell you that you are our brothers and we would never let you down. We will always pray for you and boycott your enemies.
"All of them expressed their happiness and surprise, emphasizing that their morale is high and asked us to sincerely and continuously pray for them. They told us they knew that our feelings were genuine and they were never angry about our stance," Akdar added.
Calling America as well On the other hand, Jihad through the internet forged ahead where some Muslim youths had innovated more thoughts for electronic Jihad, in reply to the call of many ladies through e-mail groups. The last of those calls was a message from a group of young people calling for escalating electronic Jihad. They said, "Dear members of Arab and Islamic e-mail groups it is necessary to coordinate efforts, unify powers and work together to uphold our poor brothers in Iraq and defeat the crusade criminal Anglo-American force." The new idea presents the following proposals:
This must be put in an easy, clear and brief English. Those who do not know English well, should read a text of a set of texts. We must ask them to watch a specific website or satellite channel in a bid to break the blackout of American disinformation offices."
Laban severely criticized the Education Minister's speech before the Shoura Council saying, "Bahaa Eddin found no reply to those who hold him responsible for the aggravation of the illiteracy problem in Egypt, except for attacking Katatib, as if they were responsible for making the number of illiterates in Egypt hit 20 million, according to Shoura Council acknowledgment."
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher expressed his country's rejection of America appointing an American general to govern post-Saddam Iraq and repeating the post-World War II Japan example.
Al-Fiqi warned Saddam Hussein against using weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in his war against coalition forces because such an act would be naive that would make him lose wide international sympathy and make the war against him legitimate.
I call for a new regional system that brings Israel to account after we let it go monstrous for the last 50 years."
Muslim Brotherhood Guide in Egypt, Counsellor, Mamoun Al-Hudhaibi warned that America was seeking to "control the fortunes of the world and infiltrate into the centers of power and leadership in the world through crime, terrorism, deception, bribery and debauchery.
He said, "Everybody must understand that our defence and support of the Muslim people of Iraq should not mean the Iraqi regime but rather the Islamic people, land, nation and sanctities and mosques where Allah's name is often mentioned. He went on to say that "The unarmed people of Iraq are standing against America and its allies' tyranny and, through faith, stubbornness and steadfastness can, God Willing, repel the aggressors. This means that any faithful people who believe in their right and sacrifice for their freedom can face oppression and tyranny.
The elections of the ruling party units and grassroots in villages and districts resulted in most old leaderships retaining their positions.
ISRAEL ATTACKS SHAABAN ABDEL-REHIM
The song refers to the fact that disarming weapons of mass destruction in "something good" but not in Iraq as inspection teams did not prove that it has such weapons, rather in Israel which possesses such weapons and whose soldiers kill the old and the young in Palestine without any consideration to the international community. If, moreover, talks about the tragedy which the Arabs started to live since the September 11th incidents in New York and Washington and about the Arab leaders failure to unanimously agree on unified resolutions owing to the surrounding changes.
Exciting stories are being told about the legendary resistance shown by the brigade led by the Son of the Nile, which stopped the progress of the third battalion of the fourth regiment of the American Marines led by a General called Marcos.
DESTROYING IRAQ IS PRELUDE TO BESIEGING CHINA
The Russian newspaper sees that such documents are of a very importance to Russia in three aspects:
Some make it likely that such matters have been discussed between President Saddam Hussein and former Russian prime minister Yuvegeni Primakov when President Putin commissioned him a task last February ahead of the start of the American war on Iraq.
If the American and British intelligence bodies rely on their spies, the Russian one depends on the Iraqi-Russian cooperation as well as the previous and accumulated experience since the Soviet Union and its current inheritor: "the department of the Russian and international intelligence."
Here, we can reach a new issue emerged apparently. This issue envisages confrontations between the U.S. and China, which is the only power that can vie with the U.S. as the Chinese economy develops dynamically while the country suffers great oil energy shortage.
Of course, there is almost a need to such bases not to confront terrorism but to dominate the northwestern part of China. Surrounding China gradually depends on the American military bases in an indirect way.
Saudi businessman Abdullah bin Mahfouz told Al-Hayat that he was on standby to partake in Iraq reconstruction projects and compete for post-war commercial contracts and transactions.
The primary contracts would be exclusive to US companies, which would lead the reconstruction process, Saudi businessman Hussein Shobokshi said, pointing out that Saudi and other companies of different nationalities would come second to American ones.
Grand Sheikh of Al Azhar Muhammed Sayed Tantawi called for putting an end to the current war against the Iraqi people as soon as possible because they are a war-torn people.
To the contrary, he indicated, terrorism aimed at killing innocents, occupying lands and transgressing against freedoms and honour. There is a general legal rule terming as "terrorist" whoever transgresses, without a legitimate right, against others whether s/he be Muslim or Christian and Islam has clean hands of them.
Commenting on boycotting foreign goods, he said that fatwas must not be issued in that regard without reference to competent bodies to underline to what extent that boycotting is useful and whether it could harm individuals or the society.
Today (25th March) a donation campaign, organized by Mohamed Bin Rashed Al-Maktoum Charity Institution, will start at 2 pm in the state-owned Dubai TV to help the Iraqi people.

JIHAD VIA PHONE IN SOLIDARITY WITH IRAQI PEOPLE
Many Egyptians had called Iraqi people through haphazard numbers and talked to them and noticed that their morale is very high and that Iraqis insist on victory.
Calls made by some Egyptians uncovered a state of extraordinary solidarity. Some families started to call the Iraqis to boost their morale and pray for them.
Noura, for example, said that she had called the random number 0096414432642 in Iraq and a father of an Iraqi family replied to her.
Another one who calls himself "A Muslim who loves Islam very much" says that he succeeded in calling Iraq and an Iraqi youth called Naser answered him.
You must fight in faith not as to sacrifice for anyone."
Some Muslim youths had used that idea during Aqsa uprising in Palestine and started to direct young people to call certain numbers. The revenues of those calls are allocated to back the Iraqi people or to enhance other medical and social projects.
Ordinary mail addresses should be obtained as well in order to send them the pictures of rotten corpses of their sons so as not to think again of desecrating the Islamic world countries."
EGYPTIAN FM TURNS DOWN IDEA OF APPOINTING AMERICAN GENERAL TO RULE IRAQ
On the other hand, head of Foreign Affairs Committee in the parliament Mostafa Al-Fiqi said two days ago that the Anglo-American war on Iraq would continue for several weeks and the Iraqi people would not accept an American governor or occupation of its lands though it has earlier approved of the dictatorship of Saddam.
Al-Fiqi castigated the decrepitude of the present Arab regional system terming the Arab League as "paralyzed" and a sort of "useless folklore" that has failed to be effective."
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD GUIDE: AMERICA WANTS TO CRUSH MUSLIMS & SEIZE THEIR LAND
He emphasized that "the blatant aggression on the nation makes Jihad an obligation upon each and every Muslim man or woman.
RULING PARTY GRASSROOTS ELECTIONS IN EGYPT RESULT IN RETAINING OLD LEADERSHIPS
The reports said that such elections had been held with complete transparency and democracy on the part of the party, thus revealing the success of such an experiment regarded as the first of its kind in the party.
In an article entitled "in the face of mass wrath" published in Israeli Yediot Aharonot an Israeli journalist said that the song which made great sales, more than 4 million copies, in Beirut, Damascus and Amman in addition to its sales in Cairo. That song, he said, would never have been spread but for the report broadcast by a widely spread Arab satellite channel. He, further, pointed out that official TV channels in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and some Gulf countries ignored the song in accordance with what he described as "high level orders".
Al-Ahram Al-Arabi's correspondent in Moscow Abdel-Malik Khalil writes an article to the following effect only in part: The whole world is living a historical awful moment caused by the aggressive war launched by the U.S. and Britain on the Iraqi people at a time when the U.S. hurries up to disclose its aggressive plots which will also include Syria and Iran. Resorting to accusing Russia of offering military aid to Iraq makes it apparent that the world verges on a third world war, or, according to a Russian parliamentarian: "We live now in almost the harbingers of a third world war."
Protecting the Russian interests in post-war Iraq, especially as President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov have articulately explained more than once that Russia has important interests in Iraq now and in the future.
However, Primakov explicitly told Saddam about this matter, even though it was not an easy one despite the friendly relations between Primakov and Saddam since the Soviet era when Primakov was former Soviet Union president Mikhail Gorbachev's envoy to Saddam Hussein to convince him of the military withdrawal from Kuwait and saving the Iraqi people, but the U.S.-led war machine imposed the withdrawal and sanctions for over ten years on Iraq.
Former chief of the national economic security body in the first main administration of the Russian intelligence spoke about the American aggression on Iraq. He said that what is going on now is not meant to promote democracy nor to make life go smoothly regardless of the U.S. efforts to promote such allegations. They speak about changing the regime in Baghdad. After such change, Iraq will be, then, ruled by a puppet government. Undoubtedly, it would be incapable of controlling the country without Western protection just as the case in Afghanistan.
Although the U.S. assault on Afghanistan was meant to eliminate Taliban, the real goal was its neighboring country - China. The Western military forces in Afghanistan seemed to have determined the borders on which China could extend its influence.
SAUDI BUSINESSMEN: READY TO COMPETE FOR RECONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS IN IRAQ
He added that British and US companies should not be let alone in that field, pointing out that Saudi businessmen should take well-studied and planned moves to win some of these contracts to "reconstruct a neighbour Arab country whose people would welcome us more than anybody else."
However, he said, US companies might depend on some Saudi businesses to provide their needs because of joint relations.
Al Azhar and Islamic Research Academy scholars' stance on that war goes in parallel with the Christian position declared by both Pope John Paul II and Pope Shenouda III, Tantawi said. Both stances are opposed to war and are calling for peace, tolerance and reconciliation, he added.
Jihad includes self-sacrifice, money-sacrifice and anything anybody can do to help what is right, Tantawi said in the conference.
When asked about the Palestinian cause, Tantawi said that the Palestinians should continue defending their rights by all available means and the UN should help them through subjecting Israel to its resolutions and forcing it to comply with them, otherwise, he went on, it could lose its powers as an international organization that has binding resolutions.
Deputy chairman of the institution, counsellor Ibrahim Bomelha told journalists yesterday that the aim behind the charity campaign was to help the Iraqi people in their distress and provide them, especially children, women and the old, with aid and basic needs.
On the contrary, the Jordanian-Iraqi crossing point witnesses the crossing of Iraqis heading back to their country, which baffled Jordanian observers. While international organisations had not reported even a single case of Iraqi refugee until yesterday afternoon, the official Jordanian records said around 500 Iraqi citizens at least crossed the Jordanian-Iraqi borders heading towards Baghdad in a bewildering behaviour that needs much explanation. Among those returnees are five Iraqi diplomats who quickly and "happily" left, to quote in the words of the Iraqi embassy spokesman in Amman Gawad Al-Hamad while speaking about a Jordanian decision that five Iraqi diplomats should leave Jordan.
It has been noticeable so far that big quantities of fresh meals have found no people to eat them near the Jordanian-Iraqi borders. Some of those who are there for whom the meals were not originally prepared get the meals free of charge now so that suppliers may not bear the cost of returning them to Amman.
It seems that foreign reporters know they have nothing to do in eastern Jordan for the Iraqis move in the opposite direction heading to Iraq and the people there are only truck drivers and customs and relief workers and there is no real way to know what happens outside the borderline.
Some local press expressions also entered the circle of fun. Arabs Today local newspaper carried on its front-page yesterday a word of advice to US President George W. Bush saying that he should receive lessons in geography due to his statements in which he said war would last longer because Iraq is a vast and "very rugged" country. The newspaper mentioned that Iraq is a plain and open country rather than mountainous and rugged, which requires that lessons in geography should be given to the ignorant president.
For his part, Dr Ahmed Mahmoud, the researcher at Cairo University and supervisor of the survey, said that excluding Maspero from the competition was not a surprise as there were former indications that confirmed that. At the last months, Maspero's following up of events was very poor.
Within the framework of increasing Egyptian efforts to support the Iraqi people, whether through invocation in prayers or internet, Alexandria University students have devised a new method to support the Iraqi people. This step is part of a project entitled "Wipe the Tears of Baghdad" which comes within a series of "wrath panorama projects" to support the Iraqi people. The idea in a nutshell is to call any random Iraqi phone number and talk to its owner to encourage him to face his distress and tell him that all Muslims are bolstering him and all the Iraqi people.
They also noted how happy the Iraqis are due to this good step that shows inter-Arab and Muslims cooperation at the time of distress.
Some others volunteered to transfer the idea outside Egypt through inquiring about the way how to make international calls to Iraq from different Arab and foreign cities.
She explains her experience saying "God is Greater... my whole body was trembling" due to her attempt to wipe the tears of an Iraqi citizen.
Naser wondered, "Who is speaking and how did you know the number?".
The Egyptian young lady Akdar says that her four-member family and she called four Iraqi families.
The idea of calling the Iraqi people came to be the most modern method of Jihad via phone.
2- "Calling Iraq and its poor people in order to encourage them. This, however, must be done in a reverse way, in other words calling random phone numbers in the USA and calmly telling them that their sons are dying in the Iraqi desert in a free holocaust in order for the masters of the White House to enjoy Oil and for the sake of Israel.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher expressed his country's rejection of America appointing an American general to govern post-Saddam Iraq and repeating the post-World War II Japan example.
Al-Fiqi warned Saddam Hussein against using weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in his war against coalition forces because such an act would be naive that would make him lose wide international sympathy and make the war against him legitimate.
I call for a new regional system that brings Israel to account after we let it go monstrous for the last 50 years."

He said, "Everybody must understand that our defence and support of the Muslim people of Iraq should not mean the Iraqi regime but rather the Islamic people, land, nation and sanctities and mosques where Allah's name is often mentioned. He went on to say that "The unarmed people of Iraq are standing against America and its allies' tyranny and, through faith, stubbornness and steadfastness can, God Willing, repel the aggressors. This means that any faithful people who believe in their right and sacrifice for their freedom can face oppression and tyranny.
The elections of the ruling party units and grassroots in villages and districts resulted in most old leaderships retaining their positions.
ISRAEL ATTACKS SHAABAN ABDEL-REHIM
The song refers to the fact that disarming weapons of mass destruction in "something good" but not in Iraq as inspection teams did not prove that it has such weapons, rather in Israel which possesses such weapons and whose soldiers kill the old and the young in Palestine without any consideration to the international community. If, moreover, talks about the tragedy which the Arabs started to live since the September 11th incidents in New York and Washington and about the Arab leaders failure to unanimously agree on unified resolutions owing to the surrounding changes.
The harbingers of this world war are represented in the ongoing war behind the scenes undergone by the three intelligence bodies of America, Britain and Russia in order to get the archive of documents of the Iraqi State, the Iraqi intelligence documents in and outside the country, and the Baath Party's documents.
Determining to what extent Saddam's regime has financed Russian political movements and parties.
Anyway, it was announced that Primakov's visit to Iraq in February 2003 was meant to convince Saddam to cooperate with the UN. So, the visit was meagerly covered by the media amid different interpretations and speculations.
Following Iraq, the U.S. will try to change the ruling regime in Saudi Arabia. However, the events will likely develop and take another course of action peacefully.
Consequently, the U.S. exerted its efforts to install "the Western rule" in Afghanistan as if the matter was to draw geopolitical interests.
Many Saudi businessmen said they were ready to compete with American and British companies for juicy contracts of reconstructing Iraq once was over. Other Saudi economists, however, were of the view of the necessity of forming a Saudi bloc and not moving individually to win these contracts.
Moreover, Head of Saudi Export Development Center Dr. Abdul Rahman Zamil pointed out that the geographical location of the kingdom, adjacent to Iraq, nominated it to be a preferable supplier of construction materials, foodstuffs and Iraqi market needs. Thus, the kingdom has a good chance to participate and win some reconstruction contracts.
When Iraqi money comes back home from abroad in post-war stage, he expected, Saudi businesses could stand much better chances of signing contracts with Iraqi partners in the medium range because the Saudi market is very close to the Iraqi one.
Tantawi said in a press conference held yesterday (April 5th) and attended by a constellation of foreign and Arab correspondents and reporters that Al Azhar never opposed those willing to fly to Iraq to help the Iraqi people, noting that doors of Jihad were open.
Asked about "martyrdom" operations targeting American targets in Iraq, the Grand Imam said, "Whoever blows himself up against the aggressor is a martyr."
Tantawi pointed out that the Palestinian people should be confident of God's victory, pointing out that responsibility for the present goings-on is borne by the Islamic world including rulers and Muslim scholars, everybody within his role and competence.
He said that before the war the institution had stored large quantities of dates in Iraqi mosques. About 500 tons of dates and 100 tons of medicine were stored in order to help the Iraqi people in case the war was aggravated.
Relief organisations had heavy presence in border areas with Iraq hoping to get cases of large number of emigrants, which has not taken place, to the surprise of these organisations along with the Jordanian authorities and hundreds of resident media men who hope to conduct interviews with supposed Iraqi refugees.
The absence of Iraqi refugees seems to have caused a professional catastrophe to more than 1200 foreign, Arab, and local reporters who gathered in Al-Rewaishid border area to prepare tens of media programs about the refugees and their problems. They started to suffer from ennui because no Iraqi refugees have come and the authorities only allow them to see ordinary things in the area.
Therefore, foreign reporters find nothing but boredom, which pushed them to intensively gather to attend conferences by Jordanian officials where the same anti-war political clichés are repeated that the Jordanian borders play no role in the operations against Iraq. Those reporters sit for hours in hotel lobbies and have tours among Iraqis in Amman and most of them feel that their information about what is going on is not more than that of an ordinary citizen.
THREE POUNDS FOR WATCHING WAR IN CAIRO CAFES
Maspero's adoption of the American point of view in many issues, especially that of the Iraqi crisis is one of the main reasons that made it lose its popularity, Mahmoud added, pointing out that the Egyptian TV viewers were disappointed when it broadcast a series of programs about the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
The new idea presented by the students via their website has proved a great success with their Egyptian relatives, who are searching for any means to support their brethren Iraqi people. They asked that that idea be generalized through electronic forums. This thought was adopted by many websites, which opened dialogue for it. The result was amazing.

Another young lady called Mariam said that she succeeded in calling Baghdad after she had failed many times. She added, "I cannot describe to you the sincere feelings of the householder of the Iraqi family whom I talked to. He invoked blessing for me even more than I did for him. My tears betrayed me more than once when I was talking to him.
He quickly replied, "I'm an Egyptian and we here call random numbers to tell you that you are our brothers and we would never let you down. We will always pray for you and boycott your enemies.
"All of them expressed their happiness and surprise, emphasizing that their morale is high and asked us to sincerely and continuously pray for them. They told us they knew that our feelings were genuine and they were never angry about our stance," Akdar added.

The last of those calls was a message from a group of young people calling for escalating electronic Jihad. They said, "Dear members of Arab and Islamic e-mail groups it is necessary to coordinate efforts, unify powers and work together to uphold our poor brothers in Iraq and defeat the crusade criminal Anglo-American force." The new idea presents the following proposals:
This must be put in an easy, clear and brief English. Those who do not know English well, should read a text of a set of texts. We must ask them to watch a specific website or satellite channel in a bid to break the blackout of American disinformation offices."
This idea is not applicable for Iraq or its people because it was not defeated in World War II like Japan and because circumstances were totally different in both cases.
In a symposium at the Faculty of Economics and Political Science, Al-Fiqui rejected any criticism to be directed to the Iraqi regime now. He said that this would be "immoral" and would be considered in support of the aggression.
He set conditions for Israel to join that fresh regional system including reaching a just and comprehensive settlement for the Arab-Israeli conflict and subjecting all its nuclear establishments to international supervision and control.
He added that the present American Administration aimed at "crushing Muslims and seizing their fortunes and lands."
He added that Muslim Brotherhood expressed concern over the fate which has befallen everybody but regrettably no response was give by the governments to such sincere counseling. Instead they declared war on Muslim Brotherhood.
According to the reports received by the ruling party general secretariat, headed by Minister of Information, Safwat Al Sherif, the fact that the old cadres succeeded in retaining their positions points out their effectiveness with the masses.
Lots of the Israelis attacked the Egyptian pop singer, Shaaban Abdel-Rahim due to his new song "hitting Iraq". In his song he calls on the UN and the international community to necessarily look to Israel that possesses weapons of mass destruction, emphasizing that Iraq is void of such weapons.
In his article, the Israeli writer stressed the "naivety" of the Egyptian singer who, according to him, finds no difference between Sharon and Barak in his song "I hate Israel" of which he sold 15 million copies until now. however, he then described him as intelligent in dealing with some phrases that "tackles the fancy of the tense Arab street" when he described Bush as the leader of the Axis of Evil and Sharon as sitting in a Jacuzzi with Arabs blood dripping around him like rain.
A Russian newspaper points out that there are still Russian diplomats in Baghdad despite war dangers with the target of completing an important accomplishment carried out by some agents of the Russian intelligence with their Iraqi counterparts in Baghdad. This task is meant to obtain the secret documents of Saddam Hussein to protect and safeguard them so that his enemies could not get access to them in case the ruling regime in Iraq is endangered. The Russian intelligence men are keen on maintaining their relations with the Iraqi public and military intelligence alike.
The Russian intelligence body getting access to the activities of the Iraqi agents and their activities in other countries.
Some make it likely that the Iraqi side will choose Russia if the situation worsens in order to safeguard such documents no matter the price would be especially as the Russian intelligence maintains close relations with Baghdad and because the Russian leadership defends Iraq and is opposed to the military campaign on it out of a Russian strategic perspective.
The next goal, which is considered the most serious to the Americans, may be Iran, as the U.S. seeks to solve the very strategic tasks given the fact that the oil reserve decreases worldwide, he pointed out.
China now is exerting growing pressure on Kirghizia where there is an American military base. Why, then, do the Americans need military bases in Kirghizia, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan? It seems that such a step means nothing after its control of Afghanistan.
Saudi firms are expected to win some reconstruction contracts and practically participate in reconstruction, an official with Jeddah Trade and Industry Chamber said.
There is a growing sense of unease haunting countries about US's trial to corner and control the Iraqi reconstruction market, he concluded.
WHOEVER SETS HIMSELF OFF AGAINST ENEMY-RANKS IS A MARTYR TANTAWI
There is a big difference between Jihad and terrorism, he said, as Jihad was legitimized in Islam to defend soul, homeland, abode, liberty, humanity and legal values. It was also legitimized to help the oppressed to get their rights.
All wise men should stand by the aggrieved party until it takes its rights.
ISRAELI-AMERICAN "DEAL" TO ANNOUNCE "ROAD MAP"
The fourth phase provides for holding an international peace conference, which France proposes to hold it with a view to helping establish the "brave men peace", while the announcement of the Palestinian State represents the final stage of the peace process.
Sudanese President Omar Bashir gave green light to the army to crush the "military rebellion" in Darfur provinces in western Sudan. He said Khartoum would not negotiate with those who carried arms in Darfur and revolted against the State authority and law.
The U.S. embassy in Cairo received from Washington a few days ago a list of 500 Egyptians who volunteered to fight with Iraq. The list includes also the detainees and those who have been killed, U.S. diplomatic sources told Asharq Al-Awsat.
Concerning the number of those who were killed, he pointed out that the authorities were collecting data from the Egyptian embassies in Baghdad, Qatar, Kuwait, the U.S. and London and all bodies concerned.
On the other hand, some experts ruled out the possibilities of carrying out such a project or linking it to the conditions of the termination of the Arab-Israeli conflict and finding a final solution to the Palestinian issue.
A New Pact Professor of International Relations and head of Political Science Department, Suez Canal University, Dr. Gamal Zahran agreed with the above-mentioned argument, adding that the revival of the project would be tantamount to the establishment of a new American-controlled pact, under a new Iraqi leadership both the form and policies of which were being prepared for by the Jewish American military governor Jay Garner. Such a leadership will then be beholden to the Americans and the Israelis and would act like a thorn in the region. Such a pact will try to lead the Gulf states and drag Egypt within the framework of remapping the region, which, according to Dr. Zahran, is reminiscent of the old Baghdad pact.
What happened in Iraq will always haunt us and disturb both our present and past, reminding us of our defects and of the fact that what happened should be blamed on our own dissention, disputes and selfishness. It will bear witness to our weak sense of belonging or loyalty to our nationalism and lack of sincerity to our next o kin.
In order to avoid what happened, we should learn the lesson, reconsider our positions and believe that unity leads to strength and adhere to God Almighty's words, "And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allah (i.e. this Quran), and be not divided among yourselves".
JEWISH RELIGIOUS OPINION: IRAQ PART OF GREATER ISRAEL!
NO COMPARISON BETWEEN SYRIA, IRAQ: BAZ
To target Arab countries one by one will shake the U.S. image in the eyes of Arab citizens, he said.
Under the above banner headline, amongst others, the opposition daily carried its front-page top story on the ongoing campaign against Syria. The following are the most important extracts of the story: U.S., British and Israeli accusations against Syria escalated on Monday in a bid to drag Damascus' feet in the Iraqi issue as a prelude to launching aggression on it.

EGYPTIAN INTELLECTUALS EMBARK ON DEMOCRATIC REFORM PROGRAM
A paper declared a few days ago suggested setting up the new national project on the backdrop of the new "colonial assault on Iraq that targeted the whole of the Arab world on phased-out stages". "That's why a fresh Arab and national project should be put on the table that takes into consideration the points of weakness," the paper said. The paper comprised ten points, mainly including "decrying the American colonial invasion of Iraq, supporting the legitimate rights of the Palestinian and Iraqi people to struggle to get independent, carrying out constitutional, political and legislative reform programs in Egypt based on boosting the concepts of enlightenment and rationality to build a civil democratic state and achieve a social reform to ensure a new start for the national movement."

Turkey seeks to boost economic relations and trade exchange with Egypt and raise the ceiling of dealings up to one billion dollars annually, i.e. more than twice as much as its current volume, said Turkish State Minister for Foreign Trade. It is unreasonable for Turkey to have meager economic and trade relations with a major country like Egypt that has much potential whether in terms of raw materials, investment opportunities or its consumption market, he said. He added that his recent visit to Egypt two weeks before, during which he was accompanied by a number of Turkish government officials, was a success. The Turkish government officials felt comfortable on such a visit and underlined the necessity of putting its results into effect, he added.
There are also the Egyptian marble, which competes with Italian; marble ceramics, whose industry has progressed in Egypt, in addition to natural gas of which the Egyptian fields produce good kinds, not to mention its huge reserves in Egypt, which is considered very near to Turkey, which can import it in the future, the minister said.

In a related development, three American pharmaceutical companies in Egypt hinted that they would suspend their fresh investments until a suitable solution is found to the problem of medicine pricing and the pegged prices that have existed for some time in spite of the increase in dollar rate of exchange. The three companies as well as other companies called for necessarily increasing the medicine prices so as to make up for the rise of costs and prices of imported input. On the other hand, the Egyptian government is still insistent on the current pricing system in order to protect the bulk of Egyptian people against the high increase in medicine prices. Director of the Economic Department in the US Chamber of Commerce in Cairo Khalid Sweilam said some 55 US companies in Egypt informed Prime Minister Atef Ebeid of the main problems they faced owing to the economic recession slowness and the instability of exchange rates despite the significant measure taken to deregulate such a market.

IRON PRICE PER TON UP 1100 POUNDS IN ONE MONTH
Reinforcing iron manufacturers warned that such industry, whose investments are over 25 billion pounds, is facing a crisis due to such exorbitant rises in the production cost. This means that the product will be provided at a price exceeding the imported one by 25 percent, thus facing stagnation and recession especially as banks refrain from opening documentary credits for importing billet. This will make the procurement of foreign exchange a very difficult task.
$1 BILLION TO SET UP 3 POWER STATIONS
The studies of setting up a new power station at Oyoon Moussa area have been finished to face the growing future loads of South Sinai governorate, Awadh said, pointing out that the Holding Company is currently developing and updating the control, protection and measuring devices of Ataka power station with a 17-million-dollar grant from the USAID in addition to other 6 million pounds that represent domestic components.

Egypt's exports to Jordan hit the highest rise at a rate of 38% valued at 92 million dollars, it added. Libya and Syria were on top of the countries exporting to Egypt at a value standing at 74 million dollars or 53% of the total imports from such countries, it said.
Minister of Electricity and Energy Dr. Hassan Yunis stressed that that project was considered an important step to back electric connection as well as cooperation and integration between the two sisterly countries not to mention boosting bilateral relations, on which both presidents Hosni Mubarak and Colonel Gaddafi are keen.
The contract term is 30 months including linkage of the Libyan grid to the super voltage grids in Egypt which are connected with the Arab Masherq countries grid and Tunisian grid that is, in turn, connected with the Arab Maghreb and Europe grids, he added pointing out that this qualifies it to exchange power easily with those grids.

The two parties will consider this initiative together with the economic positions resulting from the war repercussions.
Abul-Qumsan described the raising of the Saudi ban imposed on the Egyptian meat exports as partial and confined to deer and sheep meat according to certain conditions relating to specifications and validity certificates and the means of exportation.

The U.S. embassy in Cairo received from Washington a few days ago a list of 500 Egyptians who volunteered to fight with Iraq. The list includes also the detainees and those who have been killed, U.S. diplomatic sources told Asharq Al-Awsat.
Concerning the number of those who were killed, he pointed out that the authorities were collecting data from the Egyptian embassies in Baghdad, Qatar, Kuwait, the U.S. and London and all bodies concerned.
On the other hand, some experts ruled out the possibilities of carrying out such a project or linking it to the conditions of the termination of the Arab-Israeli conflict and finding a final solution to the Palestinian issue.
A New Pact Professor of International Relations and head of Political Science Department, Suez Canal University, Dr. Gamal Zahran agreed with the above-mentioned argument, adding that the revival of the project would be tantamount to the establishment of a new American-controlled pact, under a new Iraqi leadership both the form and policies of which were being prepared for by the Jewish American military governor Jay Garner. Such a leadership will then be beholden to the Americans and the Israelis and would act like a thorn in the region. Such a pact will try to lead the Gulf states and drag Egypt within the framework of remapping the region, which, according to Dr. Zahran, is reminiscent of the old Baghdad pact.
What happened in Iraq will always haunt us and disturb both our present and past, reminding us of our defects and of the fact that what happened should be blamed on our own dissention, disputes and selfishness. It will bear witness to our weak sense of belonging or loyalty to our nationalism and lack of sincerity to our next o kin.
In order to avoid what happened, we should learn the lesson, reconsider our positions and believe that unity leads to strength and adhere to God Almighty's words, "And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allah (i.e. this Quran), and be not divided among yourselves".

The debate, which started during the committee's discussion of the new banking law, triggered a heated argument.
"This was an unnecessary measure that denied access to this job to competent bankers and financiers who may be more worthy of this position," he pointed out.

CUSTOMS DOLLAR UP TO 575 PIASTERS
The final formula of the trade agreement between Egypt and Russia was approved yesterday.

The price of billet, which is required for the iron industry, hiked by 100% due to the 40% rise of the U.S. dollar rate of exchange in customs outlets and the 60% increase in ore iron prices worldwide.
"The problem lies in the exorbitant rise in the billet prices, which reached 280 dollars per ton, an increase of 100 dollars against the previous prices before the unprecedented rise of the dollar rate of exchange against the pound. This increased the billet price by approximately 50%. The overburdened plants, consequently, increased the price per ton of iron and decreased their production capacities by about 35 and 65 percent due to inability to import more raw materials to meet the domestic demand because of the high cost," said Khalid Al-Borini, an iron factory owner.
The urgent drive of the electricity sector includes the construction of many new power stations, which will start operation by 2005, said Minister of Electricity Dr. Hassan Yunis.

Even though the commercial and economic official contacts between Egypt and Saudi Arabia are very slow as a result of the war conditions and the predominance of political coordination, Egyptian exports to Saudi Arabia increased remarkably, stated a report issued by Ministry of Foreign trade. This is in spite of the fact that the Higher Joint Committee between both countries that was decided to be held during last March was put on the back burner and businessmen's visits between both countries went down as a result of the strict security measures in both countries' consulates which resulted in canceling many trade occasions and international fairs lately in Saudi Arabia. The report added that among the most important exports were food stuffs, fruits, nectar and dairy. Saudi companies, the report continued, signed huge supply contracts to deliver them to the forces that are in the Gulf via Kuwaiti distribution companies. Egyptian exports got a competitive edge versus the exports of South Asian countries where their costs of insurance and freight to Saudi Arabia surged up, thus resulting in decreasing their exports to it and canceling their contracts with it.

The specialized sectors of the two countries are devoting themselves to considering current positions in order to put an end to such matters, thus realizing the interests of the two parties in the light of commitment to Arab and international agreements that organize trade exchange, he pointed out.
Through cooperation between such companies and the Anti-Subsidy and Dumping Body such a problem will be solved according to the rules applied in such a field, Fawzi pointed out.
The medium goal of such a policy, however, is represented in the level of local liquidity.
Al-Shafie added that financing the state budget deficit had been included on the list of the CBE duties as it had to find out mechanisms to meet the needs of the budget. That is why it has devised the "key dealers" system in government bonds market, which will be launched after the unified banking act becomes valid shortly.

This urged minister of Electricity Dr. Yunis to convene an urgent meeting last Saturday evening with chairmen of distribution companies after his arrival from Libya. He stressed taking effective actions to ensure collecting those dues.

The volume of pays and wages totaled 38.5 billion pounds. In addition, some 18.2 billion pounds were earmarked for social insurance and pensioners. The new budget also pegged prices of basic and necessary commodities, though they are high at international level despite and differentials in the rate of exchange. 8 billion pounds were allotted as direct subsidy to such supply commodities as sugar, tea, cooking oil, baby milk, low-cost housing, and public transport means in Cairo, Alexandria and other governorates.

Minister of Petroleum, Sameh Fahmi regarded the project as a successful economic model for bilateral cooperation. He pointed out that its importance was due to the contribution of 6 Egyptian-Kuwaiti companies specialized in sheet production, execution of pipelines projects and gas and other oil products transport. The result of the availability of both the product and the market factors would ensure the project's success. He added that the project was important for providing the needs of the Arab gas line (second phase) of the pipelines for transporting Egyptian gas to Jordan.
This is their plan when they want to control local and international markets everywhere, he added.

Private printeries, about 3,000 in number, will be the first to be harmed by such crisis and thousands of workers and their families wait only for a mysterious fate.
150 printeries stopped working due to such high prices, now that they failed to face the losses ensuing from the high cost of implementing their contracts prior to the price advance.
He added, "Before we call on the government to adjust the tenders prices, we stressed the necessity of paying off the printeries' arrears due on the government, especially as some of such arrears date back to three years ago." If such dues were repaid to the printeries, they could fulfill the current contracts and make up for part of the expected losses, he pointed out. But alas nobody replied, said Baghdadi.

He emphasized that the new national programme would include some social elements, which was one of the goals of the European partnership with Egypt.
The memo pointed out that such decision runs counter to the measures and steps carried out by Egypt to qualify its economy to set a joint Egyptian-European partnership in the framework of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation. This cooperation aims to establish a Mediterranean European free trade zone, including Egypt, in the coming few years. The application of such decision especially at this time runs counter to the directives of multilateral international commercial relations which aim at setting up a stable system for free trade which is faraway from protective measures which hinder the development of developing countries and prevent them from increasing their shares the international trade and limiting their capabilities to merge into the international trade system, the memo noted.
History, nevertheless, will never forgive Saddam Hussein for being to blame for the establishment of a political regime that seized the destiny of Iraq from 1968 till 2003 and led his people to a serial of devastating wars that wasted their resources and ended up by a sort of personality cult that consecrated despotic practices, obstructed people's development and robbed them of the ability to cope with the age, face its challenges and enjoy its blessings.
Arab regimes, peoples, thinkers, intellectuals, politicians and experts should review the lessons of this historic experiment with all its dimensions.
Furthermore, the Arab countries that offered their lands as military bases for aggression on Iraq hoping that their ruling regimes would be left alone, would eventually find out that they have misunderstood the American policy which values its own interests above any friendship.
In a meeting with a number of Israeli politicians, the US ambassador said the "roadmap" was not suitable so long as the two parties - Israelis and Palestinians - exchanged criticisms and reservations.

SOMALISATION OF IRAQ AND FUTURE OF STABILITY IN ARAB WORLD Under the above heading, Dr. Abdel-Wahab Al-Afandi, a Sudanese writer and researcher based in London, writes to say:
The full laxity of security and dissolution of the state and its institutions call to mind what happened in Somalia after the collapse of the regime of General Siad Beri there. This regime bears resemblance to the regime of Saddam Hussein with regard to its national tendency, expansionist wars, repressive policy (though it does not resemble the internationally unique Iraqi level), and dismantling the structure of the modern state in favour of tribalism.
The collapse of the civil society institutions seems to have been complete as was the collapse of the state and its institutions. Therefore, the proposed re-building strategies now consecrate a return to the pre-state and pre-modern civil society institutions. From Basra to Mosul we find that invaders and countrymen are unanimous that it is necessary to resort to the tribes chieftains and men of religion to restore order and put things right. At the same time, we find the trust of Iraqi people towards each other petered out to the point that everyone prefers invaders to his own countrymen. In Kirkuk, Mosul, and Tikrit, the citizens feel happy about the arrival of American tanks and feel sad when they see Iraqi fellow fighters particularly the Kurds. And it is difficult to blame them for this.
War events pushed nightclub owners to close the doors of most Al Haram area nightclubs except for two, Al Ma'wid (Rendezvous) and Parisiana overlooking Mariotia channel and owned by producer Sultan Kashif, husband of famous belly dancer Lucy. Lucy has earlier advised her husband to shut the nightclub due to war circumstances.
Side by side, the state of recession witnessed by nightclubs and hotels moved to low-cost ferries, which sail across the river with poor lovers onboard. Ferries docked on the banks of the River Nile that sail along the river for only LE5 also were affected by this state. These ferries have always been a Mecca for young lovers. Now, passersby can notice these ferries laying down on the river whereas their owners are looking for customers.
I revoked my engagement with one of my relatives after I made up my mind that the current time was the right time for fighting Jihad and not making romantic relationships.

He added, that was why they had taken united steps to square up to the aggression fallout fortify the internal front and render effective all forces to block American and Israeli plans for our region.
We should take these threats into consideration as warnings of a hostile nature and ill will, he concluded.
Much to the attendees' surprise, Abdel-Shafi laid it bare that a small part of the PNA 2003 budget was allocated to the service ministries of Health, Education, Social Affairs, Manpower and Agriculture, while the PNA chairman's office was given 74 million U.S. dollars, or 7 percent, of the budget, down 5 million U.S. dollars compared to the 2002 budget's 97-million-dollar allocations.

The deputy wondered why do the US Department of State protested against Al Azhar at a time when all the Egyptian political and religious forces including the Egyptian church denounced the war on Iraq? Such forces are not more patriotic than Al Azhar, he made it certain.
Lentos, who arrived in Damascus on Friday evening, said the Syrian forces deployed in Lebanon should withdraw, terming the control of Hizbullah of the Lebanese-Israeli border as "unacceptable".

Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh said that 'treason' was behind Baghdad's tragedy. Moreover, he castigated the history of coups in the Arab world, calling on Arab leaders to 'learn the lesson' of war in Iraq. He also criticized the Arab people for placing their rulers on a 'pedestal'.
He, furthermore, did not rule out the possibility of forming a coalition government as an 'inevitable' option in case no party achieved the required absolute majority.
Shura Council Speaker in Islamic Action Front, Abdel Latif Arabiyat told Al-Hayat that the serious developments in Iraq and Palestine and the fears of their implications on Jordan had pressurized the Islamic movement, thus forcing it to rise to the national responsibility of contesting the elections as the whole region has become prone to American threats and have, therefore, to face the challenge of Washington's schemes against the Arab and the Islamic nations.
The relation between Islamists and the government has witnessed aggravating tension since 1999 when the Jordanian authorities removed four key figures in Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), arrested some key figures of the group and passed laws that cut to size its presence in municipality councils and university student unions.
Islamists had accused the authorities of taking illegal measures against them in 1989 and 1997 elections and ascribed the failure of some of their candidates to win the elections to election results rigging.
Olwi called for making contacts and establishing relations with those scientists to draw upon their expertise in development.
He said that before the war the institution had stored large quantities of dates in Iraqi mosques. About 500 tons of dates and 100 tons of medicine were stored in order to help the Iraqi people in case the war was aggravated.
Relief organisations had heavy presence in border areas with Iraq hoping to get cases of large number of emigrants, which has not taken place, to the surprise of these organisations along with the Jordanian authorities and hundreds of resident media men who hope to conduct interviews with supposed Iraqi refugees.
The absence of Iraqi refugees seems to have caused a professional catastrophe to more than 1200 foreign, Arab, and local reporters who gathered in Al-Rewaishid border area to prepare tens of media programs about the refugees and their problems. They started to suffer from ennui because no Iraqi refugees have come and the authorities only allow them to see ordinary things in the area.
Therefore, foreign reporters find nothing but boredom, which pushed them to intensively gather to attend conferences by Jordanian officials where the same anti-war political clichés are repeated that the Jordanian borders play no role in the operations against Iraq. Those reporters sit for hours in hotel lobbies and have tours among Iraqis in Amman and most of them feel that their information about what is going on is not more than that of an ordinary citizen.

Maspero's adoption of the American point of view in many issues, especially that of the Iraqi crisis is one of the main reasons that made it lose its popularity, Mahmoud added, pointing out that the Egyptian TV viewers were disappointed when it broadcast a series of programs about the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
JIHAD VIA PHONE IN SOLIDARITY WITH IRAQI PEOPLE
Many Egyptians had called Iraqi people through haphazard numbers and talked to them and noticed that their morale is very high and that Iraqis insist on victory.
Calls made by some Egyptians uncovered a state of extraordinary solidarity. Some families started to call the Iraqis to boost their morale and pray for them.
Noura, for example, said that she had called the random number 0096414432642 in Iraq and a father of an Iraqi family replied to her.
Another one who calls himself "A Muslim who loves Islam very much" says that he succeeded in calling Iraq and an Iraqi youth called Naser answered him.
You must fight in faith not as to sacrifice for anyone."
Some Muslim youths had used that idea during Aqsa uprising in Palestine and started to direct young people to call certain numbers. The revenues of those calls are allocated to back the Iraqi people or to enhance other medical and social projects.
Ordinary mail addresses should be obtained as well in order to send them the pictures of rotten corpses of their sons so as not to think again of desecrating the Islamic world countries."
IKHWAN DEPUTIES ANGRY ABOUT EDUCATION MINISTER'S CRITICISM OF KATATIB
"Does the minister know that there are 7000 Katatib supported by the State budget and supervised by the Ministry of Wakfs and that there are more than 7000 others supervised by Al-Azhar Affairs Department in accordance with law?" he said. There are other thousands of Katatib that do not have subsidy from the government, said Laban, adding that it is not logical that the minister would defend himself in the case of illiteracy aggravation ascribing it to Katatib and threaten their closing down while they are the biggest help in erasing illiteracy in the country.
Consequently, Egypt categorically rejected that idea, he said.
"I don't defend that "blood-stained" regime due to all its bad record and the catastrophes it has caused for the region and its peoples," he said. "However, I'm against the brutality and genocide that our brotherly Iraqi people are being exposed to."
Talking about the Egyptian regional role in formulating the prospects of the region, Al-Fiqi called upon Egypt to formulate a new role that is based on educational, democratic and political reform model after Egypt lost its pioneering role in different fields especially education.
In a message he addressed to Muslim Brotherhood, Al-Hudhaibi hailed a fatwa (religious opinion) passed by Al-Azhar two weeks ago regarding Jihad (holy struggle) as an obligation upon Muslims in support of the Iraqi people and to repel aggression.
If those rulers had listened to Muslim Brotherhood's opinion and prepared their peoples for Jihad and brought them up on faith and sacrifice, the Jews would never have thought of sweeping Palestine nor would America have acted so preposterously nor would it have threatened the world, especially the Arab and Islamic worlds or tampered with its destiny and future, killing and capturing, detaining and torturing at will. It is America, after all, that now backs Zionism in Palestine and declares war on Iraq's Muslim unarmed people.
The elections were held in 6700 party units nationwide and ended yesterday after a span of 6 days to renew 25% of the members of those committees in accordance with the party's new constitution.

According to some sources, military leaders from the third battalion of American Marines led by Marcos expressed fears of the ferocious resistance shown by the Son of the Nile brigade. According to certain data, the brigade's Egyptian commander was one of the heroes of the October 1973 war and headed for Iraq a few years ago.

Many Saudi businessmen said they were ready to compete with American and British companies for juicy contracts of reconstructing Iraq once was over. Other Saudi economists, however, were of the view of the necessity of forming a Saudi bloc and not moving individually to win these contracts.
Moreover, Head of Saudi Export Development Center Dr. Abdul Rahman Zamil pointed out that the geographical location of the kingdom, adjacent to Iraq, nominated it to be a preferable supplier of construction materials, foodstuffs and Iraqi market needs. Thus, the kingdom has a good chance to participate and win some reconstruction contracts.

He added that his recent visit to Egypt two weeks before, during which he was accompanied by a number of Turkish government officials, was a success.

However, 50% indicated that they would only buy products made of Egyptian cotton out of their belief that it is absolutely the best kind of cotton.

EXCHANGE FIRMS SUE CBE

In a related development, three American pharmaceutical companies in Egypt hinted that they would suspend their fresh investments until a suitable solution is found to the problem of medicine pricing and the pegged prices that have existed for some time in spite of the increase in dollar rate of exchange. The three companies as well as other companies called for necessarily increasing the medicine prices so as to make up for the rise of costs and prices of imported input. On the other hand, the Egyptian government is still insistent on the current pricing system in order to protect the bulk of Egyptian people against the high increase in medicine prices.

He confirmed that the expected growth rate for the current fiscal year would not reach the target figure, i.e. 0.3%. Head of Economics Department, Sadat Academy for Management Sciences Dr. Sherif Qassem said that the Egyptian pound did not reach the safe side yet although the exchange deregulation decision has been put into force a long time ago.

It is noteworthy that the year before the USA had postponed discussing the free zone project with Egypt for five times on end under the pretext that Egypt had not fully met conditions as well as the lack of economic legislation and laws, to which recently included stopping financing or any financial remittances to anybody suspected of involvement in terrorist operations, which Egypt has by and large managed to do.
Egypt and Japan are forecast to ink a memo of understanding for cooperation in the construction area next Thursday. The memo is to be signed by Egypt's Arab Contractors and a giant Japanese construction company.
He added that construction works of the building will start next September. The ratio slated to be contributed to by the WB wasn't determined up till now. He hoped that the WB would finance all the project after the confidence it gave to the Ministry of Civil Aviation due to its quick approval of this supply. Regarding using the financial lease system to purchase 12 new Airbuses for EgyptAir, Ahmed Shafik stressed that EgyptAir considered this as the best economical way since it will save millions of dollars.
Egyptian banks received governmental advice to enhance the orientation towards putting forward more euro saving coffers within the framework of a banking policy. That policy aims to encourage dollar holders to transfer their dollar deposits into euro in a bid to raise the supplies of the dollar on the market, decrease its dominance on the exchange market dealings, alleviate pressure on the national currency and protect its current value without any further decline. On the other hand, the unofficial exchange market witnessed a qualitative change during the last few days in the filed of foreign exchange speculations.
Abul-Oyoun confirmed that banks are encouraged to expand spreading the automated teller machines and depending on cards in buying and selling, a thing that will contribute to expedite heading for the implementation of the electronic commerce operations and converting to deal with cards rather than cash.
EGYPT IS THE FOURTH TRADE PARTNER OF US IN MIDDLE EAST
This comes at a time when Egyptian imports from the US declined to $396.07 million from $573.48 million during the same period last year, a retreat of 39.94%, said Zeidan, adding that consequently the trade balance achieved a deficit in favor of Egypt to the value of $154.30 million against $454.24 million during the same period last year, i.e. 66% retreat.
During the ministerial meeting he held yesterday President Hosni Mubarak warned the government against extending grants or rewards from foreign loans allocated for projects.
Mubarak confirmed as well that the competent sector should work out the technical and the financial feasibility study for the project and floating the project in an international or local bid with a view to determining the needed value of the local and the foreign component, Al-Sharef added.
He pointed out that the Japanese market had already started to import Egyptian herbs as the Egyptian Commercial Bureau succeeded in assisting an Egyptian company to conclude a contract for exporting 12 tons of sea herbs to Japan.
In her dialogue with Al-Alam Al-Youm, she also stated that the Government was currently studying the cost of loan guarantees endorsed by the American Congress for Egypt at a volume of $2 billion and comparing them with other borrowing sources available to Egypt with a view to defending the technique of using such guarantees. Meanwhile, she emphasized that that reflected the confidence of the American administration and congress in the strength and soundness of the Egyptian economic policies.
He, then, left Cairo for London where he ran marathonic negotiations with banks through his deputy in Cairo, Magid Fahmi.
TENDENCY TO "RATIONALIZE" DIRECT SUBSIDY OIL PRODUCTS
During his meeting with the committee on industry and energy in the parliament to discuss the draft planning budget for the fiscal year 2003-2004, Fahmi pointed out that the sector abided by ministerial decrees to ban expenditure on some items that do not affect efficient operation or exploitation of resources and emphasize adherence to financial, economic and accountancy criteria and systems capacities which must be applied and the achievement of the highest possible rates of investment in light of the basic commitments of the sector towards the state and the citizens and acting to secure the allocations required for coping with the cost of the projects to train and employ skilled labour through which the petroleum sector contributes to solving the problem of unemployment in Egypt.
EGYPTIAN- TRADE COMPANY TO BE SET UP
The new company is primarily meant to market Egyptian agricultural products in the Commonwealth Independent States (CIS), he added, pointing out that such countries are highly consuming markets.
The reply to such a question has become important not only to know what happened to the Iraqi president and the truth about the rumours that had it that a deal had been arranged for between Washington and the Iraqi leadership by Russian brokery but also for a better understanding of the Iraqi regime's character and opportunistic ideology. We unfortunately responded to such ideology with such credulity and acquiescence that finally ended up with that disastrous collapse and rapid dissolution of the dignity of the state whose national fabric promised such cohesion between various nationalities, creeds and sects that would preclude the collapse, dissipation and chaos that we have seen in Iraqi cities in the last couple of days.
We should, furthermore, admit to the bankruptcy of the Arab political order and should use this event for encouraging opening up to the peoples and bridging the gap that widened due to the lack of political participation and the idea of civil society and its institutions, which may ensure such social cohesion that the dismantlement of societies would not be that easy.
The following are the main questions and answers of the interview:
Q: There has been much talk on Israeli interests in the ongoing war...why?
Q: Does Israel know the real goals of the war on Iraq?
Fiqi: I hope the current situation would be a shock that can give Arab mentality pause for thought.
Egypt may be the least double-faced political character.
It is Egypt which led liberation movements in the 20th century so it should initiate reforms and be more democratic than America.
The recently formed national council for human rights and the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) reform were a good step in this direction.
This should be turned into reality as early as possible or we will have no role to play in the region, taking into consideration substantial changes, mainly including the fact that America has dispensed with its agents and is now dealing with the region in a direct way as they did not offer it what it had expected of them. It is now in the belief that the concept of the state national security has not been restricted to a certain region anymore, while Israel is posing itself as a country that will lead the regional order.
I am against America's policy, but we should accept the fait accompli.
We do not want to get back to the past.
We deal with America in a way that does not mean that we are America's agents. Egypt should have tools needed by America, and have an influence in the region.
America is expected to turn against the UN once war is over.
"It is high time for Iraqis to lead a normal and democratic life," he told reporters in Omm Al-Qasr following his meeting with local leaders, pointing out that Iraq had many educated and cultured people.
Will the World Council of Water supervised by Dr. Mahmoud Abou-Zeid, Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation confront Israeli ambitions? Will the international legitimacy that bans the transport of water outside rivers basins be activated even though such legitimacy utterly failed to prevent the aggression on the Iraqi people?
Globalization of Water: The new international orientations to face water shortage, which the government is trying to adopt and comply with after packaging them with new nomenclature including globalization ideas like the idea of pricing water promoted by international institutions within the framework of economic globilization to serve the interests of certain regional parties like Israel which, according to reports, will suffer from a water shortage in the next few years after the non-renewable subterranean waters that it robs Sinai of and extracts from the Western Bank, according to recent reports of the Arab League.
More than once has Ethiopia said that it does not recognize Egypt's rights to the Nile water as a mouth country and rejected its right to observation along the river course.
WILL MUFTI PRESIDE OVER AL-AZHAR UNIVERSITY?
According to ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) sources, major changes are expected to take place at the partisan, ministerial and parliamentary leadership levels including changes at junior leadership levels in the next few weeks and at senior leadership levels at the beginning of October at most.
Al-Ahali learnt that the identity cards of some favourites of some government leaderships had been withdrawn and their annual validity date was modified from December 31st 2003 to October 31st of the same year.
It is not a secret that 90% of the mosques in Europe and the USA were built with Saudi finance.
This step must rely on a political will that senses the danger resulting from underestimating the importance of pulpits in leading and guiding public opinion. A balance must be stricken in means of self-expression and prevent it from being monopolized by a certain bracket.
ISRAELI COMPANIES PARTICIPATE IN IRAQ RECONSTRUCTION
They pointed out that the revival of such a project would represent an alternative to Russian oil imports which cost exorbitant prices.
Yadiot Aharonot published a report to the effect that Iraqi businessmen had recently submitted a proposal to Israeli bodies to cooperate in implementing building works in Iraq. The official radio said that Iraqi suppliers contacted Israeli agronomists via the Arab Jwish Institute, Beit Pearl near Tel Aviv, in order to help rebabilitate its agriculture.
The city's residents say Saddam used to invite his distinguished guests to hunt deer from in area.
CONFRONTATION BETWEEN EGYPTIAN AND EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTS OVER HUMAN RIGHTS
Sorour rejected the European parliament description of the Christian community in Egypt as a minority, saying the Egyptians (Muslims and Christians) reject any foreign attempt to interfere in their internal affairs.
Chalabi, 57, had worked as a chairman of a Jordanian bank in 1988 before he transferred 300 million U.S. dollars to his personal accounts with Swiss banks in 1990. This sum constituted most of the assets of the bank which collapsed and was liquidated later on, with the Central Bank of Jordan bearing its losses.
Within a framework of humor and the exchange of sarcastic points of view, the water closets in universities and mosques bore witnesses to America's crimes and objections to the leadership's statements. The sarcastic phrases denounced American aggression on Iraq and revealed the psychological repression suffered by the Egyptian people especially university students during the American aggression on Iraq.
Another student wrote " your Majesties and Excellencies Arab heads of state "pshaw".
Another student commented "Yes, I think so, he has been betrayed!"
You are crying for the moon!"
On the wall of a W.C. in Al-Azhar Faculty of Medicine a student wrote " Bush, son of a bitch, Baghdad is Cairo."
In the same bathroom a student drew a long arrow on one of the doors and wrote a remark "please follow the end," where abuses of government policies in Egypt were written.
Another student trying to be optimistic and hopeful wrote a song by Mohamed Munir "Let us dance to your tune as tunes are still possible" At the end of our round, we found a phrase on one of the bathroom walls " Not only did Baghdad fall but all the Arabs fell as well" A female student in Cairo University told us that even female students' bathrooms contained such phrases.
In the girls W.C. of the faculty of commerce a female student wrote "O university male students, it just befits you to frequent discotheques and watch matches while we (females) are up to the fight."
Iranian impediment Although it was alarmed when the Marines tanks rolled into Baghdad announcing its fall, Iran replied to Washington's threat without delay through hinting to its ability to impede the project of occupying Iraq and putting it under American-British mandate.
The source pointed out that Tehran worked out a new policy on the Iraqi file after the US had reneged on its promises to the Iranian-backed Supreme Council of Islamic Revolution in Iraq and after the US President's representative for the Iraqi opposition Zalmay Khalilzad told the supreme council that Washington no longer recognized the quadruple committee formed by the Arbil meeting seeing that events had gone beyond it.
The facts of the current situation show that the Iranians have some cards that could enable them to influence the course of current events inside Iraq.
Therefore, the most important factor of our influence on the future of Iraq is not our cooperation before or during war, but rather the presence of influence factors in Iraq, which make it incumbent upon the US to understand our reasonable role."
Iraqi insiders said the broadcast can be received easily in most Iraqi areas including Baghdad.
Within this framework comes the noticeable promotion of this council and its chairman Mohammad Baqir Al-Hakim and describing him as a legitimate representative of the Iraqi people in the current stage.
The same sources told Al-Majalla that the son of Imam al-Sadr who stands up for the leadership of this trend (Moqtada-23) has reliable popularity in the central and southern cities of Iraq. He has thousands of followers in the capital Baghdad some of whom undertook the administration of (Al-Thowra City) district where more than one million Iraqi Shiite citizens live, after the fall of Saddam's regime. Those followers point out that he gained popularity due to his father who was regarded as a national leader for Iraqis, let alone being a senior Shiite religious authority.
RANTISSI: WE AREN'T IN A POSITION TO EXTEND ASSISTANCE TO IRAQIS TO RESIST AMERICA
WASHINGTON POST: EGYPT HAS HELPED SYRIA TO OWN CHEMICAL WEAPONS
Quoting what it called "sources in American Intelligence bodies" the paper said that Syria had resorted to Egypt for possessing chemical weapons almost 30 years ago within its quest for owning mass destruction weapons to redress the military balance with Israel after the latter managed to develop its nuclear programs. The paper added that late President Assad regarded chemical weapons as the best option for Syria to deter Israel which owned an arsenal of nuclear weapons.
The Muslim Brotherhood believes that the authorities aimed at blaming the group for inciting the masses to demonstrate prior to and during the war on Iraq, which sometimes led to clashes between the police and the demonstrators. However, Muslim Brotherhood participation was confined to officially licensed demonstrations.
WAR ON ARAB LEAGUE!
However, the campaign on the AL role and its inability to activate its charter and the failure to implemented the resolutions taken under its umbrella is one thing, and the exploitation of such a campaign to destroy Arab identity and assassinate the concept of Pan-Arabism and Arab solidarity is quite another thing.
He was able to make the best of the Egyptian foreign ministry's breakthrough as well as Cairo's position for the sake of the joint Arab action of that organization.
The organization monitored the deaths of 9 Egyptians in police stations and the exposure of 29 others to various degrees of torture.
The organization emphasized that the Egyptian government must take a practical step at the level of its international commitments to stop the crime of torture through ratification of the optional protocol annexed to the Torture Combatting Agreement.
"While we're monitoring the developments of the situation in Iraq, we still keep our eyes on the Zionist dangers that threaten our country," he said.
The official warned against the Israeli ideas and goals. They are meant to convert Haifa harbour into Rotterdam of the Middle East at a time when Egypt is striving to convert Sidi Kirir in Alexandria into something like a bourse for selling Gulf crude, he said.
He described such attempts as more dangerous to the Islamic world than nuclear bombs.
He warned against globalization, which aimed, in the first place, at the imposition of Western culture on all cultures and obliterating them especially the Islamic culture regarded by the West as the archenemy of its alleged culture.
The draft bans selling Syria any U.S. products and equipment that can be used in either civilian or military purposes, suspends federal loans or aid to U.S. investment projects in Syria, reduces diplomatic representation between both countries and slims contacts with Syria.
HEZBOLLAH TO BE NEXT U.S. ATTACK TARGET: U.S. OFFICIAL
Democratic senator and presidential candidate Pop Graham said U.S. concerns about Hezbollah should outweigh its concerns about Saddam Hussein as the former poses a more serious menace to the American people!!
ISLAMIC TREND DOMINATES STREETS AND DEMONSTRATES IN BAGHDAD
It seems that a strong Islamic trend started to dominate the street in Baghdad but it needed a leadership to be organized into a political trend that could impose itself on Iraq's political future.
In one of those leaflets, a definition was written of Jay Garner, in charge of the civil administration in Iraq. The definition was entitled, "A Zionist meant to be ruler of Iraq!"
EgyptAir, Egypt's main airline, said it would sell tickets, for domestic or international flights, to Visa Card and Master Card holders by installments provided that these cards be issued from the National Bank of Egypt (NBE).
The agreement also gave Visa Card holders the right to book first-class tickets for the rest of their families.
ABU MAZEN GOVERNMENT
By the same token, the Europeans, Arabs and Americans put pressure on Arafat to make some sort of compromise and this is helpful on one hand and harmful on the other. It is helpful because Abu Mazen would not be able to form a government without this pressure. On the other hand, it is harmful because it links the new government to non-Palestinian partners.
Furthermore, Arafat bucked other names for that post. Asked about their stands on the fresh government under Abu Mazen's premiership, Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders said that the new government was not formed to face Palestinian crises, recover economy, fight corruption and cement national unity.
The new government is a war on the intifada and we cannot be part of this government because it declared war on resistance and we are part of this resistance," they said.
Addressing the People's Assembly yesterday (April 24th), Chairman of Foreign Affairs Committee Dr. Mostafa Al-Fiqi said the United States was leaking untrue pieces of information to cause bedlam in the Egyptian internal front. "We should be on the alert because the Americans want to hit hard the Egyptian and Arab domestic fronts," he opined.
The desire to give further opportunity to extensive partisan representation in the People's Assembly (PA) that will provide some sort of equality among parties was behind the preparation of the new bill. It might be mentioned that the Egyptian political parties had participated in a conference a few years before to discuss the most appropriate election systems that cope with the Egyptian atmosphere, provide large-scale representation by parties in the PA, and make PA members express and adhere to their parties' policies so that discussions in the PA would take place between different political parties' policies. In that conference, all parties decided that the combination between the two systems of the proportional slate and the individual system may be an ideal system on condition that the law articles should be formulated to achieve equality amongst partisan candidates and independents so that no lawsuit would be filed against its constitutionality.
The Ministry of Justice will refer the draft law on elections to the President of the Republic who can issue, in the absence of the parliament, a decree of the new law of which the PA will be notified within fifteen days if the President finds reasons for dissolving the PA and staging fresh elections according to the new law, Al-Mussawar learnt.
Iraqi Opposition parties competed against each other for previous State-owned premises with a view to taking them as their headquarters in different districts of the capital Baghdad. "Surrealistic" scenes were formed of the names of movements and parties covering the front pages of newspapers and facades of buildings, syndicates and social clubs.
The sentence "Barzani is the symbol of freedom" was written on the pictures. The Iraqi National Congress (INC) headed by Ahmed Chalabi possesses the largest number of government headquarters. Chalabi seemed to have strong American support that was reflected in the Iraqi street on some demands written on walls. Such "surrealistic" demands ask Chalabi to put law in force, while Baghdad witnesses a state of unlawfulness.
ISRAEL CUTS MILITARY FORCE
The Americans introduced only 1000 tanks into the Iraqi lands and the majority of these tanks were not used.
Thus, a reasonable cut in Israeli army forces has become possible. Leaked information in that regard reveals that 3,000 jobs would be dispensed with among regulars in the few coming years together with a similar cut among reservists.
The privatization program also includes cutting guarding jobs in several insensitive departments such as the army's radio and stores. Moreover, a number of military factories designed to produce clothes and furniture for the army would be closed and alternative goods would be bought from American plants because the American military assistance to Israel was conditional upon purchasing American goods.
Under this heading, Kuwaiti ex-minister of education and former National Assembly member Ahmed Al-Rabe'i wrote to say:
Iraqis seem to disbelieve what happened; did Saddam fall? Are they dreaming? Is it true that the Iraqis demonstrate in streets and write slogans on walls without being killed?
Don't blame Iraqis for the way they expressed such a state as they have just gone out of a mass grave!
They quoted Israeli Maariv newspaper as saying that such companies had received a number of applications concerning projects for setting up a network for the Internet in Iraq and repairing the communication lines that were destroyed during the war.
Shalom told Annan there were many Israelis of Iraqi origin who can help in many fields such as medicine and training Iraqi experts. The Israeli minister also asked Annan to allow Israel to send aid, including food and medicine, to the Iraqi people.
The European parliament issued a decree urging Egyptian authorities to guarantee the rights of peaceful and collective expression, ban all forms of assaults of demonstrators or detainees and ensure appropriate legal protection for the arrested.
The Egyptian Parliament decree, further blatantly intervened in Egypt's internal affairs by criticizing the judiciary verdicts and by describing the Copts as a minority that must be fully respected and represented in the Egyptian society Arrangements are now underway for holding the Egyptian-South African Higher Committee meetings next July, which will be presided over by the foreign ministers of the two countries. The committee will discuss the activation of the agreements concluded by the two countries and some international and regional issues of common concern.
Since last July, such reports had had contributions from Richard Perle, a keynote hawk in the American administration who had recently resigned as Defence Policies Council head, even though he still draws up such policies.
One of the reports launches an urgent warning to the Saudi ruling House including the following:
The report mentions a set of retributive measures stepping up to the possibility of launching war and toppling and expelling the Saudi regime unless the Kingdom met the warning conditions, which runs counter to all international laws and conventions and might amount to the crime of aggression.
Besides, the report adds, the Saudi House is hated throughout the Arab World owing to corruption, etc...
It is noteworthy that the report, issued last July, had urgently demanded that Saddam Hussein's regime be eliminated and the region's arrangements be then made accordingly.
On Monday, Israeli Maariv newspaper stated that as of next October Israeli travel agencies would organize regular journeys to Iraq for tourism and "Jews Reunion" purposes.
STATEMENT WITH "SADDAMITE PHRASES" PLEDGES TO ESCALATE RESISTANCE AGAINST OCCUPATION
"ROBOCON EGYPT 2003" TO LAUNCH IT SECOND ANNUAL FESTIVAL
KING ABDULLAH APPRECIATES MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD POSITIVE ROLE IN JORDAN
Al-Zonaibat announced that the Shura Council (comprising 50 members), the highest organizational referentiality of the group, would decide next week its position regarding the parliamentary elections, pointing out that the government has showed keenness to hold the elections on time, Shakra said.
Main opposition party leaders ended up moves that took place throughout the last two weeks on divers levels. They decided on Wednesday to submit to President Hosni Mubarak a program for "national salvation", in which they put forward an integrated visualization for the policies required in the coming period.
He added that the program would include a vision of political and democratic reform and the means proposed for tackling social and economic crisis as well as the optimum course of the Egyptian-American and Arab-American relations.
However, we prepare ourselves for the worst in case such context does not consecrate our constants which are all national rather than sectarian ones," he said.
For the first time in the secular Turkish republic's history, the Turkish government, led by the Islamic-oriented Justice and Development Party (JDP), is making ready for putting Islam-based bonds on sale at international markets.
The government has been zeroing in on Arab investment capital, particularly since Arab investors were locked in hardships and difficulties following the September 11th events in the U.S., the Turkish Milliyet (national) daily reported on Friday.
In a lecture he gave in the National Centre for Social and Criminal Researches in Cairo on Thursday, Sorour described those who repeated rumours about immediate PA dissolution as "unpatriotic".
It also enforced all the rulings issued by the Court of Cassation, he said. The dissolution of the PA was not discussed at all. Its formation was constitutionally sound under full judiciary supervision and without interference by the administrative body, he added.
Following the meeting, Moussa said to the journalists, "The AL is open to all Arabs from all orientations and will receive all Iraqi elements and listen to them out of its deep interest in the future of Iraq, which I believe is a common interest for all Iraqis. We are still in the stage of listening and consultation."
Meanwhile, he denied any contacts or consultations by the block of Independents with the USA.
He warned that "a provisional government would be without capacities while the transitional government would be tasked to prepare for the elections and running them, setting up parties, creating a proper political climate and laying down a new constitution so as to set up a legitimate government that would represent all Iraqis.
The expert said he had bought the jewellery from some citizens who looted the palace under the nose of the American soldiers. He, however, did not rule out the possibility that it was the soldiers who had actually sold it to the expert. He refrained from such argument for fear of being arrested and investigated by the commanders of American military police who monitored the soldiers' behaviour.
JORDAN: MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD TO JOIN ELECTIONS
A leading Islamist told Al-Hayat that the participation decision came following a plebiscite among the Islamic Movement grassroots who showed considerable enthusiasm for running the elections. He expected the turnout to be extensive and to cover all constituencies (45 in number).
The number of seats in the Jordanian house of representatives became 110 after the election act was modified last year and when a 6-seat quota for women was approved last month.
Five announcers with the Egyptian TV Channel 7 have lately dressed hijab (Islamic veil) at one scoop, putting the channel off. By taking such a step, they touched the raw nerve of Adel Maati who is in charge of Channel 7.
The veiled young ladies reportedly resorted to Minister of Information Safwat al-Sharif, hoping that he would lend them his hand to obtain their legitimate rights, Al-Quds Al-Arabi daily learnt.
Heba Tayseer wondered why veiled broadcasters are not allowed to appear on the screens even through religious shows, which should not be presented by unveiled announcers.
IRAQ WAR TERMS DOMINATE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL LIFE IN EGYPT
Al-Ahli angry fans, whose team was about to win the football tournament chamionship before its defeat, sarcastically described Al-Ahli players as "Olouj". Some fans of the winner Al-Zamalek wrote on walls in popular districts phrases saying, "Al-Ahli's Olouj were defeated... they are now committing suicide" in an allusion to Al-Sahaf's statements about the defeat of the US forces in front of the gates of Baghdad ahead of his disappearance.
At cafes and fora, Egyptian intellectuals and citizens of the popular districts are often using the same terms of war when they call each other up as a kind of joking, such as "Olouj" and "tarateer" (yes-men). Some of them have been still discussing the meaning of such terms.
Last month, sources continued, in the peak of the aggression on Iraq, and under media blackout, a batch of Jordanian secondary education teachers from different governorates arrived in Israel.
The aim behind such meetings is that Israeli teachers be acquainted with Jordanian counterparts and explain to them the Israeli story from the Israeli viewpoint.
It is worth mentioning that Jordan had recalled its ambassador from Israel in protest against the Israeli brutal practices in the territories occupied in 1967 and maintained the charge de affaires Dr. Mostafa Al-Tel.
There is some sort of consensus that the American presence in Iraq is mere occupation.
There are some indicators from many parties inside and outside Iraq over the necessity of cooperation with the Americans with a view to expediting the formation of an Iraqi national and acceptable government and pushing for the departure of the Americans.
Unreligious political leaders are also divided. Some of them favour the American presence, while others try to maintain enough independence for themselves.
It, consequently, imposed itself on the political equation in Iraq and the whole region.
The Iraqi society is re-putting up the rule question anew and apart from local political dominating forces.
But its presence is illegitimate.
The indicators that are issued successively these days from Iraqi religious authorities in this direction seem to foreshadow an important change in the Iraqi political thought.
A federal state is a declared goal, but separation has not been yet formed as a palpable political formula.
SAIRI leader Ayatollah Mohammad Baqer al-Hakim immediately enunciated willingness to "work with the U.S. and the international community to improve Iraqis' conditions," an apparent bid to rebuff the previous accusation. He also said in Iran, "The Iranian experiment can not be applied to Iraq."
Neither a sheer secular nor a sheer Islamic state is advisable...a sheer Iraqi state is better."
This also stresses these leaders' awareness of the serious stage in Iraq and the requirements of change in vision and priorities.
This coordination, if any, reflects a high degree of awareness among the foes of the past.
So speaking, religious convictions are able to divide people and cause splits.
However, this unity should be preceded by the independence of Iraq from foreign powers as well as local ones regardless of their political or ideological affiliations.
Al Ahram Al-Arabi learnt that the Trade Cooperation Draft Agreement between Egypt and Gulf Cooperation Council would be referred by Egypt to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the coming session meetings of the Egyptian-Saudi Supreme Joint Committee, which had been postponed because of the American war on Iraq.
The work would be participated in by a number of ministers concerned with a variety of spheres.
The plan included raising services prices and laying off thousands of workers in most organisations including the Railway, Public Transport, Post, Drinking Water, Sanitary Drainage, and the organisations affiliated to the Ministry of Housing.
The report pointed out that among these organisations there are 57 organisations that suffer imbalances in their financial structures due to the imbalance between costs and prices set for selling commodity and service products in which they do their activities.
EGYPT FOURTH IN TERMS OF INFLATION RATE
Egypt rose from the seventh to the sixth position because it achieved positive balance for the current account by 0.5 billion dollars annually. Meanwhile, it stopped at the seventh position for five months on end for reporting a deficit in the balance of trade by 7.8 billion dollars.
Concerning the new investment ventures, the number of money investment companies, which were established, went down from 378 companies in January-February 2002 to 365 during the same period this year, the report said. The issued capital of such companies increased from 2.3 billion pounds to 3 billion pounds. The number of individual companies that were registered at the Commercial Record went down from 3260 to 3068. The issued capital of those companies increased from 52.4 million pounds to 64.5 million pounds during the same period.
The association demanded that the credit policies of the agricultural sector should be reconsidered on the basis that this sector has a vital role that would maximise particularly in the near future as a result of several trade agreements signed during the past period. Exports of crops and citrus fruits are expected to increase.
With respect to the local debts, the report said they went up at the end of June last year to 262 billion pounds, a rise of 11% compared with the previous year as the growth rate of treasury bills and bonds amounted to 24.2% thus hitting 166 billion pounds while loans from the National Investment Bank reached 161 billion pounds.
A quick look at the dollar resources would show us that they reported a decline estimated at around 3 billion dollars while the dollar uses went down by about 2 billion dollars, which underlines that the actual deficit is more than one billion dollars, but the changes that took place in the errors and omissions clause negatively and positively affect the final balance of the payment balance, the report said.
According to a recent report by the Central Agency of Mobilization and Statistics, the volume of trade deficit had recorded a remarkable rise in the first 10 months of last year and almost hit LE1 billion thus taking the total up to the equivalent of about 29 billion and LE225 million.
The report indicated the volume of exports of some other products like potato, unmixed aluminum, medicine, marble, carbon and wires.
It pointed out that all obstacles before domestic products should be removed as that played a basic role in raising their costs. Tax rates should primarily be reduced and export-oriented goods should be subsidized. Funds required for using state-of-the-art technology should also be provided so that the domestic product can be developed.
While he attended the forum of Al-Ahram Regional Institution yesterday, Nazif said that the market's, current circumstances were not suitable for the implementation of the project especially as the value of the licence and web in toto hit LE4 billion, a sum that can hardly be restored.
The agreement includes the importation of Russian and Ukrainian wheat through paying half of its price and bartering the other half for Egyptian commodities, said Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Fayza Abul-Naga.
Negotiations with Romania are underway to that effect, as Abul-Naga will head an Egyptian delegation to visit the Romanian capital on Sunday to hold talks to import wheat and boost economic and commercial relations between the two countries.
In press statements following the meeting, Khidr said that the project would be bankrolled through a 40-million-dollar loan from the Islamic Development Bank and another 10-million-dollar loan from the OPEC.
Today, the committee set up by premier Dr. Atef Ebeid is going to complete the preparation of the first unified bill on the foundation of companies in Egypt to replace other laws which are currently valid. This would make all companies in the country subject to a unified legal system in a bid to achieve transparency and clarity in dealing with investors.
He emphasized that it was important that the new law should take care to organize rights and duties. In regard to the procedures the executive statute will undertake that responsibility to avoid the law becoming too voluminous.
It is noteworthy that the authority is currently preparing, in coordination with the Social Fund, for a special law for small industries to give a push to such industries and create job opportunities for solving the problem of unemployment.
Bedroom linen represents 37.8% of such exports, followed by carpets whose exports stand at 28.4%. The study pointed out that China, Pakistan, India, Mexico, Portugal, Turkey, Taiwan, Brazil, Canada and Thailand topped the countries that export upholstery to the USA. Egyptian exports of drapery hiked from 57 million dollars in 1999 to 69.3 million dollars in 2001. Carpet exports topped the list of exports with 63.4% of the total upholstery exports, the study said.
IMPORTERS: CUSTOMS DOLLAR INCREASES 17P.T. EVERY MONTH
He pointed out that some traders were behind the rumour that the virus can transfer via commodities in order to exploit this situation to rise the prices of their stock of Chinese commodities on the domestic market.
The U.S. classification came after the Egyptian exchange asked the U.S. Capital Market Authority to list it among overseas-registered capital markets pursuant to the definition of the Article 902-B of the 1993 securities act in the U.S. , which regulates stock selling and buying operations outside the U.S. market, he added.
83 CRUDE OIL DISCOVERIES AND 44 NATURAL GAS FINDS IN 4 YEARS
Fahmi said that the areas of Eastern Oil Mountain, Edfo, and Saqqara in the Gulf of Suez are among the most important areas of the recent crude oil discoveries.
Saqqara field has been considered to be the biggest crude oil discovery in the country since 1989. Technical studies are now under way for setting the find on the chart of production soon.
The new orientation has been attributed by Nazif to the government wish to have a presence in the mobile market and the inability to construct the new third network due to deteriorating of international market conditions and the political instability in the Middle East, which made well reputed companies refrain from investing in it.

BLACK MARKET FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE EBB AWAY IN EGYPT!
Al-Abyadh thought that the one of the reasons why there were no violent fluctuations in the dollar rates of exchange on the black market was a retreat in imports especially from China due to fears of SARS.
Although the new budget has announced a 25% reduction in government expenses particularly the external missions by as of 1st July next, the gap between uses and revenues still represents a big challenge particularly as the impacts of the American war on Iraq have not yet come to an end.
On the other hand, the Egyptian Parliament's Health Committee meeting yesterday under Dr. Hamdi Al-Sayyed threatened to reject the draft public budget and the economic and social development plan for the fiscal year 2003/2004 on the health and population sector after the government representatives from the finance and planning ministries who attended the meeting affirmed no additional financial resources could be found.

While the minister declined to make a pledge before the MPs that the third company would be established as a State-owned company with other shareholders, the MPs accused the government of lack of transparency and incredibility and violation of President Mubarak's instructions. Some days ago, President Mubarak stressed it is necessary that the company should be established and the mobile service should not be monopolized by two companies only operating now in Egypt.
Al-Maqrahi then went on to say that what is going on now is a repetition of the tragedy of selling the first mobile phone operator established by the national company to one of the two running companies. The minister's talk about options other than the construction of the company is rejected, he said describing the situation as extremely miserable.
Leftist MP Al-Badri Farghali said that the destruction of monopoly in this service is our aim.
He admitted to being under pressure but not from the two companies. He said he has no apprehension over the establishment of the third company, but the pressure comes from the feasibility study particularly as the rise in dollar exchange rate and pound flotation changed this study a lot. The offering of the third company for subscription poses a risk to shareholders from the people particularly the poor as all the documents show that the new company would turn no profit, he said, adding, "Arab stockholders came to us but we have to tell them the truth".
The study pointed out that the competitive ability in external markets was no longer considered the only element required for any country's exports to succeed. Equations of profit-making external trade have key constants that include economic blocs, trade agreements and direct contact with decision makers and non-governmental circles in the trade partner's markets.
The study pointed out the modesty of the volume of Egyptian exports to the European Union countries and demanded that Egypt-European partnership agreement be activated and that all quotas assigned to Egyptian exports to the European market be exploited.
Egyptian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Fayza Abul-Naga said she had delivered a message from President Hosni Mubarak to his Romanian counterpart on bilateral economic and political relations. She said President Mubarak had told her ahead of her departure for Romania to attend the third meeting of the Egyptian-Romanian Joint Committee that it was important to come up with the best outcome that could be reached.

Coordination is underway between the Ministry of Supply and the Ministry of Health regarding a new trial to recycle flour packages, Khidr said, affirming that this would save some 70 million pounds every year.

The state public budget for the fiscal year 2003/2004 uncovered a rise in the burdens of public debt from LE38.2 billion in the previous budget to LE45.4 billion. The rate of Public debt burdens also rose in the budget from 27% to 28.6% in the new budget.
More importantly even is that steady rise in the public debt whether domestically or externally, which will increase the burdens of the public debt service and the steady rise of its rate in the state public budget, which poses a threat to the proposed development and spending programmes especially in the field of investment.

According to the Group's general guide, the meeting held between some Group members and representatives of some Western embassies at the Swiss Club in Imbaba at the end of last March dealt only with some general issues such as the Copts' situation, the apostasy penalty, women, public freedoms, the multiparty system and elections, which are issues towards which the Group has declared its attitude explicitly and clearly in public.
He stressed that anybody who tried to sow the seed of discord between the group members would be disappointed.
The General Guide of Muslim Brotherhood regarded detention operations to which leaderships in the Group were exposed as "strong evidence refuting arguments of an Ikhwan-government alliance during Iraq's war demonstrations," Al-Hudheibi added.
Al-Arabi learnt that the American embassy in Cairo had asked American businessmen and companies not deal with some Egyptian and foreign banks in Cairo and to withdraw their funds and balances from them under the pretext of suspicious relations between such banks and some terrorist groups as well as the previous Iraqi government.
The American Administration, therefore, decided to avenge itself on those banks by asking American companies not to deal with them. Meanwhile, the report accused some banks in Egypt and the Arab countries of violating UN resolutions on the sequestration and freezing of Iraq assets. The report, nevertheless, preferred to mention the names of only two banks in Egypt, one of which is Bank Saderat Iran, which has been closed down for scores of years.
Al-Arabi learnt that the embassy was trying to exercise pressure on Egypt to freeze some assets with those banks especially with the National Bank of Egypt.

Hizbullah assistant secretary general, Hussein Al-Khalil voiced his belief that the American demand that Lebanon and Syria disarm or gather the party's weapons would not be met with a positive response.
Today, if the same folly was repeated by the enemy, the party would take the same course of action and the same results would be achieved by us God Willing!"
It is just unreasonable to ask people to withdraw from their own villages."
After his first meeting with the American ambassador, the Lebanese Foreign Minister denied their discussions having broached the subject of disarming Hizbullah of its weaponry. The ambassador said that he reminded the Minister of the importance the USA attached to the maintenance of peace along the Blue Line (the line of the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon).
For his part, Lebanese Foreign Minister emphasized that Lebanon disagreed with the Americans regarding their attitude towards Hizbullah, which is, according to him, part of the political life.

Problems of banking body "The rules of Basel-2 Committee stressed important points such as measuring the credit risks in the internal operations and providing the data required for the operations carried out on the market," said advisor to Capital Market Authority, Aman Bassent Fahmi, who doubles as head of Misr International Bank. This resulted in real accountability through obvious figures. This should also be synchronized with the admission to some reforms that could be achieved due to the application of such rules on the Egyptian market, which suffered from a number of problems recently, she said.
The banks have already started to consider the current situation and what the CBE wants them to do in order to reach the real goals of increasing the capital. Such aims mainly include the protection of depositors against liquidation cases and absorbing any losses through maintaining a good margin for gaining confidence regardless of any pressure with studying the influential factors in determining capital such as good administration, the fluidity of assets, the administrative behavior and the burdens ensuing from facing the expenses of ownership, he said.

It was commonly known in political milieus that coordination between the ruling party and the group takes place more often than not at the expense of other coordination operations between the group representatives and other opposition parties in the field of popular and mass actions, which eventually stopped the coordination between opposition parties and the group in the sphere of action in support of the Iraqi people.
The security approach to the political Islam trend has invariably proven to be a wrong policy, which only bolsters such a trend. It is only a radical constitutional and polical reform which can ensure a free political rivalry that shows each political force in due perspective especially if such a reform claims the minimal degree of social justice, which requires reconsidering the present economic policies, the burdens of which are borne by the majority of the Egyptian people, especially the poor and the low-income brackets!
In other words, we are talking about going back once again to the times of militias! There is no doubt that keeping arms in the hands of Hizbullah fully endangers democratic life in Lebanon and threatens Lebanese national security in its entirety. Nevertheless, we begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel after Hizbullah's secretary general Hassan Nasrullah backtracked on his previous statements about the necessity of repelling the American invasion of Iraq, explaining that he meant the resistance of the "Iraqi people to the occupation". We hope that the group will disarm itself peacefully because other alternatives could jeopardize the political future of the group and its national achievements.

Common Arab action should set off through a regional Arab nucleus including five countries, notably Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Libya and the Sudan. These nations adopt public positions against direct and indirect threats against Syria and Hezbollah. They are also opposed to any policy to subjugate the Palestinian Authority to Israeli dictations.

Business councils' heads consider it a big opportunity for the Egyptian economy as it will help boost Egyptian exports to the U.S. market which is considered one of the biggest markets all over the world in terms of purchasing power, thus doubling the volume of Egyptian exports in a few months just like what happened with Jordan when it signed a free trade zone with the U.S. as the volume of Jordanian exports increased from 100 million dollars to 900 million dollars.

Egypt's imports also increased during this period from 46.4 million dollars during the reporting period of 2001 to 50.6 million dollars in 2002.

Pope's secretary Anba Yu'anis said the Pope justified his refusal by saying, "Not only the Christians but also all other Iraqis need support."
What a shame when the security of the world depends on Sharon's and his gang's whims!
Syria seems to know that Powell didn't come to open a diplomatic dialogue with it, even if he alleged so. Rather, he came to brandish the stick of sanctions and a little carrot, which seems to be a cheat: a promise of a comprehensive peace.
Syria undoubtedly realizes that the demand now is not to sit passively on the fence concerning the "road map" plan but to prove its support of the "road map" and take part with the Americans, Israelis and the Palestinian Authority to uproot resistance that confronts the plan of Sharon's gangsters.
The balance of power is obvious and the price is exorbitant. Definitely, it will not bet on Arab consolidation that shred some tears on the Iraqi people and put much curses on its ousted leadership.
It knows well that the secretary's denial of a plan for a new war doesn't mean that the "new reality" is not on the cards.

ARAB DIPLOMAT: EGYPTIAN IDEAS TO SET UP STRONG ARAB LEAGUE

A mini-ministerial council would be established to run Arab affairs during the interval between two ministerial sessions. The council would be elected by ministers and convened regularly.
Mandour discovered the matter a while before when he went to get a new passport in which he did not find the religion blank, a thing that disturbed him so much.
Commenting on US Secretary of State Colin Powell's remark that the Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad informed him of the closure of Hamas' office in Damascus as well as offices of another two Palestinian organizations, Rantissi lauded, in exclusives to Asharq Al-Awsat, the stance of the Syrian government, which hosted the movement after its leaders were exiled from Jordan.
ARAB LIKUD!
It also means that the Arab winners might truly regard the USA victory as their victory too.
Some have rushed into the belief that their holy mission was to urgently target an enemy which they thought was Arab Nationalism as an ideology, method, practice and results, while others just sided on the anti-terrorism American war to target "religious fundamentalism" as an ideology, method practice and results. Some prefer to wait and see while others have changed into fossils or perhaps mummies.
Reality proves that such two extremist trends could only have lead the Arab world to the current state!
Such people never call for change, they are rather Arab-Arab civil wars, internally as well as externally.
Those should know that Likudism which could hardly suit Israel due to its state terrorism, war and ethnic crimes can by no means form a substitute for any rejected or abominable system in the Arab world.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia denied the conclusion of any agreement with the USA on American military bases on Saudi territories.
HAMAS, JIHAD, POPULAR FRONT OFFICES IN DAMASCUS CLOSED DOWN
In recent weeks, talk - overtly handled by U.S. press, but covertly dealt with by Arab press - rose to the surface on what can be called "the list of demands" delivered to countries in the region following the war on Iraq, which allowed the U.S. to be officially centralized in one of the major and important Arab countries, with a U.S. military general leading the current administration in Baghdad. Therefore, Egypt's role in the coming stage should be carefully confabulated. When I (the writer) say Egypt I mean that of establishments, policies and even the intellectual and cultural atmosphere. Here, I'd like to make a principal remark: Egypt's necessary role is required of both the regime and the people who always represent a national leadership of the region's peoples.
Fourth: The Coptic Church, which observes national stands, could not be spared attack and blame due to its hard-line positions against Israeli occupation. Thus, the Egyptian religious institution in general comes under criticism for what is required is to accept the new situations and give up criticisms and anti-Jewish religious provisions that heighten people's awareness of the threat posed to the nation. Religious schools and Al-Azhar institutes are to be a target for desirable change under the pretexts of reform and modernization. Here, positive indications were recently made by Arab capitals. For instance, Egypt's parliament lately passed a partnership agreement with Europe, Saad Eddin Ibrahim's case was closed, the foreign exchange rate was unleashed and the National Democratic Party (NDP) Supreme Policy Council put forward proposals to establish a national human rights council, abrogate state security tribunals and scrap the hard labour imprisonment penalty.
Second: Egypt, they believe, could have played a bigger role in serving hegemonic policies and control pretexts, but Egyptian patriotism made its undeclared policies compatible, to a great extent, with its declared ones. The Egyptian conscience is always responsible to its nation, and often attaches significance to its Arabism, a thing which bugs several circles involved in super and major powers' Middle East policy-making.
Now that it is a country of enlightenment and emancipation, Egypt should be a country of reform too.
The answer was: "We'd prefer the present regime, the defects of which we already know and hope to reform.
Nor will hesitant people be allowed to take advantage of the reform trend or to resort to compromises!
However, to be more realistic, we have to say that the Arab citizen from the Atlantic ocean to the Persian Gulf would prefer to submit to any traditional or "moderate" regime rather than to a radical, revolutionary and bloody regime, not necessarily owing to any real faith in the slow or reactionary evolution tempo in those moderate regimes, but rather because he voted for the lesser of the two evils so that he might stay with his relations in a position that would ensure minimum livelihood conditions that might be pregnant with hopes in a prospective evolution!
What is even more dangerous is the fact that reform has to be done on time using the required dosage, otherwise the last reform chance would be wasted, thus making the putschist revolutionary concept all the more popular to the masses or the elites that lose hope in any genuine reform which see revolution as an inevitable option without incurring blame should they be let down by their leaderships.
During the last two weeks, Cairo witnessed several meetings between Egyptian officials and politicians and poles of Iraqi political forces.
Observers noted that the presence of the Iraqi National Congress (INC) under Ahmed Chalabi was barely noticed, thus hinting that Egypt does not seek to establish ties with any group in Iraq that is not popular on the Iraqi street.
EGYPTIAN ARRANGEMENTS TO RESUME PALESTINIAN DIALOGUE IN CAIRO
DANGEROUS CONCESSIONS MADE BY SYRIA
The Syrian regime, known for its stalwartness and heated revolutionary and patriotic discourse, behaved in a remarkably perplexed manner in the last days. It closed down tightly its border with Iraq, deported all the Iraqi officials who soughs sanctuary in Syria and announced for the first time in its history that it "accepts what the Palestinians accept." It further asked for a role in the road map, which is supposed to lead to a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
The Syrian regime gave up its entire revolutionary and nationalist stands at one go without making concessions to its people, such as launching liberties, establishing a multiparty system, conducting direct elections, parliamentary life, and independent judiciary, a thing that means its practical end at one go or piecemeal, as it will lose the justifications of its raison dieter. Even if it keeps on, it will be isolated internally and externally and its continuation will be temporary and ineffective continuation.
During the war on terrorism in Afghanistan, Syria was most cooperative according to Washington. It even cooperated in an astounding way worth flattering.
Will an organized guerrilla war start in Iraq against American and British forces?
It is also reported that the secret project to prepare the elite units started in 1991 within the framework of preparations for a potential stage where Iraq falls in the hands of the American forces and the necessity to take retaliatory steps after the fall.
The officers in that office, the nature of whose activities remained unknown, were once referred to by security bodies in the Republican palace as "The Forty Men Group" whose specialty was external assassinations such as the attempt on the life of a Qatari spectator who tore the Iraqi flag on the TV screen when Qatar was beaten by Iraq in the qualification tournament of the World Cup.
The organization uses the cloak of religious slogans to justify its activity against coalition forces. Some people started to sympathize with it as an organization, which is opposing the Americans on a religious and political basis. They, nevertheless, do not know that those organization members were among former security bodies' torturers.
The resistance includes all utilities with watchword combining them all, namely to delay any efforts of reform perhaps in the hope of the former President unexpectedly coming back to power!
Independent Iraqi sources, however, wondered whether any secret organization would stay intact in a country where all officials scramble to sell their information to the new authorities!
"There is no relation between the two things and what is said in that regard is baseless," he said.
Attending students asked Mubarak to stop the system of selecting a president through a referendum, but, instead, follow fresh rules that make available more than one nominee rather than one person only and Mubarak's answer was, "Time is not ripe to amend the Constitution. As for economic and social changes, it is possible to conduct some changes and reforms through new acts without having to amend the Constitution".
"More than 30 press publications, including magazines and dailies, slam the government, the society and even some governmental policies freely," he added.
A US high-place official said the American authorities, concerned bodies and forces based in Iraq seek to arrest 1000 of what he called the Iraqi "nuclear Mujahedeen", in an allusion to the Iraqi scientists and researchers responsible for the Iraqi nuclear programme.
It is noteworthy that the destruction of such weapons was used as a primary pretext by the US for justifying its war on Iraq.
Galal Dewidar, Chief-editor of Al-Akhbar daily wrote his column about the State budget to say: Although I felt optimistic when I read the fresh State public budget estimated at LE158.6 billion, I felt uncomforted about, and afraid of, the future when I followed up the statements of Minister of Finance Medhat Hassanein in a press conference and before the People's Assembly. Talking about the specifics of the big deficit in this budget netting LE30 billion, Hassanien, strangely, announced that expenditure volume would go up by 11%, while rise in budget revenues would not exceed 4%!
Both men pointed during the meeting to the grave consequences of excessive expenditure and banks expanding expanded bank credit facilities for customers.

This happened after the minister discovered that the powder was included in the lists of American commodity import programme within the framework of the USAID to Egypt. Some sources indicated Ebeid's response to American pressure which forced him to backtrack on the ban decree he had taken only a month and a half before. The ban decree was passed on March 6th and the immediate release of the powder order came on April 23rd.
The bill was put forward by independent deputy, Abdel-Moneim Al-Oleimi. Head of the Committee on Proposals and Complaints, Counsellor Ahmed Geweili decided to form an ad hoc committee to study the bill, with government representatives attending.

The figures uncovered an increase of 6.5% in passenger car sales (local and imported) during the period from January to April 2003 to hit 15,620 cars against 14,680 cars in the same period last year. Excitingly, the sales rise was focused on imported vehicles, whose prices hiked by 30% owing to the exchange rate decontrol, as their sales rose to 7,120 cars versus 5,330 cars in the same period of 2002.
However, the car sales rise didn't come in favour of operation of local capacity as the customs resolutions are still in favour of imported 1000-1300cm cars, which necessitates producing 28 thousand cars locally this year at the same rate of last year against a capacity of 120 thousand cars.
Such stability per se would assure purchasers that no further jumps would take place, which may lead sales to retreat once again. Indeed, car sales started to decline during last May, but the matter may differ following exams season.
Some analysts attributed such a rise, slow as it is, to the aggregate reforms that took place in the Egyptian economy in the last month. Such reforms that eventually took the lengths of allowing selling and purchasing transactions to take place on the same day, which has been a constant demand of the Arab and foreign investors.
Attraction Prices The Stock Exchange chairman Sameh Al Torgoman believes that the demand by Arab and foreign investors for Egyptian stocks is attributed to their currently attractive prices following their retreat to very low levels, not to mention the fact that some foreign investments have moved from Arab bourses in the proximity of the war to the Egyptian bourse to make use of the tempting chances for purchases.
Circulation manager of Investment Company for Securities, Ayman Al Rifai emphasized that Arab and foreign investments had generally increased in the Egyptian market thus reversing the wave that had been predominant before the war, which urged many investors to sell their stock. He pointed out that a purchasing force emerged especially for the stocks of Orascom which had been idle for months, as well as the stocks of companies of mechanical industries.

In a symposium held by the Arab Association for Economic Researches, two days ago, these economists pointed out that the American initiative to establish an American-Mideast free trade zone was not a new one. It was put forward following the Gulf War II but was not put in action.
Abdel-Karim said that in its new session, slated for June instant, the Arab Economic Unity Council will witness some important steps for the activation of the establishment of the Arab common market which had been delayed for too long. This market, he continued, had been announced in 1964 but was not effectuated due to the reluctance to establish it. It is the only weapon for facing any new ideas run counter to our interests, he added.
An expressive Arab conference should be held for laying down an Arab strategy for coordination between stances before indulging in the negotiations concerning this zone.
This came in the seminar held about the feasibility of the partnership agreement.
In the fifth negotiation round at the end of July, the Egyptian and Turkish parties will discuss liberalizing all Egyptian agricultural and processed agricultural goods as well as industrial commodities in return for gradually liberalizing Turkish exports to Egypt over a period of no less than seven years. This came within the framework of Egypt's commitments to Barcelona Declaration in 1995 which included setting up a EuroMid free trade zone. The fourth round of negotiations was held in Ankara during the period from May 21st to 23rd 2003. The Egyptian party asked for immediate liberalization of all industrial, agricultural and processed agricultural exports to Turkey.
The volume of trade exchange between Egypt and Turkey has developed from about $513 million in 2001 to $430 million last year as a result of a decline in the value of Egyptian imports from $421 million in 2001 to $316 million last year in spite of a rise in Egyptian exports from $92 million in 2001 to $114 million last year. Egypt's exports mainly include mineral oils, petroleum, cotton, rice, coke coal, cotton yarns, natural gas, quartz sand and copper products.
Egyptian free zones witness a state of imbalance in spite of the facilities provided for setting up exportation projects which the Egyptian government try to increase in order to meet its needs of foreign currency which witnessed a high demand in the last period.
Economic analysts confirmed that the exposition of the free trade zones projects to several hindrances represented in customs, tax and bureaucratic systems in dealing with government bodies which confine the positive effects of such projects on the national economy. Also another hindrance is the ministerial decrees, which run counter to the business nature of the projects.
The companies failed to repay their due debts because they make heavy annual losses, something that makes them stumble, the sources said.
Meanwhile, the national companies are facing fierce international competition especially concerning the imported goods which are re-exported together with the smuggled ones that dump the domestic markets due to the weak control over such markets, they said.
Egypt's national economy has been stuck in a 25-year bottleneck, said the participants, ascribing economic deterioration to absence of democracy.
The trade balance deficit swallowed all Egypt's foreign exchange resources.
He added that Egypt's quota of steel to American markets, which had been preserved, amounted to $94 million last year. During the period from January to February 2003 it reached about $43 million.
The project offers loans at an easy interest of 6 percent for short-term loans, 7 percent of medium-term loans and 8 percent for long-term loans, he said.
In an initiative, the first of its kind to raise the level of the Egyptian-Japanese cooperation following Mubarak-Koizumi summit, chief of Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) will pay a 3-day visit to Cairo, starting next Saturday during which he will meet with senior officials forefront of whom are Prime Minister Dr. Atef Ebeid.

For instance, a marathon is expected to be organized soon by the Japanese Parliamentary Friendship Society, which includes over 40 parliamentarians, involving 7 former ministers and three incumbent ones. The marathon will be between Asia and Africa (through crossing over Mubarak Peace Bridge), with winners to be awarded at the wrapping up of the race papyrus certificates reading that they have crossed the two continents. The event which attracts 2,000-3,000 Japanese marathoners is meant to promote and reinforce tourism, the Egyptian ambassador said.
SHEIKH YASSIN: NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OSLO AND ROAD MAP
A. We've announced our stance before, which is the demands of the Palestinian people. Such demands are related to the liberation from occupation and stoppage of settlements rather than government-related demands at a time when the land and the people are under occupation. We actually need a government, but the government is formed when the citizens have a homeland on which they can establish a state.
Stoppage of Intifada Q. Will Hamas agree to stop the Intifada, collect arms and comply with the new government commands?
Q. Will you agree on stopping the Intifada on certain conditions?
If Israel withdraws to the pre-September 29th position, what else will take place?
They want to solve this issue at the expense of the Palestinian people, a thing that is unacceptable. Q. Do you distinguish between Oslo Agreement and the "road map", which is suggested by the U.S.?
Once security is achieved they will, then, reach what they dreamt of. Israel, therefore, will be acceptable in our nation and will be part of the Middle East. There will also be normalization of relations with it, a thing that they want the Arab and Islamic countries to do.
Under this headline, well-known journalist Magdi Mehanna wrote an article, which ran to the following effect, only in part: Just one day before American Secretary of State Colin Powell visited Syria, I tried to call Khaled Mashaal, chairman of Hamas movement politbureau, who lives in Damascus, but I couldn't because all his telephones both in the office and at home gave one response, "wrong number."
The Palestinian leaderships are now under some sort of house confinement and are allowed to work and act only within the narrowest limits until further notification!
Damascus, however, tried to evade the second thorny and crucial case of Lebanese Hizbullah and the Syrian backing it receives.
It takes part in the political game and in decision taking.
Perhaps he wanted to say that such a question was untimely and that he would not be in a hurry.
The question that is going to impose itself in the near future is, this:
The whole world says no to striking Syria, no to aggression against Syria, but it also says that the Syrian leadership has to stop being adamant.
Such terrorism is represented in backing Palestinian organizations described by Washington as hostile to Israel and is also represented in Lebanese Hizbullah.
No matter what options or situations, I believe Hizbullah is aware that in light of such a difficult equation it might find succour only in God Almighty as it might well be let down by friends.
The statement added that the committee's duties would also include extending support to the royal family's noble elite in order to lead the country to the good of its sons and act for stopping the corruption practiced by some princes, key officials and businessmen who have been looting the country's resources for 25 years.

Future of partnership with Europe However, the conclusion of an agreement or agreements between the U.S. and the Arab world will raise many questions concerning the future of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, which is scheduled to be completed by 2010, as the European Union has allocated some 5 billion dollars for it. The American side, nevertheless, has not shown yet to what extent it is ready to expend on modernizing the economies of the region.

On Sunday, Egyptian newspapers severely criticized Tantawi for his statements during the inauguration of that congress where representatives from 72 countries participated and where the future of the Islamic world is probed. The papers voiced surprise at his description of the Islamic nation as "a nation of rabble and hypocrites" who were predominated by the use of high sounding slogans and hypocrisy." This made him issue an explicatory statement signed in his own handwriting pointing out that he "meant the regime of Saddam Hussein, which killed the innocents, treacherously attacked its neighbours and did harm to Islam and Muslims and persisted in animosity and oppression." He pointed out that the word "rabble," mentioned in his talk meant that regime and its hypocrites.
The slogans contained by the road map for achieving peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians especially regarding the establishment of a Palestinian state side by side with Israel can only be described as wonderful and an important step on the road to putting an end to that conflict.
Each and every action on its part embodies hostility against everything that is Arab, which would ultimately mean responding to Israel's wishes.

QATAR TALKS ABOUT POSSIBLE CONCLUSION OF PEACE AGREEMENT WITH ISRAEL
Qatari Foreign Minister's statements are considered a rare stance by a high-ranking official in the region that rules out the establishment of any normal relations with Israel unless it withdraws from the lands it occupied in 1967, CNN said.
Libyan official sources told Asharq Al-Awsat that the memo emphasized the impossibility of Libya continuing with the AL in light of the current Arab situation and the failure of the collective Arab action system to defend the vital interests of Arab peoples especially the Iraqi and the Palestinian ones.
The source who asked Asharq Al-Awsat not to identify him, said Cairo continues its consultation with different Palestinian factions in order to agree on the agenda of the third round of the Palestinian extensive national dialogue, which is meant to set the Palestinian house in order from inside and determine the priorities of the coming stage of national work.
Egyptian intelligence chief, Omar Solyman supervises such talks in order to convince the Palestinian factions of an Egyptian project providing for stopping Israeli-Palestinian violence for a year in the Palestinian occupied lands to give the opportunity to peaceful solutions aiming at resuming the frozen negotiations between the two parties at the point they had reached before Israel invaded the lands controlled by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) in September, 2000.

Many Arab and foreign countries condemned as a terrorist act the three bombing attacks in the Saudi capital of Riyadh late on Monday.

The bombings were also condemned by Lebanese Foreign Minister Jean Obeid and Lebanese Democratic Renewal Movement leader MP Naseeb Lahud.
Kuwait, the government and the people, supported all Saudi measures to preserve its security, he said.
The attacks were also condemned by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) as "sabotage acts" The GCC Secretariat said in a statement "It emphatically denounces sabotage acts and bombings perpetrated by terrorists in Riyadh, claiming lives of innocent civilians."
The current situation in post-war Iraq raises as many concerns as it does questions about the new political system in the country.
The view on the day of the Shiites' celebration of the commemorating the death of Al-Hussein, Prophet Muhammad's grandson, which was held on 22 April, only a few days after the fall of Baghdad, was terrifying to the Americans, for the scene brought to their minds the Khomeini Revolution, with all its repercussions on the whole area and American policy.
The danger in the Iraqi case lies in the possibility that a party with a large Shiite base may acquire a majority that would carry it to power and, once there, it would bring democracy to a grinding halt and think that the result of the elections gave it the right to establish any sort of government it wanted.
Such a solution may lie in giving the Iraqi military, which will be restructured, a role for protecting democracy and preventing any violation of its rules that will be laid down in the new constitution. The notion of making the military a guardian of democracy in Arab countries has been proposed in the Arab world only on a very small scale, never getting its fair share of discussion, perhaps because there was no way to apply it.
It is better to have the military play this role through a national security council, not through its high command or general staff.
According to the Turkish Constitution, the Armed Forces are the guardian of the republic and the secular system, and the secular republic may be undemocratic.
A question may be asked here about the differences between the history of the Iraqi Army and that of the Turkish Army, given the fact that the latter has been a tool of modernization since the last days of the Ottoman Empire, not to mention its role in the national liberation war in the wake of World War One, as well as its well-known contribution to building the post-Caliphate state and preserving its unity and national cohesion.
Moreover, a more positive role can be visualized for the Iraqi military, not only because they will be a new establishment, but also because they will not be assigned missions that would eventually lead to intervention in politics, contrary to the missions of the Turkish military that is tasked with protecting secularism, as this mission puts it in a confrontation with a segment of the Turkish political class and forces it to lock horns with an elected government, as was the case during the era of the Necmettin Erbakan government in mid-1990's, and as is happening at present, thought to a lesser degree.
The manipulators within the deposed regime will be prosecuted for suspending the constitution, a charge whose punishment should be severe, so as to create a strong deterrent against attempt to uproot democracy.
PEACE ACHIEVED THROUGH RECOGNIZING OTHER'S RIGHT TO EXIST: QATARI FM
He thought that peace is in need of more than mere initiatives and each party should recognize the other's right to exist and they have to effectuate what has been agreed upon in Oslo and Madrid agreements under the umbrella of the UN Security Council.
Everyone knows that there are hindrances, but if good intentions are shown the problems with the Palestinians and regarding the Golan Heights would be solved, he said.
"I'm confident that combating terrorism and carrying on with reform will, in turn, make it incumbent upon Israel to take steps towards improving the living circumstances of both Palestinians and Israelis," he added.
The ambassador said in his protest that the movie shows the anti-America demonstrations that flared up in Arab countries as well as the whole world, something which he considered as a hostile feeling towards his country. Welch managed to get a copy of the film script, which castigates the US aggressive policy towards Arabs and Muslims by showing scenes of popular protests in streets and universities.
It seemed that the government is bent on forging ahead with political and legislative reform according to its viewpoint. A few weeks before the end of the parliamentary session, it hurried to declare the referral to the People's Assembly (PA) of a bill that would stipulate the cancellation of state security courts and the establishment of the Legislative Council for Human Rights. This emphasizes its desire to complete that step quickly and establish the idea of developing local political life.
During the emergency meeting held yesterday (14th May), the Association decided to send a delegation of businessmen to Iraq to meet with Iraqi businessmen so as to discuss the Egyptian role in the reconstruction operation. But, the meeting would be held in a neighbouring country of Iraq, as it would be difficult to hold it in Baghdad for security reasons.
She, furthermore, requested that pressure be practiced on the UN in a bid to execute the contracts that were not executed within the framework of the oil-for- food program. In addition, factories that changed their production to cover the Iraqi market and manufactured in accordance with the required specifications must be compensated. Suppliers who were damaged due to the war and were not able to consign their goods after the completion of production must be compensated too, she concluded.
In a message to the Ikhwan all over the world, of which Al-Hayat obtained a copy, Al-Hudheibi said, "Astonishingly enough, Arab and Muslim rulers do not move to square up to such disasters, nor do they want to even show wrath and denunciation against those who perpetrate such crimes.
It is the same policy adopted by the Jews at the time of Prophet Muhammad, God's prayers and peace be upon him. It is also the same policy adopted by the occupiers in the Islamic East and in the their colonies over the last two centuries.
ANNOUNCING INFORMATION COMMUNITY INITIATIVE, ESTABLISHING EXPORT-ORIENTED TECHNOLOGY
The initiative uncovered a boom in the number of phone subscribers. The fixed phone subscribers hiked from 4.9 millions in October 1999 to 8.2 millions in April last.
The number of houses that used this service totalled 800,000 serving two million users. The current total capacity of international calls is 850 million pulse/second against 20 million pulse/second in October 1999.
It was targeted to set up a cyber café in every village. Over 550 cyber cafés were erected in 26 governorates.
Regarding the tendency of establishing a "non-cash community", the local networks of electronic dealings were linked together to facilitate their access to regional and international networks in order to expand the using of vending machines, remitting salaries to banks and the National Post Authority, setting up an information center for consumption credit to support the use of credit cards, using electronic payments in government services and utilities, including the Internet banking, mobile banking, prepaid cards and paying through credit cards.
The number of trainees is currently 12,471, while it is targeted to reach 39,000 in 2007.
It was followed by the Swedish Ericsson with investments standing at 93 million dollars, exports of 200 million dollars and 448 jobs.
The number of companies in this field hiked from 282 in 1999 to 438 in 2000, 262 in 2001, 713 in 2002 and 859 in 2003.
The work of that conference was kept secret on the request of several countries that took part in it, but had no diplomatic relations with Israel including Iran.
This is the first time the Egyptian public opinion has been shocked at such news in an Arab country which used to be labour attractive point. There is no obvious reasons for the presence of Egyptian nationals corpses among those of thousands of Iraqi citizens in addition to some other Arab nationalities incidentally discovered.
The Egyptian diplomatic mission which retained a strong presence regardless of the aggression on Iraq had formed fact-finding teams to find out the number of Egyptians who are being hospitalized in some Iraqi hospitals as a result of those operations.
Qabbani said, "Israel's intention to allow the Jews to perform their prayers in Al-Aqsa mosque campus is an aggression on Islam and Muslims in the whole world and not only on the Palestinians alone.
The streamers carrying Islamic slogans are mostly those parties that have returned from exile in Iran after they were pursued by the former regime such as Islamic Call Party (Al-Da'wa Al-Islamia) and the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq. On the other hand, parties that have returned from Europe carry national slogans like the Iraqi National Congress, and the National Reconciliation Movement. However, the new parties which have been recently under construction usually carry the word democracy as part of their names like Al Tagamoh (Grouping) for Democracy and Iraqi Democrats, which shows the relief the Iraqis have started to sense. Old parties also still carry the same names such as Kurdish parties, the Iraqi Communist Party, Arab Nationalist Movement, etc.
Although the strength of political movements in Iraq can not be precisely gauged for the time being, due to the special views held by the silent majority and because of lack of an all-out or transparent view of those movements and parties which have only recently emerged on the Iraqi arena, they all actively try to introduce themselves and prepare for a forthcoming election which they might win. However, it is every day's concern now to think about how the USA would see the future of Iraq. Will its deeds run counter to its words after matters settle?

The message was therefore obvious and definite; despite all the media hype, Hezbollah does not pose danger to Israel.
He also dropped another bombshell when he said that the problem does not lie with the Syrian army, but lies with the Syrian influence in Lebanon.
Because this deal can hardly be implemented in full immediately, both parties agreed implicitly to implement it in reciprocal stages according to the regional and international conditions. The US would officially seek later to revive negotiations on the Syrian-Israeli track and ensure that Syria and Lebanon would have place on the roadmap. Meanwhile, Syria and Lebanon would guarantee the continuation of calm on the Lebanese-Israeli borders and finding a solution to the problem of the Palestinian organisations offices in Damascus, which may be, as a first stage, the movement of some of them into the Palestinian camps in Syria.

It might be mentioned that this step was preceded by another one when the Syrian government decided to change the school khaki uniform in all pre-university stages, which is similar to the military uniform, into blue and gray for the males and blue and rosy for the females.
Such a change has been invigorated by President Ali Abdullah Saleh's amnesty decision for the social leadership known as the 16 list who received judicial sentences after the secession war in summer 1994. He also called them to return to the country.
The party welcomed the amnesty decision for the 16 list and regarded it as folding important files of the past (as well as the file of the 1994 war) and to achieve national reconciliation which has been a constant demand of the Socialist Party.
He also called for a mechanism that would use the amnesty decision to achieve the national movement goals in the officialdom and the opposition through closing conflict files that have become groundless. It also called for abiding by the rules of tolerance and resorting to the constitution and the law in defining laws and obligation for everybody no matter what political or public position they had.
He underlined the necessity of differentiating between jihad in such places and operations by extremist Islamists in Arab and Muslim countries.
"Neither an individual nor a group of people could render the shedding of blood permissible, but rather a government that defends its people against any aggressor or a judge who metes out punishment after verifying pieces of evidence and witnesses, he added.
22 DEPUTIES WHO EVADED MILITARY SERVICE DEMAND THAT DISCUSSION OF THEIR POSITIONS BE POSTPONED!
Deputy, Mohamed Al-Badrasheini leads a group of deputies who want the issue to be resolved lest it should affect the credibility of the parliamentary council, and its legal position.

AMERICA IS AFTER POLITICAL GAINS FROM FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH EGYPT
Head of the Third World Forum and former minister of planning Dr. Ismail Sabri Abdullah does not object in principle to negotiations with the USA about signing a free trade agreement.
We have no modern factories which are designed for exportation except for one carpet factory. It is difficult, therefore, in light of the present orientation of businessmen towards the domestic market, to increase our experts even if scores of agreements were concluded".
Among other reasons that urge the US to clinch agreements with Egypt is that it is the cultural center of all Arab countries. Egypt provides them with books, movies, and TV programmes. There are, further, about 2 million Egyptians working in Arab countries including doctors, engineers and teachers.

He, further, asked Egyptian companies which want to promote exports to Japan to pay heed to the special Japanese requirements in some products and not to rush into turning down even slight amendments as responding to such amendments would lead to long term dealings which requires regularity of exporting to the Japanese market to ensure a link between the Egyptian procedure's interest with the interests of the Japanese imports so that a sort of relative constancy of some Egyptian exports to the Japanese market might be achieved.

ISRAEL BESIEGES ROAD MAP WITH PALESTINE STATE IN JORDAN
According to a well-informed source, the reply of the Israeli government was that Elon's statements represented no official Israeli position, but only reflected the minister's personal point of view.
Jordan had more than once turned down such proposals made by extremist members in Sharon's government, but it seems that the current escalation of such proposals is meant to put obstacles to the implementation of the road map as they coincided with statements published by Israeli Yediot Aharanot newspaper by extremist female writer Amona Alon who urged the Israeli government to reject the road map and adhere to the status quo imposed by the occupation of the land. She demanded that the Arabs who have 22 states, according to her, declare the Palestinian state in Jordan, adding that the Israelis would not allow the Palestinians to return to the territories where they used to live till 1948.
He regarded Israel's approval of the plan as approval of Israelis falling dead and injured on a daily basis!
Israeli Minister of Accommodation invited whoever are left of the Jews in Morocco to emigrate to Israel in retaliation for the terrorist operations carried out by Al-Qaeda men in Casablanca two days ago.

FADHLALLAH DECLARES TARGETING CIVILIANS AS RELIGIOUSLY IMPERMISSIBLE
Fadhlallah emphasized to Al-Hayat that the religious opinion (fatwa) he had issued the previous day about the blasts in Morocco would also apply to the explosions in Riyadh in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia last Monday, as well as any assault against innocent civilians regardless of their nationality or whether they were non-Arab or non-Muslims or even nationals of foreign and Western countries.
"In the political battle everything will fight, but only the arms are used in the military battle," Al-Sayyed said in a festival thrown by Hizbullah on Saturday. "We should be aware of this political fact. All of our institutions should be prepared. We also should prepare ourselves and our generations and children intellectually, culturally, ethically and civically," he added.
In the corridor of Jordanian senior merchants and trade agents, they are talking about "business" on the Iraqi market, as the American occupation forces allowed the Iraqi senior and junior traders to buy as much goods as they could and get them access to the domestic market without customs charges or control or interference for three months only provided that any products that have to do with arms and potential resistance would be excluded.
Car experts estimate that hundreds of cars enter Iraq on a daily basis in favour of Iraqi traders. It seems that the Jordanian free trade zone, whose traders used to suffer from recession, has become "almost empty" nowadays. The visitors of such a zone say this zone, which is specialized in cars and equipment, no longer welcomes the Jordanian merchant. The Iraqis who buy everything are now spotlit.
Iraqi traders search for huge quantities of detergents, kitchen utensils, garbage cases, chips packages, sweeteners which are sold by small-sized shops.
It is reported that a fierce competition is underway at present between some Jordanian senior exporters to get the fruits of a deal to which the Americans pay much attention. This deal is the exportation of tens of thousands of satellite dishes to Iraq during the current week. Meanwhile, trucks carrying tons of electrical appliances, such as refrigerators, television sets, washing machines and cookers, cross the border on a daily basis.
Tabligh (Informing) Movement is a purely preaching movement that contents itself with working in mosques (and its origins come from Pakistan) and the surrounding countries such as Bangladesh. Although this movement does not work on politics, the Moroccan authorities often tighten the grip on it because of its foreign origins.
The Islamic movements in Morocco are societies and no one is allowed to form a political party. That is why when Tawheed and Islah Movement decided to run in the elections, it formed alliance with the Justice and Development Party led by Moroccan struggler Abdel-Karim Al-Khatib, which is not an Islamic Party.
One of the things that mark the Islamic political activity in Morocco is its primary dependence on the tenets of the Muslim Brotherhood Group and the ideas of Hassan Al-Banaa and Sayyed Qutb. They, however, categorically refuse to use mosques in political discourse and consider them sacred places that should only be used for worship. They use the cultural societies, which they always seek to construct as a front for their activities, to hold their symposia. They are widespread in Morocco to the extent that Tawheed and Islah Group alone has 60 societies.
In the recent period also appeared "Al-Monassaroon" (Christinized) who are now in thousands though there are no Christians in Morocco and the majority of population (30 million) are Muslims save five thousand Jews. This is a phenomenon that creates a troublesome climate particularly as many think that christianization comes with support from the American embassy. Although the government does not recognize them and consider them apostates from Islam, it does not take any action against them particularly as most of them are of high ranks in the capital Rabat.
The political street in Morocco is full of vitality and contradictions, but these suicide attacks are strange to the Moroccan society and the Moroccan fingers point at foreign hands standing behind these recent incidents.. so who did it?
When those same "deviants" went to Afghanistan, they used to receive many financial and political support from the Saudi government and were depicted by the Saudi mass media as heroes fighting a holy war to liberate a Muslim country from an atheist Communist occupation.
The Saudi authority should admit, in the first place, that there is a people called the "Saudi people" who deserve democracy, independent judiciary and decent living, just as they deserve accession to sovereignty ministries, key princedoms and embassies as well as top positions of the state, the armed forces, and security institutions. The country, after all, is for all and defending its security and stability cannot be the preserve of a certain category.
The problem does not lie in the interpretation of some Quranic verses in a way that might favour extremism or violence justification. It rather lies in an unfair policy of the US which can only see through Israeli eyes, and tendentiously humiliates and degrades all that is Arab or Muslim.

"Ibda" (Creativity) Gallery organizer Ahmed Shehata said that the Israeli ambassador's movements are random, adding that he is fond of visiting plastic art galleries.

RABBIS RULE IRAQ!
This news comes at a time when US forces ban the entry of any Iraqi or foreign journalist to these oil sites at a distance of 15 kilometers, a measure that can only be seen as an attempt to hide the Israeli presence in Iraq.
If we take into consideration the fact that there is increasing rejection by Sunnis and many Kurds of the American occupation or the Israeli scenarios of Iraq's future, the entire Arab region will enter a stage of instability at which national and religious extremism of different directions will flourish particularly as Israeli rabbis seem as if they are ruling Iraq now!

Certain gases are also used by Israel to cause sterility.

198 MILLION DOLLARS VOLUME OF TRADE EXCHANGE WITH YEMEN
Al-Alam Al-Youm learnt that the executive statute draft of the banking act obliged companies operative in foreign currency transfer to settle their positions according to the provisions of the fresh law. The executive statute draft makes it incumbent upon such companies not to practise any activities carried out by the banks unless there is a license from the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) and under its direct supervision through subjecting their foreign exchange to search and control by the competent department at the CBE.
The Ministry of Housing has paid 1.110 billion pounds' worth of contractors' and suppliers' dues until June 2002.
"This is known for all and the issue was presented months ago to the ministers of public enterprise sector and foreign trade in many meetings, but it hasn't been settled yet although there are alternatives and solutions only awaiting a decision to be made by the bodies concerned," he told Al-Akhbar.
Hence, the crisis would continue even during the new season. This would affect negatively the Egyptian cotton reputation and the Egyptian plants' ability to meet the local as well as international needs.
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Fayza Abul Naga discussed with board chairman of Small and Medium-Sized Industries development company and President of Malaysian Mala University's, Mohamed Al-Khattib the ways and means of boosting bilateral cooperation between the two countries and exchanging scientific know-how to develop small and medium-sized industries.
The committee has asked as well in its report for studying the reasons for the decline of local investment rate to only 16% during the first year of the plan against 18% in 2001-2002. The committee considered this as an alarming indicator that necessitates improving the current investment environment and providing the banking finance necessary for the private sector.
The report showed that the targeted economic growth of the fiscal year 2003/2004 that hit 3% is a modest rate that cannot achieve the top goals of the five-year plan, foremost of which is solving the unemployment problem.
The report pointed out also the necessity of rationalizing the government expenditure that eats up 30% of public funding.
Has the decision succeeded in controlling the dollar, or is it still too late to issue a judgment?
Former CBE governor adds that part of the aims of the decision is to procure foreign exchange to open special documentary credits for the materials necessary for some important industries along with earning good profits to some sectors dealing with the market, such as tourism and export. He acknowledged that the unexpected declaration of the decision caused confusion on the market at the beginning of its enforcement. However, he pursued, the market regained stability after a few days as some negative points were dealt with and the black market was eliminated after a while.
Dollar abundance Head of Importers Division Mostafa Zaki underlined many issues that helped rendering the decision successful in spite of the tough economic conditions such as the war on Iraq which stopped importation movement from all the world's countries. This helped providing a large reserve of foreign exchange with the CBE that reached 1.3 billion dollars, thus opening 88% of clients' applications. According to the CBE governor Mahmoud Abul-Oyoon, consumption expenditure was decreased, banks were given green light to open credits through the programme of priorities of strategic commodities and important raw materials in a bid to resume the march of the companies that employ many workers.
Al-Ghazali stresses the same opinion considering that the time is not a criterion of success. There are other reasons that lead to success which are currently unavailable.
Chairman of the People's Assembly Committee on Housing, Mohamed Aboul-Enein said that over 12 thousand contractors had stopped working. He pointed out that companies had been considerably affected recently especially after the deregulation of the rates of exchange. He added that the delay in the payment of the contracting sector's dues on the government had led to accumulation of bank interests as most projects had been chiefly financed by banks whose interests had consequently risen, thus doubling the size of companies' debts to banks.
In this context, Mohamed Mahmoud Ali Hassan, head of the Egyptian Union for Construction and Building Contractors say that the contracting sector had recently undergone several shakes such as Egypt's economy being converted from a guided economy to a free one that implements the supply and demand mechanisms and then the deregulation of foreign exchange circulation and converting several public companies into public enterprise sector and finally the deregulation of the rates of exchange decree passed at the end of January last year which raised the value of all foreign currencies against the Egyptian pound which reflected on a rise in the prices of all building materials which are mostly imported from abroad.

* How much has been spent of the total finance of the IMP?
* The plan's timeframe is five years, of which one year elapsed without any tangible progress.
The programme will contribute to modernizing the industry. No sane man might think that a programme that will spend 426 million euros within four years can modernize the Egyptian industry. My personal aim is not to upgrade industry in toto, but rather starting and contributing to modernization, as it is a difficult and sophisticated task that requires patience and efforts.
All these influential elements affect industry.
He should understand that he is involved in a struggle and fierce competition that requires permanent alert. However, initial estimates reveal that the all-out modernization process might take 20 years, on condition that there should be a clear-cut national vision for the future of Egyptian economy.
In Egypt, we have to determine what we need specifically.

UNPRECEDENTEDLY, EGYPTIAN CHRISTIANS DEMAND COUNCIL FOR HUMAN RIGHTS BE HELD IN CHURCH
He pointed out that such systematized discrimination took several forms such as the prevention of an Orthodox citizen or citizeness from marriage even after they get a judicial ruling permitting them to marry if one of them was converted to another Christian sect. Another example is the fact that a monk who abandons monasticism in favour of ordinary civil life is deprived of the right to get married.
He said, "In spite of the simplification of procedures by the President and assigning that matter to local units and governors, the procedures for building churches can not be held as equal to those for building mosques."
Although the roadmap demands that Israel stop building settlements in the West Bank, the Israeli government will shortly build 2000 housing units in the settlements, according to Israel Housing Ministry Data.
Israeli central census center has unveiled recently that by the end of 2002, settlers in the West Bank had increased by 5 percent. This means that 11,000 settlers joined the settlement project. It is noteworthy that the number of settlers totalled 225,000 by the end of last year.
An opinion says if Israel makes peace it will die or implode because it is a racial society, in which the officials keep a hot atmosphere at the borders so that the inside may be cool and calm.
Dr. Haitham Al-Kilani, a Syrian strategic expert, said that the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation is a national resistance movement against colonization and occupation that stressed that the essential factors of the Arab-Israeli conflict have been going on since the Zionists stepped to the land of Palestine. What changed is the form of the conflict, its tools, and rules particularly as the peaceful settlement march, which is more than ten years old, will not reach its end as long as Israel looks forward to occupation, dominance, and expansion.
He underlined that the Al-Aqsa uprising brought about a shift in the general situation of the region as over the past ten years the inter-Arab contradictions have exploded by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait were dominating the arena of Arab political interactions. But, today this stage has come to an end and the main contradiction between Arabs and Israel has come back again to the fore thanks to the Jerusalem cause, which the settlement process tried to get around through delay in Madrid, Oslo, and what came after.
The US is the main contributor to the establishment of the Zionist entity, he revealed.
He also said that the roadmap is built on the grounds of international legitimacy resolutions 242 and 338 and the Arab peace initiative, which resulted from Beirut summit in March 2002. Sharon rejected this roadmap because it points to an Israeli pullback to the 1967 lines, Basiouni revealed. No Israeli prime minister whether from the right or left wing can agree to sign a peace agreement that underlines the pullback to 1967 lines, but resolution 242 was approved because it spoke of safe and recognized borders.
She affirmed that it is not enough to report, register, and hope for these things to occur. Rather, they should come through wise operations that make them possible and real strategies aimed at translating them into facts meant to reduce extremism and arrogance tendencies.
He affirmed that in the face of the Zionist challenge disunity remains the path of failure, inability, and concessions but national integration is the path of resistance in times of peace and war alike.
Sharon demonstrated that he was a skilled actor when he made naive persons feel how it is uneasy to have a cabinet decision passed on approving the roadmap. The approval was conditional upon a U.S. understanding of Israeli reservations and a binding decision on opposing any Israeli recognition of the Palestinian refugees' right to return.
Such requests mainly include ceasing resistance, incriminating martyrdom operations, disarming all factions and stopping instigation.
The Palestinian National Authority conceded all the Palestinian territories occupied since 1948, and the first Palestinian prime minister is now dropping the right to return. Still, Palestinian-Israeli parleys have not started yet, while Israeli forces are reoccupying the West Bank and most of Gaza Strip lands. What will remain of Palestinian rights once confabulations and the third stage come to a close?
SHARON'S TRICK!
The first message was directed to the administration of president George Bush which ran to the effect that Israel would not be an obstacle to the American campaign aiming at remapping the Middle East or to the American position in the "Anti-terrorism war".
It is obvious that Sharon refused to alienate what he deemed as a resource of Israel, i.e. the relation with the USA.
More importantly, killer Sharon's government's decision yesterday (25th May) managed to save the American-Israeli relations from a crisis at a time which is of the highest sensitivity to Washington. He managed to push the ball in the Palestinian court. After the Israeli decision, Abou Mazin's government's performance together with the behavior of President Yasser Arafat, Hamas and Jihad will be under scrutiny.

The airlines demand that about $17 million be remitted monthly in hard currencies to their countries, i.e. about $200 million annually.
They had hoped for much more than that as it eventually impacts on tourism in the country. This, undoubtedly, will bring about two results:
The airlines suggested they be exempted from taxes just as is the case with the equipment, machinery and engines that came for the usage of those airlines and serve the purposes of work according to the provisions of law 119 for 1983 on civil aviation duties and the charges of exploiting air transport rights.

The institutions comprising less than ten workers constitute 98%. They mostly offer simple services either in shops or retail.

Premier Atef Ebeid confirmed that special economic zones law will make Egypt one of the best investment zones in the world in light of the existence of power sources and the increasing strategic reserves of natural gas, pointing out the rise in natural gas project exports in Egypt.
There are opportunities to cement bilateral relations between Egypt and Romania, as Egypt is the gateway to the markets of Middle East, Africa and Asia while Romania is an outlet for Egyptian trade to Eastern and Western Europe.
The number of investment companies in Egypt reached more than 29 thousand companies, 751 of which work under the free trade zone system, with total investments of 82.9 billion dollars till late last May and total capital of 41.5 billion dollars. The investments of the free trade zone companies hit 17.5 billion dollars with capital of 6.5 billion dollars, he said. Al-Ghamrawi offered the incentives and opportunities of investment in Egypt to the Irish investors, adding that the labor cost in Ireland is fifteenfold of the labor cost in Egypt something which will increase the competitiveness of Egyptian production, especially in light of Egypt's free trade agreements with Arab countries and the COMESA.

MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD MENTOR IN IRAQ: WE ARE AGAINST IMPOSING ISLAMIC GOVERNMENT, DO NOT MIND NEXT IRAQI PRESIDENT BEING SHIITE
Al-Tikri replied to accusations regarding the absence of the Islamic party from the opposition front compared with the other Shiite and Kurdish organisations, which faced the Baathist regime over the past years. Justifying such absence, he said the nature of confrontation between the regime and Shiites in southern Iraq and Kurds in the North made them the strongest voice in opposition.
Speaking about the coming stage and whether the Islamic party is ready to participate in an Iraqi administration to be formed by the Americans, he said there was a difference over this issue between him and the members of the party inside Iraq.
But, we have doubts about the American intentions.
Al-Tikriti said that the Muslim Brotherhood approach was based on the spread of justice and good values and their attitude was originally peaceful and did not include fighting and violence which was attributed to the Muslim Brotherhood.
In this regard, Al-Tikriti affirmed that the Islamic party opposed the Shiite demands of an Islamic state because those demands would make the Americans feel that the Islamic movement tries to snatch the opportunity to impose on the Iraqis their religious scheme.
GARANG CALLS FOR 50% OF JOBS, 60% OF OIL REVENUES This item comes on page three.
He rejected the post of vice-president because it is ineffective.
SUDANESE OFFICIAL: GARANG'S DEMANDS UNREALISTIC
Hasan went on to say, "What is normal and dominant is to have one central bank, one monetary authority, one monetary policy and one currency in the same unified country, which would inseparable".
Certainly, he was not in his office on Tuesday. In an attempt to probe the "story", Al-Hayat contacted him only to listen to a "recorded message" in his mobile phone expressing "refrainment" from talking. It was known that he held a series of meetings in the channel's headquarters on Monday evening.
This does not rule out huge pressure practiced by the U.S. and the Arab countries on the channel's approach.
The search for "mass graves" in Iraq has recently turned into a bourse where prices sometimes rise according to the quality and nationality of the victims as confirmed by secret government documents found in some government buildings or in the houses of some senior officials that were exposed to looting and plundering and some of which were sold for tens of thousands of dollars.
The source said the third batch of "Hizbullah" and "Islamic Jihad" pilots, which comprised thirty pilots, returned to Lebanon without completing their training.
A source close to the guard pointed out that the truck that the Lebanese and Syrian forces stopped two days ago in Beqaa was transporting part of the weapons taken away from Margeyoun province to a storehouse of the Revolutionary Guard.
This synchronized with information confirmed by Pakistani sources about contacts conducted by the American forces with Afghan Islamic Party leader, Gulbeddin Hikmatyar whose supporters are launching attacks against the American forces in Afghanistan.
ROADMAP FOR IRAN
This did not take place before.
The "Washington Post" piece of news is a fresh evidence as it said US officials were considering proposals for destabilizing the Iranian regime and encouraging a popular uprising against it.
He who does not believe could ask Mullah Omar and Saddam Hussein.
The devil is close and present almost everywhere, in the Soviet Republics, the Gulf waters, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, in addition to Iraq.
Responding means opening the door for changing Iran's role and changing the Iranian regime itself and rehabilitating Iran to reconcile with the American world.
"The external dimension cannot be dispensed with in the development process, as part of the revival which was witnessed by Egypt since the era of Mohamed Ali Pasha (Egypt's ruler early 19th century) has been based on external world," he added.
"This congress will be a chance to put up new ideas and orientations for a number of national action-related issues," he said, stressing the importance of the society participating in offering some services under the State's control in order to meet the growing demand for a number of services especially education.
The Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) on Friday suspended dialogue with Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbass (Abu Mazen) as he committed himself to serious and unacceptable things at Jordan's Red Sea resort of Aqaba summit.
Al-Rantisy noted that Abu Mazen conceded the historic Palestinian rights of Jerusalem, refugees right to return and release of prisoners.
Abu Mazen, while addressing the Aqaba summit, shrugged off the Palestinian refugees' right to return to their homeland, which means a tacit agreement on the settlement of 4 million Palestinians in the diaspora, the statement said.
OCCUPATION FORCES TO STAY IN IRAQ FOR 60 YEARS: U.S. CONSERVATIVE LEADER
Iran and Syria, along with some other countries in the region, will be put under a U.S. surveillance and may come under a U.S. attack if they have weapons of mass destruction, he said.
Under this heading, Walid Shaqir of Al-Hayat writes an article to say: What is the relationship between the democracy which Washington's rulers promise to establish successfully with a reshaped Middle East accordingly - following the occupation of Iraq - and the announced commitment to an eventually racial state with its identity to be restricted to a certain category amid a majority that, in this case, should be suppressed on the grounds of defending this state's identity?
This commitment renders unjustifiable the Americans' objections to theocratic regimes.
Once more, America abjures what it calls on others to do.
VOTES SELLING CAUSES KUWAITI ELECTIONS ARENA TO FLARE UP!
Such a story has become so common in Kuwait these days when competition is in full swing and as people are looking forward to knowing who would win on July 5th, which points out the importance of money in the current election battle witnessed by Kuwait.
The arena flared up following that advertisement, which drove the society in charge of combating selling and buying votes in the elections to inform the police and file a lawsuit against the candidate with the judiciary.
The question, however, remains; what should a candidate who spends $10 million gain from becoming a deputy?
In a message to Muslim Brotherhood all over the world, Al-Hudaibi voiced surprise at Arab ruler's insistence on not responding to the voice of right, logic and interests. He said that the grave threats produced by the fierce American campaign on the Arabs and Muslims had embodied a concrete fact imposing itslef on the level of peoples, rulers and Islam as a creed and sharia (legislation).
Al-Hudaibi said, "The nation is undergoing a catastrophic reality represented in despotism, repression and internal submission that drained on its energy, impeded its march and boosted policies of its dispersion thus preventing its unity, progress and advancement and enabling the Americans to occupy two of its countries (Afghanistan and Iraq), acting to liquidate its causes and seeking in the meantime to sweep all its countries.
Freedoms are still confiscated; security bodies still exercise cruelties, intimidation and temptation. Corruption concepts are still rampant. People's repression still hinders their free movement in the right direction.
He wondered: Why have not those regimes taken any action since the fall? Only a national front, initiated by the opposition Al-Wafd, Tagamo'h (Grouping), Nasserite and Labour parties, has been formed ever since.
A political and economic reformation revolution should be launched, he said, calling on the regime to believe in the devolution of power principle.
The national front idea should be buttressed by everyone, or it will be just a paper in political literature archives, he said.
Under the amendments, the Premier will be granted the competence to add other bodies whether they practice the activities of an artificial person or a natural person.
He pointed out that there was a difference between confession and informing or giving information that would lead to unraveling the crime. He pointed out that he stood for all laws that protected the people's interests, pursued corruption and terrorism.
Surprisingly, Dr. Ahmed Fatehi Sorour said that a dead person's will could not include parts of his body. He pointed out that the will could include only money while the body is not money. Man does not own his body as only God Almighty owns it.
ZAKEYA FIRST WOMAN TO LEAD A PARTY IN EGYPT
4 MILLION DEPRESSIVES IN EGYPT
However, it is difficult to detect this disease in the developing countries where patients resort to superstitions explanations, incantations and charlatans to dismiss the spirits from the patients, they added.
They put their books and shoes aside and stand in lines behind their young imam as it is the time of worship in the American University in Cairo.
The phenomena of religiousness represented in the wearing of the veil by women and the wearing of shortened clothes by men along the lines of the good ancestors found its way to the university campus.
The veil is banned for security reasons".
The prohibition comes from America rather than Egypt.
Shuaib comments saying, "Frankly, it seems that we, as administration, did not realize the gradual infiltration of religiousness aspects.
A quick talk with tens of head-covered female students shows that the majority of them chose the path of "devoutness" after entering the university.
Sarrah, 21, attends lessons in a mosque once a week, while Enji, 20, prefers to attend religious lessons in a small meeting whose attendants do not exceed four or five to be held by rotation in her house and her colleagues' houses.
Mai, 20, a daughter of a high State official who wore the head cover after joining university, says "When a girl joins university and notices that many of the head-covered students wear stylish clothes, she becomes enthusiastic about the idea more and more".
That is why the administration bans the establishment of clubs under religious titles.
Muhannad, the religious and bearded university student, sees that the government thus blocks the road before the oppositionists under the name of Islam.
"I do not know how they pray but if they pray like us and need a place then this is their right, why not?" he said.
EGYPT RULES OUT POSSIBILITY OF RELEASING ISRAELI SPY AZZAM EVEN IN CASE OF BUSH'S MEDIATION
Asharq Al-Awsat learnt that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak would reemphasize to his American counterpart that the spy Azzam was detained after his involvement in espionage on behalf of the Mossad against a number of vital Egyptian targets and interests had been proved and that the judicial verdict was pronounced against him after a fair trial. The Egyptian judiciary's independence will also be emphasized as not even the Egyptian Presidency could interfere in its affairs.
Spokesman for Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) deputies in the People's Assembly Dr. Mohamed Mursi required that an urgent parliamentary investigation be done regarding the Ministry of Housing and Reconstruction squandering about LE21 billion (more than $4 billion) at one go.
STATE PROPERTY LIQUIDATED TO REDRESS BUDGET DEFICIT!
He added that the proceeds would be exploited for supporting the state public budget.
However, in his statement, the Minister of Finance did not specify the property which he is thinking of selling and by what means he intended to dispose of it.
Israel hinted yesterday (June 3th) at accepting a truce with armed Palestinian factions, particularly Hamas and the Islamic Jihad mediated by Palestinian Premier Abu Mazen.
On that basis, he met in Gaza with Hamas leaders, who are still discussing the issue.
It may be useful to recall that the Sharm El-Sheikh summit, which was sponsored by former U.S. president Bill Clinton in 1996 and attended by Arab leaders, condemned the Palestinian resistance as a "terrorist act".
The first Sharm El-Sheikh summit failed to stop resistance and martyrdom operations, and the second Sharm El-Sheikh summit will face the same fate. As long as occupation and settlement exist, Palestinian rights are usurped and Arabs are still insulted, the resistance will continue. It is unimportant whether America recognizes it as a resistance or insists on designating it as terrorism.
Al-Jabir said the project, declared in City University last month in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II, was aimed to provide a chance for Arab students to deal closely with their Israeli peers so that they could be acquainted with the problems, interests and hopes of each other.
Israeli authorities declined to name lawyer Anwar Zahaika's newborn baby after Saddam Hussein.
U.S. ALLOWS SYRIA TO REOPEN FRONTIERS WITH IRAQ
NASRULLAH SLASHES AT TWO "AMERICAN DICTATION" SUMMITS The Secretary General of Hizbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, made strong, blistering remarks against the two summits that were held at Sharm El Sheikh and Aqaba and against those who took part in them.
If Palestine were the private property of individuals, they would not give it up that easily.
"This is very, very, very serious talk, because it is being said at the time when the Palestinians and the Arabs are demanding the return of refugees. It simply means that there is no way for those refugees to return to Palestine."
"The description of resistance as Lebanese by Presidents Mohammad Khatami of Iran and Bashar Al Assad of Syria is not disowning of the resistance, but rather a true description of the entity of the resistance and its presence in Lebanon and Palestine.
MOROCCAN "JUSTICE AND DEVELOPMENT" DIDN'T LEARN LESSON OF ITS TURKISH COUNTERPART: RESEARCHER
A: Certainly these blasts moved us to a new stage. I think the atmosphere in Morocco will differ after 16 May bombings. I mean here the means to which opposition may resort, as the opposition in Morocco, whether political or religious, used to stage peaceful opposition and sparingly resorted to violence. However, we can confirm now that Morocco turned into another stage, which necessitates reconsidering the way of dealing with such developments.
The Salafi trend used to be a counter to the Islamic one.
There is a hard-line Salafi trend in Morocco, not as an organization, but rather as a concept or an ideology, which is called for through speeches delivered in mosques, cassette tapes and various writings.
They are influenced by the heresy thought. For me, I think that Zakaria Al-Meloudi or Youssef Fikry groups did not carry out Casablanca blasts. However, I see that some Salafi elements were actually polarized to implement such operations.
Every part seeks to exploit the incident for its own favour.
Actually, the party links itself to the Islamic points of reference. It should, however, pay attention to some balances in the society so long as there are laws organizing political action. There are also some political considerations.
To my mind, Abdel-Karim Al-Khatib tried to rectify this issue when he was asked about it. He replied that it is a Muslim party and even it is a mistake to term the Justice and Development Party as Islamic, according to an interview with him by a Moroccan newspaper.
Rashid Khashana, expert on North African affairs, wrote: The Arab Maghreb region is being swept by destructive winds whose aim is to eliminate moderate Islamic movements, under the pretext that the differences between armed groups and those Islamists who operate in the legitimate political field are based on illusion, not to mention the views of those who regard such differentiation as evidence of the naivete of those who have not yet wised up to the role-casting between the two wings.
This new state of affairs indicates a drastic change in the attitude towards Islamic currents that occurred with the 11 September 2001 events and has nearly eliminated the dividing line between peaceful Islamic movements and violent ones.
However, the bombing of the synagogue in Jerba, Tunisia, last year and the recent terrorist attacks in Morocco have shown that the Islamists of Maghreb have not allowed themselves to be dragged into the quagmire of violence despite the blows dealt to them by security agencies and the social and human suffering they have gone through. They have also shown that the culprits of the bombings represent isolated extremist groups that regard everybody else, including the moderate Islamists, as non-believers.
QATAR: INTELLIGENCE, INVESTIGATION CANCELLED
It also pointed out that the "new body enjoys a legal personality" This is the first step of its kind following the endorsement of the "Permanent Constitution" through a public referendum held on 29th April last. It is believed that it aimed at organizing work in this field and assigning one body for tackling these affairs instead of two bodies whose terms of reference may conflict or overlap.
He pointed out that his movement demanded that 40% of ministries offices be assigned to the South.
In his talk about the Sudanese "National" capital, he said, "Khartoum should be free of sharia during the transitional period.
He suggested that the ministries be divided into three categories: sovereign, productive and services. He said that the South percentage should be 40% in every ministerial category not as used to happen in the past when the South's representation used to take place in marginal ministries like the Ministry of Animal Resources.
EVIAN SUMMIT: ROAD MAP FOR SYRIA, LEBANON
The new map will urge Lebanon and Syria to get more involved to in the peace march in the region, he said.
The Sudanese government and political parties cannot concede such an inalienable business.
The statement said that the declaration had talked about a national capital where all religions are treated on equal footing for the sake of the country's unity. It added that the Islamic views of Al-Sadek Al-Mahdi could not be subjected to any speculations, nor could his endeavours in Islamic thought be denied.

The General Federation of Chambers of Commerce (GFCC) attributed such increase in price to the increase in the cost as a result of the hike of the rate of customs dollar, in addition to banks' failure to meet the needs of investors for opening documentary credits, thus doubling the cost of obtaining the dollar. The GFCC asked the government to necessarily discuss these circumstances with traders to protect the stability of markets and curb the phenomenon of dollar rate increase, particularly as the GFCC had monitored and mentioned such circumstances in a memo tabled to the minister of supply and domestic trade and the cabinet.

Moreover, oils are adulterated, unofficial plants are erected to package bad kinds of oils, which necessitates intensifying control.
Vegetable oil imports decreased to 30.8 thousand tons in 2001 versus 93.5 thousand tons in 1999.
Egypt's main exports to Canada are garments, coal, furniture, carpets, vegetables, urea, yarn, wooden statues and children's wear.
Israel ranked 22nd in the report's index and got a high human development mark, while Egypt had a moderate human development mark.
Egyptian authorities need to give accurate data, especially basic education enrolment rates.
LE10 BILLION ANNUAL WORK VALUE LOSSES
These facts were discovered by a study carried out over one year under the supervision of the Scientific Research Academy (SRA) and the Ministry of Administrative Development.
Following are the most important of these anomalies:
24 thousand laws and decrees The second of these anomalies is that the private cadre ranks, foremost of which is the police sector, went up from 214 thousand in 1971/72 to 700 thousands in 1997/98.
Costs of the governmental body operation hiked from 21.3 billion pounds in 1991/92 to 51 billion pounds in 1996/97.
1. Governmental buildings, 272 thousand in number, of different levels and types, not to mention public enterprise sector installations which hit over 54 thousands in number according to the 1996 census.
Government suffering Dr. Abdel-Khaleq Farouq emphasizes that the government still suffers from a democratic complex in its relation with citizens.
The study showed that the number of office days hit 208 per annum after applying the weekly two-day holiday system and, consequently, the number of holidays hit 157 throughout the year.
The hours wasted in the administrative body and the local administration other than the economic and service authorities amounted to two billion in number with total cost of 5.8 billion pounds.
Dr. Halim adds that the government work environment in Egypt is so bad and is characterized by chaos, haziness and inefficiency in addition to duality in work and contradiction in competence.
ARAB REGIMES UNABLE TO STOP TERRORISM
Violence also extended outside Palestine to include Nairobi, Mombassa, Dhahran, Riyadh, Rabat, Tunisia, Afghanistan, Iraq, and of course New York and Washington, as well as Atlanta and Bali, etc.
Those hawks singled out Saudi Arabia and Egypt to be given the lion's share of blame because these countries, as they claim, fell short of bridling extremism or even contributed to the promotion of extremism ideologies and allowed their media to promote hatred towards Israel, which was considered the strongest catalyst for terrorism.
The Arab governments have undoubtedly wronged themselves when they gave this impression because they made the people imagine that they fell short of fighting terrorism by giving wider freedoms of thought, organisation, and movement, which allowed the growth of a rebellious thought and active movements not to the liking of the government.
Therefore, the two ways could be merged so that Israel may benefit from the Arab experience and vice versa.
This is no easy achievement and all of us know the final result of this astonishing Iraqi superiority.
Therefore, Syrian victory over the Ikhwanite violence is not due to the usefulness of the used means but because the Muslim Brotherhood Movement itself rejected violence.
The current US Administration mixed greatly between its political differences with Muslims and the Islamic world and the phenomenon of terrorism.
By accident, just a few days before Sharm El-Sheikh summit, there was news about the arrest of a key suspect in the Olympiad explosions in Atlanta.
Regimes want to take fighting terrorism as a pretext for reducing the opportunities of political participation and the already limited freedom of expression. Meanwhile, the US wants to take war on terror as a cover for passing its projects for dominance.
Partnership and amalgamation The project explicitly includes the establishment of a U.S.- Middle East free trade zone. However, its strategic goals are meant to consecrate the new American sole power in the world through promoting the arguments of "partnership" and "amalgamation." It is known that the American reading of those two arguments is different from either that of the Arabs' or that of the Middle Eastern countries'. The material potentialities and political influence of the two parties are unequal due to the fact that one of them will definitely lose and have to surrender and widen the gap of its openness at the expense of its cultural national identity, material ability and political positions when it comes under pressure or even assault.
This means the recognition of the state of Israel in the region and establishment of transparent relations with it where the policies of the Arab partnership countries will be mixed up with the Israeli logic.
The American and Israeli discourse usually promote their products as a tool for conveying their own cultural values. They usually use the media to deepen such values in the fields of work and production. The thrust of this problem may be the cultural impact of the American-Israeli partnership project, as it is based on the centralized values of each of them.
First, the U.S. has to remove the impacts of the war from Iraq and revitalize its economy and put an end to military occupation.
The Palestinian resistance continued its painful strikes against the Israeli occupation army.
Markets, resorts, busses and overcrowded places were completely empty.
U.S. GIVES ISRAEL GREEN LIGHT TO LIQUIDATE HAMAS
Israeli deputy minister of defence told the Israeli Army Radio on Friday that Israel would not differentiate between the movement's political leaders or its military officials "as all of them are targeted due to being involved in perpetrating or plotting terrorist operations."
ISRAELI EDUCATION MINISTER: ISRAEL FOR JEWS ONLY, ARABS SHOULD EMIGRATE TO SYRIA

GADDAFI URGES CANCELING PUBLIC SECTOR AS "NOBODY IN LIBYA CAN UNDERSTAND IT"
He added that that would also apply to banks which should turn into collective property of Libyans without the state ownership so much so that each bank will be owned by a number of Libyans who will choose for it officials who will run it and be responsible for its profits and losses. The same thing will apply to airports, roads and other public utilities run by the state.
Saadeddin Ibrahim and his companions seemed to be keen on exploiting the enormous moral push they got after the center was acquitted by the Cassation Court of the charges launched against most of its personnel and customers by the authorities.

EGYPTIAN AMENDED PROJECT TO SIGN CONDITIONAL TRUCE BETWEEN PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS
Commenting on MPs discussions over the plan and budget of the new FY 2003/2004, Prime Minister Dr. Atef Ebeid exploded a number of surprises in figures, which were enough to respond to the whole inquiries that were raised during the discussions.

The file of the case against the ambassador, which demanded he be expelled, has expressed the feelings of a bracket of Egyptians who do not like the ambassador's acts or talks.

"I TOLD AMERICANS THAT REGIMES IN REGION HIDE BEHIND PALESTINIAN ISSUE," SADD EDDIN IBRAHIM
He appeared to have won a great political and moral backup from the U.S. officials in his recent tour as he said his center would normally resume its activities, adding that the board of trustees that runs the center would convene on Wednesday (June 11) evening.
On his activities in Egypt, he said he would normally carry out his activities in the country, denying that he might take anti-regime positions.
Muslim Brotherhood Group (Ikhwan) considered the assassination attempt that targeted Dr. Abdel-Aziz Al-Rantisi as a proof that peaceful solutions with Israel are futile. "The attack on Rantisi crowned a chain of criminal operations perpetrated by the Zionist enemy before, during and after Sharm El-Sheikh and Aqaba summits," said a statement by the group on Tuesday. "The sinful scheme and criminal intentions of Sharon and his gang came to the surface.
On the other hand, Hezbollah said that the sinful attack on Dr. Rantisi confirmed anew the hostile policy of the Zionists, a policy that is always carried out by successive Israeli governments, which always shirk any commitments, charters and agreements.
Gamal Mubarak will almost certainly pay a new visit to the American capital, Washington in the last week of June (this month).
The first visit extended for about two weeks from January 27th till February, 9th. It included a galaxy of journalists, party members, and diplomats like: Abdel-Muneim Saeed, Mahmoud Mohieddin and Dr. Osama Al-Baz. The visit is expected to include the same figures besides other faces from the National Democratic Party (NDP) Policy Committee, headed by Gamal Mubarak.
In what seemed to be a bid to render effective the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) call on the private sector to partake in the educational process, Policy Secretary Gamal Mubarak tasked the secretariat's committees with preparing proposals on educational, economic, health, youth, women and Egypt's foreign relations affairs. These proposals would be submitted to the NDP General Secretariat in preparation for referral to the NDP's next annual congress slated for September 2003.
Last year, addicts spent over 14 billion pounds on drugs, a figure which is seven times as much as the Suez Canal revenues that amount to 2 billion pounds annually, uncovered a study conducted by the National Planning Institute and supervised by Dr. Nadera Wahdan.
Thus, this does not encroach upon the creed of faithful worship of God. "It is religiously permissible and a kind of honour. There is no difference between establishing statues during persons' lives or after their death." Nonetheless, he laid it bare that it is better to direct such amounts of money towards construction of charities that carry their names to be beneficial to all people.
For his part, Islamic lawyer, Mamdouh Ismail said that such a change in the Islamic Group's ideology and orientations came in continuation of the serial of ideological reviews started by the Group a few years ago when an initiative to halt violence was taken in 1997, then publishing the four ideological review books at the beginning of last year.
The Islamic Group decided to abandon its old views and to come closer to Muslim Brotherhood Group ideology considered by observers as the main cloak under which hardline ideology advocates might project their thought. All this notwithstanding, the stage of hostility between the two groups seems to be unsurmountable.
In light of the occupation of Iraq and the remapping of the region through Arab rulers who are hostages to the American will and proved to be subject to American commands in both summits of Sharm El-Sheikh and Aqaba, in addition to the Christian Zionist Lobby in control of the American decision and those Egyptianized Americans who are playing a serious role which is apparently based on Copts' problems but in fact paves the way for America's intervention in Egypt's affairs.
The civil war that raged for over 15 years was only a result of such a structure. The current sectarian tensions are only another consequence.
The Lebanese model is the optimal model for implementing American-Israeli schemes to divide, break up and balkanize the region. The other solution adopted by the Egyptian marines group who promote the American commodity and advocate the new American religion, justifying the occupation of their homes. Those can not have the least allegiance to their homeland or the land. Their allegiance is solely to the dollar and their happiness lie only in American hegemony.
More importantly there are some Egyptianized who were once Egyptians and now hold American nationality to which they adhere and therefore play a suspicious role in its favour against the homeland under the pretext of the Copt's card. They are now playing in the open quite unequivocally with American protection that invested agents' acts with legitimacy! Allegiance to foreigners has become a value that entitle one to prestigious positions.
"Most Copts are marginalized, isolated, blockaded, odds and ends, neglected, drugged, excluded, asleep, timid, scattered and worried.
If he is entitled to boast of being Pharaonic, is that a preserve for Christians to the exclusion of Muslims? Does that Coptic epoch belong only to Christians or was it an epoch of Egyptian history which belongs to all Egyptians without exception?
Are Christians now being as persecuted as they used to be at the time of the Romans?
The senior writer of the American Watani newspaper then broached the subject of Coptic patriotism as they rejected Arab nationalism, regarding it as a prelude to Islamization of life and a structure for political Islam. Little did he remember that nationalism has always been at loggerheads with Islamists. The effects of such a confrontation can still be evident. In adopting such a stance towards nationalism, he actually adopts an American attitude announced by American marines in Egypt in promotion of the fall of nationalism vis-a-vis dividing alliances in the interest of America.
So what do those Americanized want and what role is being played by this sectarian newspaper?
Do you want the division of the homeland?
Abdel Alim said in the proposal tabled to the Parliament that Israel sought to repeat the scenario of stealing the subterranean water from the Negev Desert through prospecting for oil in Umm Rishrash.

Moreover, general guide of the group Ma'moun Al-Hudhaibi blasted "attempts to market and pass the roadmap and the US presence in Iraq", calling on all Arabs and Muslims to "boycott US and Israeli products".
"The American attempts to set roots in Iraq, confiscate its people's right to enjoy security and freedom, choose their government and exploit their resources should be met with denunciation from Arab rulers," Al-Hudhaibi said.
"Despite the great uproar that preceded Sharm El-Sheikh and Aqaba peace summits, US reassurances to follow up the roadmap peace plan, and the American trials to beautify the ugly American face in Iraq and official Arab media participation in promoting the roadmap peace plan, the US practices in Iraq were not marketed among Arab and Muslim peoples," the message said.
Since this chamber was founded in October 1981 (the same month when President Mubarak took office for the first time) to promote relations with America, members of this chamber have become big stars and have financed a number of NDP activities.

In Al-Batawin area and its outskirts, which used to be the whereabouts of the Sudanese who were residing in Iraq until recently, some young men stand carrying small bags or cases containing the latest drugs that reached Iraq including heroin, hashish and narcotic capsules which many Iraqi youths started to be addicted to.
Although the sources of such drugs are unknown, the Iraqi accusing fingers always point at the Mossad via Arab and foreign countries. Also, because the Iraqis, especially young men, are unaware of how to take such drugs, drug-vendors offer services to teach them the way of usage free of charge. They conclude deals to attract clients with special discounts for permanent clients.
POLITICAL ISLAM IN IRAQ WHERETO?
Such facts about political Islam organizations in post-Saddam Iraq make us raise some questions about their political map: what are their numbers, kinds and political ideas?
Facts say that the map of such organizations consists of the following:
Islamic Labour Organization, led by Hadi Al-Madrasi with Jawad Al-Attar as spokesman 6.
Iraqi Hezbollah 11. Kurdistani Hezbollah, founded in 1982 and disbanded on 16/5/2003 12.
Iraqi Islamic Party 16.
Islamic Movement in Kurdistan 20.
Muslim Brotherhood, general guide in Iraq is Dr. Osama Al-Tekriti 24.
Islamic Reconciliation Movement for Iraqi Turkmen, its members are Kurdish Shiites 28. Mosul Scholars Front The list is open-ended and organizations come one after the other. Future of Iraq, hauza and mosque 2.
presence. This will also increase their diversity and spread, a thing that explains the daily protests in Iraqi cities especially the Shiite holy ones (Najaf el-Ashraf and Kerbala) as well as in Baghdad. Such demonstrations mostly call for ending occupation and substituting it with the Hauza (semiar in Shiite law colleges) and the mosque in ruling the country. We may not be exaggerating if we say that in light of what is going on in Iraq and out of our reading of the growing and diverse Islamic scene, the future of the ruling of Iraq will be determined to a great extent at the thresholds of the mosque and Hauza in the political and movement senses.
This semicircular front of resistance that has been formed will abort the whole project of the U.S. in the region.
The "oilfields" and "Hauza" may turn into a fathomless political quagmire for all the U.S. schemes in the region that will be different in one way or another from Saddam quagmire.
Observers of the Iraqi scene today and the position of political Islam can also read an implicit and radical animosity to any rapprochement with Israel, something that upsets the U.S. to a great extent. One of the targets of such a war was to create a friendly, or even neutral, Iraq to Israel in the equation of the future conflict with it. Most obvious now is that such Islamic organizations with their diversity may agree on one thing only; impossible recognition, friendship, cooperation or even neutrality with Israel.
Secretary general of the front Hamza Mansour said in a message conveyed yesterday (11th June) to Premier Ali Abu Al-Raghib that the Islamists have information that the government grants the military and security men voting cards, in contradiction to the law which prevents those people from casting their votes. "Furthermore, the government insists on preventing the front's candidates from obtaining the lists of voters in their constituencies, even though other candidates obtained them," he added.
He went on to say that the front received information to the effect that security bodies summoned polling stations heads and warned them against objecting to some card holders casting their votes whatever the information recorded in their cards with respect to name, age and place of residence. "This emphasizes the news that large numbers of cards were illegitimately granted."

"Zoellick didn't criticize Egypt but rather the Egyptian economic policy. Anyway, we support easing rather than escalating the situation. I think that the U.S. administration appointed Zoellick in February 2001 to assign him the Middle Eastern file and plan, as he assumed main posts in the U.S. Department of Treasury, Department of State and the White House between 1985 and 1992," he said.

Al-Masimi didn't contest elections of her own volition, but rather the Islamic Action Front Party, the political wing of Muslim Brotherhood Group, asked her to do so. Her candidacy wasn't based on the woman quorum but to occupy one of the two seats of the first constituency in Al-Zarqaa city, i.e. she vies with male candidates first.
Q: What is your stance towards the government's determination to make every veiled woman take off her Niqab when voting in elections in order to verify her identity?
Q: Did the party impose the condition of your husband's approval for contesting elections?
A: No hawks opposed my candidature, but there was a controversy over this issue. There were pros and cons of fielding a woman in parliamentary elections, but the majority were for woman candidature.
A: I was fielded on the basis of a bonafide seat rather than the woman quorum as it is difficult for any woman to win the elections on the basis of woman quorum in Al-Zarqaa. This is because the woman quorum relies on a certain percentage of votes in a constituency, which is difficult to obtain in Al-Zarqaa.
A: I have no clan basis. Rather, I rely on the basis of the Islamic movement and the party along with my family which supports me. Q: The party fielded another Islamist in the same constituency, namely Ibrahim Al-Mashoukhi.
A: There is coordination with societies and organizations concerned with woman affairs. Forefront of these organizations is the Jordanian Woman Union which agrees with the Islamic movement in many issues, especially the political ones.
Q: What is your electoral blueprint?

The conference is expected to be held in the Dead Sea area in Jordan later this month.

jihad is on the things that have been shrouded in much ambiguity, being linked with terrorism. In this article, Dr Yousef Al Qaradawi removes some of the misunderstanding of Islam through his answers to the questions sent us by readers, as well as the comparison he holds between the tolerance of jihad in Islam and what the current Torah teaches about the ways of jihad.
A: The Holy Quran says: "Therefore, when you meet the Unbelievers (in fight), smite at their necks; at length, when you have thoroughly subdued them, bind (the captives) firmly: thereafter (is the time for) either generosity or ransom: until the war lays down its burdens." The Quran deems it sufficient to subdue the enemy, or only weaken it, and in that case the Muslims must bind their enemies, i.e. take them captives, not kill them.
Surely He orders that to protect the Children of Israel from worshiping idols, a thing that would certainly bring about their destruction.
Do not also rule out what the British and others did when they went to Australia to discover it, destroying its original people in the process. We have seen for our eyes what has been done by Zionist Jewish gangs on the land of Palestine: they have staged heinous genocide campaigns, ruthlessly slaughtering women, children, old people and innocent civilians. They have heeded not a single human consideration, gutting pregnant women and pulling out their embryos to mutilate them, killing sons in front of their fathers and fathers in front of their children. They have terrorized the Palestinians, who fled their homes in panic, leaving them to these terrorist butchers. These butchering criminals have been applying the teachings of the Torah that they have been taught: not to leave alive anything that breathes.
Q: How far does the Torah go in terms of doing evil to others?
In Numbers, 25, the Old Testament tells of how Moses killed the Israelites who had sexual intercourse with the Mobite women. In 2 Samuel 12, it says, "So David gathered his forces, went to Rabbah, attacked it, and conquered it.

STRICT ACTIONS AGAINST VIOLATOR IMAMS
WHO WILL SUCCEED POPE SHENOUDA?
The first article of this statute stipulates that once the patriarchal see is vacated because of the death of its occupier or any other reason, the Conclave and the Melli Council shall be convened upon a call by the oldest bishop in a date not more than 7 days of the see vacation to select a bishop succeeding the patriarch. A Presidential decree shall be issued to appoint this bishop to undertake the affairs of the patriarchy according to the laws, rules and traditions of the church until a patriarch is appointed.
Controversial talk among the church milieus speak about the possibility of disregarding the condition of impermissibility of the candidature of the bishops of archdiocese to the patriarch post along the lines of what has been done in the last two elections as per which late Pope Kirullos VI and Pope Shenouda III were elected. Other names will emerge and there will be ferocious competition among the bishops who have political, public and material influence over St. Mark See.
The Islamic deputies, he maintained, would also call for scrapping "temporary laws", especially those pertinent to elections, municipalities and public rallies, along with the acts chaining public freedoms as, he said, such laws are unconstitutional and uncivilized. They will also call for establishing a new constitutional court that may put an end to legislative chaos that created "time laws" in contrast with the constitution and national interests. Furthermore, restrictions on public freedoms, and overtaxing will absorb the Islamists' attention, he said.
Asked about the front's position on possible involvement in a new government, Mansour said the front might get engaged in such a makeup but under its own conditions. The front will join a government based on a belief and cannot commit itself to Wadi Araba where the Jordanian-Israeli peace agreement was signed in 1994.
Early this year, efforts were exerted to unite the candidatures of different Islamic groups in the 25 constituencies but to no avail.

It may be said that the power of the Islamic groups in some constituencies is ascribed to the influence of their candidates or deputies rather than their organizational presence or intellectual spread in different constituencies.

Let's imagine, for a while, that the Iranian Khomeinite regime has collapsed and a new democratic regime came to power in Tehran, What does this mean at the Iraqi level?
There are, at least, five reasons:
There is a partial political life left by the Iranian mullahs' regime.
Third: Iran will have, then, ended a religious-political stage and deposed theocracy without regret.
Fifth: Iran, even if its oil resources are less than those of Iraq, is far larger in space, population, middle class and qualified cadres whether inside Iran or in exile.
Some others always bias towards the Shiites against the Sunnis. In terms of politics, culture and civilization, such a change will be against the Arabs' weak weight and distorted image.

Rafah City Council sources affirmed that the wall is situated between Signal 5 and Zo'rob area which belongs to Egypt, a thing which runs counter to the Egyptian-Israeli peace accord and international laws and charters, the claimant said. Such a plot of land should be restored, and the Israeli government should pay 5 billion U.S. dollars as an amercement for serious damage inflicting upon the residents of Rafah, he demanded. The reparations, when obtained, should be used to restore cracked houses and erect new houses for those whose homes collapsed, and establish infrastructure.
The sources attributed Palestinian Premier Mahmoud Abbas' concern over Barghouthy's case to the latter's weight in the Palestinian street, something which might help effect the truce with Israel, at least for the part of Fatah cadres.

All this, in addition to failure of the pretexts under which the war had been launched, like Iraq's possession of mass destruction weapons, have led to shortening the wait and see stage which usually follows any occupation in its beginning and have caused the organization of a popular armed resistance in a way that surprised the White House leaders themselves.
Contrary to what usually happens in wars, such capacities were not totally annihilated by the war launched on Iraq, which if it had happened would have put off resistance till the gathering of capacities took place.
In a nutshell, the occupation policies and failure to execute its promises increased popular wrath and decreased the number of those sitting on the fence. This also dealt a blow to the pro-American opposition which bet on supporting the US, thus leading to the emergence of the Iraqi resistance which has all prerequisites for developing resistance performance.
Over 15 Islamic, liberal and independent candidates, including incumbent key assemblymen, launched their campaigns with concurrently calling for political reforms within both the government and its authorities, and the ruling family, which is a new aspect of the Kuwaiti election arena.

Under this headline, Al-Quds Al-Arabi published its editorial, which runs to the following effect: News coming from the Arab region is pessimistic and signals a stage of instability that may be developed to disturbances, civil wars and military coups.
The missiles that struck Future TV channel owned by the Lebanese-Saudi millionaire may be the most dangerous indicator, as such a strike reminds the Lebanese of the chaos and lack of security that dominated the Lebanese arena at the climax of the civil war.
In brief, the Arab region has become unstable and insecure. It is expected to witness violence rather than democratic orientations, inculcation of respect of human rights and self-expression and civil liberties.
BASHIR READY TO BE MARTYRED IN DEFENCE OF SHARIA
Bashir made his enthusiastic remarks following his meeting on Wednesday with leaders of the Popular Authority for Defence of Dogma and Homeland, which prepared for organizing a march to condemn the call for secularization of the capital Khartoum.

HAVE IRAQI SANDS STARTED TO 'QUAKE' UNDER US FORCES' FEET?
Meanwhile, disputes escalated inside the American Administration milieus over the Defence Ministry's preparations shortcomings which led to its failure to fill in the vacuum that ensued from toppling the Iraqi regime.
Matters have been made worse when Bremer ventured into dissolving all the state's institutions, ministries, army and security bodies in a bid which revealed Washington's intention not to renounce authority for the Iraqis in the foreseeable future. This had led to arousing the anger of the Iraqi street after that decision had set millions of Iraqis against the unknown!
This can be ascribed to several factors including the following:
- The availability of arms. 50 million weaponry pieces are reported to be in Iraqis' possession, a case unprecedented in any other country that had been occupied even though Iraq's area is 45 times as big as that of Lebanon, facing a military force less than that of the Israeli forces that swept Lebanon in 1982.
Over the last couple of weeks, over 200 out of 270 candidates for the outcoming Kuwaiti National Assembly (parliament) general elections have started their campaigns with mass rallies and feasts that drew more than 100,000 people, with the government and the current assembly whose term will come to a close next week ahead of the general voting scheduled to begin on July 5th having come under broadside.

To begin with Iraq, there are growing resistance operations against the U.S. presence. Counteractions carried out by the U.S. Army as a reaction to such resistance are also escalating. The U.S. forces killed over one hundred and twenty Iraqis during their attack on Al-Dolo'iya area and other areas in Al-Anbar governorate to the west of Iraq where attacks against U.S. forces were intensive and two Apaches were shot down.
Those who launched such missiles want to direct a message to more than one party to the effect that a certain stage terminated and another one started to rise to the surface. The characteristics of this new stage are, regrettably, violence.
The U.S. acts in Iraq and the collective massacres the marines started to perpetrate there under the pretext of cracking down on Baathist bands, the absolute support of similar Israeli massacres in occupied Palestine inflame violence, vengeance attitudes and reprisal.
He threatened to resort to war if he is obliged to cancel sharia.

While opposition parties are calling for a change, Al-Sherif decisively said that the NDP annual congress, which will be held next September, would consider partisan policies only and would not broach the issue of power rotation. This is considered decisive dismissal of recent rumours that had it that large-scale amendments would take place in the NDP ranks to continue the regeneration process that was launched last summer and resulted in President Mubarak's son Gamal assuming the NDP Policy Secretariat, which is considered the most prominent secretariat in the ruling party.
Both Arabic and old Coptic languages mark the Egyptian character, and to keep the Coptic language usable is aimed to preserve historical and religious heritage, though it is uneasy to apprehend and is an extinct language, Shenouda said.

US INDEPENDENCE DAY IN EGYPT BESIEGES CAIRENES IN THE STREETS!
Since the early morning cranes were often seen pulling citizens' cars to be mended away from the embassy's vicinity. Those, however, who were destined to work in a company, bank, embassy, or government department close to the American citadel, unfortunately found themselves quite incapable of reaching their destinations on foot as they were barred by cement barriers which blocked the roads and the iron barriers which met them in every direction, so much so that some of them had to head for the surrounding hotels in search of a space for their cars to park. Those parks' exorbitant prices just added to exasperation they had experienced due to the American Independence Day!
Some, however, were heard whispering about the liberty of Garden City dwellers who turned into captives of the embassy. Some others, of course, could be heard wondering, "Millions of the Iraqis who were not spared Saddam's cruelties fell prey to the Americans too!"

Most operative investment funds achieved a leap in their profits during the first half of the year instant, 12 times as high as their profits during the same period last year.
The managing director of the NBE's company for investment funds Essam Khalifa ascribed this leap to the fact that the first half of 2003 witnessed a considerable increase in the prices of most active shares due to the dominating tension in the Middle East following the end of the Iraqi war besides the emergence of new initiatives in the Palestinian crisis.

Dollar exchange rate in Egyptian black market increased to 6.30 pounds two days ago after it kept stable between 620 and 625 piasters for a month.
Secretary of exchange division Ali Al-Hariri said that the dollar rate will not exceed 7 pounds at the end of this year, pointing out that there is an improvement in the supplied quantities of dollars with exchange firms.

The statements made by both American bodies came at a time when a great sensation was created about some American investors wishing to liquidate their works in Egypt as a prelude to leaving it due to the "unfit" economic climate described by liberal political oppositionists as "investment repelling" and criticized by the American trade representative Robert Zoellick in the "World Economic Forum" in Jordan last month.
The official pointed out that such information only included the companies which were established under the law 203 the law of joint stock companies- excluding the American companies working in the field of petroleum and natural gas (representing about 65% of total American investments in Egypt).
The government currently considers taking a package of procedures which were demanded by the World Bank (WB) so as to release the 1-billion dollar loan which the WB agreed to grant to Egypt. These procedures include laying down a new program for economic reform in two or three years.
The program also seeks expediting the privatization procedures and selling the public enterprise sector's companies whose capital is mostly owned by the government.

BANKING SYSTEM TO GET RID OF OLD GUARD
Experts see that the change started on 17th December last with appointing Farouq Al-Okda as board chairman of the National Bank of Egypt (NBE) for three years and Mohamed Kamal Eddin Barakat as head of Banque Misr for the same period in addition to other appointments. Premier Atef Ebeid considered that these changes came within the framework of the national plan for modernizing public sector banks and the commitment to the regulations banning the appointment of any one after reaching the retirement age and the holding of two banks chairmanship at the same time.
For his part, board chairman of Misr-Romania Bank Abdel-Rahman Baraka sees that the about-face witnessed by the banking system is part of a strategy that the CBE along with the government seeks to complete with a view to meeting the requirements of work on the banking service market. This comes amid fierce competition on part of the major entities expected to vie with small local entities.
Youssef pointed out that the changes, though shocking to some people, activated the banking system producing development in light of the emergence of "globalization" of the banking activity control standards.
Minister of Supply and Domestic Trade Dr Hassan Khedr told Al-Ahram Al-Arabi that the Egyptian market is very effective and has 70 million consumers, pointing out that the government's policy aims to encourage competition between domestic trade companies which will reflect on creating commodities with high quality and at competitive prices.
Manager of Al-Fatim group in Egypt, Said Al-Tayer, said that the group investments hit around one billion pounds. The injection of another two billion pounds in new projects is under study, he noted, uncovering that the current investment projects of the group accommodate about one thousand direct job opportunities besides another one thousand indirect job openings through shops and transport services and whatnot. A third project (to be executed soon) is expected to provide 1500 direct and indirect job opportunities.
He ruled out the idea of opening stores in the heart of overcrowded cities in order not to compete with small and medium traders and wholesalers. Carrefour took account of rendering good services and depending on ramified suppliers' network.
Dr. Ghali stressed the importance of updating such labs so as to meet health control standards applicable worldwide within the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement.

$75 MILLION FROM WB TO EGYPTIAN PRIVATE SECTOR
ITALIAN COMPANY BIDS FOR EVOLVING EGYPTIAN BANKS
BANKING MILIEUS RULE OUT DOLLAR RATE EXCEEDING LE7 THIS YEAR
Deputy chairman of Foreign Currency Chamber in "Cairo Barclays Bank" Karam Solaiman confirmed that the dollar rise to 7 pounds in Egyptian markets is out of the question following the state of stability witnessed by markets and transferring the responsibility for monetary policy to the Cabinet.
The newspaper pointed out that the Pentagon wanted to promote military ties with certain allies such as Morocco and Tunisia as well as getting long-term facilities including American access to military bases in Mali and Algeria to routinely train personnel or crackdown on terrorists.
In an interview with the US European Command commander General James L. Jones last week, he said, "Africa, as shown by latest incidents, is a growing trouble," adding "as we pursue our fight against international terrorism, we will have to go as far as it takes us to finish terrorists".
We would stand prepared to cooperate with the USA in training African contingents in counter-terrorism to deal with that common challenges."
The decree was termed by economists as a "major step" that could serve local and foreign investment and dispel "fears" that the abrogated legislation, though inactive over the last couple of years, could have remained as a "sword of Damocles" over investors who were concerned that their dealing in foreign pieces of currencies could be interpreted as incompatible with regulations, thus coming under relevant sanctions.
Having discussed the chronic problems between the Sudanese government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) led by John Garang over dividing power and wealth, mediators from Inter-Governmental Authority for Development (IGAD) put up a secret paper to the two parties during their negotiations on Monday and asked both of them to give a reply to the paper in a week's time, diplomatic well-informed sources told Asharq Al-Awsat.
Although the South is one third of all the North, the mediators justified their proposal by arguing that the south had suffered from the destruction of war so that it deserves that percentage in order to keep abreast of the development process.
Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad said his country has not asked to be "included" in the roadmap peace plan designed for the Palestinian course, calling for a "mechanism to resume negotiations on the Syrian course stalled three years ago".
Larsen has earlier announced that the roadmap included the Syrian and Lebanese courses, while Syria announced it would "accept what the Palestinians accept", without objecting to any "progress" made on the Palestinian course that could alleviate Palestinian people's sufferings.
BREMER WANTS TO BELONG TO EUPHRATES CLANS, BUT MARRIAGE CONTRACT IS STIPULATED!
The clan chiefs crowded as guests in their senior sheikh's hospitality, a grandson of Abd El Wahid Al Shukkari, leader of the 1920 Revolution that drove out the British from Iraq. They received Bremer and the delegation in his escort with every cordiality.
"There are certain conditions for belonging to our clans - including intermarriage, through either marrying one of our daughters or letting our sons marry girls or women from your own family," the clan chief said.
Vis-a-vis that polite refusal, Bremer fell silent and in embarrassment just thanked his hosts for their hospitality and left without having the surname Hassan added to his name, as he had wished!
On the other hand, killing Iraqi nationals, nabbing them on allegations of being operatives of the ousted regime is still a sort of transgression.
Moreover, there is no need currently to search for pretexts for that war as long as 'what is done is done'. Postwar Iraq will go now to the background and uprooting the Iraqi resistance would come to the foreground.
The Americans can get preoccupied with released cassette tapes more than alleged weapons of mass destruction.
ISRAEL, PAKISTAN AND TARGETING THE ISLAMIC WORLD
Israel started the game by intensifying pressure on Pakistan prior to Afghanistan campaign, involving Pakistani-American cooperation in that pressure as a means of disciplining Pakistani attitudes.
In fact, Pakistan has gone through many a difficulty and faced many a challenge both inside and outside the country. The Pakistanis tried to look to the Arab world for mutual support so that that world might back Pakistan against India, while India backs that world against Israel. In spite of the fact that the American-Pakistani alliance has been of basic importance since Pakistan was established, and regardless of all the differences and contradictions, America has absolutely relied on Pakistan twice at least when American dignity completely hinged on Pakistan: once when the Soviets in Afghanistan had to be confronted in what was known then as Soviet Vietnam, which contributed, inter alia, to finishing the Soviet Empire, which was the ultimate goal of the USA.
Pakistan, in return, would guarantee an end of the conflict with India at the expense of Kashmir, as well as some American assistance and perhaps an escape from American censure of the internal developments in Pakistan.
Israel has done very well in that regard, while Iran has become alone in the field, which is very much unlike its experience during the Iranian-Iraqi war when it held ground and repelled the Iraqi aggression for 8 years.
The American absolute support of such a scheme is more zealous than Israel for eliminating and liquidating Hamas even though Israel stressed it would honour its truce with it! It was not, furthermore, mere coincidence for Pervez Musharraf to announce in Washington in the last week of June 2003 that he was considering the American demand to establish diplomatic relations with Israel!
This will assure Israel of annulling the efficacy of the Islamic Conference just as it was assured of Arab League attrition and crisis aggravation.
In reply we say, there is a big difference between Israel acting in public and its secret action through the USA as establishing diplomatic relations with Pakistan would ensure its diplomatic relations with other countries too.
The Pentagon is willing to reinforce military ties with Morocco and Tunisia, and to gain access to long-term potential to tap into military bases in countries like Mali and Algeria in attacking terrorist sites or carrying out war games and exercises.
EGYPTIAN EMBASSY IN TEL AVIV CANCELS PARTY RECEIVING ISRAELI OFFICIALS ON Asharq Al-Awsat learnt that the Egyptian embassy in Tel Aviv had cancelled the regular reception party organized every year to mark the anniversary of the July 23rd, 1952 Revolution. According to Asharq Al-Awsat information, this cancellation was caused by the Egyptian indignation about the Israeli policy regarding the Palestinian issue.
An Egyptian source told Asharq Al-Awsat that the fact that all armed Palestinian organizations joined the truce agreement is a historic unprecedented development in the Palestinian position.
It is noteworthy that the Egyptian embassy used to give that party on the occasion of July 23rd and to invite most Israeli political leaders every year.
A few days prior to the official inauguration of the Egyptian-Jordanian gas pipeline project, which extends between Jordanian Aqaba and Egyptian Taba and which is slated for inauguration on July 27th to transport Egyptian natural gas to Jordan, the Administrative Judicial Court with the State Council set July 26th for examining a lawsuit filed by veteran lawyer Abdel-Halim Ramadan against the government, calling for stopping the implementation of the project and even cancelling it on the grounds that Israel may make use of it because it is near to Israel. He called on the government to conduct a plebiscite over the continuation of this project.
In a seminar held by the Shooting Club in Alexandria yesterday on educational policy in Egypt, he pointed out that there was a wide gap between Egypt's expenditure on basic education and other countries' expenditure.
The Sudanese problem is running deeper due to a major conspiracy being devised against the Arab country.
Such laws, together with other decisions, only mean a yen to have a breakaway state. The argument that they only come as preparations for a potential state if the southerners say "yes" in a possible self-determination referendum pursuant to the Machakos Agreement can be rebutted by responding that such arrangements are not timely since the referendum will be carried out after the six-year transitional period.
Thus, practically, the south will get its total independence, while its representative will jointly run northern affairs, he said astonishingly.
An Egyptian stormed into the American University building in Cairo and at the top of his voice asked to meet the biggest official in the university to inform him about the whereabouts of the deposed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. He stressed that he would not utter a word before he received the $25 million reward set for the purpose.
A new crisis cropped up between Al-Azhar and the Ministry of Culture when the former's scholars criticized the researches and discussions of the 3-day conference held early this month and called for by Minister of Culture Dr Farouq Hosni under the rubric of "Towards new Arab cultural discourse from present challenges to future vistas".
INTEGRATED CITY FOR ARTS AND TRADITIONAL CRAFTS
The minister added that the database prepared by his ministry on the traditional and environmental products would be made use of.
Unemployment has exacerbated, local currency retreated and its decline is still on. Inflation rates went up and all attempts to raise the value of exports and growth rates failed.
Even private projects, on which the market is based, are different, he added, indicating that these companies are big ones with giant entities in capitalist countries. But in Egypt the latest statistics affirm that 93% of the existing economic institutions have under 5-worker workforce; i.e. they are micro-institutions. The institutions comprising less than ten workers constitute 98%. They mostly offer simple services either in shops or retail.
Over fifty years the role of planning in Egypt has been confined to sheer change dependent on the political decision taken by the authority. It was not comprehensive planning as the planners were often surprised at decisions that turn their plans upside down. Even when planning depends on private sector perspective role complementary to development, it fails to pay attention to the fact that the private sector is not trustworthy enough.
She added that the expectations indicate that the rate of Egyptian economy absorption hit 350 thousand workers annually while the annual increase in labour volume is estimated at about 638 thousand worker. The margin between the two figures will join unemployment power.
LE10 BILLION ANNUAL WORK VALUE LOSSES
These facts were discovered by a study carried out over one year under the supervision of the Scientific Research Academy (SRA) and the Ministry of Administrative Development.
Following are the most important of these anomalies:
24 thousand laws and decrees The second of these anomalies is that the private cadre ranks, foremost of which is the police sector, went up from 214 thousand in 1971/72 to 700 thousands in 1997/98.
Costs of the governmental body operation hiked from 21.3 billion pounds in 1991/92 to 51 billion pounds in 1996/97.
1. Governmental buildings, 272 thousand in number, of different levels and types, not to mention public enterprise sector installations which hit over 54 thousands in number according to the 1996 census.
Government suffering Dr. Abdel-Khaleq Farouq emphasizes that the government still suffers from a democratic complex in its relation with citizens.
The study showed that the number of office days hit 208 per annum after applying the weekly two-day holiday system and, consequently, the number of holidays hit 157 throughout the year.
The hours wasted in the administrative body and the local administration other than the economic and service authorities amounted to two billion in number with total cost of 5.8 billion pounds.
Dr. Halim adds that the government work environment in Egypt is so bad and is characterized by chaos, haziness and inefficiency in addition to duality in work and contradiction in competence.
AL-HUDHAIBI CRITICIZES AMERICA, EMPHASIZES INEVITABILITY OF JIHAD!
He also denounced the USA attempts to exercise pressure on Arab and Muslim rulers and urge them to change educational curricula, delete Jihad Koranic verses, the prophet's traditions and all that underlines the identity and character of peoples.
Al-Hudhaibi concluded his message by saying: "the roadmap and American political settlement schemes are only projects to serve the purposes and ends of American policy and meanwhile serve the interests of the Zionist entity, aggression and expansionism, at the expense of the existence and destiny of the Arabs and Muslims' sanctities and civilizational role.
He was astonished that some Islamists who are living abroad lashed the Jamaa Islamia. " Members of Jihad Group led by Dr. Ayman Al-Zawahri - who are detained in Egyptian prisons supported the peaceful attitude and tried to follow suit," he told Al-Hayat.
The new council to be under the Shura Council will include 27 members to be selected from among public legal and political figures, human rights advocates and opposition party leaders.
However, the council may involve no cabinet ministers or officials just to ensure its independence. Once made up, the council, which will receive and investigate human rights violation reports, will convene to select a board and permanent secretariat.
Some sources expected that the election of the Egyptian Press Syndicate will be held in the coming few days.
AIDED BY UNDP, EGYPT TO CREATE WOMEN'S POLITICAL QUALIFICATION CENTER
It will also provide for training those women who already exercise public activities, including political parties and NGO, in a bid to create political cadres able to exercise political action, as well as female employees and young ladies yearning for political involvement. They are also to be trained in communications, and leadership skills, and be educated about election laws and social and economic conditions, with a guide to be released under the title "How to Run an Election Campaign".
The Egyptian Engineers Syndicate commenced moves similar to a sudden uprising after imposing receivership on it for 8 years, during which more than 350 thousand engineers made strenuous efforts to hold a general assembly and free elections to lift such receivership.
He pointed out that engineers received a lot of promises to hold elections. "Nevertheless, these promises were mirage and meant only to calm us down. So, we started to practice collective pressure to hold a general assembly to be attended by all engineers."
Egypt had the 120th place in the 2003 Human Development Report, released by the UN Development Program while it was the 115th in the previous year's report which included 175 countries.
Egypt's per capita quota of the gross domestic product (GDP) amounts to 3.5 US dollars on a daily basis, and average lifespan is 68 years.
Women's empowerment should be buttressed in Egypt, it recommended, pointing to major drops in this area, particularly concerning political rights, in 2002 and 2003.
Member of the Egyptian delegation Dr. Mohamed Abdel Maksud said, following his return home, that the committee decided to refer Jerusalem and Rumida Hill site (Hebron) to the next meetings of the committee slated for next year in China. Israel established a settlement in that site and the occupation forces seek to add that site to their alleged archeological sites, he said.
High-ranking political Israeli sources hinted that Israel might show some flexibility concerning releasing a larger number of Palestinian detainees in case the US released Jewish-American spy Jonathan Polard and Egypt followed suit and released Israeli spy Azzam Azzam who is serving a prison sentence after he had been indicted for collaboration with Israel.
WILL ISRAEL START A WATER WAR WITH LEBANON?
US Congressman Darrel Issa, who is of Lebanese descent, surprised his Lebanese hosts during the talks with Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri by revealing a project spearheaded by himself. On the surface, the project appeared to aim at helping Lebanon make better use of its water, some of which goes unused into the sea, while in fact it would pave the way for a new state of affairs that Issa dubbed as using additional quantities of water for sharing or distribution among regional countries. It is a certainty that the first beneficiary of such a project is Israel.
The German connection Another surprise that awaited the Lebanese was delivered by Joschka Fischer, Germany's Minister of Foreign Affairs, who also raised the water issue during his recent talks in the region.
There were calls at that time for Israel's future borders to extend up to course of the Litani, but on the eve of drawing the map of the mandate, France refused that, insisting on having the border drawn as it is today, i.e. along what is known as the Blue Line. However, Israeli claims have remained alive and pressing, in a bid to get Lebanese water. This has been evident in Israel's bids to prevent Lebanon from pumping part of the water of Al Wazzani River, despite the fact that the drawn quantities do not meet the needs of some southern Lebanese villages. Moreover, during the talks that pave the way for what later became known as the 17 May 1983 Agreement, Israel tried, while it was still occupying half of Lebanon's territories and deploying its forces around the Lebanese capital, to force the then Lebanese Government to accept a version of the agreement that contained veiled mentions of sharing the Litani water.
For his part, Minister of Public Works and Water Resources Dr. Mahmoud Abu Zeid, in his capacity as head of the International Council for Water said that the Council was carefully monitoring what Israel could do in Iraq regarding the water issue.
HAMAS LEADER: WE ADHERE TO SUSPENSION OF COMMANDO OPERATIONS
For the movement, the issue of prisoners is a red line which cannot be bypassed in any way or form, he added.
Al-Hayat learnt from Egyptian sources that the visit came according to the directives of President Hosni Mubarak who issued statements two days ago concerning the issue of the Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons.
As of yesterday morning, Palestinian police and Gaza municipality proceeded to remove all graffiti on the city walls.
This step is similar to what was done by the PNA in 1994 in the wake of Oslo agreement when it painted all walls in the West Bank and Gaza Strip white, thus signaling the end of Intifada and the beginning of the era of the PNA and negotiations.
U.S. Ambassador in Riyadh Robert Gordon has become the common denominator in most political forums in Saudi Arabia at present.
It is enough to select a king from the first generation."
Gordon is not an ordinary ambassador. He is considered a close friend of U.S. President George Bush, so that many people considered that his words may be reflection of the ideas of Bush and his administration.
The U.S. ambassador's talk about appointing a crown prince from the second generation means closing the door before those sons of late king Abdel-Aziz. And opening it before an army of highly qualified young princes who are mostly educated in the West.
In this context, they point to Prince Bandar bin Sultan, Saudi Ambassador to Washington and Prince Khalid bin Sultan, Assistant Defence Minister who is currently in charge of upgrading Saudi armed forces.
JEWISH ORGANIZATION ACCUSES SUZANNE MUBARAK OF SPONSORING ANTI-SEMITIC BOOKS
In a report issued on Monday, the organization accused Egyptian first lady Suzanne Mubarak, who sponsors the Reading For All series, of having a series of books released including anti-Semitic material and lauding suicide-bombers against Israeli civilians.
Qoaita described that as extremely dangerous to the future of Egypt on the domestic level.
It is worth mentioning that Minister of Administrative Development Mohamed Zaki Abu Amer had revealed the preparation of a draft law for the new employment name of assistant ministers. Official decrees will be passed soon for their appointment. Those assistant ministers received training in the American Harvard University. The new draft law will stipulate their responsibilities, competences, financial degrees and pay.
However, he strictly stressed that "no one imposed on us any thing in that regard as we are a democratic country and do not allow anybody to impose their guardianship on us."
Al-Baz described the demand of some people to halt any contacts with Washington as "wrong thinking".
As regards the delegations efforts to highlight Egypt's realistic image before the hardliner American centers, particularly as far as democracy is concerned, Al-Baz negated that such centers concentrated on that topic particularly, while the talk did not focus on Egypt.
Thus, Egypt has joined the countries that support Americas efforts to escape international justice and enjoy a special status that would relieve it from legal liability for any crimes committed by American citizens or soldiers in violation of international law and Geneva conventions.
The pretext that America has used in opposing the Rome Agreement is that it lacks guarantees that preclude its exploitation for political reasons.
The Egyptian attitude will certainly be surprising if Egypt finds itself faced with war crimes committed by American troops here or there.
POVERTY IN EGYPT
He laid it bare that the poorest 30% of the population used to possess 10% of income in 1995. In 2000 their share of the income retreated to 7.7% only. This means that poverty aggravates among poor classes that have the highest growth rate.
Yesterday, American sources told Asharq Al-Awsat that following receiving information about the existence of a white powder suspected to contain anthrax in the American Cultural Center in Alexandria, the American ambassador to Cairo David Welch ordered to launch a full-scale investigation with security companies operating in the embassy.
The results of the analysis were not announced until yesterday evening.
The sources, however, emphasized that Cairo had handed Tehran lists including the names and whereabouts of a number of the Egyptian Jamaa Islamia (Islamic Group) leaders, their code names and their contacts with their followers inside and outside Egypt. However, the Iranian authorities did not respond to such demands and denied the existence of any Egyptian fundamentalists on its soil, the sources added.
The Egyptian Ministry of Wakfs (Religious Endowments) has designed a plan for religious awareness in summer for mosques, youth centers and workers and youth gatherings. The plan will be contributed to by keynote scholars and Islamic advocates.
Minister of Youth and Sports Dr. Ali Eddin Hilal has called for setting up the first stock exchange for footballers in order to implement clear-cut policies, principles and bases for genuine professionalism away from speculation operations of buying players for raising the standard of the first popular game in Egypt.
ISRAEL STARTS FORMING KURDISH ARMY IN NORTH IRAQ
They pointed out that Israel agreed that its officers would continue training the Kurds to teach them combating arts to form the nucleus of the Kurdish state, the establishment of which in North Iraq is supported by Israel.
He stressed that the Israeli movements in Iraq are made with the knowledge and approval of the USA and Britain.
Israeli and Arab observers linked that escalation to the detention of Islamic movement leaders inside the green line and Al-Aqsa Sheikh Raed Salah over one month ago. Arab deputy in Knesset, Abdul-Malek Dahamsha said that that was another step in the war on Islam declared by the American President George Bush and supported by Israeli Premier Ariel Sharon.
PALESTINIAN REFUGEES REFUSED TO BE SETTLED IN IRAQ
The camp refugees refused to return to Iraq because it became an occupied country, Asfour said, adding that they asked for returning to their homeland Palestine. In case they couldn't return to Palestine, they wish to immigrate to European countries, which would give them asylum till the Palestinian cause is settled.
He pointed out that he represents the Roman Catholic Church in all the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries except for Kuwait, adding that all these countries allowed the establishment of churches except for Saudi Arabia.
The Yemeni Grouping for Reform party (Islah) is one of the Islamic factions close to power. It is now the main opposition force in the House of Representatives (parliament). It maintained its position for two successive times. It participated earlier in main ministerial posts in a government coalition.
A: Islah is one of the Islamic movement factions which is renowned for centerism and moderation in the Yemeni arena and to some extent in the Islamic and international arenas. This emanates from its concept of Islam, as it adopted this approach since it has declared itself on 13th September 1990 following the Yemeni unity.
A sole political violence action has never been registered on our own part.
A lot of Islamic movements were indeed harmed after this day.
Such an imbalance sometimes leads to disapproved positions.
Islah is no longer the sole party to claim these ambitions, as there is no discrepancy between Islah and the rest of political forces in the Yemeni arena in terms of principle or methodology. Nevertheless, it is a discord of program that lies between us and the other political forces as all of these forces and organizations abide by the constitution, whose articles emanate from Islamic sharia. They also abide by the law on parties, which stipulated that slogans, principles and methods of any Yemeni party not run counter to the Islamic sharia.
Disagreements Q: Although you said there is no discord between your party and the other political parties and forces, you declined to participate in a coalition with a party that doesnt abide by your program, what does this mean?
We were committed in our blueprint to reforming the economic position. And any breach of this commitment, our program or our suggested economic solutions in return for coalition with any other party will be paradoxical with our credibility with our people. We have our own clear-cut economic, social and political views, which any party wanting to form a coalition with us must abide by first.
Secondly, there are the treasury bonds, which are considered a usurious activity that impeded the economic progress as many traders deposit these bonds in banks and obtain usurious interest. These bonds yield 30-40 billion riyals annually.
Added to this are taxes and customs duties. In a nutshell, we can find tremendous potentialities in Yemen that need only to be used in good conscience.
We, in Yemen, differ from them as all our legislations are Islamic and the West, friends and brothers deal with us constitutionally and legally via acknowledged institutions.
These deposits were owned by the people of Quraish who fought and expelled the Prophet. This means that Muslims should commit themselves to and preserve the interests of the others.
Enlarging extremism Q: The US accused Yemen of begetting or harbouring al-Qaeda elements after Afghanistan, how do you reply?
We, whether as opposition or rulers, refuse any act of sabotage that is detrimental to the national interest.
If we have a look at the life of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), we will find that shura was clear in all the aspects of his life, peace and war alike. Electoral process was also clear when Caliphs Abu-Bakr, Omar, Othman and Ali were elected for caliphate.
NUCLEAR BOMB IN ISLAMIC WORLD; OPINIONS OF ISLAMIC SCHOLARS
In other words, if Kharazi wants to say that the Islamic law (sharia) prohibits the possession of a nuclear weapon, how could the Islamic Republic of Iran, then, be accused of possessing such a weapon?
Q- As you are an authority in jurisprudence, on which principle did Minister Kharazi base his argument that Islam prohibits the possession of nuclear weapons? A- Minister Kharazi speaks on behalf of the state.
Q- From the sharia point of view, when will a decision of possessing nuclear weapons be taken?
I'd like here to emphasize that Islam always calls for peace, security and international justice. It primarily prohibits producing such weapons, which cause the biggest harm to innocent civilians and destroy land and people. The Islamic principles provide for not acquiring such weapons so that people could avert their dangers. Besides, the Islamic sharia prohibits the killing of civilians, the demolition of houses, attacking women, children and the old people, cutting trees in the enemy's territories to the end of the Islamic moral principles on which the rules of fighting in Islam are based.
A- We have refused this absolutely. The official bodies announced that they consider the matter in light of the constants of the national independence and interests. We're committed to signing the IAEA treaty. All our programmes are transparent, but the U.S. makes such turmoil over the Iranian nuclear programme and tries, through its influence, to incite the international community and public opinion against us, while it knows well that Iran hasn't any unannounced nuclear programme.
Q- If the current balances of power are reversed and we supposed that the Islamic countries were the great power in the world, what would they do concerning the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction by others?
Rumours had it that the project might be frozen due to American pressure. In response to such romours, Pakistani Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Jamali said that nobody in the country thought of taking such a dangerous decision.
On the other hand, head of the Pakistani Islamic Shiite Movement Sajid Naqwi told Al-Majalla that Islam encourages the establishment of military capabilities in order to square up to and deter the enemy. The Pakistani government should take every possible means to protect its people and land, he added.
"The Islamic countries' decision to acquire nuclear power is subject to the balance of 'interests and evil' or the means of achieving good and warding off causes of corruption and evil," said Sheikh Dr. Abdullah bin Beyyah, former Mauritanian Minister of Justice in the seventies and expert in the International Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) Academy affiliated to the Organization of Islamic Conference.
They should also deal with the pressure brought by the U.S. to bear on any country that wants to acquire nuclear weapons.
"I agree in principle with the argument that the Islamic principles disapprove of the acquisition of such kind of weapons of mass destruction because God does not like causing havoc.
Regarding Islam's perspective of acquiring a nuclear bomb, he said the Quran is very obvious in this regard as God says, "And make ready against them all you can of power, including steeds of war to threaten the enemy of Allah and your enemy," he added.
In its final session on Monday, Kuwaiti National Assembly endorsed the state's public budget of the FY 2003/2004 although the Financial Committee made a recommendation not to endorse it.
Kuwaiti diplomatic sources said yesterday (29th June) that Kuwait informed Iran of its keenness to close the sea border file suspended a long time ago.
The Kuwaiti Salafi movement has demanded that foreign military presence in the region be dispensed with and be replaced by a Gulf force to protect its countries from any external aggressions.
SYRIA TO SEPARATE RULE FROM POLITICAL AFFILIATION TO BAATH PARTY
Yesterday (2nd July), President Bashar Al-Assad issued an amnesty for the prisoners who committed crimes before 10/6/2003. The decree includes forgiving all misdemeanors and army-deserting cases.
The new contract will secure fresh oil discoveries.
"There are many other oilfields that will be put up for development in the future, in addition to many other fresh prospecting sites. The new contract includes new conditions related to the contract period. The rate of distributing quotas will be negotiated after the new production."
He said, "There is no reason why we should be more Palestinians than the Palestinians themselves or more Catholics than the Pope John Paul II".
Pakistani Islamic groups had shown strong objection to the establishment of any kind of relations with Israel.
US DEPARTMENT OF STATE TO LAUNCH ITS ARABIC SATELLITE CHANNEL EARLY 2004
The finance of the Middle East Television Network at a value of 30 million dollars was added earlier this year to the draft budget of the year 2004.
President Hosni Mubarak sent on Friday his special task man and chief of the General Intelligence Omar Sulaiman to the Palestinian territories, in a mission described by Egyptian and Palestinian milieus as urgent, sensitive and meant to patch up the internal rifts in Fatah and convince Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas (Abu-Mazen) of backtracking on his resignation from Fatah's Central Committee.
On the other hand, high-ranking Egyptian and Palestinian sources said the Egyptian security delegation seeks to firm up the declared truce between the Palestinian and Israeli parties. The delegation called on all Palestinian factions to extend the truce for six months instead of three months in order to create an atmosphere proper for bringing the "roadmap" into effect and give the opportunity to the contacts made by Cairo with the U.S. administration and Sahron's government to release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.
Washington stressed that it doesn't intend to leave its forces in Iraq for long and that backing the governing council would be a first step for completing the potential of the Iraqi state, the sources said.
MPs DEMAND THAT ISRAEL NOT BE ALLOWED TO SEARCH FOR ITS MIAs' CORPSES TILL POW'S ISSUE IS RESOLVED
The deputies, in the forefront of whom was Al-Badri Farghali said, "Granting Israel approval to search for its MIAs' corpses should be linked to an agreement to be signed by the two parties under which financial compensation are paid to the families of Egyptian POW's. They pointed out that the compensation value should not be less than $3 billion. An official apology should also be declared to the Egyptian people for that heinous crime that runs counter to the simplest of human rights in return for allowing Israel to search for its MIAs provided that such search is conducted under strict Egyptian supervision by competent bodies.
They also will mull over a proposal to allocate a share of Zakat (alms) funds to contribute to procurement of that sum beside the allocations of the fund from the state budget and subscriptions of housing unit owners in addition to donations and gifts.
On the other hand, specifications of the two insurance policies, namely temporary life insurance policy and housing unit insurance policy, required by the real estate finance law, have been set to ensure payment of the total value of the house whether in case of the owner's death or the destruction of the whole unit.
The lawsuit, filed by famous lawyer Isam al-Islamboli, stressed that "the house should be set in order."
Commenting on the case, Dr. Atef Al-Banna, a professor of constitutional law said that Article 139 shows that the veep appointment is compulsory.
The new bill is meant to develop parliamentary life, expand political participation of all society brackets, consolidate democratic practice, and respect voters' right and freedom to choose their representatives without any interference or pressure, the sources said.
The question which haunts the Egyptians regarding Gamal Mubarak's mysterious role in public policy is: Does he represent the generation of youth and the middle aged as they say? His recent statement as chairman of the National Democratic Party's (NDP) Policy Committee surprised the Egyptians, especially the generations, which, according to him, he represented. In most of his statements, he underlined that he represented a generation that advocated reform in Egypt. This was not the first time for him to say that. In a lecture he gave in the American University in Cairo, he pointed out his political vision and tendencies and urged minimizing free education and medical treatment while mostly ignoring important issues especially Egypt's Arabism and pivotal role in the Arab nation and the Palestinian cause.
People's Assembly deputy Dr. Ayman Nour said, "I belong to Gamal Mubarak's generation in terms of age or age group. It is a generation, nonetheless, that is most unlucky as it is deprived of all chances to rise. The older generation do not allow any space for new generations.
Where is, then, the alleged regeneration?
Nasserite Party Organization Secretary, Gamal Abdel-Nasser Ewais says that Gamal Mubarak relations with public action is still simple compared with other youths of the same generation. His relation with public action is now linked to his partisan role. If he regards himself as a representative of the new generation, his social vision fall short of that purpose as he calls for canceling free education in Egypt where the scourge of illiteracy is aggravating. He urges further privatization while the unemployment queue reached over five million jobless youths in the country.
He added that Gamal Mubarak should have addressed his Washington statements to the Egyptian people and subjected his concepts to public discussion and listened, meanwhile, to other opposite ideas.
The reform issues meant by Dr. Al-Eryan are not the National Council for Human Rights, or the cancellation of state security courts or hard labour punishment as it is unreasonable to cancel state security courts and retain Supreme State Security Court (Emergency) or to cancel hard labour penalty while keeping torture in prisons and police stations, which calls for all-out reform measures rather than formal procedures.
He, according to Abdel-Aziz, is capable of running extensive sectors and he himself has ruled out the possibility of taking over power as his main interest or realm lies in economy and policies.
Firstly, both of us, your Excellency and me are citizens quite equal to all other citizens in rights and duties, according to the constitution.
I, consequently, wished you had not assumed the position of the Policy Committee Secretary but rather contented yourself with practising partisan activity just like any other party member.
There is, consequently, some kind of duality in undertaking such a duty.
Frankly speaking, there are many Arab rulers who firmly believe that they derive their power and stability from the USA satisfaction with them and their obsequiousness regarding its demands rather than from their peoples' support as those peoples' docility have been ensured through oppression, emergency laws, republican guard or royal guard as well as central security forces with their police dogs, armoured vehicles, weapons, tear gas or blood bombs as it makes no difference, as its rifles loaded with rubber or fatal bullets (no difference either)!
We wished you had toured Egypt's governorates, hamlets, villages and factories and closely acquainted yourself with your citizens and compatriots so that the nation's conditions might be clear to you on the ground rather than through reports or through a short anecdote!
We want you in particular to reassure us through your own attitudes, tours and behaviour that you both realize and believe that your constituency is here is Egypt rather than there in America!
For about 6 years now the Egyptian authorities have allowed Azzam's family to pay him one visit monthly and allowed for a number of Israeli ministers and senior officials in the Israeli government to meet with Azzam in prison to ascertain that proper health conditions were available.
He pointed out that Cairo had shown reservations about mediation attempts made by some countries, especially the USA and Britain, to urge it to change its political and official declared position regarding the return of its ambassador to Tel Aviv.
For each 240 citizens, there is one quack, which means that there are 200 thousand persons pretending to be able to cure diseases by exorcizing ghosts!
Beans exporters from China, France, England, Australia and Canada have agreed on re-quoting beans exports to Egypt, economic sources said.
As a result of this disequilibrium, beans prices are forecast to shoot up at local markets, said Al-Basha Idris, head of the Farm Produce Dealers' Division under the Chambers of Commerce of Cairo.
The sources confirmed that the expected increase in energy exports may exceed the current plan target by $420 million to exceed $3275 million defined in the current plan.
$332 MILLION VALUE OF EGYPT'S COTTON EXPORTS
Al-Shiewi pointed out that the Egyptian long staple cotton exports rose to 2.336 million kantars, at a total value of 204.75 million dollars since the beginning of the season till yesterday (20th July).
Free zones total imports surged up to 428 million dollars during the third quarter of 2002/2003 against 359.6 million dollars during the second quarter of the same year.
Under that deal, a CIIC working team will move to Hermes with Dr. Mohamed Taimour holding the post of board chairman of the new alliance; Yasser Al-Mallawani as deputy board chairman and executive manager; Hassan Heikal as assistant executive manager and Fiyad Mals as executive manager of the company's regional activity.
Difference between the two sides lies in a number of points, foremost of which is the privatization of banks. Not satisfied with privatizing the administration of banks the WB asked for taking decisive measures in this direction.
The government briefed WB representatives on the measures of developing and modernizing banks technologically in a way that leads to preventing any corruption cases, and briefed them also on the results of deregulating the Egyptian pound and the currently implemented measures of the comprehensive economic reform.
Egypt's imports of broad beans are expected to rise this year due to a decline in domestic production to 50 thousand tons only and the tendency of Egyptian importers to contract for importing over 700 thousand tons to the value of about one billion dollars to meet the needs of the domestic market.
The report uncovered that the volume of timber imports declined from 2,131,000 tons in 2001 to 946,000 tons in 2002. Swedish wood imports also decreased from 1268 thousand tons in 2001 to 204 thousand tons in 2002 while our beech imports surged up to 306 thousand tons in 2002 versus 272 thousand tons in 2001, it said.
These three kinds namely Swedish, plywood and beech wood represent 88.2% of wood imports in 2002 versus 77.9% in 1999, an increase of 10.3. While other kinds represent 11.8% of total imports of wood in 2002.
Egyptian IT and software exports rose from $15 million in 1999 to $50 million in 2000. Arab countries are regarded the main market for Egyptian software industries.
The Minister of Electricity and Power stated that the total costs of the power station project amounted to LE3 billion and that the foreign component in those costs would be financed from low-interest sources provided by the Arab Development Fund, The Kuwaiti Development Fund and the European Investment Bank, while the local component would be raised out of the autonomous resources of Western Delta Electricity Company.
Further, half of the venture's production will be exported. The project aims at setting up and operating a plant for producing cardboards and packaging materials, especially those produced of polypropylene which is used in packaging food stuff and etc. the plant will be based in the industrial zone, 6th of October city. The project will provide 210 job opportunities, Al-Ghamrawi added.
During the signing, the UNIDO director general decided to allocate extra finance amounting to $5 million to activate the deferred points of the agreement on condition that the EIF contributes the same value.
For his part, UNIDO director general said that the organization takes interest in cooperation with Egypt as this will positively reflect on the industrial progress in Egypt, expecting that the project will not solve all the problems of Burg Al-Arab which has 500 plants and 125 thousand workers. This project, however, he noted, will better performance and raise the competitive edge, along with quality.
EIF chairman Abel-Mon'em Seoudi said that the second agreement aimed at boosting technical cooperation with the organization through increasing the competitive edge of the Egyptian industry. This will come true, he pursued, through setting up industrial information network and improving quality to conform to exporting markets, capitalizing on idle capacities, reducing wastage and spreading new means of administration.
The minister added that the Egyptian company had offered the best bid technically and financially. The company has high capabilities in producing sugarcane and beet sugar and manufacturing the required machinery. It had established 5 factories in Iran at a capacity of 250 thousand tons per factory. Establishing similar sugar factories in Sudan is under consideration.
Presenting the project before President Mubarak and King Abdullah, Petroleum Minister Sameh Fahmi said that the Egyptian companies participation in the project would add to expected Egyptian revenues from the Arab Gas project. These revenues are expected to be $70 million in the first year, $200 million after a couple of years and $500 million in five years' time.
As for the third agreement it aims at sustaining the finance of the project, and it will be clinched between the executing companies and a Jordanian bank.
CCI will also hold the responsibility of supervising, following-up and evaluating the implementation of different stages of the project. Meanwhile, the Petroleum Ministry will pay LE12 million as a contribution to anti-pollution projects through extending natural gas networks to these brickyards to use gas instead of mazout. The brickyards' owners will pay 5 million pounds. Ministry of State for Environmental Affairs will participate in the project by 1 million pounds as the Environmental Affairs Body will take part in subsidizing 6% of the interest rate on the loans which the factories owners obtained from Faisal Islamic Bank of Egypt to enable them to improve the burning system.
Statistics issued by the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMS) on the incoming tourism rates in Egypt during June 2003 pointed out that the number of German tourists who visited Egypt during this period hit 43,906, down 10.8%. Despite this decline, the German market was ranked second in the last three months among the top ten markets exporting tourism to Egypt during June 2003.
Egyptian tourism experts and officials expected the Egyptian and Saudi capital invested in tourist projects in Egypt and Saudi Arabia this year to exceed $900 million, particularly as a result of the improvement of touristic activities in Egypt and the Egyptian government's bid to boost tourism revenues to some $5.5 billion this year and the Egyptian plans for attracting about 9.5 million tourists by 2005. The Saudis also seek to attract a sizable portion of Egyptian investments to the Saudi tourism sector, so as to make use of the promising and highly profitable investment opportunities that Saudi Arabia affords in this sector.
He added that the first project lies in Ras Banas in the Red Sea governorate on an area of 42 kilometers and at an investment cost of 5.6 billion pounds. This project aims at constructing hotels with accommodation capacity of 7695 rooms, tourist villages with accommodation capacity of 1950 rooms, safari villages with accommodation capacity of 100 rooms, health center at a capacity of 150 rooms, diving center at a capacity of 50 rooms, water sports center with capacity of 50 rooms, condominium units at a capacity of 283 rooms, tourist housing with capacity of 356 rooms, in addition to setting up golf courses, tennis courts, marina and a commercial center.
EGYPTIAN EXPORTS WORTH 122 MILLION EUROS TO FRANCE IN FOUR MONTHS

STATIC EXPORTS, GROWING IMPORTS

As regards the reality of the situation following the elapse of seven months after the implementation of the exchange rate deregulation and its reflections on trade balance, board member and managing director of the Export Development Bank Hamdi Moussa sees that the end result of the past six months was a retreat in the pound exchange rate before the dollar by 63 piasters. This devaluation was supposed to result in a high demand for Egyptian exports whose prices were on the wane and whose competitive edge was increasing consequently. This happened to a great extent during the past six months which recorded a growth in the value and volume of exports whose yield hiked up to 5 billion dollars. If the same rate continues, exports revenues for the whole year is expected to be two times as much as this figure, with an increase of more than one billion dollars in comparison with last year, he added.

According to sources with the Ministry of Water Resources, the talks held during the last three years failed to reach an agreement about the Nile water due to differences in the stances of the countries concerned. Some of them demanded that the water be distributed according to the area, which others asked that the population size be the adopted criterion for water distribution. A third group led by Ethiopia whence Egypt gets 85% of water wanted each country to exercise full sovereignty over the part of the river which passes through its territories.
Water Dearth! Due to the fixed water resources and the rising rate of population growth, the per capita share of water in Egypt retreated to 900 cubic metres annually and Egypt entered the critical stage so much so that it was classified by international institutions as under the water poverty line. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation failed to make use of agricultural drainage waste, which reached 14 billion cubic metres annually, 8 billion of which are fit for use and out of which 3 billions are annually used by farmers in agriculture without any treatment in the areas where no irrigation water is available. Eleven billion cubic metres go, therefore, to the Mediterranean Sea even though little state-of-the-art technology is needed to have it recycled.

Every where in the world from America to Japan, from Europe to China, people talk openly about the peoples' indignation about despotism which came to be the basic track of all Arab ruling regimes! People also indignantly talk about the way the peaceful rotation of power will take place particularly in Egypt! This is especially so due to the fact that all pretexts assumed by the Egyptian government for freezing political and constitutional positions have lost all credibility or power to convince anybody after it managed to implement its economic reform programme and after the religious terrorism phenomenon ebbed away!

AFTER LATE MARRIAGE IN EGYPT, GIRLS ESCAPE SPINSTERHOOD BY DOING POST GRADUATE STUDIES
Mona, a 37-year old woman admitted that post graduate studies were the real reason. It was a sort of escape from the pathetically long wait for the suitable bridegroom.

On the other hand, the report stressed that car sales in the last five years has accounted for 18.8 billion pounds. Sales of all types of cars hiked by rates that are higher than the supplied quantity in the last years, reflecting the rise in cost.

21 COMPANIES TO PARTICIPATE IN IZMIR EXHIBITION
Seminars on the investment in Egypt would be held on the margin of the exhibition as well as promoting the tourist cities, he said, adding that exhibitions have proved success recently in raising the volume of exports, in addition to facilitating the signing of commercial deals with different countries worldwide.
The commercial bureau in Brussels ascribed such a rise to the involvement of non-petroleum products, especially fruits and vegetables, which increased from 3 million euros during January-April 2002 to 7 million euros in the same period this year. Textile exports also hiked to 8.5 million euros from 6.5 million euros and chemical exports went up 50% to hit 3 million euros during January-April this year.

Although the Yemeni market is one of the promising markets for Egyptian exports due to its proximity to Egyptian export ports and consequently the relative low cost of freight in addition to the increasing purchasing power of Yemeni consumers, weakness of the Yemeni industry structure, the lack of any competitive domestic commodities in the short and medium runs, the high cost of agricultural production and the possibility of importing agricultural products, the commercial representation report uncovered certain obstacles to the inflow of Egyptian exports.
- Decline in the interest taken in the activities of Egyptian exhibitions mounted in Yemen. Some Egyptian companies exporting to the Yemeni market have, furthermore, violated contract conditions whether through the shipment of commodities in less amounts or at lower quality than stipulated in the contracts or by failure to ship the goods, the down payments of which are collected from Yemeni traders, which would consequently prejudice the Egyptian goods reputation.
Ignoring the role of careful advertising of Egyptian goods on the Yemeni market using the best techniques which fit its nature. - Scarcity of visits paid by producers and exporters to the Yemeni market to get acquainted on the ground with export opportunities and to conclude contracts with importing Yemeni companies.

They pointed out that the shortage started following the decrees of the rates of exchange deregulation and the considerable rise in the dollar rate of exchange as well as the phenomenon of the dollar supply shortage on official and unofficial markets.
They pointed out the failure of the recent measures to solve that crisis including the reliance of the companies which suffered from a deficiency in foreign exchange on others which have a surplus in hard currency due to the failure of the total surplus of the enterprise sector to cover the required funds.
Investigations emphasized that the prices at which the Turkish reinforcing iron bars were supplied were lower than their cost in Turkish factories, thus constituting a dumping of the Egyptian iron market, which would do extreme harm to national economy.
First Undersecretary of the Foreign Trade Ministry Al-Sayyed Abul-Qumsan told Asharq Al-Awsat that the Saudi decision relied on news published in some papers. The Egyptian veterinary services emphasized that the animal wealth is utterly free of the Rift Valley fever or any other epidemics that impede exportation, he noted.
He belittled the repercussions of the decision on Egypt's sheep exports at present. However, he added, such a decision would have a remarkable effect if it continued till the pilgrimage season, during which Saudi Arabia imports an enormous number of sheep in order to meet sacrifice needs.
They attributed that to some helping factors, most important of which are the short period of the war on Iraq, waning of the gap between exchange rates on official market and those on black market and the possibility of the government obtaining a loan from abroad.

The Foreign Trade First Undersecretary Al-Sayed Abu Al-Qumssan said that the decision aimed at facing the phenomenon of some traders use of the export and import offices in collecting commodities from the local market and exporting them to foreign markets with low prices, burning these markets and harming the Egyptian exports reputation.
It is worth mentioning that head of the Chamber of Hides Trade Mamdouh Mekki and a lot of ceramic producers had addressed the minister of foreign trade about similar cases.
BAN ON DANGEROUS WASTE IMPORTS, TRAFFIC OR CIRCULATION!
After foreign refuse collection companies started work in Greater Cairo suburbs to put an end to one of the most sophisticated environmental problems in the Egyptian capital of Cairo, namely refuse, a scientific study showed that the refuse collected from Cairo is the richest in the world in terms of useful materials! The price of refuse could reach 90 up to LE6000 per ton due to refuse richness in several organic materials that could be used in many processing industries.
Such clothes are used once again in stuffing pillows and mattresses. Prices of paper and cardboard collected from refuse are LE30 and LE70 respectively. Low-quality paper could be recycled to be used in making bags for wrapping vegetables and meat, he added. Strangely enough, plastic price per ton is LE800.
The data pointed out that LE6.064 billion was the proceeds of selling 38 (majority) companies on the Stock Exchange and 16 (minority) companies to the value of LE 1.753 billion.

$450 MILLION TRADE BALANCE DEFICIT IN 6 MONTHS
On the other hand, the Egyptian trade balance deficit with the USA reached about $450 million in the first half of this year.
In spite of an over 25% retreat in exports, the trade balance deficit depleted in the first half of this year as a result of a big retreat in imports especially after Egypt tended to import wheat from France and Ukraine as strong competitors of the USA.
CBE DENIES IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS ON FOREIGN CAPITAL MOVEMENT
Abul-Oyoon emphasized that the CBE was keen on meeting all the requests of foreign investors wishing to remit their activities yield in Egypt as soon as it receives a request to that effect from any bank.
Firstly the CBE withdrew LE2 billion from the liquidity in local currency through issuing a one-month deposit with an average interest rate hitting 8.4835%. It is to be mentioned that the highest price hit 8.80% while the lower one hit 8%. After that the CBE issued a two-week deposit to the tune of LE1.5 billion with an average interest rate amounting to 8.645%. The highest price that was offered hit 9.05% and the least one hit 8.01%.
Sources with the clearance banks of the NBE and Banque Misr started operations of remitting foreign exchange assets inflows into banks with a view to increasing indirect investment on the Stock Exchange to the CBE fund assigned for that purpose as of yesterday (Sunday) according to the CBE instructions.
A Jewish attempt to control one of the Egyptian parliament premises after South Cairo Court refused to pass a ruling in favour of some families belonging to Jewish organizations in France which had filed a lawsuit claiming the ownership of the premises under historical pretexts.
The Egyptian Parliament defense, however, assured the court that Rimon Gaddaa's allegations were lies as no requests had been made by the French ambassador, nor had the PA set up any committees to check the villa, nor had any offers been made. The compliant, Gaddaa failed to present evidence to his or his French Jewish principals ownership of the villa. Nor could he prove that he was one of the heirs of Victoria Garboua who brought the villa on behalf of her husband Jacques Levie during his life. The court headed by Justice Ali Emara decided to turn down the lawsuit and confirm the Egyptian parliament's ownership of the villa.
Israel claimed that the message had been conveyed by UN delegate in the Middle East who, nevertheless, denied conveying such a message.
The American Secretary of State Colin Powell said on Saturday that Washington had determined an agenda for Syria.
"SPIKE" DEAL BETWEEN LONDON, TEL AVIV
It is noteworthy that the British Defense Ministry had clinched a preliminary deal with the Israeli government in 2001 under which they bought a number of these rockets, to the value of 4.4 million sterling, with the aim of trying and testing the efficiency of these rockets.
The Palestinian sources pointed out that the Palestinian delegate to the United Kingdom Afif Safya raised the issue, several times with British officials and warned against its impacts on the Israel's attitude towards the peace process.
According to the Israeli Ministry of Defence, its arms exports were valued at $4.18 billion in 2002, a 70% rise over 2001.
New Delhi which concluded with Tel Aviv the deal of AWAKS radar aircraft of the Falcon type a year and a half ago to the value of one billion dollars is considered the best customer for Israeli military industries.

DOLLARS TO LEAD FEMALE STUDENTS UP TO AMERICAN CAMPS!
They go there under the pretext that the Americans wanted secretaries and char girls. A ring of brokers claim that they are recruitment office owners.
Sahar paused for a moment and then said, "Sami is trying to secure secret safe places for the girls like hotels where posh cars park outside!
Their presence embarrasses students' movement.
Security measures were intensified after an American soldier was killed inside the university campus about 10 days ago.
Following his sponsorship, two days ago, of the graduation of the 10th batch of specialized professional diplomas organized by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Riyadh, Minister of Work and Social Affairs Dr. Ali Bin Ibrahim Al-Namlah said that his ministry had drawn upon an international expert from Jordan to achieve its strategic goals in combatting poverty in all Saudi Arabia regions.
It urged businessmen and the affluent to contribute to combating such a serious phenomenon.
In statements to Asharq Al-Awsat yesterday Dr. Hamoud bin Abdel-Aziz Al-Badr said that such a step was motivated by keenness on the part of the Saudis to forestall any attempt to use Saudi donations for acts other than those originally meant.
Jordan's Prime Minister Ali Abul-Ragheb has formed a new cabinet that will shoulder the responsibility of resuming economic reform projects and restoring stability to the legislative atmosphere, which has long suffered a constitutional vacuum due to the absence of parliament, which the government filled with over 230 tentative laws. Having seen limited changes in political and economic ministries, the 28-portfolio cabinet with 8 incoming members and 5 outgoing others is now anticipating parliament's confidence.
Former minister of information, Mahamed al-Odwan has become Minister of Political Affairs, and Al-Dostour daily Chief Editor Nabil al-Sharief, a professor of the English literature with several Jordanian universities, is to take over as Minister of Information.
JORDAN IKHWAN FORM PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE TO DEFEND JORDANIAN DETAINEES IN ISRAEL
The committee will call on the parliament to make intensive contacts with a number of world parliaments to bring pressure on Israel to release 82 prisoners, he told Asharq Al-Awsat. Another campaign to the same effect will be launched at the international level through newspapers, the media, political parties, syndicates, and human rights and public freedoms agencies, he added.
The mediators' proposed that a new name be set - the capital area which would consist of one of the areas inside the city of Khartoum where the national government buildings and offices lie, besides the site of the national parliament located at the entrance of Om Dorman city, one of the three cities of the current capital.
Mediators also suggest that the competence of the National Assembly to run the capital area be extended to include other areas outside it is in accordance with what the parliament would pass by a two-third majority.
JORDAN APPROVES PROJECT FOR EXTENDING RAILWAY NETWORK BETWEEN ARAB MASHREQ COUNTRIES
The workshop was attended by representatives of different transport and communications ministries, both land and railway transport unions in the Arab World, Arab development and investment organizations and institutions from Saudi Arabia, Syria, the Sudan, Egypt, Morocco and Jordan.
BASHAR AL-ASSAD IN FOURTH YEAR OF REIGN: FULFILLING "FATHER'S WILL"
They did not demand to have him referred to the judiciary - God forbid! - but rather to sack him only, especially as he approached seventy years of age.
The official italic mass media did not, however, mention the value of the sums embezzled by those employees who are mostly low-income persons even though they include a number of engineers.
The second story is meant to throw dust in the eyes, while the first depicts the "will" of embezzlement, plunder and seizing influence and wealth. It is the "will" of turning Syria into a mafia controlled by a handful of families, whose practices are the worst in the history of the mafia's traditions.
There are some reasons for this "development" in the approaches of corruption and turning the country into a private estate. Some of such reasons did not emerge at Hafez Al-Assad's era.
It goes without saying that such experience cannot be gained in rallies or ceremonies with senior or junior politicians.
The third reason, which emerged after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, is that the ruling mafia in Syria felt that eternity is for God Almighty only and that billions of dollars cannot prevent the downfall of idols. They also felt that the best way is not to stop plundering and looting, as the idiots expect from the mirage of the regime's "reforms", but rather go to extremes in stripping the country of everything.
Regrettably, what we witness today is what we expected when Bashar Al-Assad was elected president three years ago. We expected at that time that Syria would lose the body of Hafez Al-Assad rather than his approaches or policies. This means the replacement of the "change through continuation" slogan, which was adopted by the youthful president and the men of this new era at the beginning of his reign, with a "continuation through continuation" slogan.
With the advent of the fourth year of Bashar's reign, there is no sign that the main tactic of his rule will be changed: a step forward in return for five others backward.
In a statement to Asharq Al-Awsat during his visit to Arbil city (North) yesterday, Wolfwitz said that future relations between Iraq and the USA would have to be established on the bases of confidence and cooperation, which, he proposed, could be ensured through a common defense treaty.
SABAH AL-AHMED: WE'RE FACING HARD TIMES
Jordanian Minister of Transport Nadir Al-Zahabi said an Arab investor applied for a plot of land in Jordan to erect an aircraft plant.
The approvals were referred to the cabinet, which, in turn, approved the establishment of that giant investment project, said Eng.
Kicking up a fuss about his practices, the citizens have become completely unable to pay to the governor.
Elucidating the meaning of "will", we mention that this governor stood beside late president Hafez Al-Assad when he led the "rectifying movement" in 1970. It is this particular officer also who gave up his family and late Salah Jadid's group and joined Al-Assad's ranks.
In other words, the Syrian citizen's attention is intended to be distracted by corruption stories of hundreds of thousands of Syrian liras (such as those of the employees of the Agricultural Directorate in Idlib) in order to forget other corruption stories of tens of billions of Syrian liras (such as those of the governor or close relatives of Al-Assad family).
They can steal, plunder, appoint and sack anybody and do whatever they want and go unpunished. Anyone of such mafiosi can simply kill any citizen in broad daylight for very trivial reasons (a few weeks ago, a citizen was killed in Damascus at the hands of a mafioso's son because this citizen parked his car before a famous restaurant where the mafioso's son used to park his car).
This procedure cannot be taken by the current president because those who brought him to power in an uncalculated adventure are those who can have control and power until further notice. At the end of his days, Hafez Al-Assad was involved into a race against time to form a security, military, political and economic team in order to provide the suitable "entourage" that will secure the reasons of power for the young president, but unfortunately he died!
The young president does not have one fourth of his father's experience, power, men and loyal networks.
In fact, the only "reconciliation" witnessed by the regime was a chain of quick reconciliations held by the mafiosi of the regime where gaps were bridged, differences of the past were buried and policies and plans of the future were adopted (as no one trusts the possibilities of the distant future after the occupation of Iraq). This was meant to plunder the resources of the country in a peaceful way with an internal coherent front.
Ironically enough, secret directives were issued to the court martial - the sixth chamber in Damascus - based on the aforementioned decree to release Syrian Human Rights Association board chairman lawyer Haytham Al-Maleh together with Farouk Al-Homsi, Mohamed Khair Bek and Ghasoub Al-Mula (they were accused of belonging to a political unlicensed association and bringing unlicensed publications into the country).
JORDAN TO SET UP FIRST AIRCRAFT PLANT IN THE REGION
All the privileges that could be obtained by the investor in case the plant area is considered a free economic zone were explained. Indeed, the area near Queen Aliaa Airport was allocated for the new airport. Approval of the Civil Aviation Authority as well as permission of the Free Zones Authority was obtained.
A recent report prepared by the Egyptian Engineers Syndicate warned that 50% of Arab agricultural lands, which constitute some 16% of the total Arab lands, are threatened with desertification.
The report said that 80% of the Arab agricultural lands are irrigated by rainwater and the Arab desert constitutes about 75% of total Arab lands. It noted that the Israeli conflict with the Arabs was motivated by a desire to control Arab waters.
The Engineers Syndicate report noted that Israel uses about 475 million cubic meters of water out of the total 851 million cubic meters available in the West Bank, i.e. one third of its consumption.
The Shehab missile which caused alarm to the Hebrew State is Iranian made, and one of the most important fruits of Iranian Military Industrialization Authority. It is, therefore, neither imported nor modified.
The "terrorism" campaign exercised by that administration against Syria has already succeeded in reaching its goals. The Syrian government closed its borders with Iraq, prevented the infiltration of volunteers to fight for resistance against the American forces and closed the door to the attempts made by some of the old regime's defeated leaderships.
America, nevertheless, is now exhausted, hateful and incapable of repeating the Iraqi experiment in Iran.
According to a member of the "Supreme Council of Islamic Revolution" in Iraq, Zou El-Feqar Al-Hassan, the Iraqi Shiite parties demand an outstanding role in the maintenance of peace and order in Iraq.
He pointed out that the Americans' problem with the Iraqi Shiite parties lay in their belief in those parties subordination to Iran and Syria's influence and in the American administration's rejection of any independent Shiite political character in Iraq.
Marking the 51st anniversary of glorious 23rd July Revolution, the official Egyptian TV aired President Mubarak's speech for the occasion. The President called for staging elections in Iraq as soon as possible to end the "state of anarchy that threatens the Middle East," considering that "the state of instability, lawlessness and tension is not in the region's interests."
Under international agreements and Egypt's deals with the River Nile Basin countries, the Nile water can not be used by non-Nile Basin countries, he said.
Yesterday (21st July), parliamentary sources said that the PA legislative committee was considering a proposal to appoint women at judiciary posts on a par with men to achieve the equality provided for by the constitution and to enable women to take up all types of judiciary posts ranging from public prosecution jobs to the rank of court president.
A source close to the legislative committee said, "The committee has received assurances from the Ministry of Justice that the family court bill would be ready for discussion in the next parliamentary session. The bill will organize special hearings for family cases especially those related to divorce, alimony and children custody.
The unemployment that runs rampant in the Egyptian cities and villages in addition to the growing number of those who live under poverty line to an unprecedented level, led to an increase in the phenomenon in which some of the gifted and holders of rare qualifications and specialties accept low-rank professions foremost of which are serving in houses, taking up cleanness jobs and working as vendors.
He said that those servants usually hide their qualifications from their employers in order to avoid questions about the reasons that forced them to do this kind of work.
Fatima confirmed that she had been exerting herself in that job for two years and that she hid her qualifications from her employers lest she shall be exposed to insults from the illiterate wife she was serving or her sons who held medium qualifications. Fatima serves a family for about 15 hours per day and she does not tell anybody about her job. She does not deny that she might be forced, daily, to lie if anyone asked her where she works, as she replies that she is an expert with the National Center for Social Research.
A statistic by the National Centre for Social Studies unveiled a rise in the rate of spinsterhood among university female students in Egypt. The study uncovered that 50% of university graduates suffered from spinsterhood and that some of them preferred to delay matrimony till they got the highest scientific and occupational degrees.
Ibtisam who is 42 years old admitted to the fact that she was not getting any younger but she cannot be called really a spinster. To prove her argument she said she had turned down one of her colleagues' proposal of marriage as she thought there was a better life than of marriage- knowledge and making new acquaintances everyday. That was, according to her, the reason why she felt happy about her life and refused to marry at that stage of her life.
The same opinion was given by Dr. S.A., a 43 years old female, who said, "I devoted all my life to my job and studies in the university. I traveled to many countries and worked there. I made a lot of money and believed that marriage would restrict my freedom and undermine my ability to stand by and work and therefore rejected the proposals of colleagues and bridegrooms who had very good social positions.
Former dean of Arab Language faculty in the South Valley, Dr. Al Badrawi Zahran emphasized that delaying marriage till a late age runs counter to both Islamic religion and human nature. Marriage is a grace. The holy Koran says: "And among His Signs is this, that He created for you wives from among yourselves, that you may find repose in them, and He has put between you affection and mercy.
This type of swimming costumes for women is highly demanded by veiled women, while other unveiled women do not prefer them as, they said, it is illogical to put on a veil while swimming but take it off while walking in the street.
Although going swimming is a way to a means of entertainment and relaxation, it sometimes turns out to be a sort of suffering and trouble. On a Mersa Matrouh beach, a tragic divorce case took place recently when a husband from Cairo found out that his wife was used to getting up early to go swimming for hours, while he was still sleeping.
Men's Islamic beach wear is also on sale, covering the body from the navel to the knee.
It is important, therefore, that the Palestinians review their positions as most liberation movements in the world have reviewed their positions, he said.
The lawsuit filed by lawyer Nabih Mohamed Al-Wahsh is based on the pretext that setting up that committee contravened the articles 138 and 156 of the permanent Egyptian constitution passed in 1971.
NEW ZIONIST BLACKMAIL CAMPAIGN AGAINST EGYPT
A delegation of American Congressmen who have recently visited Egypt met with officials of the American embassy and the USAID to discuss the compensations which were estimated at $100 billion for what it called "Egyptian persecution" of the Jews, which caused their numbers to decrease from 75 thousands in 1948 to just one hundred in 2003 as well as the allegation that they were deprived of civil rights and putting the Egyptian officials to trial for crimes that require that those perpetrators be tried before the International War Criminals Court.
EGYPTIAN CUSTOMS DEPRIVE PREMIER OF SUDANESE MANGO!
The Egyptian delegation which participated in the Egyptian-Sudanese Supreme Committee headed by Ebeid in Khartoum had been subjected to the instructions of agricultural quarantine officials at the airport when they arrived at Cairo Airport two days ago. The delegation agreed that 300 Sudanese fine mango boxes be checked before getting access to the country, but agricultural quarantine officials ordered that they be confiscated.
On Sunday, the Iranian government announced that it had provided its revolutionary guard with "Shehab 3", a medium-range missile capable of striking Israel and the American bases in the Middle East.
Such threats have taken different forms like brandishing a repetition of the American aggression against Iraq or through subverting the Iranian regime from within by destabilizing it and the incitement of anti-regime groups to revolt and rebel.
Shehab missile will not scare America so long as the Iranian policy in Iraq is "positive neutrality" or rather not inciting resistance against occupation, but it will, all the same, be a credit to Iran, its regime and military institutions.
If they failed to do well in that sphere, why did not they do well in the sphere of providing a decent living for their peoples?
Al-Hassan ascribed the deterioration in Shiite-American relations to "a role played by two sections in the former Iraqi intelligence - "Iran" and "Islamic movements" - in inciting against Shiite movements in general.
He said that two things are wanted of the Shiite parties by the Americans namely: not to shoot a single bullet at the American and British forces in the southern governorates and to prove quite free of any Iranian influence.
I said that I would exterminate Mexico in half an hour."
This is probably Israel's aim. Addressing different security bodies about the results of the truce only one month after its declaration, Israeli Defence Minister Shaol Mofaz said, "Israel will enter into negotiations only if the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) dismantled the armed factions."
Jordanian Monarch Abdullah II sounded the alarm about the seriousness of evacuating Arab population particularly the Christians from the occupied Jerusalem, where their rate declined to a degree threatening the Christian presence in such a holy city.
In addition to the opposition's gaining the upper hand over the government, the results reflected a strong desire to change the faces, which led Press Syndicate work for so long. The new council included only four of the old council members: Kallash, Higazi, Abd Al-Maksoud and Al-Wali, the latter two belonging to the Islamic trend which seemed to dominate the elections. The list fielded by the Muslim Brotherhood group included candidates belonging to various trends besides the four who had already won.
The election turnout was 3328 journalists and the number of valid votes for the syndicate chairman position was 3255 against 73 invalid votes.
In the same context, Asharq Al-Awast added: The press arena in Egypt is expected to witness a tense climate in the coming stage. In their platforms, most winners have openly advocated the cancellation of freedom-restricting laws, prison sentences against journalists in publication cases and working for unrestricting the freedom of the press. These issues as a whole might lead the syndicate to a conflict with the state through a serial of confrontations. In the same context, Al-Ittihad said:
According to these sources, several days before the death of Qusai and Udai Saddam Hussein sent a message to the Americans through his attendant Abd Hammoud who asked to meet American officials in Iraq to convey the message.
A new crisis has been triggered between the government and the opposition in the parliament because the government turned down the political reform map presented by the opposition.
Well-informed sources said the first legislation has to do with amending the law on political parties. It stipulates revocation of the committee on political parties which looks like a sword of Damocles over the formation of fresh parties that want to work within the framework of legitimacy, in an indication to turning down the foundation of 15 parties in Egypt during the years when the committee on political parties undertook reviewing foundation papers.
EXTENDED CONFERENCE TO EVALUATE POWELL'S INITIATIVE IN CAIRO NEXT YEAR
The conference is expected to declare recommendations to enhance the initiative and the target. The initiative needs 47 million dollars to be applied in 2004.
The conference, originally allocated to "junior ambassadors", will invite 5 female parliamentarians from Egypt, Palestine, Lebanon, Morocco, and Syria as well as women from Jordan, Algeria, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Oman. However, the final number of invitees has not been set yet as some members may refuse to participate due to participation of an Israeli delegation in the conference.
A number of official employees with the US embassy in Cairo and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) as well as other American bodies left Egypt early this month heading for Middle Eastern and African countries, which Washington believes to have terrorist cells, including Nigeria, Congo, Somalia and Senegal, Asharq Al-Awsat learnt.
Rick did his postgraduate studies in political science and law and was commissioned to work for the NSC. He came to Egypt on the heels of the 11th September events.
Such information is totally divorced from reality. There is not any pressure on Al-Azhar preachers and "ulema" because it adopts a constant approach according to the Quranic verse, "Invite to the way of your Lord (i.e. Islam) with wisdom and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better."
This campaign is not confined to Egypt but rather includes many Arab countries. Some Arab countries prevented a large number of mosque imams from preaching sermons. Some other countries started to hold courses with a view to creating a spirit of enlightenment and enlightened preachers. However, the USA does not realize that the matter has nothing to do with preaching sermons but rather with the question it always evades: Why do mosque imams criticize the USA?
Well-informed sources said the alliance is aimed to prevent any terrorist elements getting safe haven away from clampdowns of security bodies and the CIA.
EGYPTIAN FUNDAMENTALISTS' LAWYER: AL-ZAWAHRI LIVES SAFE OUT IRAN
Al-Zayat said that Iran was never a safe haven since the Taliban rose to power due to political and sectarian differences, something that led to the death of a number of Al-Qaeda leaderships such as Mohamed Atef, alias Abu Hafs Al-Masri, and the arrest of others like Abu-Aubidi, Ramzy bin Shiba and Khalid Sheikh Mohamed. "As a result of this I rule out the existence of any of Al-Qaeda famous leaderships such as Al-Zawahri in safety in Iran," Al-Zayat said.
Sawiris company hung an internal notice about the project stating that the monthly salary would be $500 only as the company would bear the expenses and accommodation costs in the American bases sites.
Farkhonda Hassan. An NCW delegation headed by Hassan had visited the U.S. and presented the World Bank (WB) with the report that tackles the status of the Egyptian women and their participation in the development process, taking the social dimension into account in a way that achieves equality between man and woman.
Reports uncovered that a huge part of the financial allocations granted to the Ministry of Health and Population is being spent on ostentatious conferences, seminars and fora without any control by or accountability to the People's Assembly. Meanwhile, the standard of health services is steadily deteriorating due to the shortage in the number of doctors and the amounts of equipment and medicine.
This week, well-informed sources uncovered to "Al-Ahali" that other grants had been offered to the Ministry of Health and Population including $52.422 million (actual) in the same year, $58 million and 100 thousand (actual) in 2001, $46.490 million (estimated) in 2002 and $38.900 million (required) for 2003.
HELP OF CONSULTING FIRM SOUGHT TO IMPROVE EGYPT'S IMAGE IN AMERICA
The meeting also decided to form a permanent ministerial group comprising deputy prime minister and ministers of defence, foreign affairs, foreign trade, supply and domestic trade, finance, petroleum, communications and information technology and social affairs. The committee will be entitled to seek whoever it sees suitable of political forces to attend its meetings. A permanent secretary for the ministerial group for relations with the US will be formed. Minister of State for Foreign Affairs will be the permanent coordinator and rapporteur of the committee.
The new council will not diminish the role of Al-Azhar or the Ministry of Wakfs but rather help integrate with such institutions, he said, denying criticisms leveled at it to the effect that it was based on a certain task to issue fatwas (religious opinion) serving political interests. "It will shoulder the responsibility of updating the discourse of the imams and preachers in a way that serves the Islamic call and qualifies a new generation of preachers who are aware of religious and mundane affairs as well as the present-day discourse. This will be in a suitable way of presenting ideas and probing people's approaches towards accepting preaching methods," he pointed out.
GRAND SHEIKH OF AL-AZHAR: JIHAD IS INDIVIDUAL DUTY ON MUSLIMS
There are some cases where jihad is considered a religious individual duty on Muslims," he said, terming what was transmitted by the BBC as malice and misinformation.
Accordingly, Israel has had the 11th place on the list of Egypt's main importers, with its imports having recorded only 3 million U.S. dollars in January and February against 33 million U.S. dollars in the same period of last year, according to a report released by Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Trade.
Farouq Mabrouk will be in charge of the Egyptian Interest Care Bureau in Iraq where over 60 thousand Egyptians work, according to figures mentioned by the Egyptian diplomatic mission in Baghdad.
Al-Hayat learnt that contacts were made a few hours ago between the Egyptian and Philippine authorities concerning information about the activity of an Egyptian fundamentalist detained in Manilla called Dia' Al-Gabri.
The sources said that during investigations Indonesian outstanding fundamentalist, Makhlis Yunus who belonged to the Islamic Group had uncovered information about Al-Gabri's activity in and outside Egypt. He stressed that the latter together with other Arabs managed to form a network affiliated to Al-Qaeda in that region and set up a trading company as a faade for the organization.
Son of former Anglican community head in Egypt Rafiq Habib said he would not join Wasat party's group ( a group split off from Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) group to form a new party which is Wasat party) in case they tried for the third time to establish a political party. The two failed attempts pushed Wasat Party members to split off from the mother group because the latter categorically rejected these attempts.
He noted that his supportive attitude of the Wasat group has not changed even after the group split off from the mother group.
Chairman of the Holding Company for Pharmaceuticals and Supplies Galal Ghurab dismissed as ungrounded reports on increasing prices of some kinds of medicine.
Talks are currently underway with Saudi Arabia to abrogate a ban on Egyptian medicine exports, he said, noting that Egyptian pharmaceuticals meet international criteria as confirmed by the Saudi Arabian committees which recently visited Egyptian medicine plants.
EGYPT RANKED FIFTH IN EXPORTING TREACLE
The average value per ton of Egyptian treacle exports rose to the highest figure in 2001 in exports to Saudi Arabia, the equivalent of $539 per ton where it claimed a market share amounting to about 0.57% of Egyptian treacle. However, the lowest average value per ton - $76 - was claimed by Egyptian exports to Greece, which had a market share of 2.96% of Egyptian treacle in 2001.
Al-Tilatli called on companies to quickly start to get prepared for this certificate so that they might not be surprised by the end of the deadline without getting the certificate, which brings about a stop in exportation to the European market.
Statistics of the Passports, Immigration and Nationality Department at the Interior Ministry and the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMS) about foreign tourist movement in Egypt during last August affirmed that the number of tourists who visited Egypt hit 743.3 thousands, a big rise of 29.5% over the same month of last year, said Minister of Tourism Mamdouh Al-Beltagi. He added that this is an unprecedented figure throughout the history of the Egyptian tourism.
This came in Al-Beltagui's speech in the Thrid Arab Conference for Curative and Eco-Tourism that is being held in Beirut and whose activities will come to an end on 10th September instant.
5 NEW AIRPLANES WORTH $220 MILLION FOR EGYPTAIR
The new aircraft would join the fleet of the national carrier, which comprises 34 airplanes, in order to help in operating Umra (minor pilgrimage) air flights during the current season, which is expected to be good now that the problems that have been triggered earlier and led to the decrease of the number of Umra performers are over.
PLANT FOR PRODUCING PETROCHEMICALS IN PORT SAID
National Bank of Egypt (NBE), Banque Misr and Misr International Bank (MIBank) reached an agreement to pump 185 million dollars to finance the establishment of a factory for Alexandria Fertilizers (Abu Qir) Company, which needed foreign exchange contributions to finance new production lines, all of which are imported.

This is due to very essential reasons realized by many people who know and can remember now the nature of the deep alliance relations between the U.S. administration and Saddam Hussein in 1983-1990.
This is because at least Donald Rumsfeld went to Baghdad on November 23 as president Ronald Regan's envoy in 1983 despite the rupture between both countries since 1967, after the Iranians made a victory on the Fao front in their war with Saddam, sending Washington into panic especially under the "Khamenai Revolution export" emblems.

It wants all this to be done without the least discussion and without the least delay!
It wants to have radio and television stations set up now and without any delay to which the Arabs would prefer to listen rather than to turn into their own ones.

"EGYPT'S REVOLUTION" ORGANIZATION SNIPER: I KILLED MOSSAD LEADER, CIA OFFICIAL
Many secrets of that organization are unknown either because its leaders were imprisoned or died. However, the sniper of the military wing of that organization, Sami Abdel-Fattah nicknamed Sami Fisha at last completed his prison sentence (15 years) and just left prison. He was interviewed by Al-Majalla about the missing details. Here is the dialogue:
A: After the army, I joined the intelligence service where I worked for three years during which I made the acquaintance of Mahmoud Nour Eddin and Khalid Abdel-Nasser.
Q: What happened after Mahmoud Nour Eddin had put you to such a test?
A: In a flat at Nasr City, a Cairo suburb, I was surprised to hear Mahmoud Nour Eddin asking me to meet Khalid Abdel-Nasser, which came after I successfully executed the operation of killing the Israeli military attache, even though they all twice failed to shoot him.
I then told him that I lived with my mother and should anything wrong happen to me, he would be responsible for her as she has nobody to care for her except for me.
Assassinating Mossad official and military attache Q: What were the most important operations which you carried out?
A: I did, but nobody believed me at all even though I warned Mahmoud Nour Eddin that his brother Ahmed used to frequent the American embassy in Cairo where he was seen by Ali Zaki (a plumber) and Hilmi (a painter) who used to work then for the American embassy. They told me that he was closely related to senior officials in the embassy, adding that he used to go there in a car daily to inform senior officials of some information. When I faced him with that he categorically denied the matter.
A: He feigned illness and pretended to be unable to talk and that he was a heroin addict. At that time, all the organization members were closely monitored.
They only knew Sami Fisha, which was my nickname.
I immediately shot the driver who fell dead at once.

So we killed John Hock and wanted to blow up a microbus with 33 Americans affiliated to the Bright Star in Golf Ground district in Cairo, but Mahmoud strongly objected to the idea even though I insisted on it.

He added, "We have searched for the legitimacy from which CIVIC derived such power that enabled it to get the upper hand of all giant bureaus and firms, only to find such legitimacy in the Minister of Housing himself who turned into the biggest contractor in the Middle East through his competence of assigning the biggest infrastructure operations in Egypt and the Arab World". Farghali said, "The Minister exercised his influence to make all companies accept that bureau's bids and conditions no matter how unjust there were.

Although some Egyptian sources said they would not mind that as those Jews were Egyptian citizens though holding another nationality, the French, and that the Egyptian law would give them that right, they ruled out any Egyptian tendency, for the time being, to link between that society's demands and the Egyptian dues with Israel that are still pending whether regarding the Egyptian POWs killing or Israel's looting of Sinai's natural resources like oil or its seizure of Sinai's antiquities after the 1967 war.
The reply is in the following dialogue:
If the Jews have asked the Arabs and the world for dues relying on historical and religious grounds, a group of Egyptians in Switzerland opened the file of what is called the "Big Exodus of the Jews from Egypt at the Pharaonic times" when they stole gold, jewellery, cooking pots, silver work, clothes as well as other items from the ancient Egyptians and quit Egypt at night carrying that priceless wealth.
Q: Before getting involved in the legal aspects, what were the details of that major theft according to historical constants?
Q: How was the theft found out?
Q: Were they pursued then?
The key word was then "At midnight" and the Jewish women were instructed to usurp the Egyptians' gold and culinary utensils, which they did.
Q: The Jews as usual may cast doubts on this story, what then are the religious grounds which you said are in the Torah?
Q: How can such religious texts be adapted to the law?
Q: What are then the arguments that can be cited in order to restore the stolen gold?
A: At present, this is being calculated. If, for instance, we assume that what was stolen was one ton, it doubles every twenty years if the interest rate was only 5% annually. Since the ton is about 700 kilograms of pure gold (as the stolen gold works were mixed with copper) it would at least be 1125898240 million tons of gold. The stolen gold is probably estimated at about 300 tons of gold not just for one thousand years but for 5758 years, according to the Jewish calendar, hence the enormous amount of debt.
Q: Are there any compromises about that issue?

Makeya said that 75% of Iraqi women, according to the UNESCO statistics, suffer from poor educational levels in regard to writing and reading in Arabic, which is an important phenomenon in the battle for the development of the Iraq fortunes, especially as women constitute 55% of the total population.
We had plans which we had implemented to teach English and we have only to upgrade these plans.

They might have directed some warnings to the professors who had been key members of Al-Baath Party but they refrained from exercising any violence against them even though they used to go to the university in their military uniform carrying guns."
Although some see elections as a western way of life, Jealous Students, who have reservations about western thoughts, think they are capable of winning any elections in universities after their keenness on serving their colleagues in the university campus became quite obvious to all students, said one of the Jealous Students, Kazem Abdel-Gabbar. He pointed out that the presence of foreign forces in Iraq would not change third thoughts Arab and Islamic identity. We hope such forces will quit our country as soon as possible.

The US source linked between the current dilemma between the two countries and the aim of changing the situations in Arab countries.
"We emphasized that our war against Al-Qaeda organization began years before the US war against it.
Gaddafi talked about the new world order where Libya and America would be allies in the war on terrorism.
"We haven't got certain reading for the situation at this stage, nor do we expect a tangible progress this week," the official said.
However, the progress that has been achieved up till now does not disperse fears that Gaddafi may impede reaching an agreement in this regard.
The period of the agreement is 25 years, which is renewable. Another contract was signed with the American "Veritas" Company to conduct survey studies in the Syrian regional waters in the Mediterranean Sea.

Having achieved the first target, Israel sought to attain further gains in the other two fields and looked forward to killing two birds with one stone, i.e. achieving economic and political targets at one go. This can be achieved by making huge profits through many ways and means and via different investment companies on the one hand and establishing cooperation and friendship relations with central Arab countries that were archenemies to it until recently on the other hand, thus opening many doors in Arab countries through the help of the Americans.

This came after a green light had been given to such companies by the Israeli government. A major Israeli newspaper (Yadiot Aharonot) published a report on the bids of reconstructing Iraq saying: "Official sources at the U.S. Secretary of Defense (Pentagon) informed Israeli authorities that Israeli firms could provide raw materials, services and other different works related to Iraq's reconstruction."

Tantawi disowned the Fatwa emphasizing that "it concerned only the person who passed it." He highlighted that it did not represent Al-Azhar. Not only did he do that but he also passed a decree suspending Sheikh Nabawi Mohamed Al-Esh who had signed the fatwa and stamped it with Al-Azhar's seal and referred him to investigation.

Welch said that the American and the British forces "do their best to protect the Islamic sanctities" referring that "these forces did not enter any mosque at all".
Secretary general of the Islamic Research Academy Sheikh Sayed Wafa Abu Agour, who doubles as general supervisor of Fatwa Committee at Al-Azhar, laid it bare that sheikh Nabawi was not entitled to issue a fatwa in political causes and that his task was to issue fatwas regarding the religiously permissible and impermissible matters in social relations among Muslims rather than political issues.
For his part, Dr. Abdel Sabour Shahin, the Islamic thinker, said, "This collaborating council was appointed by the occupation forces. All the council's members have direct or indirect relations with the CIA and Isreali Mossad. They were appointed to try to achieve what the USA and Arab countries failed to achieve - recognizing the legitimacy of occupation under the pretext of establishing a democratic system and liberating Iraq."

International Delta Bank board chairman Ali Negm thinks that the state of chaos on the foreign exchange market required measures and controls to rationalize dealings whether in the form of withdrawals or deposits. He emphasized that such measures would not be a novelty as they are available in several European countries for the sake of controlling foreign exchange and avoiding their infiltration to the unofficial market and to seize any attempt to carry out money laundering operations. He added that insistence on circulation through the cash system gives the unofficial market a chance to get foreign exchange and speculate in it. Activation of other untraditional tools in the field of monetary dealing, on the other hand, would deprive speculators of their main resources of foreign exchange.
French BNP Paribas group raised its quota in BNP Paribas Le Caire (an Egyptian joint-stock company) by 11% so that the French contribution in the bank hits 87% against 13% for Banque du Caire, said the managing director of BNP Paribas Le Caire in a press conference held on Monday to announce that the bank had introduced the banking insurance service.

COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER EGYPTIAN-RUSSIAN INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS
The volume of trade exchange between the two countries does not reflect their deep relations, he said, pointing out that the idea of boosting Egyptian-Russian relations is different from previous periods, as the focus now is on encouraging businessmen to enter into fresh fields.
Joint fresh ventures based on researches and studies can be established with a view to reaching a distinguished volume of production, he said.
During the inauguration of the fourth session of the Egyptian-Russian joint trade committee, Minister of Foreign Trade Dr. Youssef Botros Ghali urged the Russian party to consider its stance towards Egypt in light of the actual measures taken by Egypt in that field.

He added that a technical committee had been set up with the participation of a Russian bank with Businessmen Society to solve banking problems that face exporters and importers in Russia and Cairo.
He said that setting up two trade centers for businessmen in both countries would be a serious and carefully studied attempt to embark on a new stage of Egyptian-Russian economic relations.

On the other hand, the Nile water rose by 73 centimetres at Al-Yam station, in North Sudan, 28 centimetres in Khartoum and 25 centrimetres at the North of Atbara, thus threatening flood this year that would threaten North Sudan and South Egypt and the consequent spread of locust swarms which would attack Egyptian borders with the coming of the flood within a few days.
Modern bases have also been set up in Abu Simbel tourist city, east Owaynat and the land reclamation area in the Egyptian south to combat locusts.
The wording of the message, written by Welch, comes exactly to the following effect: "Within the framework of the US-Egyptian fruitful cooperation, especially in combating terrorism and out of our desire to boost bilateral cooperation in hitting terrorist groups which perpetrated the 11th September attacks, thus causing recession worldwide, and taking revenge for Egypt on the terrorists who destroyed its economy following Luxor accident in the mid 1990s, we see it necessary to freeze bin Laden's balances as well as his activities that the CIA managed to inventory during the last stage."
It is worth mentioning that bin Laden's group implemented a chain of projects in Egypt, especially following the 11th September events, forefront of which were repairs and restorations in Cairo International Airport, which cost the Egyptian government over one million pounds last year. In addition, bin Laden's Imports and Export Company has a tremendous activity in Egypt, which will be completely paralyzed after freezing its accounts in banks and halting its activities.

If the president quits it, the NDP will become a mere small-sized party, they said.
Atef al-Saadawi, a researcher, said most Egyptian small parties develop no new views or ideologies.
The party experiment in Egypt is still in need of more freedom and development at the level of law, judicial control and political and social actuality, he said.
The second scenario is an alliance among small factions in a bid to tide over their shortage of financial resources and build organizational bases, enabling them to contest legislative elections through joint lists.
The major party's linkage to the president of the republic turns all parties in Egypt into small ones since such a thing is always related to the existence of the president as its leader, said political thinker Ibrahim Saad Eddin. When late president Sadat quitted Misr Party for the NDP, the former turned from a majority party into a mere small ineffective one.
According to Yunan Labib Rezk, a professor of modern history at Ein Shams University, all Egyptian parties are small as the major party in the country gets its strength and survival out of leading figures of the executive estate.
Egypt's social and sports clubs have seen recent changes that demonstrate the developments of the Egyptian society over the past fifty years.
Another reason is that such clubs were joined by large numbers of overseas Egyptians returning home, who have enough money to join them. Although all clubs raised membership dues to astronomical levels (the Shooting Club, 80,000 pounds, and Al-Jazeera Sporting Club, 25,000 U.S. dollars /over 140,000 pounds/), they attracted many new members, creating an inharmonious structure of behavioural patterns, mostly based on material, rather than social structure.
Egypt's late king Faruk used to go there to do exercises and throw his private parties. It also still retains a gambling table and a special gate used by Faruk.
The roof includes a group of marble-duded bamboo tables and a big bar surrounded with decorated wooden bars, overlooking Cairo from all directions.
Although the club's membership dues are not so high (only 30,000 pounds) compared to other clubs, membership conditions are stricter, including social position, culture and education, in a bid to keep the social facility unique and singular, according to counselor Moqbel Shaker, the club board chairman and former presiding judge of the Court of Cassation.
Afterwards, the conduct of honourable members' guests is assessed to decide whether to keep or cancel membership.
Like the Car Club in view of modest membership charges (only 20,000 pounds), the Capital Club is distinguished with classic furniture, with a special corner called "the law corner", frequented by People's Assembly Speaker Ahmed Fatehi Sorour, and focuses on drawing businessmen. It has 1,500 members, including pressmen, ambassadors, ministers and key businessmen. People involved in any legal cases or debtors are denied access.
It is marked with peculiarity and high-quality services which help members conclude deals.
It is marked by landscape, including palm trees, and buildings that date back to the Mameluke era.
Dr. Magid noted that it is a place for liberals, rather than the rich. Hard-minded people, even if rich, are not allowed in.
Unlike other clubs, it has different membership dues amounting to 40,000 pounds for the first time and then 2,500 pounds per family and 1,500 pounds per individual on an annual basis.
Villa owners there are also required to pay the same membership charges.
The Fatwa (religious opinion) Committee of the Islamic Institution of Al-Azhar said the Iraqi Governing Council (IGC) lacks religious and mundane legitimacy.
Any Arab or Muslim country dealing or cooperating with the IGC should be advised to get back to the fold of Muslims. But, if it does not positively comply with advice, other Arab and Muslim nations should not deal with it.
But, the fatwa was condemned by Salah Eddin Mohamed Baha'uldin, a Muslim member of the IGC, saying that matters should be judged in a realistic way. Key issues such as the Iraqi one should not be dealt with through making and exporting religious fatwas.
In its report submitted to the People's Assembly Speaker Dr Ahmed Fatehi Sourour, the committee confirmed that "the sluggishness of some bodies in admitting to the occurrence of the Rift Valley fever led to the spread of the disease even to other governorates.
The committee warned against slaughtering or eating sick animals and called for killing them.
Death tolls are conflicting. While the official sources say that they are 20 cases, unofficial sources say that there are 33 cases. There are concerns that the disease may spread to other governorates in Upper Egypt.
However, Israeli Minister of National Infrastructures Joseph Partizky seemed pessimistic about the idea, saying it was in the early stages but it was "worth consideration". The Israeli minister will leave for Washington after two weeks to push forward the idea.

Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, affiliated to Fatah movement pledged to retaliate to Israel's killing Palestinian activists.
The American side is headed by former ambassador in Syria Edward Digergan, who doubles as director of Washington-based James Baker General Policy Institute. He paid a visit on Saturday to Damascus at the head of an American unofficial delegation. One of the delegation's prominent members is the former US ambassador in the Middle East Christopher Ross.
Syrian circles close to that dialogue noted that the American side fathomed out some subtleties sensed by Arabs and Muslims. They also see that there is a fabricated obscurity concerning such points, which some tendentious media means seek to publicize and implant with the objective of distorting the facts and distracting attention from them.
Such a big rise achieved in the first half of the current year ensued from the hike of Saudi imports from the American market by 3%, hitting $2.29 billion versus $2.2 billion in the first half of 2002. However, this rise reflects as well the increase in Saudi exports to the US market by 74%, reaching in excess of $9.7 billion, i.e. $4.13 billion over the export value registered in the same period of 2002.
In an open report to the American companies willing to deal with the Saudi market, they affirmed that the tensed security situation in the region didn't affect Saudi-American commercial ties.
Nonetheless, other parties opine that the cabinet's decree on launching the dollar interbank early November means that there are strong indications that the decree on forming the CBE's board of directors is about to be issued. In case the board is formed this week, its approval would be obtained on the new mechanism, which mainly aims at finding a de facto and genuine dollar price, getting rid of random prices set by speculators and increasing cash fluidity in foreign currency in the banking sector through allowing banks that have dollar surplus to sell it to others that have deficit in dollar supply.
They also have short financial positions in foreign currency. - The necessity of urgently meeting banks' demands with the CBE, as it is not reasonable to ask banks to sell their foreign exchange, while there is no liquidity. Rather, there is severe shortage that urged them to make their financial position short.
Egypt's Minister of Planning Othman Mohamed Othman said on Monday his country's foreign currency earners exceed spending rates, ascribing the exchange rate crisis to speculation in U.S. dollars.
The Egyptian minister cushioned the unfavourable points of the exchange rate deregulation decision adopted late last January, noting that its advantages outweighed its disadvantages.

PRIVATE STOCK EXCHANGE IN EGYPT
He added that next November would witness the establishment of the biggest centre in the Arab world for training human cadres with brokerage companies in "governance" principles and enhancing awareness of the importance of stock exchange markets. This is meant to attract more dealers pending the anticipated recovery in circulation movement on the bonds market when the Egyptian government starts putting up bonds and treasury bills on the stock exchange in early December (this year) through the key dealers system which will be adopted by 12 Egyptian banks who obtained licenses from the Authority and the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) in that concern.
BANK DEPOSITS SHOOT UP BY 7.3 BILLION POUNDS OVER ONE MONTH
Local credit went up by roughly 5.4 billion pounds to 392.8 billion pounds in June-July 2003.
The aim of that move is to activate demand on the Egyptian pound and curbing the dollarization phenomenon that helped bring speculators on the market.
Banking sources said the idea was meant to make banks capable of opening documentary credits necessary for exportation processes that stand for 60% of market needs of the dollar.
Foremost of these indicators is the volume of deposits in dollar, especially the non-governmental ones, which jumped up to 110.01 billion pounds late last July against 105.8 billion pounds late last June, an increase of 4.27 billion pounds.
With regard to the Egyptian reserves of the foreign currencies, CBE announced that they dropped 244 million dollars to 14.5 billion dollars compared with 14.8 billion dollars.
The report issued by the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMS) on Egypt's foreign trade pointed out that imports went up, too, in the same period this year from 53.4 billion pounds versus 32 billion pounds last year, an increase of 10.5%.

PRIVATIZATION TRAIN THREATENED WITH STOPPAGE
What about privatization real position? During these 11years only 192 companies have been sold while 177 companies are still waiting for privatization.
The privatization program also witnessed some unsuccessful deals, which forced the government to regain some companies after they had been privatized, like Egypt Free Shops.
Ministerial conflicts The past ten years confirmed that around 19 companies would not be put up for sale due to their strategic importance as well as national and social dimensions. Foremost of these companies are pharmaceutical companies (12 in number) in order to provide drugs at reasonable prices for citizens, though it is a provisional measure as Egypt is not subjected yet to the performance of rights protection treaty, in addition to a number of holding companies like, Sugar and Complementary Industries, Misr for Aluminum Company, Eastern Company, North Cairo Flour Mills Company, South Egypt Flour Mills and Alexandria Mills.
For his part, financial analysis and evaluation expert Eng. Mohamed Hassouna who doubles as head of the technical bureau of Public Enterprise Sector Minister, said that the main goal of the privatization program is to improve the efficiency of and develop productive units. It is a means of restructuring through having new efficient, creditworthy and technically qualified owners. Privatization through transferring ownership is not the only system applied to public sector units, but there are many other systems like leasing and administration contracts which achieved the improvement and development goals for those who want to own such companies.
Local debts recorded a sharp rise in the last fiscal year by around 25.6 billion pounds up to roughly 246.890 billion pounds late last June.

The investment costs of such projects hit $10 billion out of total investments amounting to $17.7 billion, a rate of 57%. He pointed out that the GAIFZ sought to attract international industrial investments and technology to operate in new projects inside the country and in the free zones contributing to boosting the revenues of national economy, providing new job opportunities and developing the new cities and the free and industrial zones in various governorates. This is sought through attending international events, holding public conferences and bilateral fora with various countries of the world to promote the chances of investment and cooperation in the establishment of new investments in Egypt.
Beneficiaries of the program over the coming five years include a number of African countries which participate in the program for the first time, namely Burundi, Mauritania, Togo and Uganda. The program comes within the framework of bilateral cooperation between Egypt and Japan over the last years, from which 270 farm trainees from 25 African countries benefited, said Dr. Fadia Nusair, supervisor of the EIAC.
Egypt is ranked third among the beneficiaries of the aid programs provided by the Canadian Agency for International Development (CAID).

COOPERATION PROTOCOL WITH ANGOLA
The Angolan minister pointed out that bilateral relations go back to the pre-independence era and that the civil war in Angola had affected different fields of life as the Angolan government is bent on reconstruction. He voiced his admiration of Egyptian projects in the sphere of new cities, roads, bridges, potable water plants and sanitary drainage.
The Egyptian consortium that will execute the project will contribute 40% of the company's capital, while 20% will be bankrolled through Jordanian social guarantees, Kutaishat said, adding that the final measures to procure the necessary finance will start as soon as agreements are signed with such parties.
Regarding the projects proposed by AOI to the Iraqi side, Hussein said, "We offered them projects of infrastructure, projects of setting up exchanges and communications bodies, projects of civil defence, fire fighting, water, electricity, technology, developing projects, overhauling hospitals, universities, schools, agricultural automation, ecological projects and rail ways".
However, this competition did not preoccupy us as we are used to bidding for international tenders to set up strategic projects. There are Arab companies that are already operative in Iraq but Iraq needs more Arab companies.
It pointed out that as of last April 29th, the free trade exchange agreement between Egypt and Morocco was implemented including exemption of some commodities from customs duties in both countries. The exemption, however, does not cover agricultural products or food industries or the products banned from access, circulation or use in either country.
Arab foreign exchange reserves hit $84 billion, the report said, paying attention to the serious pressure imposed on Arab economies within the framework of global and regional orientation towards economic globalization and liberalization of trade and their negative effects on Arab markets. It also warned against marginalization of Arabs amidst fierce competition amongst exporters and the negative effects of protectionist measures imposed by economic blocs.
The report added that no extra privileges should be given to foreign partnerships outweighing that stipulated in Arab free trade zone agreement so that foreign products might not enjoy preferential treatment at the expense of Arab products.

To save only 10 percent of water consumption in cultivation is enough to cover the needs of drinking and industry across the world.
Sinai's available subterranean water is estimated at around 210 million cubic meters, of which only 42 percent are used.
According to the Jewish doctrine, the borders of the original location of the Temple Mount are unknown. However, the Jews believe that it is located beneath the Al-Quds, especially after the extension introduced to the location by king Herodus.
The military wanted to ask him when they would return home, but that date does not seem to be near, it is even getting farther away!
Nor can he promise inflows of funds to facilitate the civil administration's task, especially the provision of electricity, water and other basic services. The exorbitant cost (about $60 billion) awaits the Congress's approval in an election year.
He just put aside all his problems emanating from a war unplanned for to launch threats at Iran and Syria.
There are numerous Sharonite Israeli fingerprints in the thought and action techniques adopted by Rumsfeld and his aides.
All this requires that Washington should unveil its agenda and to play the game of international coalition properly, otherwise it would have to muddle on single-handed just as it started.
This move comes on the heels of the Supreme Constitutional Court explanation, which regarded the performance of military service as a basic condition for participation in public action. Rumours have it that there are draft dodgers in the range between 1500 and 2300 in those councils whose members amount to over 50 thousands.
Such fresh procedures have angered several local council members who voiced official protest against the application of the Supreme Constitutional Court explanation to them. Many of them said that those councils were local and are regarded as part of the local administrations in governorates and cannot be called legislative councils as is the case with the Parliament or Shura Council. They added that the tendency to apply the explanation to them is a wrong one and shows misunderstanding of the law and the constitution.
The sources added that some Americans had asked State Department to treat Al Fatwa Committee on par with the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice group in Saudi Arabia and regard it as a religious center that supports terrorist fundamentalist thought in the Islamic world. Such a concept of the committee adopted by the American Administration and its embassy in Cairo was attributed not only to Sheikh Al Nabawi Al Esh's fatwa (religious opinion) banning the recognition of the Iraqi Governing Council (IGC) in Iraq but to the frequent attitudes adopted by the Fatwa Committee towards various religious issues that run counter to the American interests, hence the demand to cancel it.
Although Al-Azhar's statements carried the reverse of the American sources reports Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh decided to suspend Sheikh Al-Esh and refer him to investigation.
A quandary has been created by a fatwa (religious opinion) by one of Al Azhar Fatwa Committee members.
Even if the Iraqis themselves asked me about that matter, I would urge them to ask their scholars in Iraq. It is simply religiously impermissible to exceed my limits. It is not my right to say whether the IGC is legitimate or not and I, therefore, summoned Sheikh Al-Esh who gave the fatwa, warned him and cross-questioned him about his fatwa.
The Grand Sheikh then rode his car and drove away and we asked the Islamic Research Academy Secretary General Sheikh Sayed Wafa Abou Agour: Q: Isn't the IGC lacking in religious legitimacy at least because it was imposed on the Iraqis by force of the American occupation?
Q: Iraq is an Arab Islamic country and we are Arabs and Muslims. A: Why don't you leave that matter to Iraq's people? Aren't they better entitled to do so than we are?
A: Who said that? Are you in Iraq seeing for yourselves?
Q: Your reverence, it is America which conceals that to avoid its people's anger and so that they would not ask it to withdraw as was the case with Vietnam. Anyhow, let's go back to our main point. The question is: Do you think that such an Iraqi council was based on the principle of Shura (consultation) and the people's will or that it came on the point of the American gun?
Among the pros of the illegitimacy of the IGC is erudite scholar Mahmoud Ashour, Al Azhar former deputy Grand Sheikh and member of Islamic Research Academy who emphasized that any council which did not represent those whom it leads is lacking in religious and worldly legitimacy. The IGC has come without any wish or will on the part of the people. It came in fulfillment of the American occupation will and to carry out American wishes and ambitions. Therefore, it is neither legitimate nor eligible and we are warning all rulers in the Arab and Islamic nation that any dealings with that council means lending legitimacy to it, which will be utterly rejected and repudiated by the peoples.
Secondly: the increase in security instability leading to further boredom and rejection of the American occupation.
"Is the appointment of a governing council without the Iraqi's desire the democracy it wants to plant in the region?
All of those rulers are dictators. They are profiteers. So, why do we insist on leaving Iraq to those who occupied it?
IKHWAN LEADER WELCOMES LEFT WING'S SUPPORT OF ISLAMIC PARTY
He went on saying, "The Muslim Brotherhood has been present in Egyptian actuality for 75 years, and has a national influence. It is also the main political force in the country, and always gets involved in various elections, occasions and situations. Anyone who objects to that contradicts this reality."
Although such a question was not included in the formal talks between both sides, Egyptian military liaison officials called on the Israeli side during most of the meetings to necessarily stand against the mafias who run drugs from southeast Asia and carry out other illegal activities. But, the Israeli side declined to cooperate though Egypt continuously asked for a detailed map of such tunnels, the former ambassador said.
After foreign refuse collection companies started work in Greater Cairo suburbs to put an end to one of the most sophisticated environmental problems in the Egyptian capital of Cairo, namely refuse, a scientific study showed that the refuse collected from Cairo is the richest in the world in terms of useful materials! The price of refuse could reach 90 up to LE6000 per ton due to refuse richness in several organic materials that could be used in many processing industries.
Such clothes are used once again in stuffing pillows and mattresses. Prices of paper and cardboard collected from refuse are LE30 and LE70 respectively. Low-quality paper could be recycled to be used in making bags for wrapping vegetables and meat, he added. Strangely enough, plastic price per ton is LE800.
Under the explanation, the 9 million young men will not be able to do any political or party activities, nor will they run for local or legislative elections, he said.
OFFICIAL AT CAIRO AIRPORT PREVENTS MINISTER OF INSURANCE FROM TRAVELLING
They included the importation of Sudanese meat in return for Egyptian commodities, the construction of a road to link the two countries through the completion of the Alexandria-Aswan road and lifting 15 commodities from the negative list of trade exchange items between Egypt and Sudan.
He added that the agreement on lifting 15 items of the trade exchange negative list came as a prelude to canceling the list altogether.
The Egyptian-Israeli IMG, which possesses the gas concession, submitted a draft contract to the Israeli Electricity Company.
"BMW" INJECTS 60 MILLION U.S. DOLLARS' WORTH OF NEW INVESTMENTS INTO EGYPT
In mid-January 2004, the group will settle the 540-day debate on its agency in the country as the case of former agency owner Hossam Abul-Fotouh, who appeared in court in several cases, has turned from a mere "lame duck" issue into a public opinion one.
Last March 15, the BMW signed an initial contract with Bavaria for Cars, allowing the latter to be the former's agent in Egypt, valued at 100-150 million pounds. Abul-Fotouh bought the agency with around 240 million pounds 18 years back.
Minister of Electricity Dr Hassan Yunis and his Syrian counterpart Eng. Munir Sa'ib Al-Dahr discussed the foundation of the Egyptian-Syrian company for electrical studies and consultations which reached its final stages as a prelude to announcing it as an investment project by the end of this year. They also discussed the position of the Egyptian-Syrian company towards the project of electric power systems and the increase of joint cooperation between Egyptian Syrian companies to deliver high voltage towers of 220 kilovolts and 66 kilovolts to Syria.
Government sources denied that there were such commercial exchange with Israel at present as is confirmed by Israeli authorities concerned. The sources expected such exchanges with Tel Aviv to reach zero point if Israel continued its ferocious acts in Palestinian lands and its negative attitude towards Syria.
Last week, the Israeli Exportation Institute pointed out a rise in Israeli exports to Arab countries since the beginning of this year by 13%, thus reaching about $88 million compared with the corresponding period in the last two years.
With regard to Egypt, however, Israeli exports went down by 3% as they reached about $20 million. Exports to Gulf States also declined by 43%, reaching $2 million. Israeli exports to Tunisia went down remarkably by 68%, reaching about $200 thousand.
In spite of the importance of these exemptions in encouraging banks to merge according to bankers, the spokesman for Banks Union (BU) Ahmed Qura confirmed that the BU did not present a certain proposal to Finance Ministry regarding granting tax exemptions to banks willing to amalgamate. Qura justified this saying, "No bank has submitted any proposal in this regard and, consequently, the issue was not referred to BU board of directors." Qura averred that the proposal is not on the cards now in the banking sector.
In case banks are not able to increase their capital before the deadline, the shortest way to that end is to merge into other banking entities.
It also reviewed reports presented by the minister of domestic trade on available basic commodities at moderate prices.
FEDERATION OF INDUSTRIES SETS 9 MAIN POINTS TO REVAMP ITS ACTIVITIES
Among the main points enshrined in the drive are to reinforce relations between the federation and the chambers of industry by establishing the federation's executive board with the goal of cooperation and coordination between the federation and the chambers to attract more members, raise financial resources, exchange technical know-how between the federation and the chambers and set a common uniform position on existing important technical topics.
Although the country is suffering from a severe shortage in foreign exchange resources, which caused the Egyptian pound rate of exchange to collapse in front of foreign currencies, Dr. Ebeid recently decided to stop exporting azotic fertilizers.
Head of Exporters Division at the Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Ali Eisa said, "These decrees mean that Egyptian products would lose a number of international markets."
Non-governmental deposits constituted 83% of total deposits at a value of 341.4 billion pounds, 231.2 billion pounds of which are in domestic currency and the equivalent of 110.1 billion pounds are in foreign currencies, the report said.
The dollar's current rate of exchange at banks and black market does not reflect the real value of the pound, he said.
Speculators will incur heavy losses and their expectations in the market will come to nothing, he added.
"The banks will not speculate in foreign exchange. However, some banks wanted to benefit from such a situation but the CBE directed instructions to them to necessarily mend their positions," he added.
The dollar rate of exchange on the market is not fair. He denied the companies speculating in the dollar.
In his word during the seminar devoted to the discussion of the dollar rates of exchange issue and the ramifications ensuing from the deregulation of the pound rate of exchange, he said that it was difficult to judge the experiment of the deregulation of the pound rate of exchange which started on January 29th during the last period alone. He pointed out that in the experiments of the countries which preceded us and had similar economic conditions, the evaluation process took a period ranging from one month to 18 months.
He added that there had been a considerable rise in the dollar rate of exchange on the unofficial market but once the CBE intervened, its rate went down by more than 40 piasters at one go, which proves that such a rate was unrealistic and rather speculative.
In August 2001, the dollar rate of exchange moved to 415 piasters and the margin rose to 3%. In December 2001, the rate of exchange rose to 450 piasters. Then came the deregulation decision in January 2003 when the dollar rate of exchange stood at 530 piasters.
For his part, Car Importers Division chairman Efat Abdel-Ati sees that the increase in car prices in the recent period in spite of the decline of dollar by 90 piasters, is due to the fact that price movement is associated with currency rates especially the rise of other foreign currencies against the dollar. The dollar equaled to 120 yens, now it equals 109 yens. This means that the prices of Japanese-made cars increased by 9%.
Motor city general manger Hosni Gheriani ascribed such an increase in car price in the last period in spite of the decline of dollar to the rise of customs to around 2,000 pounds. The car customs soared form 45 thousand pounds to 47,000 pounds, he said, adding that in spite of the decline of dollar by 20 piasters, there is a rise in prices of other currencies especially yen and euro. Such a rise led to the increase of car prices, Gheriani said, pointing out that the rise in the differential of currencies and customs can not be noticed by crowd.
When dollar rate declined from 7 pounds to 6.40 pounds, before it rose once again. Thus, the two months of November and December will witness stability in car prices because the documentary credits for purchasing cars are opened one or two months ahead of importation. As a result, the batches which will be imported in this period will witness relative stability in prices as agreements to buy such cars were concluded during September and October which witness a drop in dollar rate. This means that car prices will not increase over the prices of October.
Official banking sources with the Egyptian banking system uncovered Egyptian banks willingness to enter the Iraqi market in a bid to rehabilitate Iraqi banks whether with Egyptian expertise and banking cadres or through opening branches for Egyptian banks operative in Baghdad. This will take place immediately after the stability of security and political conditions there.
General Director of CIB, Hisham Hassan thinks that the Egyptian banks had the potentialities to enter the Iraqi market through opening branches for them there or through setting up joint banks with the Iraqi party. He, however, linked that to the stability of conditions there especially as Egyptian banks had no branches or dealings in Iraq even under the deposed Iraqi regime when banking activities there were confined to a number of Iraqi banks such as Al Rafideen Bank.
Amr Tawfiq, Director with the Egyptian American Bank emphasized the Iraqi and Syrian market need to the presence of Egyptian banks there through spreading branches and correspondents to transfer Egyptian banking expertise. He expected the construction of joint banks with the Iraqi party to rehabilitate Iraqi banks. He, however, said that it was untimely for the Egyptian banks to enter Iraq due to the instability of political and security conditions. Matters will differ, however, after Anglo-American forces quit Iraq.
Egyptian economy indices improved, as trade balance deficit declined by some 4.9 billion pounds in the period January-July 2003 to hit 14.35 billion pounds against 19.24 billion pounds in the same period of 2002, said a report compiled by the Cabinet's Information and Decision Support Centre (IDSC). The report noted that total Egyptian exports went up tangibly in the first six months of the current year to hit 21.09 billion pounds versus 12.83 billion pounds in the corresponding period last year. Meanwhile, exports soared up from 32.07 billion pounds to 35.44 billion pounds.
The rate of dollarization has risen in economy from 20% in 1999 to 27% this year following the steady deterioration in the value of the Egyptian pound, which has gone down by 81% in the last 3 years.
It is noteworthy that the IMF had criticized the pound flotation in Egypt pointing out that the flotation system did not work efficiently on the Egyptian market!
Economists attributed the rise in foreign exchange deposits growth rates to the savers' tendency towards such deposits in a bid to preserve the purchasing power of their currency and avoid its deterioration after the steady decline in the value of the Egyptian pound.
"Foreign investments are attracted to the countries that enjoy plenty of trained manpower and have a developed economic structure," the study said, stressing the necessity of having an independent institution promoting foreign investments inside Egypt in light of the international climate characterized by stiff competition.
East Asian countries shared the cake of investments with West European countries due to adopting an open-door strategy. These countries, the study added, reduced the customs tariffs, removed the restrictions imposed on imports and adopted an exchange rate flexible policy as well as flexible financial and banking policies.
Italy came first among exporters of tourists to Egypt in view of the number of visitors and tourist nights over the first six months of this year. A total of 306,100 Italian tourists visited Egypt in January-June, spending 2.251 million nights.
The number of tourists coming to Egypt went up to 2.25 millions in January-June against 2.19 millions in the same month last year.
He added that those new rooms had cost 1 billion pounds in addition to 300 million pounds as cost of the basic utilities of those rooms.
Al-Azhar turned down a Russian demand to join the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC), which it presented a few days ago.
"The Russian demand is tendentious," IRA member Dr. Ra'fat Othman said. "It can join as an observer rather than a member. Although the number of Muslims in Russia are 20 millions it is not a reason for Russia joining the OIC," he added. The Russian Muslims are considered a minority, Othman said, pointing out that there are many and large minorities in many a country which outnumber a whole Muslim country but their countries' official religion is not Islam.
The group emphasized that five of its activists had been arrested, while the authorities admitted to the crackdown, but said that only two students were arrested and referred to the prosecution.
Isn't it high time the officials realized that development can only be achieved through freedom, which is a right of everybody without discrimination?" the statement said.
It emphasized that no contact channels have been opened to export Egyptian gas (to Israel). "This file was closed long years ago," it added.
It indicated that 80 percent of crimes in Egypt in 2002 were committed by married people, while the remaining 20 percent were perpetrated by bachelors.
THREE ALARMS SOUNDED AT NAJAF
Najaf massacre represented an alarm sounded to the Iraqis to the affect that the time was elapsing and on the wing and their country might be exposed to the danger of becoming a theatre of major operations that exceed its limits.
If the USA has made the error of ignoring an Iraqi role in toppling Saddam and in the period that followed that, the Iraqis should extort that role through agreement on a minimal concept of an Iraq that can accommodate all.
The region, which could co-exist with the "Lebanese arena" and the Lebanese chaos, cannot co-exist with the "Iraqi arena" or the Iraqi chaos due to factors pertaining to Iraq's location and structure.
Thus, Najaf crime has sounded three alarms which should not escape quick and timely notice before it is too late.
Men, too have to answer the question: Have you ever worked as a procurer? Intellectuals denounced such type of degrading questions which gave the impression that such matters were customary in the Saudi society.
Marking the introduction of a new perfume produced by French Jean Louis Vermeil Company on Friday, Saudi Rasaya Perfumes chairman Mansour Al-Hussein said to reporters in a news conference, "perfumes, accessories and recreational products witnessed a sluggish growth over the recent years due to the Iraqi crisis." However, he said, the perfume market in the Middle East region would recover in the rest of the current year.
A statement issued by Sudan's embassy in Nairobi asked the USA to compensate the victims of the raid it had launched at the medicine factory in Khartoum in 1998.
Well-informed Israeli sources said more than ten Israeli companies signed or were going to sign contracts with US forces in Iraq, emphasizing that those companies started their work inside Iraq either directly through American Pechtel or Jordanian enterprises working within the framework of the Jordanian-Israeli Chamber of Commerce. Meetings were convened and arrangements made to operate Kirkuk-Haifa oil pipeline, the sources added.
Israeli Export Institute expected Israeli exports to Iraq to hit over $100 million over the coming three years through many marketing and infrastructure projects in addition to $50 million in foodstuff exports to thousands of American soldiers in Iraq.
The first to propose that project was Israeli premier Ariel Sharon during his meeting with President George W. Bush in Washington. Sharon, at that time, asked Bush not to transfer Iraqi oil via Syria because, as he said, this would support terrorism.
Security coordination between Israel and America in Iraq has become a must, he said, amidst reports of growing Al-Qaeda and Ansar Al-Islam (Islam Supporters), terror groups, activities in the country and concerns about Syrian-Iranian security cooperation aimed at Americans and Israelis.
The new ministers will be sworn in before the Iraqi Governing Council (IGC) on Wednesday. Yesterday, the Iraqis were busy identifying the new figures in the cabinet formation who range from the communist to the Muslim Brotherhood advocate to the independent Shiite, the Kurd, the Turkman and the Assyrian.
Al-Hafiz, who left Iraq to study in Prague in the mid seventies and stayed there practicing political action as member of the Iraqi Communist Party Central Committee, will face a particular need to plan to solve the mother of all crises in Iraq today, i.e. unemployment suffered by over 5 million Iraqis Strikingly in the first cabinet formation in the post-Saddam Iraq, it includes the first Kurd occupying the position of Iraqi Foreign Minister since the state was established in 1921. Hoshiar Zibari, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) spokesman, had dealt with the Kurdish cause and the development of the Iraqi cause in a manner characterized by calm diplomacy, which had not been known to the Iraqi Foreign Ministry in the previous regime.
Expert in electric energy and economics who is well-known in the USA, Dr. Ayham Al Samirai will offer valuable help in solving the chronic crisis of electricity Iraq has been suffering from since 1991 when generators and electric current grids were exposed to an almost complete destruction in the second Gulf War and the Ministry of Electricity is a first attempt which Al Samirai, who was opposed to Saddam's regime and remaining close to Al-Wifaq- before he shifted to Independent Democrats Gathering, is to define its feature if not to start as is the case with the expertise of Dr. Ibrahim, oil economics professor and son of the enlightened Shiite figure, Dr.
AMERICANS PLAN TO SET UP FIRST IRAQI SECURITY APPARATUS
Al-Ani added that the "officers and Civilians Movement," which comprises military and security expertise, had offered the American bodies a security plan of three axes; protection of the borders, formation of a strong security establishment and co-ordination with American security bodies.
Some Movement's sources said that work was underway in the movement to lay down a list of the names of applicants for working for the new security apparatus that will include 3-5 thousands, forming the nucleus for the proposed security force.
It can, likewise, claim that the new government was born at the hands of the IGC whose birth and legitimacy are known to all.
Syria can by no means distance itself from the Iraqi regime or content itself with closing the border in a bid to fend off any possible danger. The prospects of the situation in Iraq is of direct interest to Syria from the perspectives of stability, security, balance of power and economy.
Most probably, Damascus has seen in the last few weeks how Iraq's neighbouring countries dealt with the establishment of the IGC.
Washington certainly needs the pragmatism and experience of the countries neighbouring Iraq to get out of the trap it has chosen to fall into.
Intensive efforts have been carried out between both sides in the last two months to mull over the release of Jordanian prisoners in Israel.

- Negotiated expulsion or rather getting access to his door and negotiating with him directly or through a third party to hand himself over and then getting him to accept deportation to a particular place.
- Isolation: tightening siege on him and isolating him from the world. The plan was set in the Israeli army after Ariel Sharon stepped to power and repeatedly announced that Arafat was unsuitable and must be expelled.
They pointed out that any bullet might cause confrontations that might claim many lives including Arafat's life.

The sources said that companies had submitted a request to banks officials over the last few days asking them to open documentary credits to the value of $131 million. Nevertheless, the banks refused although textile companies sold $50 million of their export revenues to banks during the last two months.
The sources called upon Minister of Public Enterprise Sector Dr Mukhtar Khattab to necessarily intervene to solve the crisis and hold talks with the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) and other banks officials in order to meet the companies foreign exchange needs and open documentary credits, particularly as the minister had instructed the exporting companies to sell their dollar surplus to banks in an attempt to find a solution to the dollar crisis.
Deputy chairman of the chamber, Mohamed Al-Morshedi added that the yarn crisis was aggravating, especially after a large number of domestic spinners stopped operating due to lack of cotton. Making up for that through importation has led to a rise in yarn prices due to fluctuations of exchange rates.

"The example," he said, "is clear in the Egyptian potato consignments that did not meet European specifications. Such consignments were turned down by the British and European markets in general. Israel, then, seized the chance and dumped markets with Israeli potato."
The second and new complaint is about exchange rate and remittances.
The value of Egyptian imports from the British market accounted for 498.6 million pounds sterling in 1997 and dwindled in 2001 to 454.8 million pounds sterling.

PROPOSALS TO INCREASE OUR STAINLESS STEEL EXPORTS TO JAPAN
It is to be mentioned that the European and American types enjoy a good reputation on the Japanese market.
Despite the yawning gap between exports and imports during the first six months of this year - 24.6 million dollars worth of Egypt's exports to Japan against 37.1 million dollars worth of imports - there are suitable circumstances to boost Egypt's exports to the Japanese market, which is considered an open one governed by supply, demand and quality principles for any commodity to the exclusion of rice, as the Japanese government sets complicated conditions on importing it, the study said.
Egyptian and Moroccan businessmen agreed on implementing 6 joint projects with investments hitting some 105 million dollars. These projects will be in the fields of sea fishing, tourism, medical requirements, packaging, baking fishe and producing PVC substance which is used in producing plastics.

The Jordanian authorities stopped the passage of Egyptian citrus fruit exports via its lands to Gulf States in cooling vehicles, via which more than 70% of the Egyptian citrus exports are exported to the Arabian Gulf area. Although official bodies in Egypt moved to square up to retention of trucks in the Jordanian Al-Aqaba Port, Jordanian Al-Madora Port was opened, through which the trucks cross to reach "Halat Ammar" Port in Saudi Arabia, which serves only the goods sent to Western Saudi Arabia, Jeddah and peripheral areas.

NUMBER OF THE POOR IN EGYPT ON INCREASE SINCE 2000, WORLD BANK DOCUMENT

Al-Azhar's Islamic Research Academy issued a fatwa (religious opinion) announcing cosmetics containing lard ingredients as religiously impermissible, in response to an enquiry from an Egyptian citizen about Islam's opinion of girls using make-up especially those containing lard and alcohol. The fatwa mentioned that cosmetics products containing religiously tabooed substances like lard or alcohol are religiously impermissible.
However, he added, such proposals did not receive the least attention or care even though they could create a new Arab nation with strong and new institutions.
He cited the goings-on in Iraq as evidence to his argument as well as the Israeli occupation practices in Palestine including killing women, children and demolition of houses and scraping of farms and gardens. The battle field, he added, has become the house and the building rather than ditches and defensive and military sites so much so that women and children have become the main concern and hence the importance of getting them trained in order to stand in the face of enemy soldiers.
The first defendant, in turn, used to bribe a ministry undersecretary with the General Authority for Investment in order to get permits and licenses claiming that he is a senior businessman as well as other permits allowing him to enter the VIP lounge at Cairo International Airport lest he would be frisked down or his luggage be confiscated and to meet as well a senior official with the VIP lounge, who is accused in the case too.
Hala Tala'at Hammad, daughter of a former minister, was also accused in the case for she used to help the first defendant launder his money via the foreign bank she works for and then smuggle the funds abroad.
I was neither tried nor had to pay a fine". Ibrahim Rafi, another South Sinai deputy presented a copy of the official decree exempting Sinai's sons from conscription to the Legislative Committee in defence of Sinai deputies. Matrouh deputy Salouma Hakim who is also accused of being a draft dodger asked for the floor in today's sitting.
Sheikh Sayed Wafa Abu Agour, secretary-general of the Islamic Research Academy, was quoted as saying that fatwas made by the committee should be restricted to social, inheritance, family and individual issues. Political affairs ought to be handled by specialists, he said.
A source close to the council expressed satisfaction with the Al-Azhar's decision prohibiting political fatwas as a good step in the right direction.
"We also say that resistance factions should adopt legitimate approaches, the lack of which makes Egypt denounce Israel's acts against civilians," he said.
In response, Maher added that Egypt does not want any party to take any decision that may complicate the peace process.
However, Abu Zeid attributed the delay in implementing agricultural projects in Al-Serr Wal-Qawarir area, to the high costs of lifting water to such an area, pointing out studies to find alternatives in order to be used in such heights.
In a message to Information and Culture Center affiliated to the Cairo-based Japan's embassy, he said the Japanese Foreign Ministry has always been issuing strongly worded statements following any Palestinian bombing operation, blasting the Palestinian side for security failures while remaining silent about Israeli aggression.
POPE SHENUDA UNCOVERS ASSASSINATION THREATS DUE TO HIS REJECTION OF PERVERSION
He added that he would also make contacts to drum up international support for combating this immoral behaviour. "This campaign will include the International Churches Council, Middle East Synod and church councils of America, Europe, Australia, Canada and Africa."
The Orthodox Coptic Church Synod chaired by Pope Shenuda issued a recent statement condemning attempts by Western churches to legalize homosexuality.
The statement also supported audacious calls inside and outside churches which are opposed to homosexuals' marriage, exercise of homosexuality outside churches or homosexuals' access to church ranks.
"With greater reason, the official bodies in Egypt and Libya should take up the filing of an urgent lawsuit to get compensations under the international laws and covenants, which make natural and legitimate the right to get compensations for any harm."
He disclosed that he sent a written message to Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher four months ago urging an official intervention by the State to espouse this issue. But, he seemed to have received neither a negative nor a positive response.
ROW BETWEEN TANTAWI AND EGYPTIAN SCHOLARS ON IRAQ'S FATWA
This opinion has aroused the anger of a number of Islamic Research Academy (IRA) members. For his part, the IRA member Dr Ra'fat Othman, who doubles as dean of the Faculty of Sharia and Law at Al-Azhar University, said, "In my opinion, Tantawi's point of view, though he is the Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar, does not represent Al-Azhar, as the role of Al-Azhar cannot be confined to Egypt or any other country but Al-Azhar has a big religious and educational role that has made it as well as Egypt a mecca for knowledge and culture".
IRA Secretary General and Head of Fatwa Supreme Council in Al-Azhar Sheikh Sayed Wafaa Abu-Aggour in his capacity as the highest jurisprudence authority in Al-Azhar, commented on the events saying, "The uproar triggered by the committee ensued from our interference as jurists in the political affairs that should be left to the competent officials.
The Foreign Ministry referred a request by a French Jewish Society including Egyptian Jews to the Supreme Council of Antiquities and other relevant bodies for discussion and determination.

ISRAELI EMBASSY IS HOTBED OF SPIES
These documents also show the allowances offered to collaborators and urge them to collect much more information about extremist Islamic groups nationwide.
The Israeli embassy is the only one that has a position for an agricultural attache called Yaqoub Rosh. Oppositionists say that Rosh plays a great role in doing harm to Egyptian agriculture.
To prove his argument, the ambassador cited the case of recruiting Abdullah Abdel-Mon'em Ali Hamed from Al-Mansoura city who was trained and pushed into the realm of collaboration and espionage in favour of Israel, pointing out that through security investigations and Israeli witnesses' testimonies it turned out that the Israeli embassy plays dubious roles, especially as far as the terrorist movement, which was active from 1990 to 1997, was concerned.
Al-Eskandarani used to facilitate this task, arrange meetings and inform him of the appointments. Sassoon, accordingly, used to cancel his appointments and head straight to the Tahrir Square to meet Al-Eskandarani when the latter called him.
Therefore, he recruited a number of extremists for such a task and supplied them with arms via mediators from Sinai Bedouins.
Bhang still topped the list of drugs by 76 percent in 2002, up 18 percent over 2001.
In an unprecedented lawsuit filed against the government by Ibrahim al-Kholi, an emeritus professor of Al-Azhar University and imam of Azzam Mosque in south Cairo Helwan suburb, calling on officials of the Ministry of Wakfs (religious endowments) and security organs not to poke their noses in his religious speeches and lessons which he has been delivering for 25 years now without receiving any financial returns. In his petition, he demanded 2 million U.S. dollars in reparations for such interference, a sum which he plans to donate to Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Resurrection Church.
In its first comment on the resignation of Foreign Minister Assistant Dr. Abdullah Al-Ashal, the Foreign Ministry welcomed Al-Ashal's decision to go to court and said it would take the whole file to court, too.
However, the source said, differences date back to former Foreign Minister Amr Moussa though they were not personal.
It is noteworthy that Maher frequently asked Al-Ashal not to break the code of practice and publish or give statements to newspapers in contravention with the mainstream of the state policy, the source added, pointing out that these recommendations were followed in all democracies as this has nothing to do with democracy or freedom of expression. In case a diplomat opposed his country's stances, which is his right, he should express that to his bosses.
The arrest came following weekly statements by Ikhwan General Guide Ma'moun al-Hudheibi on domestic and regional issues, which provoked the government.
He also rapped the way they were nabbed, explaining that security forces went upstairs to reach Hishmat's flat as if they were engaged in a battle. He termed the arrest as a violation of all norms and human rights, regarding it as a "message to all Egyptians to intimidate and scare them." He regarded that the authority's position has not changed in spite of daily allegations that the country lives its most democratic era.
The results of scrutiny and close review would show the positions of those political figures who should set a good example to the Egyptian society, he said, noting that these results would decide the political future of those figures in Egypt in the coming stage.
In a quiet quarter in Zamalek, Cairo, lies the episcopal church known internationally as the Anglican Church headed by Bishop Munir Hanna, who is also its head in Egypt, North Africa and the Horn of Africa, and its pastor Tony, who is not Egyptian but holds New Zealand nationality.
Munir said that the decree by the Episcopal church was expected especially after a number of American organizations adopted a liberal thought and a tendency towards liberal behavior at all costs.
Al Amawi emphasized that the Ministry of Manpower was keen on opening bureaus in areas where there is intensive Egyptian labour so that they would be parties to contracts and might interfere in the proper time to resolve any disputes between the Egyptian worker abroad and his contractor especially as the Egyptian constitution holds the government responsible for protecting citizens and their interests both inside and outside the country.
Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh Dr. Mohamed Sayed Tantawi announced that Al-Azhar always calls for prohibiting and criminalizing aggression on civilians.
LAWSUIT ASKING SHARON TO PAY LE60 BILLION FOR HIS RESPONSIBILITY FOR KILLING POWs
"STATE COMMISSIONERS AUTHORITY" CANCELS PRESIDENT'S DECREE TO REFER CIVILIANS TO COURTS MARTIAL
Saudi Arabian authorities unfolded that a group of Israeli exporting companies stuck "Made in Saudi Arabia" onto Israeli date boxes sold in European countries.
The PNA's decision to freeze the funds of Hamas and other movements was an indirect announcement of the illegitimacy of Hamas. It also considered it a terrorist organization whose funds should be frozen and activities should be besieged, European sources said.
Despite Washington's objection to the expulsion of President Yasser Arafat from his headquarters to exile Sharon seems bent on embarking on a new stage in his war against the Palestinian Authority to destroy it after he had greatly contributed to burning the stage of Mahmoud Abbas government through holding fast to it literally forcing it into the corner of the sole option of collaborating with the Israeli army in the liquidation of the resistance.
This, nevertheless, cannot drop certain anomalies especially as Abu Alaa, unlike Abbas, will not face the problem of disputing powers with Arafat. He will not probably enjoy an American explicit support that caused part of the suffering to his predecessor who was described in the Palestinian street as "America's man" and tasted the bitterness of having been identified with Karzai.
Between the Israeli army threats to forge ahead with an atrocious war on Hamas and the latter's threats to make Sharon and the Hebrew state pay dearly for that, Abu Alaa will find himself assigned for the role of keeping the score and counting casualties while Washington will be busy reharping on the tiring roadmap tune finding excuses for Sharon who has never felt ashamed of attempting to assassinate Sheikh Ahmed Yassin as he pledged to the Israelis "not to give up the hunt!"
He courageously pledged not to turn tail in Iraq and his accomplice pledged to liquidate Hamas to a man!
First: After accepting the resignation, Arafat will reassign Abu Mazen to form another government. This will make Abu Mazen put new conditions, which Arafat will surely reject, according to the official.
However, Fayadh's problem lies in his being not a member of Fatah Central Committee, the same thing that will also apply to Munib Al-Misri, the third nominee for the post. He is a Palestinian rich businessman who was nominated to head the government with Abu Mazen last March.
Abu Mazen also discovered that the majority of the Palestinian Legislative Council do not support him, contrary to what some his close aides used to say.
This number decreased to 84 due to Haydar Abdel-Shafi's resignation in protest against the council's ineffectiveness, a member's death, and the arrest of other two members namely Fatah Supreme Committee treasurer Marawan al-Barghothi in April 2002 and Hossam Khidr on last March 17th.
The fourth reason is that Abu Mazen felt angry about American and Israeli statements together with their broken promises to support him.
Undoubtedly, to overlook any of these reasons would mean an erroneous treatment of the Palestinian position as any premier succeeding Abu Mazin would need the cooperation of those three parties and any attempt to impose restrictions on him would bring about his failure!
Abu Mazen who bore all Israeli violations of the factions truce and severely suffered from provocations, assassinations and sweeps, had taken all that into account but thought that the Americans would one day support him by deterring Israeli sabotage. However, he came to the definite conclusion that nothing good can ever be expected of Washington!
However, to lead him up the garden path where none of his convictions could be available would mean political suicide for him, which he did not include in his calculations!
When the White House spokesman says that the American president is still committed to the "roadmap", he must mean that the president still supports the bloody and barbarous war of the Israeli terrorist protagonists, Sharon and Mofaz as the lack of Bush's commitment did urge Abu Mazen to resign.
It would simply be a return to the so-called pre-peace process which has been used by Israel to liquidate the Palestinian cause and to perpetuate occupation.
The Israeli Foreign Ministry issued an official travel warning to Israelis willing to visit Sinai in the Jewish New Year known as Rosh Hashanah because they would be in real danger, to quote the warning.
Sinai came third in this summer season as the most favourable tourist destination for Israelis after Europe and Israel. The United States followed the three destinations as a tourist attraction.
In 1989, he was chosen member of the Central Committee of Fatah movement.
In 1994, Abu Alaa returned to the Palestinian territories together with leaders and cadres of the PLO to form the Palestinian Authority. He was appointed Minister of Economy in the first Palestinian government.
After the first elections of the Legislative Council, Abu Alaa was elected chairman of the Legislative Council and stayed in his position till he was tasked by Arafat to form the government as a successor of Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) who tendered his resignation.
The AFP News Agency quoted Chaldean bishop Shilmon Wardoni as saying in a clergymen meeting organized by Catholic Saint Egidio Community that " peace has not been resolved yet, as extremism is on the rise and hospitals in Iraq are ransacked".
Iraq has turned into a big prison as it was the case under the tyrannical rule of Saddam Hussein," he was quoted by the AFP.
In statements to an Iranian Turkish-transmitted TV channel, Murad pointed out that PUK leader Jalal Talabani rejects any Turkish forces in Iraqi territories.
The Jordanian government stipulated that the Iraqis should have prior approval and that their names should have been registered in the border checkpoints before they arrive in Jordan. As regards the Iraqis coming from foreign countries, Jordan will grant them transit stay for 72 hours till they leave the Jordanian territories. Meanwhile those coming from Iraq will be granted a one-month stay from the Jordanian Foreigners and Borders Directorate that used to grant Iraqis a 6-month stay that was recently reduced to three months.
In a statement issued yesterday, the group emphasized that it would not acquiesce in such a hostile attitude to the Islamic nation and the Palestinian people as Hamas represented the majority of the Palestinian people. It demanded the European Union countries to cancel that position and stand against the Zionist aggression to do justice to the Palestinian people.
They called on the European countries not to be deceived by the Zionist conspiracy and to take their own interests into account and keep their international relations with over one and a half billion Arabs and Muslims.
Following the meeting, the ambassador said, "After coming back from France where I attended a conference of French ambassadors, I met with Prime Minister Hariri to brief him on my government's position on Iraq.
Asked about France's stance on the U.S. call for the Iraqi governing council to be regarded as representing the Iraqi people, the French ambassador answered, "We believe that the Americans are right regarding putting the issue under discussion in the UN Security Council.
What we are witnessing now is the starting of establishments, i.e. a nucleus for Iraqi establishments.
Mosul governor, Ibrahim Al-Basso told Asharq Al-Awsat that the agreement had become valid since yesterday (September 8th) as oil flowed from Ain Zala station near Mosul at a capacity of 15 thousand barrels a day as a first step in return for almost 100 megawatts of electricity to be distributed according to the needs of the inhabitants who suffer from a real shortage in electric power after the deposition of the Iraqi regime.
The American leadership have ascertained that the Mossad perpetrated the blast in cooperation with American and Iraqi collaborating elements through the analysis of the explosives which proved to be extremely modern and with a new chemical formula used by the Israeli Mossad.
US AMBASSADOR IN RIYADH ATTACKS IGNORANCE OF WASHINGTON'S CRITICS OF SAUDI ARABIA
We've already participated with groups that are concerned not only with terrorists and their activities but also with financing terrorism.
He added that Saudi Arabia emphasizes the importance of combating terrorism. "The Saudi Crown Prince as well as a number of eminent imams (preachers) and religious leaders have stressed the importance of not encouraging terrorism as Islam rejects it as well as killing innocent civilians," he said.
The Egyptian Parliamentary Division proposed that the Arab parliament should exercise its power under the Arab League system and act as one of its key agencies.
The sweeping majority of Arab banks belong to the sector of commercial banks which mostly focus on conventional bank activities, including the reception of deposits, bankrolling and borrowing, especially for short-term deals, said the survey, conducted by Ali Negm, former governor of the Central Bank of Egypt and chairman of the Delta International Bank. Most Arab banks failed to zero in capitalizing on the quantitative development they achieved in the 1970s in terms of regional and international geographical dissemination, or to replace it with another specific one that may help it vie with global banks.
Rules of capital and its efficiency rates, and Arab efforts to reverse the classification of Arab countries as high credit risk nations are two preconditions for laying down a material foundation for reclassifying the Arab countries to be low credit risk ones, leading to reinforced Arab bank activities and increased foreign investment inflows, which are still falling short of ambitions. Furthermore, banks should be stimulated to enter into careful partnerships with the private sector with a view to buttressing Arab economies in the coming stage.
The consular section with the Iraqi Foreign Ministry together with a team from the Interior Ministry and personnel from the Military Intelligence have been busy searching for applications and data about Arab and Muslim volunteers who entered Iraq during ousted Saddam Hussein's regime with "Mujahid" visas to fight American forces there, they added.
The sources noted that fundamentalists, some Arab nationalists and leftists and students of Islamic universities would face many obstacles before gaining entry to Iraq and would not get an easy access to it.
Real estate milieus were surprised at the withdrawal of the public sector banks which contributed to the foundation of the real estate financing company registered in the Companies Authority a few months ago. The withdrawal operation included the National Bank of Egypt, Banque Misr, Bank of Alexandria, Banque Du Caire and (private) Delta Bank. The company's capital has also been restructured and the contributions of government insurance companies have been raised from 20% to 25%. Housing and Development Bank also raised its contribution rate from 10% to 14% in its capacity as co-founders deputy.
INT'L FINANCE LOANS AFFLICT ELECTRICITY COMPANIES HEAVY LOSSES
Officials with electricity generation companies say that the companies have been in a fix following the liberation of the Egyptian pound exchange rate, as the decree resulted in an increase in the dollar rate of exchange and the devaluation of the pound at a time when the companies are committed to periodically repaying huge loans due to international finance bodies in hard currency.
Technical committees counted the assets of Eastern Company for Tobacco, Telecom Egypt, state-owned insurance and fertilizer companies.
Financiers and economists vented their spleen on the government's obtainment of part of insurance funds, cautioning that they should be kept intact as they belong to a wide sector of citizens.
It was agreed to commence the executive procedures to set up the first holding company for public banks investments with capital of 4.3 billion pounds to start activity as of next year.
The decision to establish an Egyptian company to invest and run public banks contributions in joint companies aroused diverse reactions and enquiries inside Egyptian banking milieus.
Additionally, the establishment of a holding company to run banks and second orientation of the fresh banking act no. 88 of 2003. Ownership and control will be separated, where the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) role will be confined to mere control.
For his part, chairman of Delta International Bank and previous governor of the CBE Ali Negm says that the activation of the role of the public banks investments management company into the joint ventures will need more time till business mechanisms are organized and put into order. Even though he confesses that the new company will deprive personnel representatives of participation in the joint ventures, he finds no conflict of interests between the establishment of the company and public banks boards of directors.
Sahar Al-Damati, general manager of a private bank, wonders about the business system of the companies and their styles and competences. "Does public banks investment management company affiliate to the holding company?" she said.
These remarks came in a symposium entitled 'The Pound Whereto" that was held by the Financial Administration Society two days ago.
NEW EGYPTIAN PARLIAMENTARY SESSION AGENDA TOPPED BY INVESTMENTS, PRIVATIZATION AND PRICE HIKES Economists and businessmen as well as Egyptian MPs monitored a list of the hottest economic fields expected to impose themselves on the activities of the new Egyptian parliamentary session, which will start tomorrow (Wednesday).

For his part, Mohamed Abou El-Enein emphasized that the coming stage would witness the implementation of the third generation of investment policies which would start with the state's implementation of its initiative to set up a technology base.
It, then, rose to $700 million due to the increment of $400 million as proceeds of the purchases of quotas from the companies put up for sale.
He added that we have not built any factories for capital goods for 5 years although it is known that such factories achieve a high value added despite its neither big nor quick financial returns.
The division's board chairman, Munir Ezz Eddin urged finding speedy solutions to problems and quick determination of the cases referred to the judiciary as investment cannot stand waiting for 5 or 10 years until problems are resolved before courts.

In spite of Supply and Internal Trade ministry officials' statements that all markets were under control and that the ministry would increase the number of stores where goods are displayed at guideline prices adding that tough penalties would be in wait for offenders who deliberately raise prices especially at this particular time of the year synchronizing with the start of the academic year and preparations for Ramadan, those markets witnessed unprecedented prices hikes in most consumer and durable goods, raw materials, spare parts and even paper.
Fertilizer prices have also risen to about LE750 per ton on the unofficial market despite official statements regarding a tendency to import about 500 thousand tons of fertilizers to meet the local needs and stop price hikes.
Although such a rise have become a status quo the citizen blamed them solely on the government. The officials, on the other hand, accuse the citizens of passivity towards traders who raise prices. They emphasize that it would be difficult to activate control measures or return to the compulsory price-fixing system in light of the deregulation policies they adopt. Meanwhile, they refuse to grant consumer protection societies the powers to control markets and deal with offending traders.
NEPOTISM IN EGYPT!
Having found out, however, that his father was a simple peasant, they just crossed his name.
We started with Dr. Ismail Sabri Abdullah, former minister of planning and well-known economist who drew us Egypt's economic map. He said, "Let's agree from the beginning that Egypt has no class that can be called the aristocratic class even in the theoretic sense. The Egyptian rich are neither aristocrats nor capitalists in the well-known sense of the word. They are just brokers who know how to make money without real production.
Dr. Ali Fahmi gave a sarcastic laugh when I asked him if money had already become the only viable standard for man in Egypt.
He said that Israel "abandoned" a lot of "property", or rather Sinai peninsula, in return for signing the peace treaty with Egypt.
In his article, the ambassador admitted that bilateral relations between Egypt and Israel were at its lowest level. He criticized Egyptian mass media which use anti-Semitic phrases(!) that make peace with Israel in the Egyptian public opinion abominable and rejected. The Ambassador said that the possibilities of rapprochement between the Israelis and the Egyptians were aborted by Egyptian professional syndicates which are anti-normalization with Israel.
They asked Dr. Ebeid to disclose dimensions and objectives of that protocol as well as the motives for signing it and the body that supported it.
The hearing started with calling Ariel Sharon who neither attended the session nor sent any one to defend him.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) discovered following the war remains of Egyptian POWs whom Sharon buried in Sinai sand.
The issue of the attainment of self-sufficiency of wheat is an old one and is infested with lies and misrepresentations while experts emphasize that it is far from impossible to achieve such an aim, contrary to government claims. It is rather a reflection of the failure of agricultural policies and the result of the presence of a strong lobby of importers who make profits out of imported wheat deals. It is also a reflection of the government's inability to ensure a sufficient reserve of wheat and flour that would face up to the fluctuations of international wheat prices and the dollar rates of exchange.
Nobody, however, voices surprise when Jordan's government issues a decree confiscating the funds of Hamas movement as well as six of its leaders in response to Israeli pressure. It also backtracks from its decision regarding the American arbitrariness.
Dr. Abou El Nour emphasizes that what the Jews had done was simply fraud and trust betrayal. In the final analysis we find a theft crime in the full sense of the word. Therefore, the stolen gold can be restored after regarding it as deposits at a 10% interest rate for a period of more than 3500 years.
TRAINING COURSES FOR YOUTH IN ISRAEL
LET HER DANCE!

In a reply to Al-Hayat question yesterday about the possibility of Israel bombing Bushehr nuclear reactor in the south of Iran, he said, "We are dead sure that Israel will not commit such a fatal error or venture into such a risk as the retaliatory strike it would receive from the Iranian air force and armed forces would be so devastating that it might take Israel quite a long time to recover from it."
Khatemi called on those who kick up a fuss about Iranian nuclear activity to stop doing that. He said, "Such behaviour would not dissuade Iran from the adoption of the policy of peace and development."
He said, "I advise occupation forces to quit Iraq and give power over to Iraqi people. If they accepted my advice, all the region's countries would contribute to the attainment of stability in that country.
The military review in the vicinity of Islamic Republic founder Al-Khomeini shrine showed six Shehab-3 medium-range missiles which had already been put in military service.
"We're about to prepare a stable structure to face foreign blocs and deny Israel access into Iraqi market," he added.
The FICC was founded in 1969. It includes 18 chambers of commerce all over Iraqi governorates. It always participates in the meetings of the board of the Federation of Arab Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture, which was the only Arab organization that did not let the Iraqi seat vacant in all of its Arab and international activities and meetings, he said. The FICC also coordinates with commercial organizations to serve the targets it strives to achieve, he noted.
MISSIONARY CAMPAIGNS IN NORTH IRAQ INTENSIFIED!
The correspondent said that Turkish army officers had prepared reports about the development of such Christian missionary activities that extended even to them. The reports will be sent to the Central Military Command in Ankara.
The king had a good impression of his meeting with the Iranian president, said the paper, adding that Iran's dealing with terrorism changed as far as the West and Israel are concerned.

For his part, Eduardo thanked President Mubarak for his approval to grant a plot of land on which the bank will be set up.
The report went on to say that the Egyptian contracting sector was currently undergoing difficult conditions because the nature of contracting agreements requires several years to be implemented on the ground, but when arise in building materials prices occur during the agreement period as in the case now with reinforcing iron bars as well as mechanic and electric equipment, the cost prices rise too, which requires a reconsideration of the agreement items related to the new changes to take them into account so as to avoid the project undertaking companies incurring losses for reasons beyond their control.
The report expected an improvement indices of the companies affiliated to the Holding Company for Building and Constructions in the coming period in light of the government decision to compensate contractors by about 10% for the contracts which had been conducted prior to the deregulation of the rates of exchange as well as the government intention to repay part of the dues to contracting companies which had been in arrears for several years, not to mention the continuation of the plan of reforming the financial structures and abiding by scheduling the debts due to banks as well as the forthcoming activation of the real estate act expected to bring about a breakthrough in the real estate market.

Meanwhile, the other part will be a commercial loan with a 4.5% interest rate.
Khattab said that he had received a report from the Holding Company for Cotton, Spinning and Weaving Chairman Eng. Mohsin Abdel Wahab Al-Jilani.
He also pointed out that the exports of blended textile hit 7865 tons with revenues estimated at 126.3 million pounds, up 19.7%.
The report attributed such expectations to a number of factors in the forefront of which is the activation of many measures to boost exports whether on the part of the Ministry of Foreign Trade or through cooperation with exporters or coordination with different ministries and bodies that have to do with exports, in addition to the deregulation of the rate of exchange, which raised the non-petroleum exports and encouraged some new exporters to enter the field of exportation.
By observing the performance of important sectors' exports, it turns out that the textile sector achieved an increase in its exports by 22% hitting about 800 million dollars in 2002/2003, while cotton textile exports soared up by 10% to reach 120 million dollars and ready-made clothes by 16% to hit 218 million dollars.

The six public banks witness a critical time due to the decline in its works and profits by 10% in 2003 against those of last year. This result is due to the financial burdens that were sustained by the state due to the reevaluation of its investments in foreign currencies and the continuation of procuring allocations to face irregular loans and bad debts.

AMERICA DEPLOYS FORCES ON SYRIA'S BORDERS!
In a statement by Middle East News Agency correspondent in North Iraq, he said that the American forces secretly started to train 1200 of Kurdistan Workers Party elements and fighters stationed in the area especially Qandil mountains, under the allegation that they belong to Kurdish Peshmarga forces affiliated to Jalal Talabani and Masud Barzani so as not to incite Turkey's anger.
The American attitude towards the Syrian behavior still depends on its responses. Armitage voiced his belief that the possibility of expanding the Syrian military existence in Lebanon has come to an end as the political system in Lebanon will probably act. In case the Lebanese government asked for the withdrawal of the Syrian forces the latter has to respond.
He added, "With regarded to Ahmed Al-Chalabi, the matter is related to a judicial issue. Al-Chalabi did receive a judicial verdict which we cannot ignore if we want to respect Jordanian constitution whether Ahmed Al-Chalabi was in or outside the council. He is simply wanted in Jordan and he did receive a 22-year prison sentence on a charge of embezzlement. Such a sentence is still pending and we have to enforce it. He went on to say, "We haven't changed our mind regarding Ahmed Al-Chalabi.

Executive manager of Commodity and Metal Centre, Tawfiq Abdullah said that the Stock Exchange would unprecedentedly allow traders in the Arab region to trade in crude and polished diamond, in addition to gold and other precious metals.
The diamond stock exchange in Istanbul, Turkey is the geographically the closest one to Dubai stock exchange as there are 24 similar stock exchange in the world.
The centre executive manager told Asharq Al-Awsat that the role to be played by Dubai in the diamond trade does not aim at vying with Antwerp in Belgium but rather at making use of an "enormous" market which started to take shape in the region.
He said that Egypt witnessed an extensive reform process which started in the late 1970's, pointing out that the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) had been subjected to an all-out reform process for the last 3 years.

Controversy cropped up among fundamentalist circles concerning some websites considered to be affiliated to Al-Qaeda network, which published how female followers could practise athletics including abdomen, skipping rope and running exercises. Those websites urge women to train, practise to athletics and physical exercises, keep their ideological attitudes in full secrecy even to closer kinships, especially husbands, and recruit other females. One of those websites published harsh training tables beginning with "warming up" and running for ten minutes or skipping rope for 5 minutes in case there was no suitable place for running then doing abdomen exercises on the floor raising up the two legs and hands. The website published illustrations explaining how such exercises could be practised.
This, in turn, engenders certain implications threatening the country's social peace. The Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics said that the annual family expenditure on education and private tuition amounts to LE4 or 6 billion, representing total expenditure on education including clothes, transport and private lessons.
Head of the African Society for Sexual Impotence, Dr. Khaled Lotfi told Al-Hayat that the conference researches had warned against a big rise in that serious embarrassing disease adding that it might be aggravated due to the conditions undergone by Arab men politically, economically and socially as well as the spread of smoking, pollution, diabetes, heart and blood pressure diseases unless the required measures are taken to avoid that.
NDP CONGRESS ENHANCES GAMAL MUBARAK'S RISE
His release is in harmony with the political reform line which was declared at the beginning of the Congress by Gamal Mubarak and then was adopted by his father as the Congress wound up its meetings. It was simply incongruous to talk about political reform and a larger area of freedom and democratic development while Islamists are kept detained even though their sentences have already been served.
This, however, does not mean allowing the group to have a legitimate political entity. Muslim Brotherhood who are superior both in numbers and perhaps influence rule out such a possibility even though they still hope for it.
Another point of view was put forward by former head of military intelligence and Minister of Defence, Amin Heweidi when he said that the reforms announced were mere directives rather than decisions pointing out that decisions need a mechanism for implementation, which has not been announced yet.
The "reformist" trend in the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) made progress towards controlling positions in the party and ending all forms of opposition to their new ideas, which gained President Hosni Mubarak's confidence and direct support. This was obviously seen in his speech before the final session of NDP's annual congress.
It was said that officials in the "leftist" Tagamo'h (Grouping) Party were making consultations at present to hold a joint meeting with main party leaders in the country to coordinate a unified stand concerning dialogue and demands for political reform, especially after it has become apparent that they do not want to announce what they had agreed upon in a bid to activate the recent developments with a view to achieving most of their demands in order to rectify internal political positions.
Some of those doubtful people think that the ruling NDP would not have abandoned its monopoly of power in spite of the presence of ancient parties and other ancient ones that are not legally recognized if it had not realized that the "golden" stage was over and that the impact of the economic crisis in Egypt is such that the burdens would have to be shared out by all forces including those that used to be pursued or charged with acting against the regime.
Once again, the question is raised about the need to such laws in a country not threatened by wars on the frontiers, by civil disputes or violence cycles after those were abandoned by Islamic groups or the groups which used to be branded as hardliner, thus making the authorities logic emerge ipse facto as quite victorious!
In his address before the congress, President Mubarak made it certain that the parliament would have to pass legal amendments regarding political rights and participation, a task the parliament had failed to undertake before the decision was taken from above.
It has become an uncommon rule that the American embassy in Cairo, without the government's knowledge, would meet with parties, trends and Egyptian figures while a diversity of campaigns is being launched against Egypt, sometimes in defence of human rights in Egypt, and sometimes for the Protection of Copts or to cast doubt on roles in the Middle East.
Abel-Halim Qandil of Al-Arabi wrote an article in his back page column "For the Sake of the Homeland," that ran to the following effect: Quite obviously, there is no significance of the National Democratic Party (NDP) Congress as it is not a party in the least and as the required change should start with sweeping the NDP from the bottom right to the top.
The role, thus, might be that of the armies of the streets rather than the armies of the barracks.
For his part, Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher sent a detailed memo to Premier Atef Ebeid in which he uncovered the real reasons behind excluding the Egyptian companies from the list of the contracts included in the priorities determined by Iraq Program Bureau in spite of the fact that the Egyptian companies products are included in the list.
In his memo to the Premier, Maher noted that the Egyptian Foreign Ministry handed over FAO and the World Food Program an official list of the Egyptian contracts that have to do with the specialties of those organizations that include foodstuff and irrigation equipment contracts in pursuance of implementing these contracts.
Al-Alam Al-Youm learnt that last week the Egyptian companies obtained only one contract for supplying light means of transport, while the old contracts will mostly be suspended.

The office said in a report sent to Commercial Representation Body Chairman al-Sharkawi Hefney that Egypt's quota system-based exports amounted to 94.15 million U.S. dollars against 80.87 million U.S. dollars in the same period of last year.
Such projects will be an overture to other bigger investment ones, sources said. There are many Saudi investors on their way to Cairo because the recent circumstances and incidents proved that the investment atmosphere in Arab countries is better than that in foreign ones, especially in Egypt where Arab and foreign capital is protected, profits can be freely transmitted, foreign exchange can be circulated, in addition to low production costs, they added.
For his part, Egyptian Commerical Representation Chief Al-Sharkawi Hefni said that the Egyptian delegation's file included considering the promotion of 15 groups of commodities in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf markets including foodstuffs, garments, textiles, linen, veterinary and medical products, shoes and other leather products, electric appliances, software, furniture, lamps, and car accessories. The Egyptian party will also discuss with its Saudi counterpart the means of repaying the value of Egyptian exports, which are preferred to be paid through documentary credits in the case of industrial commodities in order to avoid any commercial disputes between Egyptian exporters and Saudi importers in the future, Hefni added.
The visit to be paid by Minister of Foreign Trade Yousof Botros Ghali with a number of Egyptian businessmen to the Saudi capital, Riyadh comes in the context of Egyptian-Saudi efforts to urgently resolve such pending issues. The Egyptian official will meet with Saudi Minister of Trade, Dr. Hashim Abdullah Yamani to discuss and resume the export of those products between the two countries after about four years of suspension which led to a retreat in bilateral trade exchange.
Within the framework of the attention given by the government and the Egyptian private sector to the Sudanese market, a considerable number of Egyptian businessmen emphasized that Sudanese banks declined to grant credits to joint companies between businessmen in both countries, which would lead to obstructing the development of bilateral trade relations.
He pointed out that Shalatin border area had no integrated customs unit to enable Egyptian exporters to carry out the procedures of any export consignment to the Sudanese market.
He said that there were other obstacles.

Regarding businessmen complaint about loans high interest rates, the CBE governor said that that issue would be discussed at the next meeting with banking leaderships. Over 2 years ago, however, he added, the CBE decided to deregulate interest rates, but most banks still adopt an almost unified interest rate because it depends on depositors who wish to get high interest rates for their deposits rather than any decisions on the part of banks.

This decision was taken while Foreign Trade Minister Dr. Youssef Botros Ghali was attending. It was also taken out of the exporters' keenness on providing money necessary for meeting the basic needs of commodities, foodstuff and production requirements. However, many observers affirm that there are cases of manipulation and the agreed-upon rate is not remitted to banks.

He said the supply of part of the revenues has been on since 1994 and it used to hit 50%. However, he refuses to take exporters as a scapegoat owing to what is happening to the exchange rate and owing to successive conditions they have nothing to do with.
Exporters agreed on law no. 506 and they were told that it would be temporary, she said. They supplied large revenues of the deals' values at suitable prices, but there is a problem - inability to control the market conditions and the nature of relations with foreign companies, as there are commitments that should be met to conclude the deals, she said.
These projects, where foreign investments are 26.1 percent, provided 26,712 jobs, he said.

NATIONAL BANK OF PAKISTAN TO WITHDRAW FROM EGYPT SOON

DOLLAR THREATENS THE POOR
Statistics issued by bodies concerned point out that total production of broad beans hits 407,000 tons, meeting 83 percent of consumption. However, overpopulation in the last years led to a sharp shortage, which was consequently compensated for through importation from Turkey, Spain, France and other countries, thus raising the price of a kilogram of broad beans from 190 piasters to 230 piasters, and from 240 piasters to 3 pounds last March.
Overpopulation "The broad beans crisis is associated primarily with the overpopulation, which contributed to the disappearance of many commodities and even the importation of huge quantities although agricultural crops are the best commodities to be exported," chief of Cairo Chamber of Commerce's Grain Traders Division Al-Sayed Abdin said. He pointed out that broad beans price rises in the past were attributed to international, rather than Egyptian, economic circumstances. Prices are expected to witness stability during the coming period like what happened to the maize crop in previous periods, which met 75 percent of total consumption, he said, adding that the expansion in some strategic crops was the solution to procure foreign exchange.
OPENNESS TO ISLAMIC GROUPS DOES NOT ALLOW THEM TO EXERCISE POLITICS UNDER RELIGIOUS UMBRELLA: BAZ
Q: What is the significance of openness to Islamic groups in Egypt? And did it come in the right time?
Q: What is the point which Egyptian efforts reached to bring Palestinian factions closer have?
I cannot deny that the U.S. administration has its own assessment of Hamas and Jihad, but it could be unacceptable for us as a neighbouring country.
Al-Baz: The expulsion decision is a very serious one according to what the international community agreed on in the UN General Assembly resolution. The U.S., in spite of its position in the UN Security Council, expressed firm opposition to any bid to harm President Arafat. I believe that Israel has neither the ability nor the political chance to carry out the expulsion decision.
Al-Baz: We are not in a competition with Iraq or any other country in the region. We hope that the international community attaches attention to Iraq reconstruction for this will improve security climate and stability in the region, an atmosphere which Egypt is seeking to provide since it is necessary for development not only in Egypt but also in the entire Middle East region.
Q: Will this create a flourishing currency black market?
US ASKS FOR SPECIAL TREATMENT WITH ITS COMPANIES IN EGYPT
There is no schedule at present to start such negotiations, she said.
During a seminar on the future of Arab-Israeli conflict after the Iraqi war, held in Bibliotheca Alexandrina two days ago, Al-Baz said there was no evidence in support of Iraq's having been connected with Al-Qaeda organization as the former was ruled by Arab Baath Party which was a secularist party that had nothing to do with that organization.
Chairman of Ibn Khaldoun Centre for Developmental Studies, Saad Eddin Ibrahim emphasized that what was reported about his urging the American Administration to pressurize the Egyptian Administration to implement democracy was utterly groundless.
Ibrahim regarded the goings on in Iraq as "a natural outcome of the war that ended in the toppling of a despotic regime and the occupation of Iraq by foreign forces, thus creating a situation where resistance of occupation is coupled with a desire to reconstruct the country. This would eventually lead to a better position than that which used to exist under Saddam Hussein's tyranny, he added.
Talks with the American administration focused on the importance of bringing the "roadmap" into effect, backing the Quartet efforts and calling upon Israel to necessarily redeem its obligations, he said. Jordan still bolsters the Palestinian economy to alleviate the sufferings of the Palestinian people, release prisoners in the Israeli prisons and stop the separation wall construction as well as assassinations.
A Muslim ought to strike a balance between his needs and the requirements of his society, he said, emphasizing that the society's requirements and necessities should be given top priority.
