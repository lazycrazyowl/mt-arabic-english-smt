By Christoph Podov - International Space Station Biggest Structure Assembled in Orbit
The delay in building this module due to financial reasons has so far resulted in setting the entire program back six months.
Upon completion of the station's assembly process, six or seven astronauts who will be able to conduct medical, physical and other experiments to observe planet earth will inhabit it permanently. The station, with its solar panels, will look like a bat the size of a football field, and it will be visible to the naked eye from earth as a meteor at an altitude of 400 Km.
In the face of mounting budget difficulties, the United States sought to find partners. In 1993, the Russians joined the American project which was named the International Space Station, after the Russians failed to finance the "Mir II" project.
It is expected that the space station will be operated initially for 15 years, but the example of the Russian Mir Station, which was originally launched for five years and is still operating without interruption for 13 years, calls for optimism.

Germany Seeks to Improve Image against Spain, France to Reinforce Reputation against International Stars
The main task of the team's temporary coach, Roddy Fowler, then Christophe Daum, Bayer Leiverkausen's coach who will take over from Fowler after June 1, 2001, will be to build a harmonious team, not an easy task as the problem with German soccer is that it has not produced a world-class player in recent years.
Spain's coach, Jose Antonio Camacho, has kept eight players from the squad which played in the European finals. They are Ichibiria, Abellardo, Gerard, Guardiola, Vlasko, Raul, Mendetta and Paco and he gave players from small clubs a chance, especially goal keeper Ovidion Esteban and midfielder Malka Rofetti.

Cairo 8-15 (AFP) -
Disputes have arisen whether in the form of coolness between players because of not being allowed to play or because of delays in announcing the team's line-up for the new season, or in the form of players objecting to the salaries offered by management for contract renewal, or due to Tsobil's temper in dealing with players both during training and in matches, a matter which has been very obvious to everyone recently.
The twins' transfer to al-Zamalik was a bolt of lightning for al-Ahli's fans who could not believe their most famous and enthusiastic players, winners of several championships, would not be on the new team and would be playing with arch enemy al-Zamalik.
There were also problems with defender Mohamed Farouk who asked for 100 thousand Egyptian guineas (30 thousand dollars) for a single season and for the contract to be paid in one installment, rejecting management's system whereby half the fee is paid in advance and the remainder depending on the extent of participation in matches.
In spite of a 1500 dollar fine against Hanafi, Mohamed insisted on a public apology to restore his dignity, something Hanafi refused to do.
For the first time too, al-Ahli is witnessing rebellion in the form of one player refusing to hand over his passport to the club's management, which banned travel to Senegal to play against Senegal's Joan d'Arc team in the third round of the Africa Championship, as well as another player claiming injury in order not to travel.

The media committee began its coordination meetings at the beginning of this year and will start work in the sports' village as of today Tuesday.
The committee will hold a meeting with journalists this August 24 to put them in the picture about the services offered before and during the championship, the most important of which is following team news (training times, press conferences and interviews, peripheral events) and preparing official tables of the competing teams, as well as a daily summary of goals, goal scorers and group listings, and best player in each match.
Three local broadcasting stations, Alnur, Lebanon Alhur and Sawt Alghed, will broadcast the matches live and Radio Monte Carlo has applied for broadcasting rights to the matches in the Middle East.
Al-Thahir also said that "the opening ceremony will be displayed on the front pages of all Arab and international newspapers and this means a lot to Lebanon. In the past twenty years, the media has persistently reported that a missile fell in this or that area 20 kilometers from Beirut Airport but next October 21, these papers will be saying that the opening ceremony for the Asia 2000 Cup was held at the Sports Village Stadium which is just one kilometer away from Beirut Airport."

The theory that the Russian submarine, Kursk, sank in the Barents Sea as a result of an explosion looked more likely today Tuesday even though the authorities are still suggesting that a collision with another vessel was a possible cause of the accident.

Urgent Israeli Air Raids on Four Palestinian Targets
Tallahassee (United States) 11-15 (AFP) -
However, it did not raise the possibility of carrying out a new hand count of votes which is in the region of 620 thousand.
Finally, in the county of Palm Beach, the count showed 4695 votes, 33 new votes, for Al Gore and 14 new votes for Bush.
Israeli Air Raids on Four Palestinian Targets
The statement added that these bases were located in Tulkram and Silfit (northern West Bank) and in Hebron (southern West Bank).

Washington 11-16 (AFP) -
Jerusalem 11-15 (AFP) -
An army statement said that three of the targets fired on by combat helicopters were bases belonging to "organizations," by which the Israeli authorities mean Palestinian militia groups, including the Fatah movement led by Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.
It is clear that these four targets were struck as a result of decisions made by Israel's security cabinet yesterday evening Wednesday.
The Vice-President told journalists in Washington, "I will accept the results and will not initiate legal proceedings to oppose them nor will I back any judicial proceedings to this end."
Gore said in a statement carried by the major television networks in America that "it is up to the two of us to ask our supporters to abide by the result of these elections, whatever it may be."
Florida's Secretary of State, Republican Katherine Harris, yesterday rejected the request made by three counties to include the votes of ongoing hand counts in the results of the presidential election.
Urgent Bush Rejects Gore's Proposals
American President George Bush declared that the first stage of the air campaign has been successful.
Kuwait considered the statements read by Abu Ghaith in the name of "Al-Qaeda" as tantamount to the admission of guilt.
Despite assurances that the first phase of the American-British military operation will focus on Afghanistan, some Arab states still fear that the next phases of this operation will target such states as Iraq and Arab organizations and that this will be reflected on their internal stability.
Relief agencies affiliated with the United Nations were unanimous in warning against the repercussions of the war against Afghanistan and neighboring countries. United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson warned of an impending tragedy "similar to the one in Rwanda." The World Food Program's Director in Tajikistan, Ardagh Meghdissian, considered that "a race with time is going on to provide food to the inhabitants of remote mountainous areas, which the trucks would not be able to reach after the snow starts falling."
The last victims fell yesterday when three persons in the Sheeka neighborhood were burned ¡¦.
Dar Al-Jadeed seized the opportunity of the American-British war against Afghanistan to exhibit the book, Bin Laden, by journalist Imad Naddaf, after a long slump it has suffered since its publication three years ago.
He attributed that to the "general economic situation and the priorities of life," which made books a luxury.
Several officials at publishing houses explained that the interest of the Syrian reader stems from following up "recent developments in computers and all that is linked to informatics and communication," followed by "literary books and works on religion and heritage and finally political books."
"In the name of God the Merciful, peace and prayers be on our Prophet Mohammad, may God bless him, his family and companions."
We announce our complete support of this emirate and the Muslim Afghani people in the face of this vicious attack with all our financial and moral support under the leadership of the Prince of Believers Mulla Mohammad Omar. May God preserve him and support him with decisive victory.
Bush must learn that in his arrogance and in media promising lasting freedom, which he drawls about, not to forget the scene of Mohammad Durra and his young Muslim brothers in Palestine and Iraq.
Those that supported this crusader campaign must know the truth after it has come out, and it became clear that it was a crusade attack against Islam and Muslims.
The Al Qaeda Network also declares to the Americans and the heathens in the Arab Peninsula, specifically the Americans and British, and orders them to leave the Arab Peninsula.
As for the warning issued by Bush and the US Administration, and the decisions that were aimed at limiting the role of the satellite channels and the international news agencies carrying our voice to the world, it is only clear evidence of the US Administration's fear that the truth behind the Tuesday events will be revealed ? the truth that reveals that Bush is an Israeli agent, and is sacrificing his people and economy for the sake of those people, and is helping them in occupying the land of the Muslims and oppressing their children.
Finally, we say as a token of advice and a sign of confirmation, telling the Muslims in America and Britain and the children who reject the United States' unjust policy, that we advise them not to ride in planes and not to live by high buildings and towers.
Saturday, an official French newspaper published, within a decree, a list of 39 people and associations suspected of having relations with terrorists, with an order of an immediate freeze on their accounts in French banks or French financial institutions.

Robinson Warns of Repeating Rwanda's Tragedy and the World Food Program Launches an Urgent Appeal American Rations

In Tehran, the Iranian Islamic Republic News Agency IRNA reported that Khatami, at an international Quranic recitation competition, said that "the Afghani people are the victims of two injustices: the injustice of oppressive leaders, and the injustice of an attack of arms and missiles."
He was of the opinion that "the human race today, especially Muslims, is in need - now more than ever - for the true message of peace as it came in Islam."

The free world must not underestimate this danger."
This long awaited scrutiny into the controversial two hundred thousand votes, should have been published last Monday, but the "Times" told its readers on Sunday, through an interview by political reporter Richard Burk that "this step might cause tension and seems absolutely inappropriate now."
President George Bush slipped and said that a Crusader war must be declared on international terrorism, then backed down from what he said. After him, the Prime Minister of Italy, Berlusconi, made the same mistake. He in turn stated that the Western civilization is superior to the Islamic civilization, and then denied that he had uttered this prohibited talk.
We were contacted by some Lebanese who requested, in partnership with other foreigners, from the government the necessary licensing for the establishment of a hound race track in a suburb of Beirut, where the gambling would be similar to that in a horse race track.
He declared that the Ministry is currently working on three priorities, which are the reduction of interests on loans, providing operational capital for industrialists, revising the prices of energy and oil derivatives, and providing industrial land at nominal cost.
In his speech, Sarraf confirmed that the road taken by industrialists with regard to developing exports is sound, and revealed that Minister Afram charged a company with studying methods of enhancing exports to Africa and other areas of the world.
He declared that the Industrialists Association plan in the next phase is summarized in trying to increase cooperation with the government and the Minister of Industry, to enhance the competition abilities of the industrial sector and to develop exports, clarifying that the Association will continue to seek opening new markets for Lebanese products.
2. Reconsider the prices of energy and oil derivatives with a view of the rates implemented in the Arab countries linked with Lebanon through free exchange agreements.
Afram reiterated "The head of state is with national industries, and we must keep up with the government and support it in its work to achieve what it promised in its government statement concerning our sector."
General Manager of the Lebanon Electric Company George Mu'awwad told "An-Nahar" yesterday that the current program has become the normal status of the current, "unless there are breakdowns, similar to what happened at the Al Jamhour Station last Friday night, when the 'neutral line' (lightening line) was disconnected due to the factor of time."
It also known that the network of lines between Tyre - Al Zahrani - Armoun - Bsaleem - Deir Ammar, which was franchised in April 1999 (during the takeover of Minister Suleiman Trabulsi at the Ministry of Energy), is expected to be completed, according to the contracts, in two stages: the first in the middle of this June, and the second at the end of the year 2002. However, work is facing problems in appropriations in those areas.
It called on the media to collect the correct information from the concerned sources at the company "to avoid confusing or misleading public opinion."
Government movement since that date has focused on the economic aspect of the subject in two areas. The first is marketing Lebanon as a center for attracting capital and deposits seeking a safe investment, and as an alternative attraction center on the tourism, educational and medical levels for European countries, which have been in the past years preferred by the Arab countries. The second is the government's attempt to overlook the financial and economic crisis, which was the pressuring element before September 11th, and seeking to divert attention from the existing negative aspects to the new positive aspects.
But there are positive indications that cannot be overlooked, which were recorded in the past two weeks, and reflected the market's responsiveness to the new government promotion. They can be summarized into four:
- Second: Conversions from the US dollar to the Lira, which could be noticed as a result of the return of some centers to the national currency for fear of repercussions of the American events on the green currency.
The rate of increase was recorded as continuing in the last two weeks, with the increase not only a result of the flow of capital from abroad but also as a result of the Bank of Lebanon implementing its instructions compelling banks to keep a foreign reserve.
And in this regard, the round of talks held by the IMF delegation that visited Lebanon last week and met with a number of officials and bankers in preparation for issuing the final IMF report, which will be presented to its administration in Washington the day after tomorrow, Wednesday, must be noted.
1. Continued weakness of the economy, and the need for enhancing it.
The international community has moved forcefully to do that by directly confronting terrorism and increasing security reserves.
The biggest long-term challenge facing the international community in building a better world is fighting poverty and encouraging the spirit of sharing.
Minister of Industry George Afram warned that the national economy would remain unable to provide opportunities to halt immigration, if the development of productive sectors does not become a government priority.

The employees at "Ojero" Company staged a warning sit-in the day before yesterday (Saturday) in all offices, departments and branches in the Lebanese areas, in protest over approving article 50 of the Media and Communications Committee.
During the sit-in, Richard Saliba, a member of the Association's council, spoke. He listed the demands, namely the continuation of work, the maintenance of earned rights, creating incentives and including services, and explained that the sit-in aims at maintaining income and declared openness to dialogue.
They also hoped that the maritime agencies would contact the suppliers and owners of ships to reduce the reflection of insurance installments and their additional fees on the prices of transportation to the lowest possible rate, and hoped that airline companies would stay in constant contact with insurance and re-insurance companies with the aim of seeking to decrease the installments of insurance against the various dangers of war, to reduce the load on the Lebanese consumer.
The Ministry of Tourism called on cabarets, nightclubs, and dance halls to install sound insulation to avoid disturbance, after an increase in complaints by citizens over the noise of equipment and musical instruments during late hours at night.
Al Hariri repeated that achieving that is a basic prerequisite for confronting the violence phenomenon that is surfacing in more than one place, and that international resolutions must be implemented, especially resolutions 242, 338 and 425.
Peres is a supporter of the creation of a Palestinian state, and he had previously stated on more than one occasion that he supports the creation of an independent state one hundred percent, or else why did Israel withdraw from a number of villages and hand them over to the Palestinian Authority? He defined the mission of this independent state as deciding everything with regard to its housing policy and others, but it is a country without arms.
Technological development contributed to that, and politics no longer dominates decisions, economy does.
And there is a new generation in the Arab World and in Israel that will be able to spread the spirit of peace if it is allowed to express itself.
After Bush repeated his support of the creation of a Palestinian State and the implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 to reach a just, comprehensive and final solution for the Palestinian issue, will Bush present an initiative in this regard as Al Hariri expected?
Palestinians want to go back to the 1967 borders and the Israelis oppose that because their interpretation of resolution 242 is not the same, despite the fact that Lord Caradon, the creator of this resolution, confirmed in an official memorandum that the resolution called for "the withdrawal from the occupied territories." The essence of the issue is identifying the occupied territories, but that was not open for discussion.
The spokesman for the Norwegian Foreign Ministry told the Saudi "Al Majallah" magazine of the success of the meeting between President Yaser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, and described it as extremely important for rebuilding trust between the two sides and stabilizing the ceasefire, and that an open hotline continues between them and US Secretary of State Colin Powell, in order to overcome obstacles that can prevent implementation of the agreement and beginning implementation of the Mitchell Committee recommendations.
The Crisis of Systems and Streets Nabil bou Munsif
If the reactions are measured in demonstrations, then the silence in most of the Arab streets reflects, more than anything else, the serious trouble in which the regimes are living.
But, on the other hand, the problem with this repression is that in the case that these regimes succeed in surviving the war on terrorism peacefully with a maximum of repression of feelings, even if these feelings were misled by instinctive religious motives, the regimes will acquire a dangerous precedent for generalizing repression to include all other internal areas. This is the most serious threat to the future of democracy in the East, if this democracy was ever meant to see light as a final fundamental solution for the countries of the backward and poor world.
And if there is a place that truly reveals this reality, it is in the streets of European countries, not in Islamic-Asian streets, where instincts turn on their anger.
Washington hastened at the end of last week to control the rush of reports that rumored a climate about "a new peace initiative" by the United States to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict. This is expected to be announced by its Secretary of State Colin Powell during the General Assembly meetings of the United Nations due to start this month, and that he would do that after postponing them to the next month.
Also, the Arab and Egyptian hints did not specifically fail, as did the Palestinian ones, in enhancing these climates and spreading them in the Arab countries. They also included Lebanon as well after the last visit by Prime Minister Rafiq Al Hariri to Egypt and other countries.
It might be in the interest of these countries to "feed" Americans positions expressed lately, and to give the US President a chance to put this new conviction of his Administration into implementation.
There is a latent unlikelihood for what is farther than the positions declared so far. Dr. John Alterman, a researcher at the "Research and Studies Program at the American Institute for Peace" and specialist in the affairs of the Middle East, told "An-Nahar" over the phone that there were several points concerning the last position of President George Bush on the Arab- Israeli conflict:
Alterman says that he met a while ago with a journalist working in the Israeli "Jerusalem Post" newspaper who told him that he reported information about the new American decision regarding bringing an end to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict before the 9th of September, and it is possible to go before that date to check this information.
It remains that the first step - according to what Alterman believes - is in both sides reducing violence and then providing a legitimacy for the negotiations which can be resumed from this point."
The serious American return to this issue remains, in turn, subject to the results of the ongoing military operation against Afghanistan, as everything depends on these results.
Perhaps among the ruins of the "World Trade Center," an unexpected victim of the September 11th attacks and the war on terrorism that was launched in response to it.
The "Taliban" movement does not know the picture civilization, so how can it realize that the West, which produced this culture, is in the process of restructuring its relationship with the pictures.
Everything that we imagined was part of excitement was gone, but the excitement remained.
It is a factor from which we have suffered in this part of the world, even if its usual expressions to us are primitive: national directive.
In war, commenting is on various civilization activities.
The belief in the necessity of the picture seems wrong in another phenomenon we have seen every day for a month.
Post - September 11th made most international televisions Lebanese televisions, yet with greater capabilities, more reporters, and deeper specialists.
No, it is the lack of pictures.
You find others like it, or slightly better, or worse, on all Arab satellite channels, all according to their resources.
The news is not from outside Afghanistan, as the viewer/listener finds it at MBC, Abu Dhabi Channel, and could also find it on Lebanese screens if those in charge of them did not mix media manufacturing with the calculations of a small merchant.
But the presence in Kabul is an economic and political success, not a media success.
The history of this star is immense, as she was a cabaret dancer for fifteen years and a singer and solo dancer for eleven years.
Marissa's father ,an engineer, and her mother ,a nurse, did not encourage her to practice this profession "but if that is her choice then let her proceed to a better place."
The show that she presented was entitled "The Spectacular". It lasted twelve years and she performed it six thousand times, at the rate of two times every night and six days a week. She was very affected when this show was stopped.
The cabaret girls dance with a wide smile drawn on their faces, making us feel we are at the beginning of the twentieth century with La Goulue, La Mome Fromage, Grille d'Egout and Mistinguett.
At the end of every show, the curtain comes down and Marissa goes back to her trailer to rest for twenty minutes.
"Prepare for the next show", a call comes from behind the scenes.
The film "Thirteen Days" tells the events of the war that almost erupted in 1962 between the United States and the Soviet Union, and pictures the White House's movements in the midst of crisis.
In the past, Jean Renoir's "French Cancan" (1955), and today "Moulin Rouge" by Baz Luhrmann, bring back to our memory the influence that profligacy had during that age in cabarets in the Parisian Place Blanche, which was frequented by people from various classes and nationalities.
The history of this star is full, as she was a cabaret dancer for fifteen years, and a singer and solo dancer for eleven years.
In which belles used to work in their lace dresses, dancing to the demonic rhythms of Jacques Offenbach's music, so that their legs rise towards the chandeliers hanging from the ceiling.
This place was frequented by young girls, especially at the end of the month, to test their luck in the air filled with smoke and lights, or to meet a rich man or member of the Jockey club or any other club, who was generous to them.
She kept on wearing a necklace which carried a cross around her neck.
But the police prevented the continuation of these behaviors.
The film "Thirteen Days" narrates the events of the war that almost erupted in 1962 between the United States and the Soviet Union, and pictures the White House movements in the midst of crisis.
"Thirteen Days" is a strong dramatic-documentary film characterized by good direction, and presents the point of view of Kani O'Donnel, a close companion of John Fitzgerald Kennedy "J.F.K", based on the archives of the White House.
Oliver Stone tried in the movie "J.F.K" to show John Kennedy as a balanced man, political and exciting.
The movie "Doctor Stragelnoff" is a caricature of the president, so was the new movie "Los Angeles 2013", with a president afflicted with mental weakness, anxiety and Christian fanaticism.
And the strange thing is the continued presence of men of religion in the White House and their inseparability from American presidents in most of the cinematic films.
Martin Sheen plays the role of the American president who does not care about all these things.
"God created man with eyes that look to the front, so that man can only see himself in a mirror (...) the mirror is the other person that sees you and that you see."
American President George Bush rejected a "Taliban" proposal to hand over fundamentalist "Al Qaeda" leader Osama bin Laden to a third country if the movement receives evidence implicating him in the attacks on New York and Washington on September 11th.
"People in America are afraid of the unknown", that is what US Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson declared, after the weekend witnessed a rise in the number of those afflicted or carrying the anthrax virus from 4 to 12 people, and the circle of danger expanded from Florida to New York and Nevada. More than one American official pointed a finger at the "Al Qaeda" Network, and its leader Osama bin Laden, without directing an outright accusation of launching a terrorist attack with biological weapons.
He added: "They are being treated and that does not mean, and I am careful to confirm, that they have the anthrax disease."
American President George Bush rejected a "Taliban" proposal to hand over fundamentalist "Al Qaeda" leader Osama bin Laden to a third country if the movement receives evidence implicating him in the attacks on New York and Washington on September 11th.
Last night, US fighters launched a new raid on Kabul after bombing it during the day, and it targeted "Taliban" positions on the front line with the opposing Northern Alliance troops.
It said that the raids targeted Kandahar airport, the New Al Qishleh Barracks, an army base east of the city, and other areas.
Officials in the "Taliban" confirmed that the front line north of Kabul did not change, and no conflicts between the "Taliban" and the Northern Alliance were recorded during the night.
The UAE News Agency "WAM" reported "media sources" in Islamabad as saying that Mutawakkil might be representing separatists in the the "Taliban" ranks after a conflict with Mulla Omar.
He added, "There is no need to discuss innocence or guilt."
He pointed out that the president participated in national security meetings in which an early plan for a regime that will succeed "Taliban" was discussed, and explored issues like security, forming a transitional government, and economically rebuilding the country.
The "New York Times" reported that Bush discussed lately in at least two meetings of the national security council a way for the United States and the allies, in their "war on terrorism", to help Afghanistan form a new government.
With the continuation of military strikes against Afghanistan, the internal pressure on Pakistani President Parvez Musharaf mounts. The protests of fundamentalist Islamists moved from the demonstrations and speech mobilization stage to the stage of security challenges, whether by attacking military basis, massing fighters ready to go to Afghanistan, or threatening to kill any American soldier that comes to the country.
The second base is located in the city of Basni in Baluchistan province, parallel to the border with Afghanistan, inhabited by a majority of Pashtu tribes to which more than half the people of Afghanistan and the followers of the "Taliban" movement belong.
But army troops and police had anticipated the matter, blockaded all city entrances, and deployed tanks in the main cities. The army also imposed a strict siege on the base, and nearby citizens were asked to leave the area.
At least one person was killed and 24 were injured, among them 2 policemen and 3 citizens in critical condition.
Pakistani newspapers say that the Northern Alliance supporters in that province, opposed to the "Taliban", as well as supporters of the return of the former Afghanistan King Zaher Shah, who is currently residing in Rome, are being subjected to threats from the supporters of the movement.
But the difficulty of Musharaf's situation, who has provided complete support to America and was the only president of a Muslim country to declare his conviction of the evidence produced by Washington on Osama bin Laden's involvement in the September 11th attacks, will increase as the American campaign on Afghanistan goes on, and as the number of civilians killed as a result of the Anglo-American strikes increases.
He stressed that "we do not have anything against the Northern Alliance (...) the issue is that there is balance, meaning that the ethnic groups must be represented in the future government."
So will the US Secretary of State offer what Musharaf hopes for to stand firm in the face of internal storms?
Ambassador Abbas was a man of honor, loyalty, and love, with no competitors. He was a man of nobility, high morals, and good origins.
I visited him in his home in Verdan every once in a while, and he welcomed me profusely and promised to give me documents and transcripts on his grandfathers, so that I may have an aide in my research on his family history, which produced scientists, literary figures and intellectuals.
Falah Maroun: A Lebanese State in the Sky of the West by Nawal Al-Barazi
From Patriarch Altienne to Patriarch Sfeir By Elie Aswad
Because of Prince Basheer Al-Shihabi's apprehensiveness of the growing influence of Jiryes Baz and his brother Abdel Ahad, he, in agreement with his brother Prince Hassan and the two Sheikhs Nasser Eddine Imad and Ali Talhouq, arranged for a conspiracy to finish off the two brothers in one day, which was Friday, the fifteenth of May, 1807. The first was to be killed at Deir Al-Qamar through an arrangement by Prince Basheer and the other at Jbeil through an arrangement by Prince Hassan.
At the palace, the Prince ordered four of his men, belonging to the house of Zein Eddne, to enter the hall and stifle Jiryes Baz.
But he ordered stripping Baz of his clothes and throw him at the garden of the Lady of the Mount Abbey.
Abdul Ahad realized the goal of the attack. A battle ensured during which Sheikh Ali Talhouq and Sheikh Nasser Imad Eddine were injured and Abdul Ahad Baz was hit with a bullet in his flank and the attackers finished him off and looted the assets of the palace.
Yesterday, history repeated itself and the massacres were repeated between the sons of the same team from Ihden, to Safra, to the uprising that preceded and followed the tripartite accord, to another oath swearing at Bkirki, until to "war of cancellation".
The first was represented by what was called the Yazreh Army, and the second consisted of militias that were considered to be a popular reservoir that acted as a reserve for it.
This is a matter that has repeatedly obligated us to focus the light on the current Christian situation in accordance with the following criteria:
Minister Suleiman Frenjiet enjoys a leading moral role in this case, which could open the door in front of many conciliations.
The partisan experience has been harsh on the Lebanese public opinion, particularly the Christian and serious statistics do not give more than the ratio of ten percentage to those who wish to join political parties.
Atallah's book on "French-Lebanese friendship" is his second investigation-reportage book after "Poisonous Garbage in the Land of the Cedars."
Randy Nahleh is the only Lebanese mentioned in the 2002 edition of the "Guinness" encyclopedia. He may be the only Lebanese to be mentioned in the encyclopedia as "Lebanese", not "of Lebanese origin".
Tripoli ? "An-Nahar": The Picture and the Techniques of Expression in the Primary School Cycle" is the title of the training course launched by the new Director of the French Cultural Center in the North, Phillip Ardouan, at the beginning of educational activities for private school teachers in the North for the scholastic year 2001-2001.
Safadi stressed the need of the region for enhancing these activities in order to guarantee openness to the World.
Is it the same?
The "Racism Between Durban and Beirut" Seminar Gregoire Haddad: Familism, Sectarianism and Regionalism Are All Racist That Find Their Solution in Comprehensive Secularism
She considered that "intensifying information, providing testimonials, and attending to the provision of education and culture, based on the principles of human rights, are the protective shield against savagery and abominableness."
Al-Hajj lectured on the "psychological and social roots of the emergence of racism" and said" "Racism started at a narrow scale in the shape of individual practices perpetrated by persons, who are wrong in their negative behaviors with their brethren in humanity.
He added, "Racism has gone beyond the philosophy of color and race. It is an intellectual philosophy that has its bases, elements and methods and is spread in the world. Discrimination has become a philosophy of the contempt of the human being."
In Lebanon, sectarian racism appears in particular.
Alongside the seminar, an exhibition was held entitled "Pictures and Racism", which included a set of pictures published in France in 1880 to promote France's plan to colonize Africa.

Spoke About the Annual Dinner of the Press Club Areedhi: We Are Against Terrorism In All Its Forms And The Situation Started To Take Dangerous Directions
We are not to evaluate the causes now, or to talk about the stations of this war, but to talk about what concerns us as Lebanese, on the one hand, and as Arabs living in a region that has suffered much from terrorism, particularly, especially and specifically Israeli terrorism.
Nor should we forget, whenever we point to this matter, that Lebanon has lost Lebanese and skilled and prominent citizens in that aggression. We also have been hit in the aggression against the United States of America by losing a number of our prominent young men."
What concerns us is our security and our stability in the shadow of this confusion, this ambiguity and this war under an ambiguous heading, as nobody has resorted to hearing the position of the Arab and Muslims, as well as a large number of States, calling for determining the concept of terrorism in order to find out what this war is all about, against whom, from where, and where to?
The attitude is therefore obvious and the intentions are obvious.
Tribute in Sidon for Prince Khaled Al-Faisal
Deputy Al-Hariri began the celebration with a word, in which she said, "what we are exposed to is nothing but misuse of our capabilities and our salvation comes through the interweaving

* Deputy Ali Bizzi announced that "We are keen on fighting terrorism, provided we define it and fighting it is carried out under the umbrella of the United Nations, despite our remarks against it."
At the invitation of member of the Party's Political Bureau, Ibraheem Reesha, an expanded Falange meeting was held at his home in Jarran, during which Baqardouni spoke. He said: "The recent elections were political in the first place and the Falangists chose between two lines: the line of modernization and unification and the line of tradition and secession. The advocates of modernization and unification won and the traditionalists and secessionists withdrew. The Falangist elections heralded the birth of a new Falange Party with a new methodology and a new project."
He concluded: "The new Falangist Leadership is determined to implement the modernization and unification project at the Party and the Homeland. It promises the Lebanese and the Falangists that it will do so and will not pass on the Falange Party as we received it and tomorrow you will witness a new Falange Party."
He renewed Lebanon's condemnation of terrorism, but he had reservations about the policy of the United States of America in the Middle East. He observed that the terrorism of individuals and organizations comes "from the womb of the terrorism of the State" and called on the American Administration to address the causes that led to the September 11th attacks.
He was afraid that "there are in this matter bribes from both sides," noting that one of the images of terrorism is also embodied in washing one's hands of implementing international resolutions.
For Islam does not need to defend its existence.
He considered that "it is not in the interest of the United States of America for the battle to be a battle of civilizations.
The United Nations at this stage is a witness, whom we need."
Sa'ad disapproved in a separate statement of the decision by Interior and Municipalities Minister Elias Al-Murr to ban motorcycles in Sidon and its surroundings.
Legal Opinion Office Commemorated Anniversary of Isra' and Mi'raj Qabbani: We Will Not Tolerate Slaughtering Muslims Qablan: We Refuse Accepting American Fate Gheith Qablan Qabbani "The Islamic Group"
Our enemy practices the ugliest forms of terrorism and he still practices them on our people in occupied Palestine, and before that in Lebanon.
And that it is what caused the death of many Americans? (...).
The destruction of cities, villages and structures in Afghanistan with modern American tools of destruction is absolute exactly the same as terrorism (...)
What justice is this?
As for us in Lebanon, the Lebanese, both Muslim and Christian, as declared by their political and religious leaders, have unified in rejecting terrorism and protecting the resistance in order to liberate the homeland from the occupying Zionist enemy.
Al Khatib said in his speech:
We Muslims are ready to demand an international humanitarian charter that suppresses terrorism in all its types.
Farewell Party Held at Qalawiyyeh Tower Finnish Battalion Leaves Today Leaving Behind Memorial Monument for its Victims
The memorial monument also bore the names of the commanders, who led it, one after the other since 1982. They were 18 colonels, the first of whom was Colonel Matta Skina, who served from November 4, 1982 until to the first of April 1984.
Colonel Hiki Holma delivered a speech in which he welcomed everyone and said: "The Finnish Battalion worked in the south for 19 years as part of the international force.
And before our departure, we called you as friends to leave a memento of us to remind you of our presence in your region.
And this monument will remain a witness in the future for the youth as an affectionate and friendly proof of our cooperation, which has lasted a long time and will go on."
And the images are still in my mind of the school children going to school under certain danger.
Let us ask ourselves how have we been able, as two nationalities and two religions, to be friends and one family.
We hope from our hearts for the Lebanese people to live in peace to make this beautiful country an advanced and wealthy country as it was before, and better (...)."
Everyone was invited to a lunch banquet that was decorated with Finnish food.
He saw in a statement by the "Central News Agency" that the uncovering of old files by the United State is "for placing pressure on officials in Lebanon and get to what it wants.
And America does not understand this situation, nor does it understand it, but tries to surmount it."
And on whether he saw a settling of accounts in reopening the file in light of the conclusion of the elections at the Falange Party, he replied: "If this is the tendency, then it is wrong. I am always against the spiteful policy against anyone and from any party.

"Secular Meeting" Gave Legal Opinion to Supporting Afghanistan, Prohibited "Opening Lands of Muslims to America"
The meeting was held at the Islamic Da'wa College in Beir Hassan at the invitation of the "Coalition of Muslim Scholars".
We refuse to let America define what is meant by terrorism, and that this matter should be a sword it wields on the necks of peoples when it wants. The concept of terrorism must be identified through an international accord, far from American hegemony, and at that time, they will find that America is the most prominent source of terrorism.
As Muslim Sunni and Shiite scholars, we consider that America wants the head of Islam, not that of the Sunnis and Shiites. We will not fall for any attempt to win one category over under the pretext that the other category is the target. Therefore, all Muslims must rise to defend themselves.
At seven in the evening, Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri received the Chairman of the Progressive Socialist Party, Deputy Walid Junblat, at his mansion in Qreitem, and discussed with him the local situation and international developments.

On the American pressure on Israel, political commentator Rovik Rozenthal wrote in "Maariv" yesterday: "All evidence points to increasing pressure by the Bush Administration to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by creating a Palestinian State within boundaries and conditions that guarantee security for Israel."
Sharon can apologize for the "Chamberlain Speech" over and over, but the meaning is clear. Bush does not believe that the Palestinian State represents a threat to Israel, like Nazi Germany was a threat to Czechoslovakia.
The Parson of the Sidon Maronite Parish, Archbishop Tanyos El Khouri, officiated at a celebratory mass at the Mar Elias Church in the town of Ba'zaran - El Chouf, on the occasion of laying down the corner stone for the church hall.

He reminded of "attempts by the Jews since the beginning of the twentieth century to portray our nation as an uncivilized nation" and was of the opinion that "fundamentalist Muslims helped give credibility to this Jewish deception, because they still believe in the twenty first century that Islam is a religion and a state."
President of the Union, Ibrahim Nafe', gave a speech in which he spoke about the work of the Union.
Earth Day in the Palestine, the anniversary of the 30th of March 1976. On that day, six Arab Israelis were killed.

And the Arabs are not terrorists and the Palestine must become a Homeland, a state and a capital, which is Jerusalem".
The Secretary General of the Federation read a report on the activities of the Federation in the past year.
Opening Third Seminar on Modern Administration Al Sa'ad: Reducing Legislative Restrictions
Our administration has suffered from indigestion in legislation and regulations. While many states have tended to reform legislation through amendments and repeals, in order to reduce restrictions and facilitate the work of the public employee and the life of the citizen, this aspect of the Lebanese public administration has remained over the decades a driving force for, and an objective for many attempts. It is high time to deal seriously and objectively with the issue and exert pressure on the political administration to expedite passage through legislative channels.
Then followed speeches by Dr. Gerard Timiset, Dr. Louis Habeiqeh, Dr. Anthony Macriomitris, Britney O'Hannan, and Maron Kisrouani.
They noted that he has been doing this for months, not just by directing appeals through the media, but also with personal contacts in Israel in cooperation with Kofi Annan's personal representative to the peace process, Terry Rod Larson, which included Israeli Defense Minister Benjamin Bin Eliazer and other officials, in order to stop Israeli violation of the "Blue Line". Despite reaching an agreement in this regard, the Jewish State has not complied with it.
They drew the attention of the governments of their countries that that is unacceptable; that Israel must be asked to stop them because they may lead to unjustified tension in this emergency international circumstance after September 11th, and that there is no need for a regional explosion, especially at this time, to divert attention from the process of fighting terrorism undertaken by the United States, with Britain's help.
The sources gave evidence of the Jewish State's desire for this role, which was that in any step declared by Washington after September 11th, Israel hurriedly announced its opinion and readiness to be among the countries that wish to fight terrorism.
The Antonian Order of Monks Commemorated the Anniversary of Shurfan and Abi Khalil Atallah: We Pray to Jolt Consciences and Demand What is Right
In the name of inclusive brotherhood and love that knows no bounds, in the name of justice and peace, we come to raise our prayers to the God of peace, love and justice, so that our prayers may jolt the consciences of those who have power, by right or without right, over the fate of people and individuals, so that they may go back on their injustice and arrogance, and work for good, peace, right, and blessings.
We are dealing with governments and official institutions that say they believe in right and promise justice.
Justice is a virtue and equity is practicing it."
Deir Doreit (Al Shouf) - "Al Nahar":
Father Nimer stated following the meeting:
This is encouraging that the mountain will not be divided from the inside, even if we were divided for a while from the outside.
Minister of State Pierre Helou noted that "the State is inoperative and waiting for implementing the appointments." He attributed the cause to the "Troika case, about which we have been complaining for quite some time."
When asked on whether he had any information on the possibility of a government change, he said: "I don't have an answer, because I am not informed about that. The last of my concerns is where I will be discharged from this cabinet. Today, I am a deputy and I could be more free if I go back to being a deputy."
That is why I would not be surprised if they send me home in the first cabinet reshuffle, or even to the parliament."
Concluding consensual agreements includes agreements with the government of the United States of America and other friendly governments and foreign companies recommended by their governments to purchase, after approval from the Council of Ministers, materiel, equipment and spare parts, and to provide training on them, which are not available in Lebanon.
At the invitation of the Upper Matn Organization in the Community Party, a dialogue meeting was held last Saturday with Secretary General of the Party, Farouq Dahrouj, at the hall of the "Social Center for the Masri Family" in the town of Saleema. In addition to party leaders and members in the Matn and Mountain regions, the meeting was attended by the representative of the Progressive Socialist Party, Farouq Al A'war, groups and delegations.
He noted that "America is using the tragedy that befell it on September 11th for other calculations and purposes. Up till now, it has not revealed its entire strategic or tactical objectives."
He also touched on the "positions of the Americans after what happened in New York and Washington, namely, President George Bush's support of implementing resolutions 242 and 338, and creating a Palestinian state." He saw that "these positions are tactical and must not fool us, because the Americans want to stop the Intifada and guarantee the support of the Arab states in their unjust war, and they also want to quiet the Arab and Palestinian streets.
Minister of Public Works and Transport Najeeb Miqati and Minister of Justice Samir Al- Jisr inspected projects being implemented by the Ministry of Public Works in Akkar, at a total cost of approximately five billion pounds.
They met with the people of the region of Akroum.
The delegation also stopped at the home of Deputy Wajih Al Ba'rini at Wadi Reehan, and then toured the Jurd-Qatee' regions, where they were received by a representative of the Deputy Prime Minister, Issam Faris.
He pointed out two important projects by the Ministry of Works in cooperation with the World Bank, which are Abda-Areeda road and Abda-Fneidiq.
Jisr said: "With regard to the Ministry of Justice, we are working on meeting the shortage in the number of judges and this is the first time the Judges Institute took a number that reached 29, while in the past it did not exceed twenty."
Until now there is no official request, and we will deal with any request if it is within the concepts of sovereignty and international agreements."
Miqati said, "The inauguration is temporary in response to the demands of the people, and in order to find a solution to the daily traffic problems in the area." He pointed out that "work will go on extensively until the work on the said bridge is completed as soon as possible."
In the currently disturbed regional and international climates, there are attempts to transform the conflict that resulted from the attacks on the eleventh of last September on the United States to a sectarian conflict between Islam and Christianity.
We are pleased to see that the majority of the Arab Islamic states are understanding of this reality and make a distinction between Islam and the crimes banned and condemned by the Holy Quran.
For the continued watching of those killed is an abominable crime that must be stopped for good.
Might we bring to mind the Arab Prophet's words to Imam Ali, may God make his memory pleasant, in the area of singing the praises of his attributes and characteristics: "You have a similarity with Jesus, son of Mary?"
Preparations for the conference to be held by Mr. Fouad Malek to demand restoring the license of the "Lebanese Forces" Party are not separate from the general course started months ago and crystallized with the elections of the Falange Party.
For until now, the blend with which he plans to launch the new party has not matured, in view of the attracting forces that control the group he meets with, with the goal of obtaining the license.
Although Malek and Administrative Board member Richard Jreisati are careful to say that the request will witness the inclusion of those in the general amnesty so that they can go back and participate in the new party.
In view of these reflections, former deputy Elias Hubaiqa continues his movement within the Forces arena, and has been active for a while in the circles of bases and elements that were active during the war and have been faithful to the "Forces" since the era of Bashir Jmayyel, especially in sensitive and known areas of the southern Mount Lebanon, in addition to groups that practiced their role alongside Jmayyel and during the era of Hubaiqa's assumption of his responsibility in the "Forces."
And this freedom in movement might have its causes and results.

These sources confirmed that "contacts and new attempts are underway to correct matters anew, especially that the President of the Republic has emphasized the necessity of adopting the criteria in relation to the deans, because he also emphasizes the necessity of starting the academic year in a natural and good way and that at the head of the faculties there should be deans who meet the academic and moral conditions, which places these faculties, and consequently the Lebanese University on the right track."
It identified its source at a distance of 79 kilometers from the Bahnas Observatory and its coordinates as 35.37 east and 33.23 north, considering that "there is no reason to expect the occurrence of damages or concern."

"Consequently, if justice is what is needed for business stability and growth, it is also necessary in investment fields, specifically foreign ones that ask first about justice and its execution, in addition to non-discrimination between citizens and foreigners."
With regard to arbitration, he said that it requires techniques "whose overlooking leads to subjecting arbitration resolutions to nullification, and as a result arbitration loses its hoped for goals."

Germany, Lebanon and "Hizbollah"
Here, Schroeder says, "Germany has different points of view".
The other prominent indicator is Germany's advanced position regarding Lebanon's preoccupations and economic concerns, meaning the partnership with the European Union and, more than that, the financial Paris-2 conference, at this exceptionally sensitive international phase.
As for in this specific field, the division is a form of unjustified imagination.
Lebanese dialogue with European countries is a need outside the wooden game that it can resemble at some stations.
The question before us to day is: How do we adapt the circumstances of the stage to serve the unity of Lebanon and the safety of its land and people and its equally important values which are democracy, protecting public and private freedoms, and launching the creative civil society forces to balance the permanent readiness to security slips at every basic juncture.
Political circles wonder whether the reassuring comments by Prime Minister Rafic Al-Hariri concerning Lebanon's relationship with the United States and his saying that they are relations of friendship, dialogue and cooperation, and that there is talk of helping Lebanon economically, are statements based on information or whether they are merely wishes and analysis that must be stated from his position as an official?
The reality is that President Hariri is depending on the interference of President Chirac with American President George Bush in order to protect Lebanon from financial punishments if he does not respond to what the United States is demanding of him regarding "Hizbollah", and on whether the French President obtained from his American counterpart what is reassuring and makes him understand Lebanon's situation and its position towards "Hizbollah" which is a political position related to internal harmony and the security situation, aside from the legal position that makes "Hizbollah's" behavior not applicable to describing it as terrorist.
Therefore, Lebanon must not provide an excuse to America or to Israel to take measures that harm it. As a result, it must concentrate, for the time being, on arranging the internal house and organizing its affairs, and to treat the problems it is facing with reason, wisdom and knowledge. As former minister Michel Eddeh said in an interview, Lebanon cannot benefit from the new conditions in the international arena if its citizens continue fruitless conflicts against each other and between the leadership and inside the authority.
For the Lebanese have a resistance that is not available to other peoples.
Qandahar falls exactly like Kabul and before Mazar al Sharif fell, but victory in its true, deep and beneficial meaning needs more than this fire show amid all this painful emptiness and all this dust and all this poverty and misfortune.
His campaign reached all the classes and groups of the American society, to the extent where fabrications, prejudice and partiality found listening ears, that made for example Dwight Eisenhower the national hero and then republic president an accused, and Charley Chaplin the King of Comedy also an accused.
The right to search individuals and homes in secret, suddenly, and without warrants.
Precautionary arrests for a week.
By Rozanna Bou Munsif:
The reason for this bewilderment is that critical and reproachful official voices appear when Powell or others tour the region absenting Lebanon from his agenda over what happened months before and what happened with British Prime Minister Tony Blair who also dropped Lebanon from his Arab tour.
It would have been possible to be lenient regarding ignoring Lebanon by the Americans in New York and giving the Syrians priority to discuss the "Hizbullah" file if Lebanon had not been there or if ignoring it did not constitute an actual insult to it, as issues that concern it are being discussed with others while warnings are directed to it over its economic situation and issues similar to that.
But according to non-local diplomats, the danger is in what Lebanon is showing of giving in to the status quo, which no longer comes only at its expense, but also cancels any outside presence for it.
First, Turkey's sharing with these republics, or a large part of them, a mutual language, and the former's feeling that it has a responsibility towards the latter and its peoples that were in the past a part of the people of the Ottoman Empire.
Fifth, the Turkish regime's care to spread its influence to that region to face the dangers threatening it, namely the fundamental Islamic currents taken in the past by the Iranian Islamic Republic and supported and promoted later by the Taliban movement after controlling Afghanistan with the help of Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden and its "Al Qaeda" Network.
Second, to benefit from the situation that arouse to double the efforts in order to remove obstacles and difficulties that stood in the way for a long time and still stand in the way of Turkey's "joining" the European Union.
As for the careful or late reading, based on the same information and sources, it indicates that the actual concern currently prevailing in Turkey is gaining the approval of American President George Bush and his administration, especially the Department of Defense the "Pentagon", and ensure their sympathy with the Turkish interests and demands.
And as a result they do not want it to merge with their countries.
It was also a move aimed at showing readiness to work with fighters who abandon Taliban and bin Landon and have things in common with Turkey whether in belonging to the same race or the same religion.
And third, that America, specifically the Pentagon, must spend a lot of money on the Turkish army because it can play the important roles in the entire region.
From Montesquieu in the eighteenth century, to Helen Carrier Dankos in the nineties, under a remarkable title "The French Academy and Lebanon", the reader can follow the course of history through literary paragraphs and with the pens of French academics who came to Lebanon on several missions, political, diplomatic, archeological or tourist and left invaluable documents on Lebanon, the Lebanon of the cedars and waterfalls and a life of plenty, to a pitiful and torn apart Lebanon, the theater for religious wars, confusion and violence.
He sheds light on the relationship between Afghanistan and the countries surrounding it (Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan), presenting an overview of the historic sequence of the Caspian area with a view to drawing its map and its dealing with natural resources.
It also has an appendix of the most significant documents related to the first war of the third millennium: Congress's decision to use military force and the speeches of Bin Laden's and American President George Bush.
In southern and eastern Afghanistan, information referred to an environment of chaos with tribal leaders challenging the authority of the "Taliban" at the Atnieh Pashton stronghold.
A spokesperson for the "Taliban" leader Mulla Mohammad Omar denied in a telephone conversation with the Qatari "Al Jazeera" satellite channel the withdrawal of the movement's fighters from Kandahar.
He added, aside from the fighting going on in the south, there are operations continuing in the northern city of Qandaz in which fighters from "Al Qaeda" are mostly participating and not the "Taliban" forces.
He said that the Department would investigate the matter.
There is a large reward (...) millions of dollars to arrest him."

Ambiguity Towards "Hizbullah" Germany Brings Back Heat to "Paris-2" and the Partnership
As for our calendar of Hizbullah, we have different points of view."
But this ambiguity did not include two economic files that are sensitive to Lebanon, as Schroeder promised Hariri supportive German participation of Lebanon in the "Paris-2" Conference early next year.
The sources noted that the German officials directed repeated questions on the security situation in southern Lebanon, and Hariri answered them that it is alright and that a fragile stability prevails, blaming Israel for keeping its occupation of Lebanese Shabaa farms and its daily violations of the Lebanese airspace.

Efforts were exerted to issue a joint Arab - European - American statement on the conflict in the Palestinian territories on the sidelines of the proceedings of the General Assembly of the United Nations, but Washington preferred to issue its own position at this stage.
And there is serious effort based on finding satisfactory settlement for the Palestinians regarding the declaration of the state that does not anger the Israeli government that is reserved on President Yasser Arafat's declaration of his sought country.
Consequently, the idea of "Gaza first" proposed by Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres becomes more acceptable for the Palestinian side because it is listed under a new political framework.
Third, Sharon and his government enjoy the support of the Israeli streets, and there is no room to maneuver to exert actual pressure on the current Prime Minister.
The criminal court in Beirut sentenced, in a ruling yesterday headed by Judge Lebeeb Zwayyen and with councilor members, Wael Murtada and Ghada Awn to prison detained Palestinian Raed Mohammad Suleiman to 15 years mitigated sentence after it sentenced him to death, and convicted him of killed his grandmother in Ein Al Hilweh Camp by throwing a hand grenade at her for greed and revenge.
The defendant on the eve of the day of the crime on 7/20/1996 spent his time playing Flippers, riding the bike and sitting with his neighbor Mahmoud Shreidi at a watermelon stand, and then returned to his grandmother's house around twelve thirty after midnight where his grandmother was sound asleep on a mattress on the floor of one of the two rooms of the house, near the door leading to that room.
Then people started to crowd.
He stated to Beirut criminal court that he did not file a personal complaint against the people who threw the grenade, and that his uncle told him a week after he was detained the names of the perpetrators, and that the conflict between him and those who threw the grenade is not political.

A young man, who grew up on the love of helping others and supporting his human brother, inspired by instinct and principle.
What makes my heart bleed the most is when I hear a news story on the radio or television that some ignorant people claim Islam burned a church here and killed the innocent in a church there.
Attacking a church is an attack on the Messiah, Peace Be Upon Him, and attacking innocent people in the church, or in any sacred place, is an attack on the People of the Scriptures and, consequently, an attack on the Messiah, Peace Be Upon Him, and, as a result, an attack on Islam.
Jesus, son of Mary, said: "O God, Our Lord! Send us from heaven a table spread set with viands that there may be a feast for us, for the first of us and for the last of us, and a sign from Thee. Give us sustenance, for Thou art the Best of Sustainers."
These are the teachings of the Quran, and this the Messiah, Peace Be Upon Him, in our Quran, so do you not believe?
And we gave Jesus son of Mary proof and supported him with the Holy Spirit. The Almighty God said what was true.
The case will now be returned to the Military Judiciary for their opinion.

In pursuance therefore, in form (...) whereas Article 78 of the Military Judicial Law No. 24/68, intending to expedite cases referred to the Military Judiciary, specifically identified the verdicts passed by military magistrates which the Government's Commissioner at the Military Court may appeal, to wit, verdicts on preclusion of prosecution, verdicts related to competence, and verdicts that are inconsistent with his submission.
Whereas the Military Examining Magistrate's verdict in this respect deals with dismissing a request by the Government's Commissioner aiming for the adoption of an investigative measure in the case, which, consequently, cannot be classified within the verdicts specifically identified in Article 78 of the Military Judiciary Law, which may be appealed by the Government's Commissioner before the Court of Cassation, nor can the inconsistent stipulations included in the Penal Procedural law in this respect be applied for the aforementioned reasons.
First: To dismiss the petition in form.
"A Small Country" Not "Small Homeland"
And Lebanon the homeland is its history (and what a glorious history!). It is its resident people and their immense energies and its people in the diaspora and the influence they sway around them.
How do we make them aware that the "small homeland" is their homeland, meaning the homeland of their geopolitical state, within which they (barely) have an influence in it and on it, but only within its internationally-recognized borders, while Lebanon the homeland spreads over an area of time, past and present and the homelands of the entire world (and politicians have no power or role in it).
You want to annex Lebanon to France?
How many among our politicians know the phrase by Gabrielle Hanato (author of the book "History of the Egyptian Nation"): "If Lebanon's mountain is not the highest among the mountains of the world, it is the most exalted nation in the history of civilization."

In response to the complaint published in "An-Nahar" yesterday and signed by the students Joseph Sa'b, Mazen Kurdi, and Husam Al Rassi, regarding scientific scholarship at the National Council for Scientific Research, we received the following reply from the President of the Board of Directors of the Council, Dr. George Tu'meh and its Secretary General Dr. Mu'een Hamzah:
The Council resumed its activities in this regard as of the 1999-2000 school year, according to a scientific mechanism and through specialized committees that handle the classification of applications to be later reviewed by the Council's Board of Directors, which announces the names of the accepted candidates.

Her work, including a field study, "an anticipation of dangers and challenges, and identification of terminology and synonyms, and the quest to benefit from these techniques in order to achieve growth, stability and the protection of human rights, these matters cannot be the responsibility of an individual, but they are the responsibility of the state and all its societal institutions."

Earlier, the President of the Republic received at 10:30 a.m., the Speaker of the House of Deputies, Nabeeh Berri, with whom he reviewed the recent developments.

Management Discusses Opening Branches of the Casino - Dhaher: The Company Has the Last Word
But during the discussion with the Banque du Liban, whose representative was present, and with the Ministry of Finance, and after an in-depth reading of this subject, it became evident that the Council of Ministers may decide to approve the opening of branches and, consequently, the Company, if it wants, may decide whether to open this branch or not.
In answer to a question, he said: "We will meet with those concerned and after that, the Committee may decide or not decide. But what I have indicated, is the lack of clarity in the text referred by the Government.
- There is independence in the committees. Each committee has its own contentions and the questions will be posed to those concerned and in the light of the answers, the Administration and Justice Committee will decide.
And said in an interview with the Central News Agency.
Abi Nasr warned that opening branches will destroy the Casino "which has given the State a financial revenue of up to 80 billion Lebanese pounds."
He added: "There maybe a project for privatizing the Casino and the branches will not add to the value of the privatization.

Lebanese - Palestinian Meeting in Support of Intifada Al Hoss: Who Holds America Accountable for Injustice? Al Hoss, the Closing Statement
He added: "Hizbullah is no longer a political party; it is a choice we are committed to and for that, all those who offered martyrs are sacred and we are honored to be related to them. We accuse the United States of America and the Zionist entity of terrorism."
It is natural that procedures for implementing of the decision should come from the resolution's source, the United Nations.
It hurts us to say that in the jungle of the new world order, the principle of might is right prevails, and there is no room for the principle of right is might, to which the weaker and smaller countries and peoples cling (...)."
In case America is alone in imposing sanctions on Lebanon, Lebanon has the right to go to the Security Council."

They pointed out that the problem lies in that any American decision to be taken has several parties involved and stems from various preferences and approaches that leave a place for accepting pressures and taking interests into consideration.
The sources indicated their reassurance due to the French President Jacques Chirac's support of the Lebanese position, which considered the Security Council the only party that has the authority to categorize any party or organization.

Commandment for the Age
The fall of the Taliban with this fragility can only be justified by the fall of its enemies in 1996 with the same fragility, as if the one that owns tanks wins the war.
Any regime, no matter how hardened it becomes, would be worth living, even if nothing but music were left for him.
Why should the implementation of the Islamic regime be backward in Afghanistan and open and developed in Iran, where institutions work with relative democracy so that the people elect to office their representatives?

The Party's Council of Commissioners held its periodic meeting under the chairmanship of the deputy leader of the Party, Dureid Yaghi, and issued the following statement:
Regional and international organizations, which still continue to issue reports and bulletins about democracy and human rights, are now called upon to interfere to stand firmly on the side of the right of Azmi Bishara and what he represents in confronting the democracy of racial discrimination and racial exclusion. Or to put it more exactly, the responsibility of the League of Arab States comes in the first place as Azmi Bishara is a Palestinian Arab citizen who defends resolutely and courageously what those Arab values really and actually represent.

At the time when the Block condemned this terrorist measure against the Lebanese people and the Lebanese State, which have strongly refused it, it denounced the way of informing the Lebanese authorities of this measure because of its disregard of the fundamentals of dealing with states.

The most Erudite Sayyed Muhammad Hassan Fadlallah sees that "The American Administration will not exert any weak to lift out Lebanon from its economic crisis, because the question for her is the need of Israel for security inside occupied Palestine and along the Lebanese front. It tries to exploit what happened on September 11 to activate new tracks of pressures in all the directions, especially in the Arab and Islamic countries, and to create the atmosphere for political climates in the region that will pave the way for the post-war stage in Afghanistan.
He concluded that "America does not possess the absolute power in the region and it is difficult that it secures a world mandate in any economic or political war that targets the Lebanese entity in a comprehensive manner, where Lebanon still enjoys international affection from more than one axis. But, the matter is not in what others plan for it, but in what the Lebanese should all do for it at the level of internal unity to confront the dangers surrounding their country economically, politically and security-wise."

From the Israeli press: Is Arafat still a fundamental participant in the dialogue, or is it time to look for a replacement?
Consequently, Israel must be very cautious about the notion of ousting Arafat from the political arena.
Former Minister of Foreign Affairs Shlomo Bin Ami believes that there is no hope of arriving at peace with the Palestinians so long as Arafat occupies the presidency. Minister of Defense Binyamin Bin Eliezer states with regard to the peace process that Arafat has, in fact, concluded his historical role, and that if it were up to Sharon, he would issue orders for him to be expelled from the arena.
After presenting Arafat's role in escalating the Palestinian position against Israel, the writer states, "Nevertheless, military intelligence claims that Arafat is the person who is capable of changing the direction.

It seems that currently the Americans are more prepared to make sacrifices for the sake of their country's national security. National zeal pushes them to buy more American-made products, while they have ceased from mocking President George Bush, went back to smoking, and became more skeptical about others.
The manager of the "Rand McNally" store, in the center of Chicago, Linda Fish, noted that "there was something that awakened" the Americans, who doubled their purchases of books, maps and earth models, whose sales rose three-fold last year.

Amid Anti-Globalization Demonstrations and Introducing the "Euro" Into Circulation, European Summit Considers Arafat Sole Negotiator with Israel, Agree to Participate in Peace Keeping Force in Afghanistan Afghanistan - Middle East - Anti-Globalization Protestors - "Euro"
But the main objective of the summit is to issue the "Laeken Declaration," which will contain a common European vision and launch a new reform of the European institutions before the accession of 10 new states to the Union in the year 2004.
He said that "All the states of the Union will participate in it (...) And that is very important."
A European source explained that the force will work under a mandate from the United Nations and will be charged specifically with guaranteeing the security of the new Afghani administration, without interfering between the different Afghani groups.
He said: "We confirm that Palestinian President Arafat, who was elected democratically, and the Palestinian Authority, are the only negotiators in this conflict in front of Israel, which needs a partner (...). And we do not believe that weakening the Palestinian Authority or its President Arafat will help in any way in pushing the peace process." He pointed out that the European Union's High Commissioner for Foreign Policy and Mutual Security, Xavier Solana, would head to Washington soon to present a new initiative with the United States to reduce the violence in the Middle East.
And this is not a new policy.

Embarrassing Questions Without Answers!
Then comes the answer: This depends on the administrative time limits that define the life span of this tragedy and the date for determining an actual end to it.
The groups which make projects in Lebanon are known. They consist of an influential person and his brokers and of the poor workers who implement orders with minimum wage and are almost chocked by the dust.
National health planning identifies the taboos theoretically, but it has not built the fixed system for monitoring, prohibiting, and even punishment.
The President of the Union of Independent Enterprises and Private and Public Institutions, Bishara Al Asmar, confirmed, in his capacity as president of the syndicate of Beirut Port employees and workers, stressed that "the north eastern suburb of Beirut city has witnessed severe suffering for over 20 years at the environmental level, as symbolized by chronic garbage disposal, which have turned into invincible mountains in the region.
Not to mention the popular markets, the fish market and the tanneries."
On this occasion, we called for an environmental conference, which was accomplished late last month under the patronage of Minister Mousa and attended by representatives from the Ministry of Environment, the Development and Construction Council, Beirut Governorate, the capital's municipality, and Jabal Lebnan governorate.
What is needed is a bold plan that will be represented first and last by the purchase of the deposits station immediately and training the available human elements to operate it."
The root of the problem lies in presses, that amount to 300 presses, throwing approximately 65 thousand tons of olive jift, and 250 thousand square meters of zeibar waters in fields and river courses, causing a repeated environmental and health disaster.
The International Coldage celebrated Arbor Day by distributing in the kindergartens department a tree for every student, to be planted near his home, so that he may learn how to take care of it.
A Cedar Tree for 100 Dollars! Mousa Interested in the Complaint Against Cutting Trees in Shanan'eer Every Citizen Is a Sentry Planting 3 Thousand Trees in Southern Matn
He also called the Environment Public Prosecutor in Jabal, Lebanon and informed him of the content of the complaint and what the Ministry is doing in this regard.
The Ministry of Agriculture implemented a project to plant 3 thousand forest trees in Tarsheesh and the Southern Matn region, in cooperation with the municipality and the Faculty of Education at the Lebanese University.
"Scientific study, with environmental and economic benefits, whose implementation will provide a comprehensive solution for the problem of olive peat and industrial waters, of which Lebanon suffers annually, and will lead to adding its name to the list of countries that present advanced research."
Oweini mentions that the presses used in the past to use a petroleum product called ( ) to produce between 6 to 8 percent of the oil remaining in the peat, but the Ministry of Environment banned its use years ago after it became known that it had negative environmental effects, specifically in polluting the air.
It is based on the process of fermenting, which raises the percentage of protein in it from 11 to 18 percent, at a time when the protein ratio in wheat varies between 18 and 20 percent.
That is aside from the financial advantage, which the owners of the presses will gain from selling olive peat instead of discarding it.
During the fourth year, the study will become ready and can be put to implementation through the construction of small regional factories that transform pet into fodder with the required scientific specifications."
Pollution and the Responsible Party, Sin and Punishment
For that is when responsibilities accumulate, even if they are false, behind the walls of the repressed silence, the repressed silence, until it explodes.
The spread of the smoke of diesel oil in the air of Lebanon is the same as cutting down trees, for both tear Lebanon apart and pollute its tourist reputation.
You were trustworthy with little, and so I will entrust you with much.
Enter Lebanon's merriment."
>From the war on terrorism to withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missiles Treaty "ABM", President George Bush is shaping the world as viewed by the United States.
With the United States' projection of Iraq, North Korea and Iraq as "renegade states" seeking to develop programs of long range missiles and to acquire weapons of mass destruction, the treaty, from the American point of view, became a restriction that prevents Washington from developing defense capabilities to confront what Bush considers new dangers facing America in the post-cold-war era.
The American campaign on terrorism proved that it has supporters among almost all countries.
>From here, Bush's excuse in desiring to dispose of the effects of the cold war does not seem plausible, which comes as part of his explanation of the reasons that lead him to withdraw from the "ABM" Treaty before finding an alternative that reassures both the allies and adversaries of yesterday.
And if Moscow after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and its economic collapse remained a hard number in the arena of international balance, that is due to its ownership of a nuclear arsenal that, if it is not superior to the American arsenal, it is not much less than it.
And it realizes the true magnitude of the abilities of these countries.
Before these attacks, Bush's policies were the most criticized in the world, even on the internal American level.
And it is the same war that lets Ariel Sharon eradicate the Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, amid Arab and international silence that parallels the silence that meets Bush when he makes decisions that undermine the strategic security of the entire world.
But those who dream and yearn were in reality denied the opportunity to realize the American gain based on thinking well of "Taliban" and Al Qaeda, and the objective miscalculation of America's ability in colonialist creativity and destructive creativeness...
It seems that the President wanted to generalize this impression, the evidence being his allowing this exhibition, with later plans to print pictures of these paintings in a calendar for the year 2002.
that modern life and its requirements imposed the existence of group participation, which has come to be known today as the concept of political parties.
More precisely, we will study the opinions of David Apter, Claus Van Beimen, and Samuel Huntington, and how much they are compatible with the Lebanese reality with regard to the presence of political parties and their role in political life.
Modern life and its requirements imposed the existence of group participation, which have come to be known today as the concept of political parties.
More precisely, we will study the opinions of David Apter, Claus Van Beimen, and Samuel Huntington, and the extent to which they are in harmony with the Lebanese reality with regard to the presence of political parties and their role in political life.
The parties, Apter continues, push the people to join their political stream, not just through the attractiveness of their ideology, but also through incentives they provide when they are in power, like employment in the various positions.
2. The historical "crisis" status theory: It works with the creation of a new state or with constitutional changes.
As for Huntington, he believes that political parties appear as a result of modern life and its complex circumstances.
This reading into the contribution of parties in the political process is not necessarily suitable for developing countries.
Even the elections that took place in the years 1992, 1996 and 2000, which sent the largest number of party elements to parliament, are not the result of a healthy state in the Lebanese political system.
The problem here is that the equation imposes a pattern of relation between the citizen and the State that does not evolve except through linkage to the religious sect.
At the legal level, the establishment of parties in Lebanon is based on a law issued in the year 1909, and is the same law that allows the establishment of associations.
If we are optimistic about the possibility of the creation of political parties on strong national bases that are open to all citizens, there remains ahead of us the most important question, which is: Will the Lebanese legislature (parliament) allow the existence of a party law that affects the interests of the existing groups?
Yesterday, the Beirut Stock Exchange issued a circular related to the decisions of the Extraordinary General Assembly of the company, whose agenda included reading the Board of Directors' report, endorsing it and changing the name of the company.
Here, a large number of shareholders proposed omitting this reading after the comments which the Chairman gave on the matter.
Then Mr. Janho asked whether any dues needed to be paid to change the name.
He told the "Central News Agency": "It is rumored that the "mechanism" of appointments stipulated the need for justifying the replacement of one person with another and that did not happen.
He asked about the reason for "replacing general directors before their terms ended, which caused them a shock."
He pointed out "the new appointments did not create 'joy' and did not have the expected effect.
If that is done, the effect will be positive".
We hope to achieve success, but in action, not words."
Sabra announced that "Promo-Liban Company will organize the festival and that the meeting aims at coordinating with the hotel and restaurant syndicates to make it a success and at cooperating within a studied and comprehensive plan." He quoted Minister Fleihan as saying that "cooperation between the public and private sectors is aimed at restoring Lebanon to its former role in the region."
The President of the Hammoud Traders Association, Paul Iyanian, renewed in letters he addressed yesterday to President of the Republic Emil Lahoud, Speaker of the House of Deputies Nabih Berri, Prime Minister Rafiq Al Hariri, Minister of Finance Fouad Siniora, Minister of Tourism Karam Karam, Minister of Economy and Trade Basil Fleihan and Minister of Information Ghazi Aridi his demand regarding "the necessity of postponing the implementation of the value added tax in view of the difficult economic and living circumstances."
This exhausts the State's treasury and the private sector."
Outside, the dollar continued to decline compared with other major currencies, except the yen, continuously negatively affected by the manifestations of economic weakness in the United States despite decreasing interest rates for the twelfth time this year from 6.5% at the beginning of the year to 1.75% last Tuesday, without resulting in its leaving the economic recession cycle.

The prices of silver also rose, the ounce closed in London at 4.38 dollars compared with 4.2650 dollars day before yesterday in New York, after it stabilized at 4.32 dollars at noon.
Previously, in the morning, the Tokyo bourse transformed to a rise after profits in the car sector exceeded losses in the banking sector, supported by the weakness of the yen, which encouraged the purchasing of stock in Japanese photographic companies. As a result, the Nikkei index closed with an increase of 78.20 points over 10,511.65 points.
He said "the elections took place at the height of confrontations faced by the Labor Federation against the Government's unjust policies vis-à-vis the workers' causes, as if it sits in the same ditch with the employers and abides by their directives."
Once again, by uniting behind our demands, much of our objectives will be realized and by our unification, our movement on earth will be enhanced and strengthened."
It has been known that, since its launch, the Presidential position has led to moving the ambiguity surrounding this establishment by initiating an audit of its accounts and other subsequent measures.
Among the indicators that may be considered:
- Preparing a draft law that stipulates exempting establishments from due and undue subscriptions.
Hospitality and Food Exhibition "Horeca 2002" between 9 and 12 April
In this context, the director of the organizing company, Jumana Damous Salameh explained, "The exhibitors used to go to the exhibition either to attend specific meetings or to get specific products.
As regards the International Food Exhibition, it will focus more on food and beverage exhibits pertaining to the hotel industry, which include the different hotel foods, fresh and frozen foods, dairy products, fruits and vegetables, juices, drinks and food packaging.
A series of seminars on vital subjects is being prepared.
He hinted that "this tax has the capability for self-monitoring and, consequently, it prevents income tax evasion."
Before looking into the effect of the tax in itself on the market, we must not forget to work on improving the general budget and finding solutions to the permanent deficit in the treasury."
He said, "Twenty-one percent of the national product is the size of the annual deficit in the budget and no country in the world can continue to tolerate this deficit in the long run.
The Lebanese Maritime Transport Association appealed to the Minister of Public Works and Transport Najeeb Meeqati to float two tenders: one for the purchase of the equipment for the containers' station at Beirut Port, and the other for operating the station at the earliest possible opportunity.
It considered that this exemption should be similar to dockage fees, in conformity with the Government's policy, and by virtue of the Prime Minister's regulations regarding the provision of the best services through Beirut Port to cruise ships.
It stressed the necessity of forming a committee to assess the compensation due to unloading contractors and owners of the machinery "so that the error that happened previously with the Dubai Ports Authorities does not recur."
The volume of revenues also decreased to more than 250 billion liras, and the percentage of deficit in the same budget recorded a reduction that amounted to 21 points as well.
"Hizbollah" Lebanon and Lebanon the State
Yesterday, "Hizbollah" Lebanon was in the "quasi military" show in form, and in the military show in content and soul more present, even more permeating in greater Beirut more than Lebanon the state, and the independence day show barely exceeded the limits of a military barracks outside the capitol.
They are legitimate questions, regardless of our initial supportive position of "Hizbollah" and its initial position towards the Palestinian cause and of its loud voice amid this Arab vacuum and panic.
We say this based on our support of "Hizbollah" and our exalting of its role, and for the blood it spilled to liberate southern Lebanon.
First is that we will be alone in the arena, and second we will pay the price alone, and third because sooner or later we will divide amongst ourselves over "Hizbollah" Lebanon.
By Rozanna Bou Munsif:
There are no concessions on what was repeated by American officials on various levels repeatedly from President George Bush to his Secretary of State Colin Powell and his national security advisor Condoleezza Rice and then Ambassador Patel in Beirut regarding foreign reinforcements for "Hizbollah", in view of clear and strong evidence the Americans say and confirm is available to them. Their positions arise originally from the presence of this evidence they likely presented to Syrian and Lebanese officials.
Diplomacy performed by Burns is supposed to be translated in the area of American openness to the countries of the region, in view of the diplomatic and media concern shown by the United States to prove its complete "non aggression" towards the countries of the region parallel to the Afghanistan war (it is noted that large posters were published of pictures of mosques in America), and distributing recordings conducted by "Voice of America" radio station with Islamic personalities, and at the same time obtaining cooperation of these states to fight terrorism.
Perhaps the deterioration of the situation constitutes an additional reason for reminding all parties of the political goals that lie behind this conflict.
As the American administration continues to cooperate with Arafat, it sees the priority in the movement of Palestinians against violence because it affects them negatively in the first place, as it reflects on the possibility of going back to peace negotiations.
Between the latest video for Osama bin Laden and the television series "Hajj Mitwalli Family", there is a common denominator that embodies the continuance of the most dangerous disease in our Arab societies: the lack of reason.
Then he tells about three people who saw in their dreams the plane crash into the New York tower before the operation.
A horrible thing, but what is worse than a culture of invisibles controlling decisions, is their rooting in the society and even its continued promotion with the more popular and widespread methods instead of fighting it.
And without thinking of the situation they have already accepted for themselves, they cannot find a way to make their decisions except by resorting to fortune-tellers or augury.
Washington - Riyadh and Washington - Tehran
Many wondered about the future of Saudi-American relations.
The information coming from Washington through informed Western diplomatic sources indicates the presence of some flaw or rather the rise of some flaw in the relations between the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, since fundamental Islamists targeted American nationals in the latter.
It also reached more accurate information that indicates that some in the royal family are involved in donations to bin Laden without being aware of the reality of his goals.
This includes Washington's need for Riyadh and its role in the region, especially in view of the negative development of the situation in the Palestinian territories.
But they point out the presence of several unresolved large issues between them, which are supposed to make the normalization of American-Iranian relations slower or late, such as the negative Iranian position on the peace process and Iran's attempt to obtain weapons of mass destruction and the like.
But it is also true that they have been stopped since that date, which may negate any connection of Tehran to relations between bin Laden and the Taliban, and what they have committed.
But are the Lebanese obsessions to be cursed?
They all come to us arrogantly, brandishing swords of revenge and superior demands, telling us what they consider we should do as a duty of our duties.
And since that day our veins have not dried and our eyes have not known sleep.
Where was America, American chastity, American justice and the Statue of Liberty?
Oh Monica!
He gives opinions and he might change them at any moment, not out of hesitation, but for his lack of faith in any stability or certainty.
As if the novelist desires an overall look at the current Lebanese reality, linked to the previous happenings since the seventies and until today, and to the events in the region around it.
For each group calls, as usual, for its own ideas and accuses the other of being wrong. Thus, fights and the exchange of cutting words erupt in universities.

The homeland of shadow is her homeland, and in as much as the shadow surrounds us the search for the light becomes painful.
"May sleep carry me and drown me
But in Paris, there was no time to waste in this negative connection.
She spoke in whispers in the midst of the noise
I cultivated my peace, daily, early (...)"
Poems inspired by homeland of shadow spanning thirty years, meaning from the age of youth to the age of maturity, we pursue in reading them, and in rereading them several times, the poetic language, the beauty of plot and the metaphysical dimension combined.
She lit her coals and inflamed their fire so that her word may rise and expand.
"The hardest thing in life is not emptiness / that crushes you on the walls of memory but when the courage betrays us / to create fates that make / the impossible an enemy to be defeated and we return (...)."
A cry of pain and an intifada against injustice and violence in its sublime dimension, the opposite of poetry resigned from life, blockaded inside the perimeter of its writer.
The platform of her poems is Lebanon, and a city in its destruction.
But without it no images filled with metaphors would have shone from between the fingers of the poet, illuminating in their limits:
No one realizes my fear
In 1992, Violin wrote a poem entitled: "Song to a Sun Child" that she paved for with an introduction in which she says: "When a child dies from hunger,
His body is a sacrifice for the morning
He knows that expanded comfort is in being close to her.
Daily: He rises early, has coffee, and starts to write.
At three in the afternoon he starts working again, reads other people's poems - long ago he stopped reading anything but poetry - and at the end of the day he strolls in the streets of Strahlen City, he goes back to his room and records the day's thoughts on a paper, and at ten to bed, and to insomnia.
The poet is a servant at the church of secrets.
He is surprised with this birthday in the Rhine country, and remembers Nietzsche's words that declare death, God.
The Belgian city of Bruges, museums, cathedrals up to the clouds, old passages on sea channels between the houses, and at its edges tourists, coffee shops, willows and aspens.
Bruges takes from the world of the other and draws you to the world of the self.
When clouds cease to exist in its skies, no lightening, no thunder or wind, the writer transforms into a storyteller, a star that lights the theater, a play for entertainment.
Contrary to what we have been familiar with in terms of novelists choosing exceptional heroes for their novels, Ruba Al-Sulh chose for her first novel "We All Fall Together" (*) an ordinary heroine who has identified her regional and religious allegiance, but represents, in her characteristics and life, an important category of Lebanese girls however their religious sects may differ.
There is the widowed and bereaved mother, the detained prisoner of war, the young man who exploits the war to extort money and get rich, and the enemy brothers. There are also those who have moved from the position of "struggle" to venerating the people of fortune, in order to achieve social positions and consequently prominent political positions, the old Nasserites, and those who rushed to share with Iraq its war against Iran and their news disappeared.
Youth: some are still introverted and some have divorced the war theses to drown themselves in available pleasures, while a few have been able to save themselves from falling into adopting the prevailing or popular viewpoints to form their own views.
The wretched Faten pays a price for a mistake she has committed that even a man does not pay in our lands.

Hence, religion was strongly present from the historical perspective in the serial "The Stranger of Taurus", the momentous Iranian production that personifies the life of Al-Imam Ali Al-Rida. It was dubbed into Arabic with a large number of Lebanese voices and attracted a large ratio of viewers, especially since the timing of its showing did not witness strong competition from other channels.
By contrast, selecting the series "The Death Coming from the East" was not successful, as it had been shown on "Al-Mustaqbal" Television a few years ago and for more than one time. Furthermore, it was transmitted over a considerable number of Arab satellite channels to the point that the Lebanese viewer had come to learn it by heart.
It remains to say that this occasion has a special flavor on "Al-Manar" television, which, unfortunately, we miss from other channels, which know nothing about the month of fasting except the times of futour and suhour, while "Al-Manar" sings alone outside the flock.

Christian sects in Lebanon responded yesterday to the call by Pope John Paul the Second to fast at the end of the month of Ramadan in expression of solidarity between Christians and Muslims.

Under the Eyes of American Envoy to Beirut Tumultuous Parades by "Hizbullah" from the Borders to the Suburb

Baalbaki started the conference with a welcome speech, then Rizq read the Meeting statement entitled the "Fate of Harmony: Reminder and Demand of Loyalty", that said: "The item of sovereignty, freedom and independence is deficient, and it is the subject of continual skepticism, and general complaints.
Such "financial, economic and social reform" is like "balanced development", a mission link in the state's agenda, each of them has a promise where no actual intention has been shown to achieve it.
The statement referred to the items not implemented so far in the Taif agreement, the most prominent of which is "spreading the sovereignty of the Lebanese state, as the agreement provided for dissolving all Lebanese and non-Lebanese militias and handing over their weapons to the state, nothing of that was implemented, and the state sufficed with dissolving organizations that responded to it spontaneously and handed over their weapons voluntarily."
It added "the successive election laws, by the admission of the benefactors, and the agreement of the people who daily express their fixed conviction, is the brutal obstacle standing in the way of reconciliation, reform, freedom, independence, sovereignty, national unity and political participation, which ensure the qualitative civilization passage into the twenty first century."
The harmony is not there, and the true reconciliation did not happened and the national unity is still unachieved, and we tell that Lebanon's independence in shaken and its sovereignty is deficient, and its will is chained and its decision is damaged."
Following the meeting Karam said: "The meeting with Minister Murr was a vocational, political, and business meeting."
Karam added: "The Minister of Interior confirms that security in Lebanon is ideal, and it has been said that we exaggerate security, and it has been said there is too much security.
Security forces are doing their job, and we did our duty in Al Daniyeh and we prevented the sabotage to Lebanon. Our security forces are on a high level, for the rate of accidents after using seat belts went down and the rate of crime has become slight because security people are performing their duties on the highest levels.
Karam continued: "The Minister laughed when a colleague asked him about his disagreement with his father (MP Michel Murr) and said: "This matter cannot be discussed and there can be no answer from me.
A delegation from the National Front Party visited yesterday Beirut Archbishop for Roman Catholics Archbishop Elias Odeh.

He criticized Israel's demand for Syrian support for Hizbollah to end, saying that "it is not acceptable for resistance to be called off while the occupation continues."
He stressed the need for a just and comprehensive peace based on the Madrid agreement and the principle of land for peace and total withdrawal to the June 4, 1967 line "because without this, there will be no resumption of negotiations whatsoever."
He referred to Israeli demands for Syria to stop supporting Hizbollah and saw this as an "indication of the lack of seriousness" of the Jewish state because "to Syria and the Arabs, Hizbollah is a legitimate resistance movement against Israeli occupation [...] if Israel wants real peace, it would have made attempts to resume the negotiations where they left off."
American Secretary of State Colin Powell announced yesterday the United States' refusal to comply with the demands of American journalist Daniel Pearl's kidnappers in Pakistan, who extended the deadline they set to kill him on Wednesday by 24 hours, and warned that they would declare "a real war against the Americans."
The American State Department told its nationals in Pakistan to take precautions.
The cycle will carry on and no American journalist will be able to enter Pakistan [...] the Americans will get what they deserve."
It added that it would send food aid to Pearl's family "as America did [...] we hope his family is grateful just as the Americans expected the Afghans to be grateful for the food dropped over their heads."
Indian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Neropama Rau described Pakistani accusations of her country's involvement in Pearl's kidnapping as "silly" and "a further example of Pakistani military spokesman's General Rashid Karshai's excessive imagination" who had declared "there is an Indian link in this matter.
Only coincidence would have it that the American president gave his State of the Union address to Congress, and through it raised to a crescendo the tone of accusation against Hizbollah listing it in the terrorist "axis of evil," at the same time as the Lebanese assembly was dissecting the state of the Lebanese nation which is drowning under increasing crises.
Raising the probability, covertly or overtly, of changing the government, whether denied, confirmed or postponed, is a reflection of the collective confusion in the search for solutions whereas the various authorities, submerged in their personal battles daily provide further examples of their edgy and unprepared treatment of events. This confirms the lack of any clear decision or the inability to make a decision to confront the state of siege, external and internal, into which they have dropped themselves together with a beleaguered Lebanon hence becoming its hostage.
Between these two factors, another dangerous aspect comes to light in the form of Lebanon being listed as one of America's objectives, albeit through Hizbollah only, in an unbalanced war in which Lebanon has no active choice.
It also means a government change, whether this happens or not, an internal consumer affair which neither advances or hinders finding a solution to the economic crisis nor protects Lebanon from the war on terrorism.
All this anger could not hide the jovial look always present on George Bush's face.
For it was as though we were sitting in front of a television screen listening with awe to the "sole leader" of the new world, and as though Congress, enraptured and applauding, were the universal revolutionary council supporting its leader and practically chanting "with our blood, with our souls we sacrifice ourselves for you Bush"!
We can not know where this zeal will lead to; and it is not limited to Bush's speech or Congress's applause, bewitched by words of power, because it extends to American public opinion whose overwhelming support for its president has reached 83% which means it will give its outright support to the arrogance of power.
From the Israeli press Sharon concedes need for Palestinian State British magazine: Israel prime suspect in Habiqa's assassination
However, he expressed his regret that Arafat was not assassinated during the war in Lebanon. A decision was made not to eliminate him at the time.

It also means that they had better not export terror to America and her friends and allies; otherwise, we will come down on them with the laws of this country."
He declared "the world needs to be with us [...] because such weapons could be directed against us or them and we can not allow terrorism to blackmail the United States or any other freedom-loving country."
To this end, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told the National Defense Institute in Washington that the United States must be prepared for further terrorist attacks that would be bloodier than the September 11 attacks.
He added: "We know Iran is implicated in sending terrorists to Damascus then onto the Bakaa Valley where they train in camps and from where these terrorists launch operations against countries in the region and elsewhere."
American television network CNN reported that the attack was meant to take place last week on a nuclear installation in the state of Virginia, using a passenger plane and that it was to be carried out by non-Arabs recruited at camps run by the fundamentalist al-Qaida organization led by Osama Bin Laden.
Conference of the 32nd World Economic Forum discusses vision for a shared future

An important stop in Arab terms is the seminar today on Arab-American relations and the future they point to.
Only the government?
But many witnesses confirmed the fact, although they were unable to explain it.
According to a reliable account (of course), the phenomenon took place when Arab Interior Ministers took part in a closed and unofficial session (forbidding any written reports about it) held on Lebanon's initiative to inform the honored guests of an experiment shown at that time on television screens under the attractive title of "A Discussion of the Budget in the Chamber of Deputies."
What did he say?
Like someone with bullets coming out of his mouth, he fired off words rapidly: "The meaning of the experiment, eh? Ha... ha... ha..."
So in addition to relaxing its Arab guests, they who only laugh in closed and unofficial sessions, the host country wanted the concurrence of the meeting of Arab Interior Ministers with the budget discussion session to be an occasion for marketing a new Lebanese invention called "television democracy."
But it would appear that the Lebanese delegation did not have the opportunity to present all its marketing arguments and this is something the informed source regretted.
The source went quiet, then mumbled: "only the government... only the government...only... ha... ha... ha..."
Many interpreted this prior session and its decisions aimed at citizens in order to lessen the burden of the new tax affecting them as also being a political message saying that the time for a government change is not here yet, especially after the president of the republic Emile Lahud clearly hinted two days ago to the ruling out of any change prior to the Arab Summit.
Ministerial sources saw the aim of this reduction as also preventing smuggling on the one hand and protecting local industry on the other.
After the session, President Lahud signed the official documents for application of the law on value added tax.
Muawadh said "the security services even allow themselves to classify the representatives," pointing out that a very, very important and high-ranking officer allowed himself to classify our colleague Boutrus Harb."

While the meeting's work proceeds tomorrow, it is expected that President Amin al-Jamil will address the audience with a voice message in which he discusses the Lebanese and party situations.
A first reading by responsible sources of American President George W. Bush's State of the Union address to Congress identified a dangerous speech "that can be regarded as a warning to some governments lacking in courage toward terrorism" in his reference to terrorist training camps in 12 countries run by groups such as Hamas, Hizbollah, Islamic Jihad and Mohamed's Army set up in remote woods and deserts and hiding in large urban centers.
and that party activists carry out operations against Israeli military sites in the occupied Shaba' farms.
They confirmed that Lebanon would not step down from its position of resisting occupation in the farms and that it is not afraid of the speech, which a number of officials took to be a serious warning with regard to Hizbollah, since there has been much criticism in recent months and this has not changed the Lebanese position.
It would also be hard to convince him to reconsider his position as this would require a capable and influential quarter not available among officials at present.
They once again confirmed that Lebanon would not change its position in spite of increasing intimidation of the party and that it adheres to the need to distinguish between resistance and terrorism.

It is no exaggeration to say that this piece, which none of our television stations have done, including the regrettable Lebanon Television, is a living expression in concrete buildings and their social mores of "where we live" and an extension of "who we are."
But the burning question remains: Where is the individual in our heritage?
Fuad Ubaid, the director general and chairman of the board of directors, says on the subject "we are making a big effort to collect national memory in terms of works of art, daily events, documents, paintings, plans and the like but we do this with some hesitancy as we do not have adequate and suitable buildings.
He explains that "the greater part of our history is outside Lebanon.
This is why Ubaid is inviting Lebanese citizens and their relatives who know of Lebanese icons to provide the Archives Institute with information "in order to preserve the national memory which is a public right."

The result was the assurance of definite possibilities for cooperation and concessions to Lebanese traders by Hong Kong, in addition to an invitation for a Lebanese delegation or mission to visit Hong Kong to expand the framework of discussions aimed at initiating close cooperation.
"Lebanon, like Hong Kong, is a bridge to neighboring countries."

A Toulouse Lautrec retrospective at the Maillol Museum in Paris (February 8 to May 6) includes thirty-two posters as well as preliminary sketches, starting with the image and ending with the word and engraving.
Lautrec's posters take the varied world of culture from theater, music and literature to the street, night, festivities and occasions.
Lautrec's knowledge of brothels and dance halls opened up many creative opportunities for him, be it murals such as "Dancer and Audience" or the traits of dancers, singers, customers, artists and musicians.
He revealed their radiance in his works and remained enchanted by the world of theater, musicals, circus, dance halls and bars throughout his life.

He considered that it was necessary to develop legal and moral standards within the basic regulations governing companies in order to limit corruption.
The aim is not only to protect oneself but also to encourage other companies to follow the example.
In the framework of looking for funding for our society, we found that we could not cooperate with a company or agency where corruption had taken hold and this is why our condition for collaboration is that the company we want to work with must agree to the charter. In addition, we are looking into preparing an impartiality charter between us and companies and agencies."
In case of doubt, the committee will look into the compliance of one of the signatory parties or members of the ethics charter.

Among the Lebanese villages in which Milki found amber are Baqaaqfara, Haqil, Miroba, Harajil, Hamana, Thahir Albaidar, Jazeen and others which is why amber has Lebanese names ("Libaniya" series) and why a type of amber called "cedars" is registered at the natural history archives in Washington, as well as another type called "Milki."

"2- Since the establishment of the College of Medicine in the Lebanese University, the issuance of Decree 4690 to build the Bi'r Hassan hospital, and its affiliation with the Lebanese University, the resident and training physicians in the College of Medicine in the Lebanese University are performing clinical training in a large number of private hospitals that the college made contracts with, according to a temporary agreement, until the opening of the Lebanese University hospital with its two branches in Baabda and Bi'sr Hassan."
"c- The insistence of the hospitals to discriminate between the resident and training physicians in the College of Medicine and the colleagues in the private colleges operating in Lebanon, and depriving the affiliates of the Lebanese University of equality from the livelihood aspect with their colleagues in the private colleges by refusing to increase compensation allowances to come close to the lowest of compensation allowances in the other universities, and depriving them of health insurance in the hospitals."

"There is no Jordanian citizen and first of them I, personally, who does not feel anger for what our folks are being exposed to of killing, siege, and starvation, because I know that every citizen and Jordanian family has a family relationship with our folks in Palestine... but their support will not be with marches, demonstrations, and donations alone, but rather by influencing the world to support Palestinian rights and forcing the Israeli army to withdraw immediately from all Palestinian cities and territories without any conditions."

"All we had was mineral water.... And on a day things were quiet, we heard people speak in Arabic, so we understood that the civilians had returned and that the Israelis had gone."

"So some of us wore women's dresses and went out with them."
"We lost a lot of our weapons."
The American President's advisor for national security affairs Condoleezza Rice repeated yesterday the classification of Iran in "the axis of evil," announcing the failure of efforts exerted by partners of the United States to end the "destructive" policies of Tehran.

I know that "the third world" has become a junkyard for all types of tobacco rejected by the American and the European.
But the matter if limited to commodities will be deficient or temporal, with its effect expiring as the popular rage against the American policy fades away.
But the Arab popular sensitivity of the importance of joining this international wave remains a marginal sensitivity and has not reached the pulse of the street yet.
That is good.
And it is not to be answered with a European cigarette, while the mind sleeps in the desert...
After the cycle of time turned a whole decade, Lebanon became a disarmed country that abandoned romantic illusions.
What is worse than that is that the parliament itself did not take long to announce its boredom with consumption of "talk" as after less than two hours it interrupted its session and pushed it to an indefinite time to complete the discussion of other inquiries included on its agenda!
For adaptation is no longer the epidemic of the people, but rather it is the epidemic of the authority that has adapted to that language and lost one of its typical components.
Some rush now the extraction of features of a "symbolic victory" from the traces of an "obtrusive defeat," the chapters of which have not yet ended.
But the exciting aspect of this important development is that there is a large number of statements and comments dealing with his emergence as if it represents a victory sufficient to compensate the enormity of the defeat that the Israeli occupation army continues to cause not to our folks in Palestine only, but to all this Arab nation and to the international legitimacy whose decisions and desires have been ripped under the chains of the tanks exactly like the bodies of the innocent in Jenin and Nablus.
If in the framework of the "arrangements paper" that organized his exit, those accused of killing Rahabam Zaifi should go to the prison of Jericho and under British or American guard, then it is not exaggerating at all to assume that the Palestinian law with its symbolic sense at least remains there, maybe to condole the Palestinian sovereignty that is also put under incarceration, in turn.
And in the horizons are the features of a political investment of the massacre that will be more brutal than the massacre?!
It added that the Ministry of Defense has no evidence indicating that Damascus tried to control the party.
Peres mentioned that he presented requests among which was for Israel to receive copies of the testimonies of those who will appear before the committee, but the United Nations refused that, as it refused the request to discuss the terrorism operations that led to the Israeli army's entry into the camp.
As to a member of the Knesset, Bail Dayan from the Labor Party, he said: "Moving from agreeing to the investigation committee to full non-cooperation resembles a suicidal move in foreign policy and proves that we have something to hide."
"The great damage that was caused to this sacred place and to clerics detained inside it and the difficult circumstances they suffer, all of that can raise a wave of anti-Semitism in all parts of the Christian world."
"Also, the raids on the Palestinian cities and villages in response to the terrorist attacks does not form an alternative for a strategy that must put a limit to the violence and save Israel from the largest of economic and social crises that it witnessed."
From the Inside Is Different From It on the Outside
Whether this talk has factual foundation or the truth is in another place, its essence indicates that the issue of relations between Washington and Tehran is moving in both capitals contrary to the direction indicated by the externally observed givens of these relations.
But who in Iran is holding the dialogue?
Rafsinjani is known for his tendencies to establish relations with Washington among conditions and specifications, and he was ahead in this matter in the mid-eighties when he entered into a large deal with Washington and some Arab states to end the Iraqi-Iranian war as part of what has come to be known as "Iran Gate."
The reformist representative Muhsin Mirdamadi, who heads the foreign and national security parliamentary committee, says that the committee is considering the issue of the relationship with Washington and, specifically, the relationship with American representatives who do not have a hostile position toward Iran.
Yesterday, Egyptian President Husni Mubarak accused implicitly Washington that it used the international campaign for combating terrorism to the benefit of Israel and failed to meet its commitments to guarantee establishment of a political settlement for the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Israel insists on stopping the Palestinian attacks totally before returning to the suspended negotiations with the Palestinians.
He added: "The major powers and on top of them the United States must assume their responsibilities in immediate stopping of all Israeli provocative practices and imposing Israel's respect for the democratically elected Palestinian authority and its people and the immediate withdrawal from its occupied land in a framework of immediate implementation of international legitimacy resolutions."
He noted that "in the world are many satellite channels whether in the United States, South America, Canada, or Europe, and in the Arab nation there also many satellite channels."

He had paid on Sunday a brief visit to Libya during which he reviewed with the Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi the situation in the Palestinian lands.
Both the Russian Ministry of Defense and the Kremlin office in Chechnya declined to comment on the matter.
"There are many rumors now."
It is noted that after the announcement by the Russian security authorities last Thursday of the killing of "leader Khattab" of Arab origin, a spokesman for the rebels questioned that matter.
Moscow accused Basaiev, who was born on January 14, 1965, in Fedino in south- eastern Chechnya, of a wave of attacks in Russia in the summer of 1999 that killed 293, but the Chechen leader denied his involvement in these operations.
He said that bad weather and poor vision hid that line, apparently.
Telecommunications Draft Bill's Dilemma Is 4700 Employees; Al-Hareeri Called Lahud, Assuring: Our Relations Will Not Reach a Dead End
Al-Hareeri conveyed from Lahud his comfort with the results of the session of the committees.
Al-Hareeri had received in Quraytam the head of the national bloc Carlos Iddeh and the chairman of the Marunite League Harith Shehab, and discussion took place on some local issues among which was privatization. The Prime Minister said: "The impression must not be that matters between me and His Excellency the President about these issues are going to a dead end, and we will not reach a dead end."
He called anew to "keep the economic affair away from political exploitation and link it with the logic of personal profit and loss instead of giving priority to the interests of the country and the subjects."
It seemed that there were no reflections of the recent inquiries session on the atmosphere of the committees, as if nothing had happened in the parliament two days ago.
This item opens the door for brokers, which could hinder attracting investors.
The amendments of the committees included also Article 19 in the section related to "licensing for telecommunications service providers and their obligations" and in the section related to "international fixed telephone services."
In the vicinity of Sheba and Kafr Shuba, American Ambassador Vincent Batel launched an invitation for calm, stating that the operations of Hezbollah "cause violence," and announced Washington's stand "against violence and against terrorism."
Batel's tour also included Khlawat Al-Bayada where Sheikh Fandi Jamal El-Deen Shujaa interrupted the reception.
He referred to the political situation and said: "President George Bush is working hard in agreement with Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and Israel to bring peace to the region," noting that "peace is not made except by negotiation and not by violence."

"And were it not for the steadfastness of the Phalanges, there would have been a Palestinian state instead of the Lebanese state, for if the Battalions did nothing, it has preserved this homeland for all the Lebanese."
By Your Lord, Enough and a Thousand Times Enough
and some others became silent to make way for the officials in the pursuit of partial salvation by finding a partial solution.
The officials attack with all weapons and of all caliber.
They took excuse in the crisis so all the promises of all the projects and development evaporated.
We understood that the world pressures us with all means to make us accept the solutions that it drew for its benefit and the benefit of the enemy of this country.
We understood, we understood, we understood everything that is being said,
For if the people remain silent today,

It focused on the type of the aggressor which is Israel the racist state, and also its intention to commit extermination crimes by premeditation and predetermination, by using internationally prohibited weapons such as cluster bombs and napalm.
They mentioned Sharon is in disagreement with the European Union because of his occupation of the Palestinian territories too, and he did not stop at that but also insulted it by preventing the Foreign Minister of Spain Jose Pique, whose country presides over the Union, from moving to Ram-Allah to meet with Arafat. They stopped at Sharon's practices in Lebanon, for he was the one who extended his invasion to Beirut in 1982. He has not ceased to threaten launching a harsh military strike if the resistance strikes lead to the killing of Israelis, military or civilians.
Al-Herawi Accused Al-Husseini of Obstructing the Session: How Was the Cairo Agreement Rescinded With One Minister?
Al-Herawi said to "Al-Nahar": "I followed carefully the recent session of the parliament, and its topic was the questions and the answers."
"They asked that day where is Prime Minister Rasheed Karami (the forgiven) so that we can ask him the question and we can reach later a confidence vote."
"Let President Husseini kindly reveal the proceedings of Al-Taif and place them at the disposal of the parliament and the politicians, as they contain no secrets."
"Everyone attended that session."
"I also ask President Al-Husseini: How did he rescind the Cairo Agreement in the presence of one minister in the session, and today he wants the presence of all members of the government and its head to ask questions?"
They were joined by the Minister of State Beshara Mirhaj, and all set off on an exciting trip in the world of the cathedral and its secrets, accompanied by the head of the restoration committee Ghassan Tweini and the members of the committee Treasurer George Eseili, Michal Fernini, Engineer Oaul Jubeili, and Nabeel Azar.
There was admiration of what was accomplished, particularly in terms of preservation of the cathedral's heritage and revival of its history.
He emphasized that "this religious edifice will be, after completion of its restoration, one of the major heritage features and will thus attract visitors from all over Lebanon and the Arab world."
Lahud Renews His Call to Keep the Economic Affair Away From Political Exploitation and Personal Logic
He added: "The economic situations through which the country is passing makes this occasion an opportunity to emphasize the necessity of participation of all, laborers and employers, and political, economic, and social figures in the rising process, in close collaboration between the two sectors, public and the private, and not at the expense of one sector without the other, because the two sectors are partners."
"As also was our call to keep the economic affair away from political exploitation and linking it to the logic of personal profit and loss, instead of giving priority to the interests of the country and the subjects."
"We had to praise the role being performed by His Excellency from his position as the president of the fourteenth Arab summit, through the contacts with the Arab officials and the international references to confront the extermination campaign to which the Palestinian people are being exposed at the hands of the Zionist enemy in one of the most violent episodes of the gruesome serial continuing for more than five decades."
Lahud also received before noon a delegation from the organizing committee for the thirty-seventh medical conference for the Middle East, which is sponsored by the President of the Republic and which starts its proceedings tomorrow at the American University in Beirut. It was comprised of the Vice-President of the university for medical affairs and dean of the college of medicine Dr. Nadeem Qirtas, the conference chairman Dr. Ghazi Zaatari, the conference vice-chairman Dr. Ghassan Hamada, and the director of media and public relations in the American University Ibraheem Al-Khuri.
Hammoud received two calls from the Secretary-General of the Arab League Amr Moussa, during which they consulted about the development of the situation in the area, and about the ongoing contacts to hold a meeting of the delegates of the League's member states next Tuesday to develop a mechanism for the monitoring and moving committee as it was approved by the Beirut summit.
"And of course I sensed from Minister Hammoud every concern and appreciation, and he promised me that the Arab summit presidency will move to ensure the implementation of the Beirut summit decisions."
"It is known that we are demanding of Iraq the necessity for cooperation with the triple committee and the Red Cross, and there is no other mechanism to deal with this issue."
Meanwhile, the Secretary-General of the ministry received the Swedish Ambassador in Lebanon resident in Damascus, Viola Forfbeilka, in a protocol visit.
He added that the volume of the American commercial trade with the Arab world does not represent more than 3 percent of the overall American trade.
He expressed his objection to the oil embargo that has been adopted by Iraq. He announced that "the good convergence" is to move toward public opinion in the states in which that opinion influences the decision-makers, as "these states control the weapons, the equipment, and the means of making changes, and that is the only way for us to reach a balanced and fair view of what is happening in the Arab and Muslim states."

The Marunite Patriarch Cardinal Mar Nasralla Boutros Sfeer received in Bakraki yesterday a delegation from the Mikhyeer family presided over by Ghassan Mikhyeer, who said after the meeting: "The visit is to place the Patriarch in the atmosphere of the my candidacy for the orthodox seat in Al-Matn, which I had the honor to gain from the family of Mikhyeer and the friends of Dr. Mikhyeer and his current."
"The target in our point of view in this battle is the base of Dr. Mikhyeer, because the vacant seat is the seat of the opposing Dr. Albert Mikhyeer and not any other position."
He said: "My opinion is that the battle has become between the opposition and the opposition over the seat of Dr. Mikhyeer, and not over the seat of the Almer family present currently in the parliament in the person of representative Michal Almer."
He denied being the candidate of the state, emphasizing that "the influence on me of the state support will follow the example of the effect on Albert Mikhyeer in the recent elections. We antagonize whoever antagonizes us, and we support whoever supports us and thank him."

For that, this project is what creates the terms of homogeneity for relations, thaws all factors of dissension and dispersion, and establishes the capacity for progress and development.
Discussion took place concerning the bill that was prepared to amend this law and place the final touches on it from its drafting committee.
"What concerns us about it is the part related to the owners of free professions, those professions that have been affected more than others by stagnation, unemployment, and deterioration. The law came unjust to those affiliated with them such that it burdens them with a load they sink under, and they have no capacity to rise with it."
"- A socio-economic factor stemming from the deteriorated status quo and the necessity of taking it into consideration within the reasonable and the acceptable, meaning with fair amounts for the treasury and not burdensome to the payers."
"In addition to several factors for which there is no room to plunge in and elaborate, all of which ultimately end in supporting our point of view that it is imperative to make the required amendment that we developed jointly as association presidents a proposition bill with its demanding reasons. We have sent its text to the representatives, the association presidents, and other colleagues, pleading our representatives to give it their concern, approve it, submit it, and follow it up until it is sanctioned."
Lebanon and the world celebrates today Labor Day, and the General Laboring Union is organizing an oratory festival before noon on its premises.
It called for adoption of an industrial, agricultural, and service-productive policy that accommodates a large number of Lebanese laborers and for finalizing the issue of the presence of non-Lebanese labor as soon as possible, because it has become an element of competition for the Lebanese workforce and has driven it to the brink of starvation.

Montreal bade farewell days ago to the Canadian artist Jean Paul Royobil, who died at seventy-eight years of age.
A novel with the "and" conjunction from the first line, separated and linked with the "comma" and both matters are equal.
Elwia Subh is the author, and she is at the same time one of the characters inside the novel.
A life running like a river from a source to a mouth,
then fruits for the first time.
Many of its flowers
Accused of nostalgia for childhood: I knock.
But I
And did we really part? I
and in the depth it is an indivisible one.
Snow was falling thickly on the funeral followers of the late artist to the church on Papino Avenue in Montreal. They applauded at length as the coffin passed by, then silence prevailed in the snow-coated churchyard.
He was done justice by the positions of Quebec artists. The Parisian comrades of his track unanimously admitted to his significance as an artist in France, as he lived there for approximately forty years.
Walberg is the compiler of the introduction of the catalog that summarized the Canadian artist's works.
Jean Paul Riobil was born in Montreal in 1923 and spent most of his life in France (between 1949 and 1989) and in Paris, specifically.
Among his friends who also left their marks in their time: Jiaco Miti, Samuel Picket, Nicola Pustal, George Mathhew, Hartong, Zawah Wu-Ki, Faira Dasilva, and Joan Mitchell, the rich American woman with whom he lived for more than twenty-five years. Their relationship was tumultuous and stormy to the extent that it was said that author Edward Albee was inspired by them for the idea of his play "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"
There is an opportunity available today to discover his art in the Fine Arts Museum in Montreal and the Quebec museum (next autumn) where his major works will be exhibited.
Free and against selling obstinate
in the size of the palm
even if it is weighed in diamonds and rubies
If they cut open that passionate sufferer of your love
encircling your tender forearm and your severing forearm
And may the emaciated body be blessed when they inhume it in your breast
If the part of you that is not for sale becomes
The pomegranate of the heart
then we become everlasting, glorified, O Amman
leave for me the face of Amman as I loved it
Her arms, and the arms of a mother who suckled me her love.
If my mother dwells on the slope of the hill in "Naour"
Do not remove, from the face of Amman
The mosque plaza, Al-Bukhari markets
Its houses the roof of which is the "yard" of the other
staying late in its shades a boy
passing by all still hearts
do not fell the blooming trees
complaining the absence of one woman of the country folks!
the expanse of the valley, in the ring of chatters, is truly small
So let us drop
to identify the features that since years have dwelled
please.

It reminded of the "ugly history" of the Bureau in monitoring local affairs and its infringement of public freedoms before the issuing of the First Amendment of the Constitution.
Director of governmental affairs in the Council of American Islamic Affairs Jason Arb stated, "Mosques like other religious institutions are open before all Americans and have nothing to hide, but this must not be taken advantage of to use techniques to spy on religious minorities who are committed to legitimate activities."
He said: "The incidents of September 11 have truly changed the way our government works."
However, it came in an opinion poll that was conducted by the "USA Today" newspaper, the American CNN television network, and the Gallop Institute that Americans have become less optimistic about the war against terrorism, as only 40 percent of those included in it said that the United States and its allies will win; the percentage was two-thirds in January.
Moroccan Islamists Protest Participation of an Israeli Delegation; "New Approach" for International Socialism to Solve the Conflict in the Middle East
The representatives of the three parties talked in succession to confirm the agreement.
Al-Yusfi, the chairman of the Socialist Union of Popular Forces, delivered the opening speech. He condemned in it the endeavor of Israel "to subdue a people by force and eradicate its memory and existence."
Pursuant to the decision of the three parties, it has been agreed that "mutual recognition between the state of Israel and the state of Palestine as two states destined to live side by side, must be the initial starting point before starting negotiations between the two peoples."
The Army Lifts Emergency Status Off Two Kurdish Areas; Pressures Increase on Ajawid to Step Down Because of His Ailing Health
Ajawid, who was hospitalized twice in May, remains subject to the observation of physicians in his house, since his return to it on Monday.
But even the newspapers that for long explicitly supported the Prime Minister appealed to him to resign to preserve political stability.
Analysts fear that Ajawid's resignation might lead to a ministerial crisis that will require holding early elections that could hinder Turkey's efforts to emerge from a profound economic crisis.
Yesterday a group comprised of eight physicians examined Ajawid in his house for the period of an hour.
The newspapers also speculated that the Prime Minister has Parkinson's disease and another disease that causes weakness in the nerves.
Syrian newspapers published yesterday for the first time in the headings of their first pages news of the trial of the opposing Syrian Riyad Al-Turk that is taking place before the state security court with the charge of offending the constitution.
One of Al-Turk's attorneys said that such information "is a message of openness that promises a just ruling."
He faces a penalty that might reach permanent imprisonment.
He described his country as the "kingdom of silence," announcing that he will not feel real freedom except "when Syria shifts from tyranny to democracy."
Activists Welcome His Ratification of the Basic Law; Arafat Discussed Reform with Palestinian Factions
Arafat's advisor Nabeel Abu-Rudeineh emphasized that the Palestinian leader "continues to hold intensive consultations with all the forces regarding the forthcoming reforms and changes."
One of the leaders of the Islamic Resistance movement Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Ismail Hanniyah, stated, "A meeting was held on Thursday in Gaza between representatives of the Palestinian authority, the Fatah movement, and a delegation from Hamas presided over by the struggling Sheikh Ahmad Yasseen that 'included' discussion of a number of headlines and issues, among which was the question of forming the new Palestinian cabinet."
The Al-Jihad Al-Islami movement expected to hold a meeting with the Palestinian Authority and the Fatah movement for consultation about "the internal arrangements."
It "aims at managing the matters of the uprising, the daily living matters, and the struggle with the Israeli occupation."
Officials said that the basic law placed boundaries separating the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the Palestinian Authority.
He added that implementing the new law will assist in rebuilding the Palestinian judiciary system that was severely damaged by the Israeli military campaigns that destroyed the infrastructure, restricted the movement of judges, and postponed consideration of cases.
The European Commission prepared yesterday its strategy in the conflict in progress between it and the United States regarding the increase of fees on steel imports, threatening to launch the sanctions mechanism on June 18 without applying them immediately, hoping to reach an agreement with the Americans.
The source explained, "The issue to the European Union is related to reporting an increase in its custom duties on American products at a time no later than June 18 without realizing that immediately."
The European Union is given time ending on June 18 to make a decision regarding the mechanism of imposing sanctions, allowing it to increase its custom duties on some imported products.
He said: "If we reach an agreement with the Americans regarding compensations and exemptions, then we will not have to resort to imposing sanctions," indicating that "the European Union will take into consideration the negotiations in progress regarding the exemptions that will be granted by the Americans to the European steel industries."
Officials in the Organization reported that the European Union has 10 days to respond to the American request to hold consultations within a month.
Officials from the United Nations and others who are local completed yesterday the preparations for electing the representative of the southern states in the traditional "Loya Jerga" council of Afghan dignitaries that is assigned to choose a new interim government.
On separate days as of tomorrow, Sunday, four states will elect by ballot their representatives in the council of dignitaries that will be held from June 15 in Kabul.
After signing the agreement in Montreal with the international organization, he said, "Civil aviation has a vital role in reconstructing Afghanistan."
Before heading to Singapore to attend a conference on regional security, he said, "I am certain that additional requests will be presented" to send more forces.
Participating currently are approximately 150 men from the Australian special forces in Afghanistan, and approximately 80 aircraft from the Australian air force are stationed in Qirigistan to carry out refueling missions in the air.
Kenneth Ruth said in its name that "(President George) Bush's government cannot keep people in custody indefinitely without directing an accusation or send them to countries where they might be exposed to torture.... With the passing of time and as the number of detainees increases, the pressures on the American government also increase for it to move."
As evidence of improved relations between Washington and Khartoum, the American State Department appointed the seasoned diplomat Jeffrey Millington Chargé d'Affaires of the American embassy in Sudan succeeding Raymond Brown, and he like his predecessor will spend his time between Sudan and Kenya.
As to Millington, he emphasized his country's concern with achieving peace in Sudan in cooperation with the European Union and renewing its support for the initiative of the Governmental Board for Combating Drought And Desertification in East Africa and the African Horn (IGAD). He said that his country will work toward transferring the experience of cease-fire in the area of the Nuba mountains between the government and the Popular Army for Liberating Sudan to other areas in the south.
She explained that these areas are the states of Al Istiwaiyya, Bahr Al-Ghazal, and Aali El-Nil.
(Reuters, AP)
The elections, be they general or secondary, are an occasion to return to the popular will when this is able to express itself in freedom.
In Al Matin there is commotion.
But in spite of that, it is blank because it conceals what is truly political to the benefit of what is personal and temporal.
2- The strife between brothers, cousins, and relatives elicits pity and particularly when it is subjected to the factors of mutual curses, grudges, and scandals of every type and sort, and the loss falls on everyone without exception.
And this is a reality that cannot be denied by words of "arrogance" from here and there.
And here the "chief exile" is equal with the "chief regretful."
A last prayer: May Allah make them grow!
And how could three of the fighters for the public interest have lost in the context of the cellular privatization discussions the possibility of putting a separating line between the owner of authority and the opportunities of benefiting from the dedication of the state and the public liabilities?
Really, how could they have said the text that calls for separation of an official from the opportunities of authority abuse for personal interest is an unconstitutional text?
We do not know if those who fought and are fighting to drop the ranch status off Lebanon, and in their forefront are Al Husseini, Dhaher, and Harb, have recalled the slogan of: "From where did you get this?" which we hang like a vessel for deceptive decoration on the walls of the state that is submerged in plunder and thefts and to the degree that made us resort to privatization in attempts to lift the situation from collapse.
They can, of course.
"Ha'arts": Hezbollah Will Continue Its Military Operations Even if Withdrawal From the Farms Is Accomplished
"Supporting this position is the head of national security, General Uzi Dyan, who said to the newspaper, 'As long as the Golan Heights remain under Israel's control, then the Syrians will find a way to remind us of that.'"
"And although such a position is not good in the long term, upon considering the public interest we must not forget the fact that Syria is now on the way to entering a confrontation with the United States, as long as the war against terrorism continues."
"It was written on the signs carried by the demonstrators: Al Abbassia and Shiba farms will return to the homeland only by resistance."
He added: "But it seems that such estimation does not take into consideration the position of the party that on the Lebanese internal level lays a state of self-defense and is trying to preserve its importance."
"And that is the reason for which Lebanon deployed in recent months hundreds of soldiers and elements along the length of the borders. They have established barricades and have detained Palestinian elements that were intending to carry out operations against Israel."
We apologize in advance that the intention is not the Al Matin elections.
For ultimately not more than nine million voters went to the polls and the results revealed the victory of the National Liberation Front that ruled the country for approximately 30 years of the majority of seats, while the Democratic Assembly party who enjoys majority in the current parliament came in second.
And that is not little.
In this sense the war has not ended yet or at least has not ended to a result that satisfies the Algerians, which means a convincing formula of accord for which they can present sacrifices.
It is remote that the Algerians do not want a solution for their problems, regardless of differences in their opinions and affiliations.
Minister of Defense Adopts Minister of Interior's Warning about Al-Matin; Bakraki Calls for Voting Attendance with "Patriotic Responsibility"
As to former secretary-general of the Communist Party George Hawy, he responded with a vengeance to the threats by the Minister of Interior to him warning of its consequences.
The Marunite Patriarchy
In that context, the candidate Ghassan Mikhyeer and the head of the Lebanese National Bloc party Carlos Iddah will hold a joint press conference today.
Questions to General Oun
Much was said, much was written, and we remained silent, the defamation increased, the gossip multiplied, and we remained silent.
Enough defamation for an "isolated cell" that they attack on the eve of every election event.
Who is the occupier?
Or does he mean by his words the Tashnaq party that maintained the inhabited and residential areas with its diligence and sacrifices, and the authority represented by the presidency of the republic, the presidency of the parliament, and the presidency of the cabinet that has expended everything in its capacity after the Al Taif agreement to set the bases of democracy and dialogue?
Has the General forgotten that the Armenians have in Lebanon a role more important than the election events?
To General Oun and Representative Naseeb Lahud, we say: Politics is a science and art, for politics does not mean degradation or defamation.
And it is enough of expressing one time as an isolated cell and another time as a ghetto, and as a digression we ask both the General and the representative: If the Armenian citizens had voted or were to vote for the opposition, would the description of the isolated cell and the ghetto remain applicable?
Has the General become recognizant today of the authority that he once considered illegitimate?
Departure from Lebanon is not the way to save and salvage it, General.
The upper council of the party held its weekly meeting yesterday, presided over by Douri Shamoun, and issued a statement that included:
"Therefore, all attempts at dialogue were aborted, and before them the national settlement and accord that aggravated the crises, and ahead of them the crises of confidence that we live."
"2- We renew the demand for revealing the obscurities of the Engineer Ramzi Eirani crime and his killing, and imposing the severest penalties on its perpetrators."
The Test in Al Matin
The voter has awareness if he demonstrated: logic in his thinking, care for his dignity, independence in his choice, ambition in his aspirations, loyalty to his country, and concern for his area and the future of his children.
Are those the leaders who will prepare for us a promising future and a blooming spring?
The slogans they release are a factor of misleading and maneuver.
For there they are adopting means of extremism instead of moderateness and the logic of maneuver instead of transparency.
Exclusivity of decision is dictatorship and abandoning allies is betrayal.
With the magic of a magician they recognize the legitimacy of the state and decide to participate in the elections.
All of that for the sake of shattering a person who advocates accord, not strife, and unity, not division.
The opposition challenged the voter in his independence because it overlooked harmony, understanding, and aspirations.
And what salvation and rescue await us?
The Lebanese Society for Democratic Elections: The Law Confirms the Requirement of the Secret Chamber
"Law number 144 issued on 5/6/1992 rescinded the first clause of Article 15 of the employees law that prohibited an employee from practicing political affairs, joining political parties, carrying the emblem of a party, etc. However, the rescission of this clause pursuant to the amendment that occurred in 1992 aimed at not depriving the employee of his legitimate right to express his political opinions, and that is a constitutionally warranted right within the framework of applicable laws and systems, and particularly via association with political parties and societies."
"b- The Society regrets what was said by the Minister of Interior that using the isolator (the secret chamber) is optional in voting, and the Society states the following:"
"c- The threats that were directed by the Minister of Interior to arrest a number of politicians concerned with the elections in the northern Al Matin area are very serious and can diffuse an atmosphere of terror and fear on the eve of the election day, which might discourage the voters from participating in the voting and the representatives of candidates from monitoring them and threatens accordingly the soundness of the elections and their freedom and fairness."
"And from that starting point we announce the following:"
"His assassination has led to increased anxiety of the expatriates with all the effects that have on their motion toward Lebanon on the economic level or on the social level."
"His killing has led to the escalation of fear among a section of the Lebanese and their relatives in the expatriation, particularly since Mr. Hedeiqa was not in the state opposition square."
"We also wish for the establishment of peace and stability in the south and for the return of its people from all Lebanese lands and from beyond the borders."
"And accordingly, we address our call for a comprehensive and just solution for the Palestinian issue under international legitimacy."
Even if they squash under their feet the orthodox (the owners of the seat) and all of the Christians and on top of them the Marunites.
- Who allowed you to exploit Qornat Shahwan?
Who decided that this battle is a battle against the President of the Republic?
And the greatest evil is the war of those leaders, one against the other, after the elections on the day when the drums wane and the lovers disperse.
As to the close contacts of Syria and those who swallow their tongues sometimes, those are among you and your partners, and regretfully Syria esteems them and receives them and you envy them, but the people do not respect them.
And how I wish that you win for constructive and reasonable opposition, and that you win for the reputation of the Christians, particularly the Marunites, some leaders of whom want to show them to the world as if they were retarded people.
President of the Republic received yesterday at Ba'abda Palace, MP Marwan Faris, accompanied by members of the Higher Emigrant Committee of the Syrian National Socialist Party. They informed him of the preparations underway by the Party to convene the Expatriates Conference on the 21st of next July in Beirut, which will include representatives of expatriates of the world. It will pave the way for the convention of the 12th international conference of the Expatriates League on the 25th, 26th and 27th of July.
The delegation included national expatriate and former ambassador Fouad Ghandour, Mansour Azar, Farouq Abu Judeh, Qasem Saleh, Jamil Rajeh and Jihad Al Aqel.
President of the Arab Dentists' Union and Union Leader of the Hashemite, Kingdom Dr. Ahmad Al Qaderi, also spoke and presented the President of the Republic with the congratulations of the participating delegations on the 2nd anniversary of the liberation.
The Communist Party answered some of what came in the interview of Elias Al Murr with the "Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation" the night before last, especially with regard to the Party, considering it rude and explicit interference in the side elections of Al Matn, and exceeds "the necessity for objectivity and impartiality imposed by his position".
At this time we consider it a side battle not separate from the ongoing political struggle in Lebanon and Al Matn.
It seems strange, above all this, even if we are not surprised, that explicit and public threats are issued by a responsible minister, a lawyer, against citizens who practice their democratic right guaranteed to them by the constitution in an election battle, on the pretext they are preparing to "create problems".
We were and still are calling for the reform of the political system, and initiators on the basis of our national position to correcting the relationship with Syria, and establishing it on the basis of respecting the sovereignty, independence and special relations within a framework of comprehensive confrontation to the Zionist-American project.
Solana Promised to Inform Officials of the Truth About the Israeli Position
They added that Lebanon took its time in taking any position on participating in any international conference before finding out its criteria, frameworks and topics.
They explained that those familiar with the atmosphere that prevailed in Solana's talks in Ba'abda, Ein Al Teineh, Qreitem and Bustrus concluded that there is no single Lebanese understanding of what he wants.
They said Solana believes, in answer to questions of the officials in Lebanon, that there is American movement in the right direction to push the political process of peace.
But if there is agreement on its topics, date and location of convention, it can convene on the level of foreign minister aides in an initial stage to start discussions and exchange points of view.
Condemnation Statements Authority
As for the Middle East, it was not one of the direct priorities on the agenda of the Bush and Putin's negotiations, and was spoken of in passing, from the angle of the expression of the American President of his fears that Russia will supply Iran with nuclear weapons.
And one of the first duties of President Arafat and the National Authority is to hasten to issue condemnation statements of these attacks even before the Israeli statements are issued in this regard.
That is the situation of the current American administration that seems in a state of permanent internal struggle with the self over the policy that must be adopted towards what is going on in the region, especially the daily side-effects of the Palestinian-Israeli struggle.
Despite the fact that such a saying is polite courage from Arafat, it is a mistake that led and will lead to diluting accountability.
Or is the object the required service of the security of Israel and the Israelis, and consequently the Americans?
If coexistence has prevailed in the relations of the factions in their different beliefs during the past period, the coming days have new facts and beliefs that are completely different than those in the past.
First Investigation Judge in Beirut, Hatem Madi, continued his investigations in the kidnapping and murder of Engineer Ramzi Eirani, and listened to five eyewitness statements.
A report said that a collision occurred between a Mercedes driven by Ali Mustafa and a motorcycle driven by Saleh Al Otah (22 years) which led to the death of Saleh.

Political, party and union dignitaries participated.
Two of them symbolize life, carved with two peacocks drinking water.
A discussion about the beauty of the paintings and places to put them took place.
Work on it will end in a few weeks.
Qandeel and Bashshour spoke at the meeting, along with Palestinian National Council member Fathi Abu Al Ardat on behalf of the Palestinian Unions, and handed over memorandums to the officer in charge of media at the United Nations Office in Beirut Najib Freiji, which were addressed to the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Anan.

Mousa Inaugurated First Cedar Forest in the South: Civilized Answer to Residues Israel Mousa "Environment Day"
At the end, everyone moved to the cedar forest where Mousa, Azar and Abu Aqel planted a cedar tree. Then, they inspected the forest and examined the phase that was completed in it.
Seminar in Rashayya on the Problem of Mines; Hrawi Overviewed Used Measures; Qablan scolded the Money
The forum was held at the Hall of Educationalist Dhaher Al Ma'alouli in Rashayya.
At the international conference, we convened and established four committees: one for taking care of awareness, the second for bringing in aid from abroad to help the injured, the third to bring aid for the army, and a fourth to bring in aid from abroad for social development."
Al Rayyes said: "We are still in the first phase of dealing with victims of the mines, and we are coordinating with the National Office."
With a simple comparison and more than 25 years after Vietnam's liberation, there are two thousand injuries annually because of American mines, as we have. The matter needs a large workshop to stop this depletion and so that we can, after many years, remove the mines."
The other matter is that all limbs injured by mines and other Israeli attacks are assembled at the expense of the South Council. The third matter: during the past ten years, lump sum compensation was provided to the injured for injury or disability that reaches the limits of 19 million liras for anyone who loses any of his limbs. That matter is fixed in our files.
The matter needs a field workshop, because we have had enough costly conferences and forums. This money, if it is available, should go to the required place," Deputy Ghanem asked the Minister of Defense: "Are there no programs to remove political mines in the country?"
The meeting was held at the Grand Lectures Hall with a number of the Association Council's members and female lawyers attending.
Masoud Nader expressed her "gratefulness for Shadid's efforts to raise the level of the Association to the highest level, and to keep the Association elevated and liberated from any restraints".
In turn, she commended Masabki "the pioneer in being involved in the Association's work and practicing the trade 50 years ago, in addition to her journalistic and cultural activity that was crowned with her novel that deserved three appreciation rewards in France".
She went back in memory to the age of fifteen when she dreamed of becoming a lawyer "and my father died and I had to help my mother and continue my education. I found a job in one of the municipalities while I enrolled in the Jesuit University and obtained a degree in law.
Finally, Association President Shadid spoke, saying: "I am a champion of women, I support her, I want her at the forefront, and I believe in her as a mother, a sister, a daughter, a mate and a worker.
He praised the characteristics of "our friend and colleague Masabki".
He said: "When I was elected, I promised a program, part of which I implemented and whose results will show in due time."
I was surprised that this writer committed morphological and grammatical mistakes that could not be believed by anyone.
It transcended it to eliminating the letter ya' from names and words, and replacing it with alef maqsoura, so that the name "Hilmy", for example, becomes "Hilma" and the name "Ali" becomes "Ala".
"Al muhamoon" is written as "muhameen" and "mustashpha" is feminine instead of being masculine. The letter"L" has no existence in their dictionary, except for a few, who graduated from French schools, such as Rushdi Abaza, Jamil Ratib and Sana'a Jamil.
* An official at the Al Hazimyyah Municipality confirmed that in two weeks at the latest, the streets - subject of the complaint - will be paved and that the delay is due to a crisis that will be resolved soon in providing asphalt.
He wondered how a company could set conditions for obtaining a bill, especially since he has subscribed to it and it has his file and all the necessary information about him.
He pointed out that the amount of five dollars is set because the owner of the complaint has not subscribed to the monthly detailed bill service, which costs two dollars a month.
Preemptive Strike?
More importantly, perhaps he pushed the American Congress to increase its military aid to Israel to face the dangers of the Iranian land-land "Shihab 3" missiles that can reach any point in Israel.
As Israel does not accept the principle of any other country in the Middle East obtaining nuclear ability monopolized by it alone since the year 1963.
The commentator says that the real danger is loading the said missile with nuclear warheads, adding, "according to the information available to us, the main assistance Iran obtains comes from Russia.
The writer believes that the best way to stand in the face of Iran's obtaining of nuclear capability is to depict the line resulting from that as a threat to Russia and the United States, as it is a threat to Israel.
All of this requires radical change in the Israeli deterrence theory based on monopolizing the nuclear ability in the region.
2- In a varied society, the administration, specifically, constitutes the bridge through which reconciliation occurs between the citizen and the regime, and therefore legitimacy is built, grows and is enhanced, overcoming initial loyalties, that are all legitimate but certainly not conflicting.
In the tax field, especially, the renewal of trust in governments is necessary, through providing the feeling in citizens that taxes are distributed equally, and so is collection and assignment.
We discuss the subject through the following points.
To provide these interests the laws give them the right to impose fees equal to their services, and additionally they utilize taxes to provide the balance of their payments.
But without completely succeeding in his mission.
In every "missile" experiment, the inciting Israeli talk, about the danger of the Iranian armament of it escalated to Washington and the other Western capitals, , despite the fact that the farthest range of these missiles does not exceed three hundred kilometers, while the Israeli side owns what is farther in range, in addition to weapons of mass destruction, before the eyes and ears of all the world's capitals.
On the eve of the elections, the battle seemed heated, contrary to the previous cycle that witnessed a harmonious list that led to the election of the former council, especially with the declaration of a single list headed by former Union Leader Muwaffaq Al Yafi, which includes Ali Al Jarmaqi, Anis Qansouh, Nash'at Abed and George Mubayyed. Meanwhile, individual nominations were registered for Fawzi Hamdan, Antoine Abu Suleiman, George Zakhour and Elie Rizqallah.
- Nash'at Abed (Druze seat).
By Violette Al Bal'ah:
President of the "Lebanese-Russian Friendship Society", Jack Sarraf, revealed a visit of a Russian economic delegation to Lebanon next month, highlighting the importance of this movement in enhancing economic cooperation and investment between the two countries.
He spoke about the problem of entry visas of Russians into Lebanon, which he had raised with Minister Bishara Mirhej last week, stressing that he is "seeking, with officials, to find solutions for it."
The Union said in a statement that the two sides "insisted on the continuation of cooperation in handling all issues to maintain the interest of patients and rights of citizens, and in service of everyone's interest.
Communication skills consultant, Zein Ghanma, lectured in the course and 20 employees from 12 banks participated.
The delegation is scheduled to visit the Prime Minister next Wednesday.
Salameh said in his conversation about the policy of currency stability that "The Central Bank faced difficulties in providing this policy due to the budget deficit and the public debt, which constituted two elements of pressure on the currency market. But, he was able, through successive procedures and various acts of financial engineering, to have enough to ensure the continuation of this policy, and there are no expectations to change it".
He pointed out the existence of two opinions in the country, one is pessimistic and skeptical whatever procedures are taken, and the other is optimistic that a launch is possible. He highlighted that Lebanon "did not activate its abilities yet, and even if most of its income is from non-resident Lebanese, it at the same time did not abandon these capabilities which were, for example, similar to what happened in Argentina."
He stressed on the other hand the strength and safety of the banking sector, and its distance from pessimistic scenarios.
He considered that the style of changing the debt from the lira to the dollar is new, expecting that the Bank of Lebanon will receive deposits, whose value he has not determined, next June, "that will contribute to improving its dollar situation."
The Board convened its period meeting headed by Abboud, with the members in attendance, and presented "ways of activating the implementation of the bilateral trade agreement signed with Iraq".
Yesterday, the following clarifying statement was issued: "To defend our national causes and rights is a holy duty that we must work for with firmness and faith, but in return, we must watch every step we take in this direction so that we do not cause damage to the national economy, and they do not reflect negatively on the citizen and society.
Foresight and acting responsibility are what is needed from us in this critical stage.
What is required is being victorious over closure for constant spiritual rejuvenation.
From these starting points Father Dr. Yousef Muwannas participated in the Libyan Dialogue Conference that was convened in Libya to discuss issues of Christian - Muslim dialogue, on initiative from the Islamic - Christian Calling College in Libya, and the Papal Pontifical Council for Christian - Muslim Dialogue. Its valuable interjections were entitled "The Basis of Christian - Muslim Dialogue and the Contemporary Issues of Media and Development."
In addition to three indices according to subject, names of editors and sources.
This troublemaking muscle, that prefers noise to silence, acquired characteristics and names that do not belong, in essence, to its significance.
The true profession of this pretentious heart is no different than the profession of the porter or carriers in ports, despite the fact that the porter does not pretend to have written a divine comedy or that he has discovered the stability of the sun and the rotation of the earth. The claim is done by the heart; it is an indicator of love, a store of faith, and the subject of the soul.
The most wronged is the liver, this isolated superior silent being. As it does not make the noise the heart does, like the brain, it suffered negligence and scorn, and that is why in the Arab language the verb toil is derived, which is reference to the suffering and torment issued by the liver.
From the movement of the heart that is called beating, the heart's name became the beater, despite the fact that the act of beating is given to any process of mixing eggs with water ... the porter is a porter ...
The more we put the claim of the heart to the test, we discover its blackmail, origin, and low value. It does not stop, in return, inflating (let us remember, also, that one of the heart's handicaps is inflation, it is said the inflation of the heart, which is the disease which caused the death of poet Abul Qassem Al Shabbi!), pretending and arrogance, only because it provides organs with nutrition.
52 Doctors Graduated from American University; Franjieh: Your Role Elevated Level of Profession
Are we on the way to be killed by the pollution we made by ourselves for ourselves, the disintegration of the family, the amazing distancing in the shadow of globalization between what is prevalent and what is subjugated and the spread of human massacres all over the earth, especially in our region.
He pointed out that the graduates will start their professional lives at a stage that is witnessing many developments and challenges with significance in the field of medicine. He asked them not to stop at the study stage and constantly continue all scientific and medical changes.
The speech of the ceremony host Minister Franjieh said: "Lebanon, who is proud of its doctors, knows full well that we in this field suffer from satiety.
Here comes your role, as specialist doctors and scientific organizations, in helping to implement the health policy produced by the Ministry because the economic situation that Lebanon is going through does not allow squandering our limited capabilities."
President of the Center, Henry Zugheib, introduced the lecture, stressing the importance of memory that "is restored exactly like archeological buildings.
A group of jealous youth from Aleppo established the Friends of Aleppo Castle Association on 2nd of August 1924, and then amended its name in 1926 to the Friends of the Castle and Museum, and they worked on establishing a museum in the castle hall.
He presented the history of Aleppo, that is considered one of the oldest cities still inhabited.
Of the activities of the Association, some are issuing the "Antiquities" magazine and the annual book "Aleppo antiquities", weekly lectures, monthly forums and annual conferences on Aleppo's archeology and that of other cities.

The Organization on the other hand has international teams to interfere in emergency cases where they work during natural disasters and armed conflicts.
The references in the process of offering services is the Organization headed by Sahnawi, and "Malta - Lebanon", which is a French organization, along with the French Healing Institutions that had a basic role in the presence of the Organization in Lebanon.
He said: "The sovereign Malta Organization is a unique organization headed by a greater master who is elected for life.
And as each state has a Minister's Council, the Malta Organization has a council called "it has ten positions, four of which are senior positions, they are: Ministry of Finance headed by Marquez Janlouka Kiavari, Ministry of Foreign and Internal Affairs headed by Count Jack De Lidkerk, Ministry of Health headed by "Royal Supervisor" Albright Khreiher Von Blasger, and the officer in charge of spiritual affairs "Royal Supervisor" Farra Ludwig Hoffman Von Romer Shtein (...)
Hospitality in Iran ... and Other Things
Good hospitality was clear in what the Iranian government provided for the guests participating in the conference, including accommodation at the best Tehran hotels, trips organized to most Iranian cities (Mashhad, Tabriz and Esfahan), accommodation in them in their best hotels, and visits to their most important landmarks.
One of the men of religion participating in this conference, who is of the scientific shrine in Qom city, expressed the opinion of Islamic shari'a on the subject, that the rights of the author, like any other financial or moral rights, are protected according to shari'a principles.
Aside from this beautiful wide expansive place and the civilized airs, what also draws attention is the immense turnout by the Iranians to visit the exhibition and buy books. Tens of thousands come to it daily, and you see them leave burdened with what they are carrying.

How we need honest witnesses who leave illuminated documents on Lebanon in the second half of the twentieth century for our coming generations, so that the true Lebanese memory will not be lost in the mazes of those who are defeated and surrender to something other than the Lebanese entity in spirit, thought and heritage.
And congratulations to our great colleague, George Skaf, on the publication of his complete writings, supervised, verified and accepted by him (from the Lebanese whiff in his analysis, to the literary whiff in "The Bells of Nostalgia Valley", "Symbols of Poetry and "Our Orchard at Elleen", to the political readings), which makes the group among the most precious of what we treasure for our children in Lebanon's future memory.

The newspaper reported a senior Palestinian source saying that even if the plan is not implemented, merely presenting it for discussion means the Palestinians have realized that Arafat can no longer escape the international pressure that is exerted on him by maneuvering as he did before.

And that the official in the State Department, Aaron Miller, one of the old members in the crew of the peace negotiations from the days of President Bill Clinton, presented the plan to Powell to implement the speech.

But the restriction of the Party's activity in the farmlands area and the limiting of its threats against Israel to the bombing of settlements and cities with long range missiles that the Party obtained from Iran after the withdrawal, with words, made the situation on the northern borders within a new "status quo" based on one or two operations undertaken by the Party against concentrated and controlled bombing of the Party's positions that could have been evacuated, which does not usually result in the fall of victims by the two sides.

After the Northern Alliance took over power, last with the help of American air raids, December, their fate seemed unknown. But the government of Karzai, concerned with reconstructing Afghanistan and ending the past's conflicts, said they could continue their studies.
He said that the investigation had not resulted so far in identifying the identity and nationality of the suicidal man, pointing out that the car was booby-trapped in an "advanced" manner and equipped with more than a ton of explosives outside Afghanistan.
In Washington, an official at the Central Intelligence Agency "the CIA" who refused to state his name said that some members of the bodyguard of "Al Qaeda" leader Osama bin Laden are among hundreds of fundamentalist fighters detained in an American Marines base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.

Indian Minister of Defense George Fernandes said Monday that Bin Laden is alive and that he lives in a hideout in Pakistan, which is a matter that was met with immediate denial from Islamabad.
The Egyptian "Middle East News" Agency reported the Under Secretary of the Foreign Ministry, Director of the Egyptian President's Office for Political Affairs Dr. Osama El Baz said that "allowing the division of a country like Sudan in to two parts will be a contagious phenomenon that could spread to other neighboring countries on a tribal, linguistic or religious basis."
He was scheduled to meet with Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, but this meeting did not take place and there was no explanation for canceling it.
Sudanese Charge d'Affaires in Nairobi Ahmad Dardiri stated: "What the (Popular Army for the Liberation of Sudan) said has no basis for truth."
He denied reports of aid agencies in the area that said military helicopter planes and "Antonov" bombers are supporting the militias and government troops on the ground.
The attackers belong to a group that changed its loyalty repeatedly during the civil war, based on unconfirmed information.

House of Deputies in Turkey Votes for Early Elections

Prison for Former Minister and 30 People in Biggest Corruption Scandal in Egypt; "Muslim Brothers"
In the year 2001, the Court of Cassation cancelled the verdicts issued in June 2000 to imprison the defendants from one to 15 years.
The scandal became public in the year 1995 when President of the Board of Directors of the "Nile Bank", Issa Ayouti, sued his daughter Aliyya, one of three women charged in the case.
In July the trial of 20 defendants in the embezzlement of 1.4 billion Egyptian pounds case (302 million dollars) started before the State Security Court.
The statement said that "the Egyptian government charged its security departments with pursuing people of opinion and intellect in Egypt and silencing all voices (...) It is a pity that at the top of the accusations directed at university professors were seeking to incite public opinion and move it in support of the Palestinian cause."
Ramallah - from Mohammad Hawwash:
He renewed the Authority's rejection of any conditions to receiving the funds held by Israel, which are a Palestinian right and not subject to any negotiations, conditions, or any form of outside monitoring.
A Palestinian source who requested anonymity explained to "An Nahar" yesterday that Israel issued the amounts due to the Palestinian Authority under pressure at the Security Council, the international Quartet and the international efforts seeking to reduce the forms of economic and military siege before the withdrawal from the Palestinian cities.
Justice Department Investigates Accounts of "America On Line" Company
It added: "In the current climate, where everyone is raising questions about accounting, it is not surprising that the concerned government agencies want to view the facts."
He was in charge of this company before it merged with "Time Warner" and before it was transformed into the largest institution in the United States in internet services, which is the period the investigators are showing interest in.
Last week, the founders of the "Adelphia Communications" Company were detained and charged of stealing deposits from the company's steel safes.
Observers said that there is no evidence yet that the accounts of "America On Line Time Warner" are inaccurate, but the fears of an expansion in the investigations led to a decrease in the value of its stock.
The Crime that Reveals the Defect
It is our belief that the future has many surprises in store for us in this file.
Of course there are exaggerations in showing the feelings of repression of Christians, but the policies followed in the country do not contribute to weakening them, but increasing them, despite the fact that the social, economic and political oppression is a reality for all Lebanese without exception.
And so the current barricades between the Lebanese do not offer anything but more mortgaging to local organized looting, following the outside which rules in actuality, the mutual readiness to take advantage of coexistence, scientific and cultural shallowness, and the pathetic "conviction" with living in the shadow of the general state of general deterioration on all levels.
Ali Hamadeh
Why terror?
According to the Hollywood imagination, the situation could be visualized as two trains going as fast as possible to collide at a specific point.
Second: Minister of Interior Elias Al Murr, who in turn shows increasing tendency towards the diplomacy of the light tone and the abundant, will use it as a basis for success.
The explosion that occurred inside the cafeteria of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem captured the interest of the Israeli newspapers yesterday.
In the newspaper's opinion, "it was difficult for the Palestinian organization in the past six months and during the implementation of the Israeli army military operation to undertake new attacks. The heavy presence of Israeli troops on the West Bank areas inside the cities and around them, in addition to the siege, made the movement of "saboteurs" very difficult.
On the Lebanese front, the "Maariv" newspaper quoted yesterday a senior Israeli source as saying that extremely important developments effected the communications taking place between Israel and "Hizbollah" with regard to solving the problem of Israeli prisoners Alehanan Tananboim and the three soldiers imprisoned by the Party.
Among the striking comments published by "Haartz" yesterday was the article written by reserve Brigadier General Aharon Le Bern who in the past was one of the officials in the military intelligence department, and he is working today in the field of strategic research.
Iran patronized a strategic arm for it in Lebanon, which is "Hizbollah", the terrorist organization responsible for killing hundreds of soldiers and American citizens in Lebanon and outside it, which constitutes an unlimited danger to the area and the West.
It is possible to subjugate "Hizbollah" in various ways.
8 Killed, 5 Injured at Teachers' Fund Center and Financial Explanations of the Crime; Who protects the People from Unrestrained Weapons?
In any case, and pending the clarification of several aspects of the crime, Director of the Fund Rachel Rahmeh Sa'adeh, Maria Thabet, Maron Mousa, Sukainah Harqous (teacher), Salman Abdullah Al Jamous, Yvette Faghali, Mousa Shweiri (head of an establishment) and Carlos Salameh were all killed yesterday.
After he completed his crime, he lit up a cigarette and tried to escape, but detectives who coincidentally were passing by hurried when they heared the gun shots and surrounded the building. They waited for the perpetrator at the front gate where he turned himself in to them."
At a later time, information revealed that the perpetrator asked five months ago for a 14 million- lira -loan to deal with his very large debt dues.
In the court, Ahmad Mansour said he executed the crime willfully "and I was not pushed by anyone to do it".
He said that no one enticed him and no one knew he was determined to kill, "and I have nothing to hide".
As for Minister of Interior Elias Al Murr he considered that "the spread of weapons in the hands of civilians is a problem many countries suffer from, and that this matter must be handled in Lebanon".
The State Security Court in Syria issued harsh verdicts for economist Aref Dalilah and Dr. Walid Al Bunni charged with attempting to change the constitution and inciting armed disobedience. It sentenced the first to ten years and the second to five.
Lawyers explained that the court depended on conversations taped secretly in prison as evidence against Al Bunni.
The defendants were also convicted for 'inciting armed disobedience", "spreading false news that weakens the state of the nation" and "spreading news that weakens trust in the national economy".
These verdicts are the harshest against the opposition figures who were detained last summer.
He called for linking economic and political reforms, and transparency in the management of the economy.
The Saudi Arabian News Agency, "SANA", reported that the court interrogated three other defendants, retired teacher Hasan Sa'doun, Eng. Fawwaz Tillo and Dr. Kamal Libwani who were also detained last summer.

We notice with amazement the repeated attempts by Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri to impose a status quo:
Experience has proven in Lebanon, like abroad, that economic stability is certainly related to maintaining the monitoring ability of the state, providing the conditions for correct competition and expanding the base of contributors, and that privatization is not turned into a monopoly transaction that endangers the interests of the people, economic stability and even the state's sovereignty over public services.
What is strange is that the complaint, filed by the Minister of Communications to the Financial General Prosecution through the Cases Commission at the Ministry of Justice over a month ago, is attached to the Audit Bureau report. This complaint has not reached the Financial General Prosecution yet.
Baqardoni: We Agree with Al Qurneh on the Objectives and Disagree on Internal charging and Hostility to Syria
Baqardoni directed his talk to the Brigades saying "You are the real children of the founder and the honest children of the institution.
First: Demand the Minister of Interior to take measures to prevent the use of the name "brigades" and all that is derived from it, or similar to it, or taken from it, and effecting the severest punishment against violators, in accordance with the memo presented to him on 7/16/2002.
We respect the other, and we listen to him and interact with him.
From the position of dialogue and resolution we extend an open hand to the opposition, especially at the "Qurnet Shahwan Meeting", a strong hand to the rule and the government.
We offered martyr after martyr, the last of whom was our comrade Tony Ba'kaloony; we offered absentee after absentee, the last of whom was our comrade Boutrus Khould.
As for the performance of the government it has not provided national interests, nor balance in representation or balanced development.
Calls for Diplomatic and Information Movement; Israel Marketing Itself in Washington as "Policeman" in the Region to Fight Terrorism
He suggested that Bush has started to become convinced of the proposal which is the focus of discussions in the American administration. There are supporters, rejecters and there are others who are reserved, in view of its negative reflections on the Arab states. They said, when probed unofficially for their reactions, that they strongly reject charging Israel with such a mission, at a time when it is still in serious military conflict with the Palestinians.
While anything contrary to that reflects on opening the door wide to wider confrontations whose results no one can predict.
He hinted that an American test of this proposal is currently taking place with the Palestinians, with evidence that the killing of civilians with American made planes is allowed, and so is the economic siege and starving people.
Lebanon celebrates Army Day today, and a central celebration will be held at the Al Fayyadieh Barracks during which officers will graduate.
At the Benoit Barakat Barracks in Tyre, Position Commander Staff Colonel Ismail Hamdan read the "Order of the Day" before a group of officers, then he received holiday well-wishers, and thanked the media for their support of the Lebanese army "that is the fence of the nation and the address of its strength and unity."
In the north, a celebration was held at the northern military regional command in the Bahjat Ghanem Barracks headed by Regional Command Brigadier Ramzi Abu Hamzeh representing Major General Suleiman. Governor of the North Nasif Qalloush, the Mufti of Tripoli and the North Taha Al Sabunji, Bishops Bolus Bandali, Yohanna Fouad Al Hajj and Francis Al Beisari, Tripoli Shari'ah Judge Sheikh Malik Al Sha'ar, Appeals District Attorney in the North Judge Rimon Oweidat, President of the Intelligence Department in the Syrian forces working in the North Brigadier Mohammad Khallouf, Tripoli Mayor Samir Sha'rani and officers participated in it.
The "National Islamic Forum" declared that it will conduct the necessary communications with the Islamic groups "to explain the national goals of the Forum and the steps planned to be taken to enhance the internal front, on the basis of considering this initiative a first step towards a comprehensive national forum that fortifies the national front in confronting the waves of extremism that threaten the security and stability of the country."
At the end of the meeting, the Secretary General of the Forum Al Mufti Al Sabunji read the following resolutions:
The Forum would like to remind all on this occasion that coincides with the anniversary of the establishment of the brotherly Syrian army as well, of the current cooperation experience between the two brotherly armies and the sacrifices of the brotherly Syrian forces in order to deepen the basis of security and stability in the Lebanese territories in implementation of the initiative of the late President Hafiz Al Assad.
After the meeting Al Sabunji was asked for his comment on the member of the "Qurnet Shahwan Meeting" member Samir Franjieh saying that the members of the "Islamic Assembly" are moved by Syria. He answered: "We are moved by our feelings of nationalism, Arab Identity and morals, and we ask Samir Franjieh who moves him internally and externally?"
This is completely rejected; it is even rejected in the Al Ta'if agreement that established the new constitution.
We are against any kind of sectarian talk and extend our hands to all parties for dialogue.
* Deputy George Nijm: "We hope that the hopes of the Lebanese will be accomplished with the liberation of Shaba'a Farmlands, and the army remains the strong arm for the unity of Lebanon."
The Public Relations Division of the Internal Security Forces distributed the following notice: "In addendum to our previous notice regarding taking traffic measures on the occasion of Army Day that will be held at the Shukri Ghanem Barracks - Al Fayyadieh on the morning of Thursday 1/8/2002, and due to the possibility of the occurrence of traffic jams on the following roads: Al Hadath - Gallery Sama'an Road, Gallery Sama'an - Chevrolet, Jisr Al Basha - Al Sayyad - Ba'abda Crossroads, Mar Mikhail - Gallery Sama'an, Ba'abda Crossroads - Gallery Sama'an,
Israeli military air force jets flew yesterday over the southern skies and were confronted with resistance anti-aircraft missiles.
While edges of the Bastra farm, Shanouh, "Bawwabet Hassan" and Birket Bi'tha'il were subjected to Israeli heavy artillery rounds.
When Sukarno assumed the rule in Indonesia, he wanted his country to be in the ranks of the advanced countries. He knew that the nature of democratic system is the reason of the advancement of these countries, and the constituents of this system are based on multiple parties and free competition to reach power and work on achieving the wishes of the people.
After the passing of several years in this state, chaos spread, damage increased, a climate of terror prevailed and the country reached the brink of a civil war. So Suhartu executed a military coup to stop the tribal conflict and bring back stability to the country.
It is said that the Lebanese government made a grave mistake when it allowed party members to enter public office.
The Imam wanted the Movement to be a democratic movement in action and practice, not a movement of an individual and reconciliation; for the attendees not to believe that the institution is the image of the president and who the president wants; that the movement is from him, for him, and to him, and all he wants is obedience to feel that everyone without him; and that the leader knows everything and is able in his party to do everything.
And so it was.
The tragedy of remaining silent towards the sectarian practice that is tearing up the body of the homeland.
Inauguration of Joint Halaba-Tripoli Transport Line; Miqati and Deputies in Ukkar, Discuss Area's Developmental Needs.

Miqati, accompanied by Al-Burini, Abd Al-Rahman, the head of the Halaba municipality, Abd Al-Hamid Al-Halabi, and Hashim, conducted a tour on the Joint Transport buses and opened the new line between Tripoli and Halaba.
First, the continuing coordination between Lebanon and fellow country Syria via its representative on the Security Council (Ambassador Mikhail Wahbah), who passed on to the Council some of our clarifications and observations, many of which were accepted.
He added, "Resolution 1428 clarifies the impression left by the report of the United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Anan, in which some saw many negative points.
"1. The first paragraph adopted what was included in the report by the Secretary-General, in particular the recommendation for an extension.
4. It expressed its strong concern at the dangerous (Israeli) air, sea and land breaches and violations of the withdrawal line.
7. It referred to the importance of United Nations force completing its third mission for restoring international peace and security in the region.
The Ministry noted that, during the period between the report and the passing of the resolution, Israel, by means of its representative to the international organization, determined to direct charges and slander at Lebanon, the resistance in particular, as part of a clear attempt to exploit this interim period and influence the decision of the Council.
The Director of International Organizations at the Ministry, Ambassador Antoine Shadid received Chinese Ambassador Liu Zhentang on the occasion of the latter's final transfer from Beirut.
The delegation congratulated the Commander of the Syrian Forces operating in Lebanon, Major General Ahmad Ali, on the occasion.
He saluted the Lebanese and Syrian Presidents Emil Lahud and Bashar Al-Asad and the command of the two armies, calling for "a strengthening of fraternal ties and links imposed by the interests of the two fraternal countries".
2. Return of Palestinian refugees to their homes in Palestine.
Governor of the North Nasif Qalush then handed Brigadier Abu Hamzah and Colonel Nabil Hashimah two commemorative shields in recognition of the role of the command of the two armies.
What concerns His Eminence concerns us all, namely that all Lebanese should be Lebanese citizens in prosperity and affluence, enjoying social security and stability, that Lebanon should return to its brilliance and magnificence, that the tourist industry in Lebanon should be a distinguished industry, one appropriate to Lebanon and the Lebanese, and that the economic cycle should progress in line with the needs of us all, citizens and officials."
The number of tourists coming to Lebanon is increasing every year. Last year saw an increase of about 15% on the previous year and we expect this year's increase to be in the region of 20% above last year."
Did he discuss with Archbishop Awdah the matter of the cell phone?
The "Charter and Constitution Forum" held its meeting yesterday morning on the occasion of Army Day. It addressed congratulations to "the organization of sacrifice, honor and loyalty, hoping that it will continue as a model for the unity of the nation and undertake its natural functions without obstacle or double standards, over all Lebanon's territory".
The open struggle over the so-called privatization, alongside the attacks, insults and slander that accompany it, provides an ugly picture of the present authority, amid the barricades of confrontation at the heart of the government and in the chamber, the palaces, government offices and headquarters. The reports of mediations, intercessions and interventions, and the odor of brokerage, shares, bank deposits, fantastic profit figures, both declared and undeclared, and the program of theft from public funds at a time of frightening debt, deafens the ears and blocks the nose.
Lebanon is progressing haphazardly in critical political, security, social and economic crises. It needs a noble legitimate authority, one that is qualified to bear the responsibility of government. Do the present officials realize the harm they are inflicting on their nation?
The largest was the fire that swept through the fruit-bearing pine forests in the town of Qaituli (Jazin), which broke out last Tuesday.
This was attended by Deputies George Najm and Antoine Khuri, representing the office of the Speaker of the Chamber of the Deputies; Deputy Samir Azar, the district head of Jazin Nabih Hamud; the head of the Maronite diocese of Sidon, Archbishop Tanius Al-Khuri; the head of the Catholic Media Center, Father Abduh Buksam; and the Commander of the South Regional Area.

But I advise citizens not to change their car engines before the law determining the internationally approved specifications is promulgated", indicating that this would happen soon.
In 1976 the uprising of the "Arab Lebanese Army", under the command of Captain Ahmad Al-Khatib, set out from them, which resulted in the military base there being moved to the Marjaiyun barracks.
Given this reality, a serious plan must be drawn up by the Ministry of Public Works, or any other official organization, to refurbish the buildings in view of the importance of this work on more than one level, bearing in mind that, in light of the deteriorating financial situation of the exchequer, it will save tens of millions of lira as an alternative to the buildings presently occupied by official organizations, and reduce the burden on the citizen, who spends his day moving from one building to another to complete his business.

What distinguishes this site is that its walls were painted in green, which has protected it from the air and water. The owners have gifted it to the endowment of the Sayyidah Mashmushah Monastery in Jazin.
The letter sent to me by Dr Nadiyah Mustafa, Professor of Political Sciences at the Faculty of Economics and Political Sciences and Director of the Dialogue Between Civilizations Program, which includes critical observations on the draft letter of Egyptian intellectuals that I drafted, holds broad hopes for the possibility of formulating a national consensus between all Arab political currents in diagnosing the present situation and conceptualizing the potential alternatives to confront these challenges.

- A hundred years of Zionism.
* How do you describe the operation to assassinate Sheikh Salah Shahadah, which resulted in the deaths of a large number of Palestinian civilians?
- We, in the political apparatus, cannot decide the nature of the response. This is the responsibility of the military wing of the Movement, which will describe where, when and how the response will be made to the Zionist attacks.
In 1961 the "Al-Jaridah" newspaper published surveys about "sectarianism", in which I did not find a clear answer.
This is the transcript of the interview:
* How will "Hamas" respond to this massacre and what will be the nature of the response?
- We said that if the enemy is prepared to stop the aggression against the Palestinian people, withdraw from the Palestinian towns that the Israeli army has reoccupied, stop the assassinations and attacks on Palestinian civilians, end the policy of demolishing homes and cutting down trees, and free all Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli prisons, then in this instance we will study the possibility of stopping martyrdom operations.
No, no contacts have taken place between Saudi Arabia and us.
- No, there have been no contacts between the Palestinian Authority and us in this respect.
America is always biased towards Israel and cannot serve our cause.
For it defends the honor of the Arab nation, and the ambitions of the enemy do not stop at the borders of Palestine, but aim to gain control over all the nation's capacities.
The scene of American preparations to change the conditions in Iraq is perplexing.
No two officials or leaders meet without the position on the American decision on Iraq being present.
On the international front the United States has won no one over to its side beyond British support, which, in turn, faces domestic difficulties.
So does the United States possess such proof?
How can Washington jump over all these diplomatic barriers at the appropriate time, the puzzle that the American President continues to refuse to solve?
If we recall the time taken to mobilize the American forces in the Gulf in preparation to strike Iraq in 1991, we can understand the meaning of the time needed to assemble 250 thousand American soldiers.
The plans leaked recently about starting with Baghdad first, recalls, with the exception of "Gaza and Jericho First", the attempt of former American President Jimmy Carter to intervene in Iran to save the American hostages, which ended in the disaster that is well known.
Thus, what is required is an American consensus, but on what plans put forward can such a consensus be obtained?
It is a failure that may be decisive for a President who needs something to compensate for the domestic chaos that has begun to sweep the American interior with the return of the Republicans to government.
Following a welcome speech by Mrs. Mubaiyad, Minister Al-Sinyurah gave a speech in which he praised "the efforts of Dr Buasiri and his experience, given that he has occupied various posts, the most prominent of which was Director of the Banks Oversight Committee for two consecutive terms".
Now we have the modern and sophisticated mechanisms and lines in the management of money, which reassure the states and organizations with whom Lebanon deals. These new mechanisms have been necessitated by the massive developments and major changes that have taken place and continue to take place in the ways of dealing with financial, banking and economic instruments."
If the "Coccyx" of the title symbols in her book those who are subservient in society, upstarts and the irksome, the story focuses more on close relationships and family and social relations.
His pictures contain some dramatic atmospheres. It was as if he knew what the innocent among his people would suffer, they who continue to suffer and pay the price in blood.

The guest was a white Mercedes 230 car that drove off the President Sulaiman Faranjiyyah autostrade, demolishing the cement wall and landing in the courtyard of the house, destroying the front, the chassis, and whole of the front, including the lights and the engine.

But what Jabir did say about the incident seems to have been derived from the topic for which he had been invited: economic anxieties and the cell phone issue, etc.
Of course, Jabir does not mean to justify the crime in terms of poverty, thereby allowing every poor person in Lebanon and the world to kill.
Mansur committed his crime armed to his teeth.
The statement made by Minister of Justice Samir Al-Jisr when he came to the place of the crime raises a number of questions. He said, "This is an exceptional incident. Security arrangements cannot be made for every individual."

They wanted to deduct from my compensation because of a loan that I had taken a few months ago. Recently, they had begun to put pressure on me to return the money that I had borrowed or they would deduct it from my compensation. I have children and I have no money left. My circumstances are wretched. I bought a car but was forced to sell it at a lower price.
In response to a question, they answered: "The person who opened fire does not appear to suffer from a nervous disorder. In fact, he appeared to be a normal person with firm nerves. He confessed simply and said: I determined to kill them. I have nothing to hide. No one knew that I would commit this crime because I planned it and carried it out on my own.
They explained that the sum borrowed by the accused was about 12 thousand American dollars of what is considered to be public money. The two floors occupied come under the official administration.
Madi told "Al-Nahar" that the reasons for the crime were financial and that there was no other motive for it.
Madi ordered that the offices where the crime took place be sealed with red wax and that the corpses be handed over to the next of kin. He issued authorizations to the security agencies.

It is noted that fires used to begin in forests parallel to private land, whose owners had determined to clear their land by burning the grass and chaff. The increase in temperature in the summer seasons and strong winds have also helped to expand the area subject to fires.

This national treasure suffered greatly during the occupation, the shells from which started fires in the mountains, fields and plains. To date it continues to suffer a more deadly enemy, however, represented in the fires that consume the earth and desiccate its flora.

Sources confirm that the fires in the last three years have focused on the forests of Ariyah, Bahnin, Malikh, Al-Aishiyah, Mt Safi and the areas of Basaliyya, Birtai and Rimat, most of which are oak and wild and air pines.
Among the most obvious reasons for the fires are the impossibility of clearing the forests from branches and dry grasses which help spread the fire and the fact that the Ministry of Agriculture will not allow the forests to be cut down and agricultural roads built in them to facilitate the movement of fire engines to the site of fires.

Speaking calmly about the night of Friday, 20 September, after the Israeli attack, he said, "We were surrounded, about 150 security men, in a hall directly opposite the office of President Arafat linked by a suspension bridge, which the Israeli bulldozers began to destroy."
Shamasnah explained, "I was the last to cross the bridge. I felt the bullets penetrating the walls and glass around me. At that point I did not feel that I would get out alive."
We thought the building would fall on us if the bulldozers of the occupation continued to dig" after reducing most of the buildings in Al-Muqataah square to rubble (...) "The worst moment was when the bulldozers began to demolish the headquarters of the Governor, which is directly adjacent to the Chairman's Headquarters. At that point, we began to feel that something major would happen."

Iraq requested the samples on the pretext that it needed them for legitimate medical research.
The details were revealed in a report by one of the Congressional committees in 1994 and in a letter sent by the Center for Disease Control and Protection to the Senate in 1995.
He asked the American Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld about this at a hearing of the Armed Forces Committee in the Senate. The latter cast doubts about the information published by the "News Week" magazine in this regard, but he added that he would ask his aides to review the records of the Ministry of Defense and other government organizations to find evidence for the transfer of samples.

The road from Quraitam to the southern district is not wide enough for more mines and ambushes set up by the fervent, the last of which was the tale of the "gap" on the margins of American intervention along the Al-Wazzani "track" as witness.
And ultimately, at least for this stormy phase, it is essential that it be clear both at home and abroad that Lebanon does not want to withdraw from its stance and slogans on the resistance and that "Hizbollah" cannot and should not be allowed to withdraw from its stance and slogans on Lebanon.
Since the story of the "mistimed operation" in the Shabaa Farms, and the subsequent debate about the background of Hong Kong and Hanoi, through to last week, the borders between the State and the resistance have not been proficiently drawn, despite the fact that the interests of both parties require this.
Why?
If such talk holds a signal to the enthusiasm of Nasrallah, which appears much more developed than the message of the traditional "enthusiasts" in the region, who have cloaked their message in velvet since 11 September, Al-Hariri has tried to sketch out a difficult third way between two easy paths within Arab reach.

The Borders of the State...and the Resistance.
It is now time to draw the connecting borders between the State and the resistance using the methods and theories of political repulsion.
Like connected veins, the State embraces the resistance and the resistance firmly establishes the opposition of the State.
His enthusiastic speech about the "Great Satan" and his statement that "our resounding slogan will remain: Death to America" are thus the "foundation columns of the house" for "Hizbollah", which is not only ranked "number 1" on America's list of "terrorism" but has become a target for daily threats, the last of which was pronounced by Richard Armitage, Deputy Secretary of State, who appears to have been behind the pressures brought to bear in Congress, which led to the suspension of aid to Lebanon.
"Israel wants to put the Arabs in confrontation with America. The interests of the Arabs lie in achieving the opposite to this."
The Prime Minister is opposed to confrontation by force because of the imbalance, and also against prostration. He calls for us to enter the existing system, to influence it and not to remain on its margins...but two matters prevent this involvement: unity of stance and clarity of conception. This is the extreme difficulty in Lebanon, and in most Arab states.
Ali Mustafa, a dealer resident in Britain, does not need an educational qualification in economics to bet on the stock exchange. Astrology is sufficient.
Mustafa, who gives advice over the Internet to investors, insists that his methods are scientific, but his special skills work in a precise manner, so he can only do what he does by inspiration.
Mustafa Ali says that most investors who use the conventional methods of investment have been harmed by the fall in markets at the present time. He said that they must work hard to understand the psychological condition of the market.
He studies the positions of the planets in order to determine the movements of the market.
He studies the sudden movements of small particles that cause natural disasters and applies the same method to people who move collectively to sell or buy, determining the movement of the market.

During talks held between them in Cairo Egyptian and Syrian Presidents Husni Mubarak and Bashar Al-Asad urged the Security Council to shoulder its responsibilities towards the Palestinian issue and the return of international weapons inspectors to Iraq.
Presidents Mubarak and Bashar Al-Asad called on the Security Council and relevant international forces to work to force Israel to respect its commitments and undertakings and make it implement Security Council resolutions without double standards, in particular the recent Security Council resolution demanding that Israel withdraw from the areas it has occupied, on the basis that this is sufficient to halt the deterioration in the situation and create an atmosphere conducive to rescuing the peace process in its different tracts, pursuant to the international reference formulated by the international community.
* In Damascus the Director of the Foreign Media Department at the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Buthainah Shaaban stated at a press conference that the aim of Asad's visit to Egypt was "to activate Arab solidarity" and that "Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia will work for anything that avoids a strike against Iraq".

The Secretariat-General of the "Qarnat Shahwan Forum" will hold a meeting next Thursday, when the bishops' statement is issued, under the chairmanship of Bishop Yusif Bisharah to study the coming steps of the Forum.
Let's wait and see what the contents of the file are first."
Among the steps resulting from the talks are a study to establish a free market between Lebanon and Yemen, to facilitate the travel of businessmen and investors between the two countries, the possibility of establishing joint industries, and the setting of a date to convene the Joint Committee for its first meeting next November.
Iraq's fate stands at a critical juncture.
If Baghdad says that Washington will not be satisfied by anything and that it is searching for a pretext to strike Iraq, then such a statement holds much truth, for Bush's administration has declared the overthrow of the Iraqi regime a clear objective and the elimination of Iraqi weapons does not seem to quench its thirst for revenge.
What is proposed is a method for sparing Iraq a war that Washington has determined to wage, under international cover if possible or alone if necessary.
The reasons for this are many, first of which is that Washington relies on the Iraqi rejection of this condition to justify its strike and so views it as the first test for Saddam.
To maintain it requires full cooperation with the United Nations.
So what decision will the Iraqi President take?
Although, and may God be praised, our tank is filled to the top, the measure overflows to the very edge, and we are not glorifying God for the past.
From a jump to its sister, the sister of this condition, which doesn't have the decency to leave us with a pleasant odor.
Despite the fact that one of the nouveau riche could spend the whole sum on one night...to celebrate the wedding of his son or daughter, or on the occasion of his wife's birthday.

Let Bush keep his thirty pieces of silver, because they do not fatten or protect from hunger.
Government sources yesterday confirmed that Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri is to visit Tokyo on the 9th of this September as part of the framework for the preparation for the Conference of Donor States to Lebanon (Paris 2).
He also received Deputy Sayyid Aql, followed by former Minister Michel Adah, President of the World Catholic Federation for Press in Lebanon, Father Tony Khidrah.
He said, "Tourism in Lebanon has varying characteristics according to the seasons and between the coast and the mountains, and in terms of services, from entertainment to shopping to medical treatment." He noted the positive effect of the influx of visitors to Lebanon for its economy generally and for the commercial, agricultural and industrial sectors in particular.
And now those who predicted the catastrophe they hurried to call upon us have seen that their predictions were not correct.
He announced, "We want to continue to reduce the interest rate on the debt so that the servicing of the debt will be equal to or less than the level of the first excess in the budget, in order to stop the deficit."
The "Southern Aid Association" yesterday visited the Al-Wazzani source in a solidarity initiative in the face of Israeli threats to prevent Lebanon pumping its water to southern villages.
A number of members of the delegation then prayed at the Al-Wazzani bank.
We are the followers of Imam Ali, who when prevented by his enemies from drinking from the water hole and defeated them, allowed them to drink, take and pump the water.
By these noble sects, represented with us today, we have come out to the assembly and we say that there is national unity in the south. All Lebanese, from the extreme north to its four quarters must follow the examples of the south and the Southern Aide Association.
The land is ours, the water is ours. We will take our right irrespective of whether anyone comes.
The delegation passed by the Roman Orthodox Partriarchate in Marjaiyun before heading for Al-Wazzani.
Sidon - "Al-Nahar":
1. "We call for the activation of political life in the Al-Zahrani area by activating popular forces therein and by encouraging them to play their role and to reject all attempts at containment and political hegemony over the towns and villages of the area.
5. Call all the media to appoint media representatives in the Al-Zahrani area, as in other areas, and to undertake to cover the political and cultural activities therein, thereby helping to activate the political life.
9. Demand that the Elections Laws be settled before voting by a sufficient period. Warn against any law that looks to the major constituencies without adopting proportionality as its democratic basis.
Birri received the new Iranian Ambassador Masoud Al-Idrisi on a protocol visit.
As we stood in the past, we stand today, and in the future, alongside Syria, Lebanon and Palestine. We believe that the region of the Middle East is passing through complex, sensitive and dangerous conditions, all of which is on account of the one-sided policy pursued by the United States on the one hand, and on account of the aggressive and expansionist policies of the Zionist entity on the other.
Following the meeting, Ghandur referred in his statement to the "importance of meeting with Speaker Birri at this stage, given that the Lebanese community in the Ivory Coast is facing new difficulties and challenges.
Birri sent a telegram to German Chancellor Gerhardt Schroeder congratulating him on his victory in the elections, as well as to the Speaker of the Columbian Senate Luis Alfredo Ramos Botero and to his new Columbian counterpart William Filiz Fera congratulating them on their election.
A series of contacts with Ambassador Farid Abbud were conducted to find out the circumstances of and reasons for this decision, in order to mount an official move in this regard.
It also means that American officials are not happy at specific positions in Lebanon and view the criticisms directed against them in connection with their refusal to infringe on freedoms to be unreasonable.
Those irritated in the American State Department have given the impression that this is a possibility on account of it not being notified by Lebanon of the latter's intent to increase its share of the Al-Wazzani water.
"The Qarnat Shahwan Forum" did not need more than the expression confirmed by Maronite Patriarch Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Butrus Safir that he and the forum "were part of the same retinue" for the political and media wave that prevailed last week, announcing Bikirki's withdrawal of its cover from the Forum, which is headed by Archbishop Yusif Basharah, to disappear.
But these atmospherics had scarcely begun to bring pressure to bear on the political arena when the first signal of support came from the Maronite Patriarch as he received the "Consultative Forum" and his confirmation in a written statement of Bikirki's maxims, recalling the three calls issued by the Maronite Episcopal Council and clearly defining the relationship that links it to the "Al-Qarnah".
It confirmed its adherence to its maxims, which will, in all probability, be restated in the statement of the Maronite Council tomorrow, Wednesday, after Safir realized that the third call "had not been properly heard" as a result of the closure of the "M.T.V." station on the same day it was issued.
Consequently, Basharah will chair a meeting of the Secretariat of the "Qarnat Shahwan Forum" after tomorrow, Thursday, which will discuss a range of steps, chief among them dialogue.
According to what these circles say, the political ceiling remains the same and the "Al-Qarnah" will not stop seeking everything set out in its statements before the "M.T.V." issue and thereafter.
But the lesson lies in the steps by which Safir will address his "dialogue" messages and the possibility of benefiting therefrom in order to lift the load from the "Al-Qarnah" members.
At a meeting of the Central Council yesterday Baqraduni reiterated the support of the Party for the President of the Republic, "in whom we see the symbol of the unity of the nation and who stands vigilant over the Constitution, the Accord and Order. We see in the army an organization that protects the peace of the people, law and sovereignty and in the judiciary the source of authority for guaranteeing the rights of citizens and their various freedoms."
If it becomes apparent to the judiciary that there was no criminal act involved, then the innocence of all those over whom suspicion hangs, including President Amin Gemayel, should be declared.
* Phalangist Party Circles mentioned that President Amin Gemayel sent by means of his agent, attorney Antoinne Muarbas, a letter to the "President of the Phalangist Party Karim Baqraduni" asking him to deposit a copy of the decision to expel him from the Party, after "we heard" the news via the press.
Maronite Patriarch Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Butrus Safir received yesterday in Bikirki former Deputy Jamil Al-Shams, who afterwards said, "I am delighted to visit His Eminence Patriarch Safir, who has demonstrated a high degree of wisdom, patriotism and sense of responsibility at this difficult and dangerous stage."
Everything that is happening is patriotic heresy.
He said, "The issue was at the point of give and take up until yesterday, when suspicions increased following the statement by the Minister for Water and Electricity Resources and the demand of all colleagues for a fundamental solution to be found for the electricity. For we, as Deputies, were asking the people in our areas to pay millions of lira due for this house or that when we know that the house is not capable of using all that amount of electricity.
Today the electricity bills have become an annihilation despite the massive efforts made by Kamal Al-Hayek, Director General of the Organization, although he is not responsible for this stage, but merely dealing with its consequences.
He said, "In adding my voice to the voices of the Deputies and prominent figures of the Tyre area calling on citizens in the south generally not to pay the electricity bills until the truth of the falsification becomes apparent, I call on the judiciary to grasp this serious social issue, uncover the truth and those responsible and hand down the harshest penalty on them, to deter those who wish to tamper with the economic, living and developmental security of the citizens.
In a meeting yesterday in the Chamber of Deputies the Secretariat of the "Consultative Forum" approved the Forum's draft constitution after amendments were incorporated.
There follows the text of the Forum's draft constitution:

It funds a number of operations, such as bringing in lecturers and experts, funding training courses for Lebanese lecturers abroad, providing books and reference sources, providing grants for the top students and organizing exchanges between researchers.

Archbishop Al-Indari then gave a sermon in which he said, "What can we say about this great work which you have undertaken along with those generous people who offered and encouraged donations from God's munificence to them, at the forefront of which is Bishop Charles Grahmann, who has come from America to participate in launching this complex fit for social and educational service for the good of Birhaliyun, to reinvigorate life here and consolidate residency and permanence here.
The bishops then blessed the complex and toured its environs.
A speech was then given by the Municipal Head of Birhaliyun Bashir Tarrad followed by parish priest Abdallah Yazbek.
The action on the "Al-Buma" deal file at this specific juncture is an explicit invitation to President Amin Jemayel to leave Lebanon and join Brigadier Michel Aun in exile, after he "dared" to cross the red line "agreed upon" regionally and internationally (?!).

Despite the right of all political forces to demand full activation of the 1973 constitution, which gives all legislative rights to the new council, no one has paid attention to the constitutional impasse contained in the article allowing the government to disband parliament and thereby repeat the same problem, but this time quickly on the basis of the anticipated ingredients!
The link is clear between lifting the siege from Arafat's headquarters in Ramallah and the preparations to launch an American war on Iraq, a war which all the evidence suggests is around the corner and perhaps the most obvious example is American haste to resolve the problem of the "embargo" in Ramallah.
If Tel Aviv had been able to continue its war in Palestine in parallel to Washington's war in Afghanistan, the American war against Iraq would not have started with the fires still lit in Palestine.
Israel responded not in order to please the White House Master and not because the strike against Iraq is, ultimately, in its interest.
It consolidated its qualitative superiority over its neighbors, to the extent that this is immeasurable.
These scenarios, maps and roles will not save any country, from Iraq to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Algeria, Sudan, Syria, Iran and Turkey.

Regarding the issue of "Ideal" and its program for supporting agricultural products, the Association demanded from the Ministry of Finance "the need to secure funds quickly to pay exporters dues within a period not exceeding two months.
It expressed amazement for "the non action of any of the officials to hold the Ministry of Agriculture accountable or questioning it on the incorrect information it released to polish the image of the agreement, and passing it without having the virtues it depicted. Consequently, what's required from the Council of Ministers is to open the record of this agreement, review and amend it to lift the harm inflicted on Lebanese farmers, or compensate the vegetable farmers in the protected agriculture at the same rate of that of price reduction that will occur because of the implementation of this agreement."

It added in a statement: "Perhaps one of the worst parts of this chain is adopting religious association criteria in the new full-time employment project for 34 hourly contract professors, which makes the full-time employment process at the university turn into a "Mullah Council", bringing back memories of the ill-reputed Ottoman Mullah system."

It showed that breast cancer represents 29 percent of cancer cases in Lebanon, making it the most common cancer, followed by lung cancer, which represents 11 percent of cancer cases.

Opinion differed about the outcome of the United States Grand Prix race, which is the 16th semi-final round of the world's car championship, "Formula 1", for the 2002 season, when the "Ferrari" German driver Michael Schumacher let his colleague in the Brazilian team, Rubens Barrichello, win, after it was clear that he locked up the win as he was faster in the free and official trials and led the race from start to finish, pursued by Barrichello without ever succeeding to passing him.
Chang had announced that he will retire at the end of the current season after his elimination from the first round of the Hong Kong International Tournament last week, but he later said: "I have not set a date for my retirement yet.

Wembley Stadium was built in the year 1923 and witnessed the biggest football win for England when its team won 4-2 over Germany in the 1966 World Cup final.
And if some excessively exaggerated talk would justify to the state with all of its institutions and apparatus to jump the opposition, under the cover of committing a coup attempt, the true realities of the conflict seem leaning toward exploiting this logic but without reaching the level of a full coup against the Lebanese reality, in response to a mythical talk about a coup attempt that even those who launched it do not believe it, and it necessitates the lowest degrees of self-respect and that of others.
The state appeared with a rare irony that it is adopting all international "standards" in place now in most countries that offer security, even if repressing, coupled with religious diversity, the symbol of Lebanon's gleaming in the requirements of the global war on terrorism.
The state picked up a critical international moment, where national conflicts are not taken into consideration and are thrown on the shelf, and where democratic "principles" tolerate waiting and ignoring violations.
No "mobilization" would have occurred in Lebanon without being a warning for violent shredding and shaking up of the internal fabric.
But the enlargement of the opposition's rock and its "danger" made it overcome its weakness to be at least at the level of the popular sympathy with it.
This is the first balance of the long journey, and the rest shall follow in turn!
True, they are many and big, but there is no magic button that will solve Lebanon's economic problems with one click.
In other words, giving the opportunity to "Paris-2 Demonstration" to take place in atmospheres that convince the participants in it that the Lebanese deserve support and help.
And how could it bolster confidence in Lebanon and its economic conditions, which deserve support because they possess the elements of health and prosperity, while it kills the last token of confidence in the possibility of internally arriving at what will restore power to national unity, the only base of health and prosperity.
We ask our friends to give us a chance to finish what we started and fulfill our commitments, and we might as well help ourselves(...). We ask them to trust us, but we might as well trust ourselves.
The newspaper indicated that Sharon, at the same time, is getting ready to face a proposition to withhold confidence from the government, presented by "Meritz" and "Shinoi".
From now on, Sharon is a prime minister of a government which does not enjoy a majority, and in the best of cases, a prime minister of a narrow rightist government, subject to the mercy of marginal parties in Israeli politics, and forced to maneuver in order to face the leftist and middle parties, who want to topple him.
His popularity hit the sky when he opposed the Likud's Central Committee, and declared his position in support of establishing a Palestinian state, and also when he fired ministers from the Shas Party.
Sharon secured himself with regards to the popular demonstrations against his cruel actions and his political bankruptcy.
Sharon, who enjoyed the political heaven so far, will know from now on how does the coalition hell look like with all the blackmail, the demands and the threats, without talking about the left's opposition."
No, it is the state that it won over.
The state is my own and yours, but it is certainly not exclusive to those who promote its policy, no matter how high they rise.
For that, it is sufficient to review the published statements and press interviews of government officials and representatives who are loyal (to whom?), not to mention the gossip of "informed sources", which seemed to have been informed just about everything except about what is happening in the world, not to forget the foolish "security sources".
This scenario may be funny, especially when it is repeated like the practical jokes of Ghawwar Al-Touche, even if it did not stem out of the corrupt mentality that Ghawar is clear of.
The decadence of the state is not felt except by statesmen, who are very rare, and the republic is not mourned except by republicans, who, once they step down from rule, no room is left for regret, sadly enough.
The Director of the Non-Government Agencies Department at the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, Yousef Al-Sharqawi, spoke about steadfastness that "needs more continuous support..., on the basis of the land-for-peace principle, United Nations resolutions and the enforcement of the Palestinians right to establish their state on their land."

After that, the American Assistant Secretary of State for Armament Affairs, John Bolton, visited Russia to confront the Russian officials with evidence on a possible North Korean program for enriching uranium. Moscow responded cautiously, saying that it wants to independently verify the information before taking any position.
He added that the American claims that Pyong Yang is developing a program for nuclear armament are baseless, explaining that "we made an unambiguous statement to the American president's envoy indicating that in the face of increasing American nuclear threat, we are forced to obtain not only nuclear weapons, but more powerful weapons to protect our sovereignty and our right to exist."
North Korean leader Kim Jung-Il had visited Russia last August for the second time within a year.
On the day after the conclusion of the Japanese-North Korean talks, which aimed at establishing normal relations between the two countries, and without reaching agreement on any of the two major issues, namely, the nuclear program of the Communist regime and the kidnapped Japanese in North Korea, Japanese delegation member Akitaka Saiki said he asked the North Korean delegation for details on eight Japanese who were kidnapped by North Korean spies decades ago.
Washington - AFP - The American Administration decided to launch a wide television campaign in the Islamic World to rectify the American society's image in these regions, which Washington considers "mistaken".
He indicated that these films aim at "discussing the American Moslems, their life styles in the United States, our society's values and more generally, introducing ourselves."
He said that "in the face of terrorism, which may harm the reputation of Islam by claims of serving it, explaining the deep nature of Islam, its aspirations to peace and its conciliatory desire must be pursued relentlessly."
Berlin - Reuters - A top Western intelligence official reported that Western spies monitored a return of intensive communications among Islamist activists that have not been monitored since the six months preceding the September 11 attacks.
He explained that "the problem that is still going on is that the target and the date are unknown."
The spokesman expected that the disarmament process will begin in Sholgara, which is reachable by car in two hours and is located southwest of the major city of Mazar El-Sherif in northern Afghanistan, where forces loyal to the Uzbek General Abdel Rasheed Dostum clashed with the forces of "The Islamic Society" leader, Tajik commander Mr. Atta Mohammad early in the week.
It followed a meeting of the American Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Zalmai Khalil Zadah, with both Dostum and Mohammad in Mazar El-Sherif during which the envoy expressed his government's concern about the fighting between the two factions.
Both Dostum and Mohammad are members in Karzai's coalition government, but they were apparently interested in expanding their provincial authority bases more than they were interested in helping the central government exercise control over the entire country.
In Kabul, the spokeswoman for the World Health Organization, Loretta Hieber Gerardet, said in a press conference that 61 children died in seven villages within four weeks in the Darwaz District in the Badkhshan Province.

A witness said: "We heard two large explosions from the first floor of the building, followed by several explosions," and a fire erupted in the house.
Earlier, a Palestinian was killed in a gunfire exchange with an Israeli officer near Beit El settlement on the Ramallah perimeter in the West Bank.
He added that before his death, the Palestinian fired on an ambulance that was passing in the neighborhood.

The army radio said that the soldiers arrested 22 wanted Palestinians in the West Bank Wednesday night.
On another front, the "Al-Risala" Newspaper, which is close to the "Hamas" Movement, resumed publication after it was closed by the Palestinian Security apparatus for more than a year for publishing "enticing articles."

He indicated that the government and insurgents delegations will discuss security arrangements after "the success" of negotiations on other issues.
Sudanese newspapers wrote today that Vice president Ali Othman Mohammad Taha completely rules out self-determination right for the three regions, calling the attention to the fact that they are part of the north, according to the south's borders which were settled in the year 1956.
Concerning that, the National Council approved a plan for the upcoming year that includes taking over the areas under the control of the insurgents and guaranteeing the security of the Sudanese territories and water resources by way of consolidating the armed forces.
Army's spokesman, General Mohammad Bashir Suleiman, denied the violation of the truce agreed upon with the insurgents in the southern part of the country, calling the situation there "quiet", but the "aggression supported by Eritrea is still going on in the East."
The leader of the Iraqi "Patriotic Union of Kurdistan", Jalal Talabani, expected an American offensive against Iraq after the month of Ramadan, which ends on the fifth of next December.

In Baghdad, the information official at the Humanitarian Coordinator Office of the United Nations in Iraq, Ali Hamati, said that "the only problem, which is certainly very serious and causes us to ring the danger bell, is the progressive reduction in oil revenues."

He added that Iran is led by "a very small group of clergymen," and that women and young people do not approve of the way it is being run."
Rumsfeld's comments contradict a recent analysis by the American Central Intelligence Agency, "CIA", that pointed to "a slow change" in the Iranian society that is more than being a revolution.
He had joined Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar for breakfast in the morning, then attended a ceremony at the Al-Bardo Palace with King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia at the conclusion of a state visit that lasted three days.
Spanish newspapers criticized some protocol aspects of Khatami's visit that stemmed from Islamic traditions, such as not serving alcohol during official reception parties or refraining from shaking hands with women, especially the queen of Spain.
On another front, two Iranian Parliamentarians, Ali Redha Nouri and Masood Hashimedhi, were killed in a traffic accident.

Word diminished in Washington yesterday about reaching an agreement soon in the Security Council regarding disarming Iraq's weapons as the American President George Bush and his top administration staff re-iterated their running out of patience with regards to the continuation of opposition of France, Russia and China, besides other countries of the non-permanent members of the council, to an American-British draft resolution, and reiterating the readiness of the United States to lead an international coalition to strip Iraq of its alleged weapons.
They spoke of "superficial and partial softness" in the American administration's position "because it seeks to trade its ambiguous acceptance with our consent, which is comprised of two distinct phases of permanent and automatic authorization to strike Iraq.
One Hundred Lebanese Companies; 47 Countries at Baghdad International Expo
As part of this event, the Al-Arar Border Center between Iraq and Saudi Arabia was opened yesterday.

It is clear, of course, that there is an opposing side and a loyal side, but this is the nature of things.
But I think that the government, to be consistent with itself, must not grant licenses to people thought to be affiliated with it. This is my opinion.
There is great trust in Lebanon abroad, by our Arab brothers and many countries. Let us, brothers and friends, trust, support and stand by our country until it passes its crisis.
The people's support and backing are critical to all the steps we undertake, and we ask God Almighty to avoid us away error and bring us closer to righteousness.
State Minister Pierre Helou contended "that the Christian faction was never as divided as it is today and that is the impending danger, indicating that "there is some balance missing internally."

Arbash then delivered an address in which he said: "The nation is in danger and our solidarity is the answer. Mobilizing the youths in the context of national and domestic unity is the best solidarity with Al-Assad's Syria, as it is with every targeted sister country."

The Archbishop of Washington, Theodore Cardinal McCarrick, concludes today his visit to Lebanon that lasted four days.
President Lahoud completed during the meeting discussing the subjects that he had raised with the Archbishop of Washington during his visit with him on Tuesday and his meeting with the Christian and Moslem spiritual leaders at the president of the republic's dinner table.
He added: "We pray for peace in the world and in Lebanon, which suffers many problems caused by external crises."

He returned in the evening to Bkarki and was planning to leave Lebanon today on his way back to the United States.
Attention was focused on the internal affairs of the country and the means of addressing the issue of internal unity and national solidarity, especially the issue of liberties and means to guarantee their preservation and consolidation, and resolving the issue of the M.T.V. television in a way that guarantees its re-opening after the tune of secular and religious convulsion, which does not serve the country nor building the country, exacerbated in an unprecedented manner.
On another front, the Executive Council thinks that in view of what the political front is witnessing that "demonstrating is a legitimate right for citizens, guaranteed by the Lebanese constitution which called for respecting the freedom of expression and belief, especially if the call to assemble and demonstrate follows the mechanics outlined by laws with proper procedures.
The League thinks that the Christian arena has become a prey for enticements that should not become a permanent reality, preserving the isolation and deepening the split.

Formation of Rightist Government in Israel Increases Chances of Aggression
"Hezbollah" has not launched any attacks at Shabaa Farms in weeks, but it is possible that it could resume that at any time and breach the ceasefire that reportedly was arranged by American Secretary of State Colin Powell when his presence in the region coincided with the rising tone of military confrontation before his visit to Beirut last spring.
He called attention to that the current government crisis in Israel must not be underestimated, and that if Sharon was able to form a new government and appoint Shaol Mofaz as a defense minister, the danger would be bigger and the field more open to free Sharon's hand, not only against the Palestinians inside but against Lebanon, too.
The Russian envoy of the peace process in the Middle East, Andre Vidovin, twice evaded answering a question on the extent of the truth in Sharon's statements, the first being at Bustros Palace after his meeting with Foreign and Emigrants Minister Mahmoud Hammoudeh, and the second at Baabda Palace after his meeting with the President of the Republic Emile Lahoud.
He explained that Lebanon does not anticipate from Anan any answer for the report she sent to him, because Beirut considers that it did not require permission, neither from Anan nor from any other country, and certainly not from Israel, because the quantity that was decided to be pumped represents a sovereign right, according to more than one regulating international treaty for this type of pumping water that originates on its soil.
He called attention "that the whole world is watching and trusting us, and we must translate this trust into a trust in ourselves and in our country, and into a faith in God."
Regarding the steps the government is taking to stop the waste and corruption and to stimulate the public and private sectors, he said: "The responsibility of the state in relation to the private sector is to remove the obstacles in front of it, and despite the efforts that the government exerted in this area, there are still more obstacles that we are in the process of removing.

65 employees, representing 30 banks, participated in it. They are operation managers and officials from departments of information and internal oversight on information systems at banks.
The two exhibits do not bring anything new in style nor in visual meaning.
The title of Anita Toutikian's exhibit is "House of Virtue", which is what she named a sculpture based on the life of a generation of women who experienced the years of war.
The groundwork that Toutikian has accomplished calls for contemplation because it is contrary to what we encounter in paintings, where geometric lines drawn in tandem on a background stripped of any distinguishing marks reveal the extent of the artist's impression with what many artists painted in the stage that preceded World War II.
What Toutikian is missing in her paintings she finds in her sculpture experiments, hoping she will find a way of distinguishing if serious inquiries would help her.
The artist says in a note that accompanies his artistic biography "that some houses relate to the memory, and others deal with the present.
Mostly Regular Criminal and Civil, Information Center: Lawsuit Resolution Rate Rises
It is evident that in comparison with the same period that preceded it, extending from 1/1/2000 to 30/9/2001, the legal system resolved 120 thousand and 671 complaints against 145 thousand and 535 filed complaints.
Part of that is due to the shortage in the number of judges, and the other part to the fact that the filers of these lawsuits no longer pursue them due to their worthlessness as years passed since they were filed, noting that a significant percentage of these lawsuits are of the civil type.
As a last note, the inventory includes criminal and civil complaints, which are mostly regular in nature.
He ruled that they should be tried before the Criminal Court.
"The Arabs at a Juncture" by Essam Nomaan
The Chairman of the Seminar, Dr. Essam Suleiman, spoke after him and said that Dr. Nomaan expresses in his book "a solid intellectual commitment at a time when the Arab situation keeps getting worse.
He distributed the book's contents under four headings: Terrorism and America; World Chaos and Disorder; Palestine and Martyred Missions; and Iraq and Arab Oil.
Colleague Helmi Moussa then spoke about "the courage of Dr. Nomaan in collecting these articles, and the fact is that most of the book's articles combine political thinking with political analysis in a brilliant way.
College of Sciences "Stables"!
Yet, this transformation did not improve its conditions except by converting it into lecture halls.
The cracked walls and the water seeping through them, despite the summer, and the sunlight in many places due to the scarcity of walls, in addition to engineering reports that compelled the president of the university to issue an evacuation order, all demonstrate the extent of the state officials' interest in
Then the president of the university brought with him to the seminar a decree for transferring the ownership of Tallet Al-Moon Michel from the ownership of the defense ministry to the ownership of the education ministry - the Lebanese University, hoping to start building the university city in the north.
First: Is it sensible that the university uses a building, whether owned by France or someone else, wears it out, refuses to restore it, and only to return it to its owners, perhaps destroyed.
Isn't the honorable stance better than many positions that bring nothing to its owners but resentment and curses.
Officials at the Botafogo Club had offered Galliano a financial reward for the amount of 5000 reals (1340 dollars) if he scored in the match.
Palmeiras, which missed the international goal keeper Marcos because of his injury, opened the scoring with two goals by its Colombian offense Hernan Dario Gomez in the first five minutes, while Carlos Alberto scored for Botafogo in the 19th minute.

Therefore, the dialogue does not become right unless it follows these matters, the first of which is that each person acknowledge the other in accordance with what that other wants to be.
As for the "Al-Mayamer", plural for Maymar, it means a conversation, a study, a sermon, a defensive article or speech, and here it is a collection of spiritual commandments directed at the devout and discusses the satanic experiments a believer endures, and means to overcome them by pious exercise seeking the light of God's face.

Loving you sets me on an inflamed burning all the time.
The seller of pigeon chicks sacrifices his slaughtered pigeons.
The two together cannot rise.
Why do your eyes gaze into the sky like someone who does not feel his creator is on the inside of him?
Why do you drink a glass of our Savior's blood like someone who does not understand that his drink mixes with the secret of unity?

With the departure of Afghani President Hamid Karzai today to Germany to participate in the Afghanistan Donor Countries Conference, which convenes tomorrow, one of the bases of the anti-terrorism alliance that the United States leads in Afghanistan was attacked by missiles in the southeastern part of the country, wounding one Afghani soldier.

However, Afghani officials complained that the sum they received so far was not enough and that the biggest part of the 2.1 billion dollars spent so far was part of humanitarian aids.
He said, after talks in Moscow with his Afghani counterpart Abdullah Abdullah: "We are in agreement with the Afghani transitional government that the anti-terrorism alliance must not in any case scale back its efforts in Afghanistan."

3 events that happen before our eyes, linked together by the subject of Islam, which takes its place here haphazardly.
The question will certainly lead us to mine fields and killings.
We are puzzled here when we read that a golden era passed by this world and went with no return, leaving us a heritage that seems much more progressive than the ensuing backwardness.

History did not tell that the Umayyad Caliph shed the blood of Al-Akhttal.
* I am confident that the above-mentioned state of gloom was behind the vicious attack on colleague Abbas Saleh.
I do not do that. The uproar caused by television, and all that noise is nothing more than a background noise!" Well.
This title encompasses a great deal of irony, even if the author never put a question mark at the end.
If Woodward had concluded from overstating the expansion of America's role in fighting terrorism and tyranny, indicating that Bush stores a high degree of internal tension in his mind and his aides' minds, Bush never failed to infer it.
How is it possible to talk about even making alliances that will fight America's battles and wars?
And because he is the leader, he does not need more than this (!): "I have no need for explanation.
But he assures Woodward: I am not lowering my tone!
One of the Indian regions has become known as "Kidney City" because many of its residents sold their body parts to foreign patients to the point that some families sell the kidneys of their children as the patient pays a price of up to eight thousand sterling pounds for a kidney to avoid waiting for years for it to be made available by the National Health Service.
The residents of this region embarked on this "trade" more than ten years ago, which gave the suburb of Villivakkam its English-Tamil name, or Kidney Vakkam.
One of the brokers came and urged me to do it, so I was paid the sum of thirty-five thousand rupees, of which I paid eight thousand rupees to the broker.
A woman of fifty-two named Angeli Kazi, who looked older with her wrinkled face and grey hair, said: "I like to sell one of my kidneys because I am in dire need for money.
She added, "I am happy because I did that; I was in need of money and I got paid thirty-seven thousand rupees."
Some hospitals in India enjoy high medical and health standards, but since selling and buying human body parts are illegal, these "procedures are performed in total secrecy at low-standard hospitals where the death rate is high."
The decision, which was issued by the Jordanian Law Interpretation Court, headed by the Chief of the Appeal Court and two judges from the court, the Chief of the Legislation Court, and the Secretary-General of the Ministry of the Interior, as members, allows the government to disband these committees.
The societies appeared to be the spokesman for the Jordanian opposition.
Abu Al-Raghib said, during his meeting on Thursday with the chiefs of the societies, that the government "does not force anyone to normalize, just as it does not prevent anyone who wants to deal with any country with which we have bilateral relations."
At the time, Abu Al-Raghib accused the societies of "appointing themselves as a new authority within the state without any legal basis, and that they have gone as far as installing themselves as inspection courts and centers for issuing forgiveness documents" to whoever backs down from dealing with Israel.

Representative Mohammad Fnaish thought that "forcing the state to expedite the case of the cellular privatization led it to this format, which was questionable before," while Representative Ali Hassan Khalil contended that "the agreement of the President of the Republic Emile Lahoud and the Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri on this format serves the interests of the state and the treasury."
Therefore, we do not see in this format any guarantee to preserve this sum.
There is a question mark about this subject, which will be discussed in the Parliament where everything will be explained."
Does he see the decision as appropriate?
The more important thing than all of this is to adopt transparency, away from doubts in the matter of redistribution."
This deferral resulted from forcing the state compulsion to expedite privatization, and it is that direction is what led the state to this format and these results."
I think the adopted format is in the interest of the country.
The Information Office of President Al-Hoss issued the following statement:
In response to this overt deception, we must set things straight.
All hell broke loose in the face of our government through the media trumpets that are owned or controlled by the current Prime Minister, Mr. Rafiq Al-Hariri, alleging that what the government is warning about has the potential of harming the climates of investment in the country and turning off investors.
The decision was issued for revoking the arbitration clause in the cellular contract on 17/7/2001.
Then where were those who care about the investment environments in the country when the current government annulled two contracts before the end of their terms?
And it is wrong because it abandoned the principle of clearing what the states is owed by the companies and the compensations that they are due.
They also consulted each other on issues related to stimulating administrative work, in addition to subjects that will be put forward before the Parliament in next week's session.
It also achieved a great success that we were all hoping for to demonstrate the international radiance that Lebanon and its capital have restored.
With my best wishes to your Excellency for health, happiness and success, I wish for your brotherly people welfare and prosperity under your wise leadership, with the highest tokens of my brotherly appreciation."
The anniversary of the Day of Independence calls for greatness and resistance for the dear Lebanese state.

"Consultative Gathering of Religious Authorities" Calls For Liberating Jerusalem
- First: We offer Moslems in Lebanon and the world, especially in wounded Palestine, the warmest congratulations and blessings on the occasion of the impending blessed Eid Al-Fitr after the month of fasting and praying and asked the Lord to accept their deeds with our prayers that God Almighty may lift the oppression off of our people and brothers in Palestine so that they may attain their freedoms just like all of the peoples in the world.
It also deplores its re-siege of the Church of Nativity and violating its sanctity, as it did not too long ago, which affirms that this enemy does not respect the sanctity or stature of religious values, whether Christian or Islamic.
-Sixth: We salute the courageous positions of Presidents Lahoud and Al-Assad, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and the rest of the people of the region, and we call upon them to continue to support the Al-Aqsa Uprising so that righteousness and justice may prevail in the end.

After breakfast, Al-Hariri gave the following address: "We were used to meeting in Ramadan at the Al-Maqasid Alumni Society's breakfast, and the meeting was always, and God willing, will always continue to be filled with love, brotherhood, openness and friendship.
Under the patronage of the Prime Minister, represented by the Minister of Economy and Trade, Basil Flaihan, the Chairman of the Board of the Lebanese-Canadian Bank, George Zard Abu Joudah, hosted a breakfast that was attended by representatives and activists.
The efforts of President Al-Hariri reached their potential in the solidarity of the ruling body and the follow-up by President Emile Lahoud.
Mansour Fears Impairing Presidency Role; Calls On Lahoud To Be Monitor, Not Partner
They intended through this atmosphere to sell the state's assets and pawning its resources quickly without discussion from anyone, under the pressure of collapse.
evidence on impairing the institutions is the meeting of the president of the republic and the prime minister for an hour and a half, while the ministers were awaiting its ratification...
He described the agreement that was concluded on the subject of the cellular as "a second scandal," because it infringes on the ruling of the State Consultative Council and the decision of the Accounting Office, through resorting to arbitration and blocking the possibility of pursuing all violations.
And after this swindling, then this came to tell the Lebanese: We drove you to collapse and we will force you to pay again, and you must tighten the belt to sell the state's assets and pawn its decisions.
The agreement that took place was giving in to the position of Rafiq Al-Hariri (...).
French President Jacque Chirac overlooked a lot of issues so that he can secure this cover and this support for Lebanon, therefore, this project cannot deviate from the right path, and consequently, all incoming money will be channeled to the Central Bank."
He contended "that the year 2004-2005 will be the zero year with regards to the budget deficit. The balance of payables is improving and the trade balance is shrinking relative to the deficit, and all these positive indications show that we are proceeding on the right path which will lead to political stability."
Astonished For Difference in Opinion Turning Into "Personal Dispute", "Tripoli Alliance" Calls For Return To Reason; Al-Safadi
He called for supporting the university "to return as it used to be; graduating the elite who built this country."
He hoped that "the second part of the Paris-2 contributions, in the amount of one billion and four-hundred million dollars and which has been allocated for investment projects, will be capable of turning the economic wheel so that the prospects for new job opportunities are open."
He called for "achieving that by the current government, or else, another government, capable of achieving this task, should emerge."
In view of the circumstances incited by the Council of Minister's resolution of the cellular telephone case, the Information Office of the Minister of Communications, Jean Lois Qardahi, issued the following statement, in response to the statement by the Secretary-General of the Supreme Privatization Council, Ghazi Yousef:
All documentation that the state presented to the Chamber aimed at reviewing the general status of the two contracts with the arbitrators without recognizing their authority to resolve the on-going dispute between the state and the two companies.
- Not adopting a proposal by one institution that called for freezing 25 percent of the total book values for risk allocation due to defects or deficiencies in the assets and other articles included in the two contracts.
After the Supreme Council had discussed the conditions, in the presence of the minister and with his acceptance, the conditions he now criticizes were adopted.
This international consulting firm, after assuring the Supreme Privatization Council that the results of arbitration will be in the state favor by a rate of 75 percent, turned around and abandoned the case due to the knowledge of the grave mistakes committed by the minister and his working team after the minister realized that his failure to pursue this case gave the two companies an almost favorable outcome to win the arbitrated conflict."
We did not ask for the impossible to get the possible but rather asked for the reasonable, and adopted the language of number, with all it carries in honesty and transparency, in reading reality and exploring the horizons of the future."
We see in it an embodiment for long-term efforts and sacrifices that we made, as a country and people, for the sake of boosting this trust in Lebanon, in the Lebanese and in the Lebanese economy.
Lets start from this simple popular proverb, "Necessity is the Mother of Invention", that was used as a rule a long time before the Galton studies (1869), which are considered among the first studies to "draw scientists' attention to geniuses" (1), and which made me pause for his extreme eloquence in expressing the fundamental core of the huge sum of cumulative assumptions over the course of more than a century on the subject of creativity, transcribing, or... renewal.
Armored vehicles were driving behind the demonstrators without interfering, and the troops were clearing the way for them.
Radio Baghdad announced the government's decision this morning to dissolve the five Iraqi parties, and they are: the Constitutional Union, the Popular Front, the National Democratic, the Independence and the Socialist Nation, and the banning of ten party and independent newspapers (...).
Nouri Al-Said's security was intensified, as reports received from the Police Directorate showed that there was a plot to assassinate him!
To whom does Camille Salama write his plays?
Camille Salama is stripping himself of the residues of age to remember what has been, with the wisdom of the kid that he was, so that he can repeat it, pure and good, and to use it to restore what indulgence and greed had spoiled by the triumph of good over evil.
They bring down the barriers between them and Luna, the life of the play with her charming laugh and her enthusiasm for "Ahh", the snowman she made and dressed with her cap and woolen scarf so it does not catch a cold from the outside. Inside there is the flame of fire giving warmth, and "Ahh", the flame demon, does not get enough of the wood and wants to taste the curtains and the bedspreads.
Such a love is understood only by kids, since adults remember it, shed tears then forget it, "simply."
Directed By:
I rise to a bright sky, to the eyes of deer overflowing with flashes, to rainbows streaming in my soul.
When the eye is quenched over the fiery drink.
After peace gets together with dew drops and dates.
Or is it a kiss of a dove that brightened the soul, presenting gold to those who know.
The comers are like that summer which is yet to forget their shadows.
Flaunting your beads and the scented herbs.
Make me then walk on the day of torment to the wings of their twists; the edge is aging.
Help me with a kiss form the mouths of the sea to silence my collapse into the lap of the flame.
When the secretary general of the Iran Freedom Movement Ibraheem Yazdi returned to Iran after a medical trip that was extended by a court ruling to detain him in Tehran, many Iranians expected that he would not spend his first night in his home but rather in detention.
For the verbal pelting, exchange of accusations, and sharp statements represent the apparent face of these relations, while this issue moves in Iranian and American circles in an opposite direction, although it is still in the discussion phase without entering the stage of actual work.
And with whom is it being held in the United States?
As a result of that approval of his, he became a target for the arrows of the religious left and the extremist right at that time, which forced him to withdraw from any dialogue about the relationship with Washington, and particularly in the Khatami phase during which this issue became one of the tools of conflict and exchange of accusations between the reformists and the conservatives.
Mirdamadi emphasizes that such a dialogue can reduce the severity of tensions in the American-Iranian relationship.
The conference was attended by the head of the episcopal committee for media services Bishop Rolan Abu Juda, the head of the Christian education committee Bishop Francis Al-Beseir, the vice-president of the media committee Abbot Francois Eid, the manager of the Catholic media center Father Abdu Abu-Kasm, the administrator of the press branch Father Yusuf Munis, and a number of monks, nuns, and media people.
The message stopped at the positives of this new arena and its benefits with regard to culture in that "it is an open window on the world and presents marvelous opportunities for evangelism if used with efficiency and awareness of its strong and weak points."

To him, a noun in the nominative case is in the accusative case, and what is in the accusative case is in the genitive, in addition to the hamzah, which was never in its right place, accordingto him and to other Egyptian literary figures.
When I asked one of the Egyptian colleagues at "Ash-Sharq Al-Awsat" about the reason he said: " by God I don't know.
And believe me if I tell you that I was "fired" from "Ash-Sharq Al-Awsat", where I was treated by those in charge of it with respect and love, because of my inability to go ahead with overlooking mistakes, which the Egyptians refuse to acknowledge, on the pretext that they are 60 million and they are free to do with the Arabic Language what they please!
He pointed out that the Municipal Council has not yet made a decision concerning naming the regions and streets due to the variance in points of view with regard to giving names, and that the work of the Municipality is focused on developing the region first.
* A source at the company explained that the conditions are set because the bill is considered personal, and no one but the owner of the line has the right to demand it.
One citizen asked advertising companies to refrain from pushing children into pamper commercials in the visual media, which damages pure Lebanese values, and must be stopped to protect the feelings of the Lebanese society.
Afterwards, Minister of Energy Muhammad Abd Al-Hamid Baidun told one of the journalists: "Our approach is for all means of transport in Lebanon to run on gas. I have sent a letter to the Standards and Specifications Organization in which I asked for specifications to be approved for car gas, so that there will be no violations of the Law.
With the onset of the Lebanese events, the Army took them over and based itself there. They became the headquarters for the Hasbiya Sector Command. Official organizations left them and were spread among private properties.
No sooner had the Council for the South completed a secondary school for the Hasbiya area in one of the neighboring pine forests than the students transferred to a new building and the buildings remained empty due to negligence, with no official interest, until the occupation of the area ended on the 24th of September 2000, when elements from State Security entered and took one of their wings as their security headquarters.

Paris-2
We do not know why some have chosen to link Paris-2 with the prevailing fashion in Lebanon these days, despite its misery and pettiness. In other words, "the Demonstration" and its prevention by threatening counter-demonstration; we turned into an example before "Paris-2 Demonstration."
It is not clear that the pleas launched by the prime minister the day before yesterday, which is not without a hidden hope, will find their way to the ears and minds while we are involved in divisions and conflicts, despite the general knowledge that it is not possible to help he who declines to help himself, and despite the fact that this simple intuitive logic poses true Lebanese questions stemming from Paris-2, including, for example:
Considering all of this, we are not exaggerating if we say that Al-Hariri seems as the Diogenes of his time but with two lanterns: a lantern for searching for support and backing to the "Paris-2 Demonstration", to try to save the international situation; and a lantern for betting on what's left of sense and sensibility internally in a way that "gives the country a chance" and affirms that we do have trust in ourselves, in our country and in our direction before we ask others to do the same.
He seemed, with a great deal of symbolism that is understood by the Lebanese, like the driver of an ambulance carrying the bleeding injured, which is the financial situation, and is trying to reach the hospital to save him, but it runs around amidst alleys and squares where shelling, sniper fire and ambushes never stop, as has been the case!
Then, the authority won, or so it believes.
This talk may be vague in a country that has gotten used to confusing the state and those holding on to it.
And if more than one question is posed on how were they assigned and who assigned them, they were not in any case commissioned to mismanage it. Otherwise, they would have been suspected of abusing authority, which is a crime punishable by law.
The scenario is inspired directly by the experiences of totalitarianism around us: it starts by declaring martial laws on beliefs, which allows the making of a traitor out of anyone who thinks outside the flock, under the pretext that the region is going through a "critical period". Then, it makes up non-present dangers, first, by attributing premeditated intentions to members of the opposition, and second, by instigating reactions to these presumed intentions by an outspoken minority for whom all platforms have been opened.
Perhaps then, the protective authority will be content with it as a permanent agent for it, and an easy tool for its wishes.
The civilization of the picture, this is what was said of the twentieth century, until we believed that the picture, whether it is photographic, cinematic or television, became stronger than the reality it reflects, or seeks inspiration from, or incites, or preserves in cans.
But the picture of what followed that moment disappeared.
It is wrong because what has been happening in the United States for a month now indicates that national mobilization, even nationalism, is capable of reaching a climax without being fed by scenes of the event that caused it.
This ethical trade rule is not the only factor behind the absence of pictures of the "World Trade Center" victims.
Because no one can follow this rule without withholding all the pictures, according to a number of journalists and European network officials.
No civilization and no picture.
It is a phenomenon that changes televisions into mere radios.
The chaos of news justifies the writing that is piling up on the screen?
The pictures are few and there is plenty of talk.
It agrees with it.
And so is the "Arab street" available for everybody.
A large delegation of Tripoli's Municipality workers, led by Syndicate President Sha'ban Khaddour visited "Tripoli Block" and were received by deputies Muhammad Al-Safadi and Muhammad Kabbara, as well as a representative of deputy Maurice Fadhel.

Two days after American Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs William Burns announced that no decision had been taken on Iraq by America, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said that Berlin would maintain "extreme caution" regarding the expansion of the American campaign against terrorism beyond Afghanistan because this would raise "serious questions" were it to include Iraq without there being evidence for Iraq's involvement in the 11 September attacks.

The newspaper took this to mean that "neither the Ottoman State nor Turkey had any connection of any kind to the Ajyad fortress, other that it came under Ottoman rule, as was the case with the other Arab areas and countries".
It is expected to be finished in 2005.
At present, markets are spread over 180 thousand square meters around the Mosque, whilst the Plan provides for the creation of commercial centres covering 660 thousand square meters.

Before leaving the White House, Bush, aged 55, assured journalists that he felt "great" and that his health was "very good".
He quoted him as saying that he believed he only lost consciousness for a few seconds because when he looked at his dogs, "They were in the same position.
Colonel Tubb clarified that the medical examination had demonstrated that Bush was well.
The cause of what Bush suffered was his body sending a signal to the heart via the lung nerves, causing the heart rate to slow and lose of consciousness.
Dough-based products are well known across the world, but they are usually sweet, not savory, and soft, not hard, like the biscuit that became caught in the American President's throat.
There he exchanged jokes with workers about his loss of consciousness and confirmed that he supported opening markets and creating new job opportunities.
Amman, Basil Rafayaah:
He said, "The most important foundation of the Government Program of Work is to bring about economic development," and called for it to confront the economic crisis from which the Kingdom has suffered for five years. "Let the provision of a respectable living for citizens be the first priority, and let probity and competency be the standard for taking public position, for there can be no place for corruption, favoritism and personal consideration in the progress of national work."
The new government included the former Director of Jordanian Intelligence, Mustafa Al-Qaisi, who is appointed Secretary Of State for the Prime Minster's Affairs; Chancellor of the Jordanian University Dr Walid Al-Maani, given the Higher Education and Scientific Research Portfolio; former Minister of Tourism Muhammad Naash Al-Adwa, awarded the Information portfolio; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Secretary General Shaher Pak, who takes responsibility for Secretary of State for foreign Affairs; and the poet and writer Haidar Mahmoud, appointed Minister of Culture.
An Example from Pakistan
Yesterday, General Parvez himself, now Prime Minister and responsible for Pakistan's general policy, went to the people to offer the greatest concession to India: to commit himself to dismantling the military infrastructure of the Kashmiri resistance movements and prevent "cross-border operations".
The Musharraf of 1999 is the same as that of 2002.
The Lahud political and propaganda machine continues to present this event as evidence of the General's sound reading of the correct national posture. It has been employed elsewhere to settle political accounts with the former President of the Republic Ilyas Al-Harawi and Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri.
And there is a long time between May 2000 and September 2001: Lebanon's legal status has changed.
America is closer to Israel and is on the point of accusing us all of terrorism.
Following 11 September India, after half a century, has gained international support for labeling the Kashmiri resistance "cross-border terrorism".
Despite the fact that he knows that he may pay with his life for this spurt of rationality, rationality which Pakistan has lacked for a long time.
But here too the world is not the same.
Contacts are taking place away from the spotlights with the aim of sounding out views on the possibility of progressing negotiations on the Lebanese and Syrian tracts should talks continue to stumble on the Palestinian front as a result of the continued exchange of violence and the failure to reach agreement on a durable ceasefire.
At the same time, an agreement between Israel on the one hand, and Syria and Lebanon on the other, might give impetus to and speed up the agreement between Israel and Palestinian Authority to prevent the Authority from being the only party outside the peace process.
Resolving the Palestinian question is thus the key to resolving the other issues that make up the Middle East crisis, but solving all the other issues is not the key to resolving the Palestinian question, the solution of which would pave the way for a comprehensive peace.
But full peace in the region can only be achieved by agreement between all the parties, the Palestinian Authority, Syria and Lebanon in particular, and with such an agreement, the problem of Palestinian refugees would have been solved.
"The Electricity Utility is Bankrupt.
If the story of the "life-belt" represents a difficulty that has yet to be resolved, despite the sufferings faced by the people in the bleak midwinter, what about the problem of collection or that of securing the funds necessary for the fuel?
Of course, Kamal Al-Hayek and his colleagues in the new department deserve a chance to try to remedy the chronic semi-paralysis, but the costs of this opportunity are more than the financial capability of the state can bear and more than those people who pay the bills can imagine. They continue to pay, whilst others do not, causing the debts to rise, the burdens to accumulate and the impudent and sick state of bankruptcy to spread.
We do not know how to interpret the words of Deputy Qabbani when he says, "It is the duty of the Electricity Utility to collect and to improve collection by any means, and if there is a need to use force, then let it be so...the legal and security agencies can be called upon."
We do not know why people in Lebanon are waiting to organize themselves into a silent and civilized revolution, initially to stop paying electricity bills and the concession companies hanging on to the mother company, at least so that we can see what those who do not pay or those who squander the current by virtue of social standing, force, authority, revolt or indolence, will do!
It is not the content of what Rod-Larsen said, which is nothing new, that is worth noting - it has been stated on previous occasions and reiterated by UN officials more than once, and Syria knows the UN position and the legal reasons on which it is based - but given that Damascus had affirmed that the area is Lebanese territory, one would have assumed, at least, not a response to Rod-Larsen but confirmation that Syria stands firm in its position that the Shabaa Farms are Lebanese.
And the "prohibition" imposed on it has been lifted in order for it take up this seat, which it last occupied 30 years ago.
This Syrian refusal to discuss with Rod-Larsen this issue in public, according to what is known about his discussions with Syrian officials, has in turn led to a Lebanese refusal to enter into a similar debate, bearing in mind that Rod-Larsen reiterated in Beirut that, from the perspective of the Security Council, the occupied Shabaa Farm land is Syria, and this did not provoke the rancor of those concerned as it used to do.
What was noticeable in the speech of the American President, and in the recent statements made by his National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, was their accusation against Iran and Hizbollah of involvement in the case of the ship smuggling weapons to the Palestinians and the accusation made against Iran of supporting terrorism without any reference or allusion to Syria, bearing in mind that both Iran and Syria remain on the American list of states supporting terrorism.
Damascus knows and has studied these changes more than most countries. The evidence lies in the many signs it has shown after the pressure to disband Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other Islamic organizations with a presence in Syria, for we can say that Damascus has not literally abided by them, but nor has it ignored them either.
The Lebanese may have grown used to this from their leaders, and may not expect anything better, but the image put out to the Arabs has inevitably lost much of its credibility, if not become a laughing stock.
If this is true, then thank God and let us hope that Musa succeeds in resolving the intricacies caused by the previous position of the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, which have become problem in themselves.
Because the Arab summit is the best thing that could happen to a Lebanon fearful of pressures, even when the Syrian stances towards the summit topics, resistance and terrorism, are enough to dissipate, at very least, some of the Lebanese fear.
General Musharraf's Experience Infectious
The first was to resist and fail to respond to the Americans.
The second was to respond to the Americans and subsequently gain their varied support and guarantee their intervention at the appropriate moment to resolve the long-standing problems between India and Pakistan, or at least prevent it from escalating and developing into a full-scale war.
A meeting of interests is closer to reality than the scenarios and conspiracies that are formulated and prepared in dark, closed rooms.
This is not easy because the conditions in one Islamic state differ from those in another and because reason dictates that Musharraf be given a reasonable amount of time to see whether his experiment will succeed.
The Lebanese can express their happiness and joy in the usual way; for example, by using the car horn in the streets and by setting off fireworks in residential areas.
And then the matter was decided and everything was put in place.
And who else but Beirut has this loud voice and this standing in the world?
And with confirmation, determination and decisiveness, Lebanese messengers are bearing to Kings, Presidents and Princes a rare Lebanese decision, the like of which they have not borne before.
And so they would sit so that we could stand nervously.
Scandal of Weapons Ship by President Salim Al-Hiss; Salim Al-Hiss.
America, as usual, rushes to justify Israeli savagery: Secretary of State Colin Powell declares that these Israeli attacks are no more than defensive measures.
What is the position of states overlooking the Red Sea, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Yemen and Jordan, towards this incident?
Is it not possible that this incident has been fabricated by Israel to condemn and embarrass the Palestinian Authority before international public opinion and make it responsible for challenging the American initiative to put an end to the violence in the Occupied Territories?
Notwithstanding the great gulf that separates the Palestinian position of resisting the occupation of its territory and the confiscation of its liberty from that of Israel, which deploys all these weapons to retain territory it has captured, put an end to Palestinian right to self-determination and finish off the Palestinian question, which is supposed to be the Arabs' central issue.
In any case, we believe that the Palestinian Intifada does not need weapons to achieve its aims.
The scene of the child Muhammad Durrah being martyred had greater impact in the world than any subsequent armed operation carried out by Palestinian resistance.
The Palestinian revolutions must, in other words, be the revolution of all Arabs.
Are not the savage Israeli operations against civilians, leaving dozens of Palestinian refugee families homeless, terrorist acts?
New Delhi Makes Withdrawal of Troops Conditional on Musharraf Translating Words into Action, Islamabad.
But he added that India was not looking at the present time to use force in the crisis, which began following the attacks on the Indian parliament on 13 December. New Delhi attributed the attacks to the two Kashmiri groups "Askar Tibah" and "Jaish Muhammad", which are based in Pakistan. He said, "We are not looking to use force and we are at present examining the possibility of resolving this crisis by diplomatic efforts."
But there was conflicting information about whether the source of shooting was separatists or Indian troops.
They said that Indian units had begun shelling at 17:45 (12:45 GMT) without provocation and had targeted the villages of Digwar, Shirikut and Sahrian in the region of Bag, in the south of Pakistani Kashmir.
The main separatist alliance in Indian Kashmir called on New Delhi to respond positively to Musharraf's proposal for a resumption of dialogue.
He was asked whether the campaign of suppression mounted against Islamic groups in Pakistan would affect the separatist movement in Indian Kashmir. He replied that the struggle for self-determination had begun before the intervention of foreign groups and activists.
He said that Powell, whose tour would include India, Japan and Kabul, would hold "bilateral talks" with Musharraf and Foreign Minister Abd Al-Sattar.
The Council of Ministers will discuss in its meeting the day after tomorrow (Thursday) an agenda comprising 21 items, the most important of which include a draft decree to establish a Union of Municipalities in the Ukkar district and a document setting out demands submitted by the Union of Independent Interests Syndicates and Public Institutions to the Ministry of Work.
3. Draft Law to annex services of employees in the Lebanese University, who were deemed to have resigned but subsequently returned to effective service (sent to ministers on 08/01/2002).
6. Draft Decree to amend Decree number 6698, dated 12/11/2001, exempting a stolen vehicle being returned to Sheikh Abd Al-Malik bin Kayid Al-Qasmi from customs duties.
9. Draft Decree to establish a Union of Municipalities in the Ukkar district, Governorate of Northern Lebanon.
13. Request by the Ministry of Social Affairs for approval of the signature of the optional protocol to the "Ending All Forms of Discrimination against Women" Agreement.
a) The first aims to oblige a company to estimate the value of compensation due following termination of the two cell phone contracts.
18. Request by the Ministry of the Interior and Municipalities for approval to secure the credit necessary and authorization to take all measures to conduct elections for members of rural councils deemed to have disbanded, to have lost one quarter of their members or to be newly-established.
Invitation to Participate in Media Conference in Tehran; Subhani Visits President of Editors Syndicate: Unity and Resistance are Lebanon's Guarantees.
Karam thanked Subhani for the invitation and said, "It is our pleasure to participate with our brothers in Iran in their constructive activities, which stem from the faith and stances adopted by Iran at difficult moments. Lebanon is indebted to Iran for many of its stances, which have helped it triumph and assisted it at the difficult times it has known.
Lebanon, Syria, Palestine and the remaining states of the region are thus coming under many pressures, but what is of most concern to us is to stress that submission to Israeli volition and provision of any concession to Israel cannot satisfy Israel's increasing desires and insatiable appetite. In fact, these concessions will encourage them to seek greater retreats and concessions, for which there are no limits.
Lebanon must use all its strength to work to maintain the hidden strength represented by the resistance.
The only logic it has is that of the military machine.
I have known Jan Ghanim since the beginning of the 1980s, if not before then, through friends and acquaintances in Hamana as "Jano", the name that stuck with him until his death,
He came to prominence in his parliamentary activities with the national defense and health committees.
From the security committee to the Brigade Headquarters, where he took part in the uprising of the "forces" on 12 March 1985 against Party leader at the time Aili Karamah, along side Habiqah and Jaajaa. From that time the Kataib and the "Forces" came to be on separate sides.
Jan Ghanim's heart stopped yesterday at the Heart of Jesus Hospital following a coma that had lasted for about two weeks as a result of a traffic accident in Al-Hazimiyyah.
He graduated as a doctor specializing in treating diabetes and glandular disorders in 1975 from Lyons University in France.
He called for the unity of Lebanon, an end to violence and war, and rejected sectarianism.
For more than 25 years he worked in humanitarian and health services at disability centers and clinics.
Ministerial sources have reported that Lebanon has rejected a proposal from Secretary-General of the Arab League Amr Musa to postpone what he has termed since his arrival at Beirut Airport on Sunday afternoon "confirmation of the Summit venue".
They said that as far as Qatar was concerned, the matter was not certain because the Embassy in Beirut had contacted an official to enquire about hotels and reservations from now for members of its delegation to the 14th regular Arab summit.
The statements issued by Lahud and Al-Hariri were judged to be an official public response to Musa and to Libya's attempts, which were based on a significant maneuver with a major Arab country, according to information available to officials about what Libyan agents at the Arab League were doing under the leadership of Abd Al-Munaim Al-Huni.
They believed that the Prime Minister had gone further than was necessary in his official statement, since Musa had not asked for Gaddafi to be named.
No one will be allowed to enter without official permission.
President of the Republic Emil Lahud has reviewed conditions in the country with Deputy Michel Al-Murr. During the meeting current developments and Lebanon's position towards them were assessed and a number of domestic political topics were put forward.
The President of the Republic met with the Minister for Young People and Sport, Sipoh Hufnaniyan, who reviewed with him the general conditions and the projects prepared by the Ministry in the area of organizing sport work.
In the evening Lahud met with Deputy Qablan Isa Al-Khuri, who provided him with an overview dealing with most of the topics of the moment.
"As you return to the land of the fraternal State of Kuwait, after recovering from the health indisposition from which you suffered, it is my pleasure, both in my name and that of the people of Lebanon, to congratulate your Highness on your full recovery and to congratulate the fraternal people of Kuwait on the return of its dearly beloved Amir, safe and well, to the homeland.
President Lahud reviewed with the Director of the Army Intelligence Services, Brigadier Rimon Azar, the security situation in the country.
The tour of Arab League Secretary-General Amr Musa yesterday to Emil Lahud, President of the Republic, Nabih Birri, Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Rafiq Al-Hariri, Prime Minister, and Mahmoud Hamud, Minister of Foreign Affairs, took on a dual importance in view, on the one hand, of the positions announced by these officials, which have crystallized into a consensus to hold the Arab Summit in Beirut on the date set and to unify the official message on the Summit, and on account of the Libyan position, which demands that the summit be moved from Beirut to Cairo, on the other.
President of Editors Syndicate Milham Karam yesterday met at the association's headquarters with Iranian Ambassador Muhammad Ali Subhani and First Advisor at the Embassy Abu Al-Hasan Zaafari in the presence of a number of members of the association's board.
Following the meeting Buiz said, "The visit was to exchange felicitations on the feasts with the Patriarch. Of course, it was an opportunity to discuss the matters from which the country suffers and complains, whether these be political or economic, or relate to the people's circumstances and services. I believe that the conclusion of the discussion was that we have arrived at a catastrophic economic situation in the country."
He was asked what they had discussed in the meeting.
President Bashir Al-Jamil, for whom Jan Ghanim was his right-hand man, called him "Jano". Former Minister Ilyas Habiq used to call him "Jano" from before the time he became leader of the Lebanese Forces and Dr Samir Jaajaa, despite the differences between them, also called him "Jano".
He came across as a senior official authority, giving reassurance that Lebanese American relations had not been affected by the differences in views on terrorism.
Following his meeting yesterday with Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri, Minister of the Economy Basil Falihan confirmed, "The Partnership Agreement with the European Union will strengthen economic relations with Europe and open its markets to Lebanese products."
He then met with Deputy Ayub Hamid, followed by Director General of State Security, Maj. Gen. (Staff) Edward Mansur and artist Mansur Al-Rahbani.
A number of agriculturalists from the same area brought the same complaint to Junbulat and told him that they could not face up to foreign products constantly sweeping the markets and damaging local agriculture.
Junbulat concluded his tour with a meeting held in the village of Al-Dabiyah, attended by Deputy Nabil Al-Bustani, and with a visit to the church of Jadra village, accompanied by head of the village council Father Joseph Al-Qazzi.
It indicated that Abu Asim was the most promising in view of his professional competence, especially after the proposal to appoint an alternative from outside the holders of Foreign Affairs positions was dropped.
Will Al-Sadr Return from Palestine or Libya?
This is the real problem facing the coming Arab summit, not that of Imam Al-Sadr.
The role of the Arab Summit to be held in Beirut (if that is what Israel wants!) is to incite the believers (as in the Al-Sadr speech) to the sanctity of the Palestinian cause and not to trade it, despite the fact that such "faith" has become a charge for which one can be detained in the world, including some of the Arab world.
Kuwait Embassy Responds to Iraqi Minister: His Country Feigns Ignorance of the Prisoner Resolutions
Al-Shawish says that the Kuwaiti statements are inaccurate when the issue of the prisoners is the one of most concern to Kuwait and at the top of its priorities. Iraq, meanwhile, ignores all the humanitarian calls for their fate to be revealed. It further ignores all international decisions and Security Council resolutions concerning the prisoners, which stipulate that they be freed without restriction or condition (Resolution 686 (1991), paragraph (c); Resolution 687/1991, paragraph 30; and Resolution 1284/1999).
How can our statements be inaccurate when there is nothing dearer to us, the Kuwaitis, than to reach a realistic formula to end this humanitarian disaster, which has been on-going for 11 years and which has affected more than 600 Kuwaiti and Arab households?
How can the statements of Kuwaiti officials be inaccurate when a number of Arab officials have tried to involve themselves as mediators in this matter and were accepted, unfortunately with procrastination, postponement and falsification of the facts by the Iraqi side? Perhaps Syrian President Bashar Al-Asad and the former Secretary-General of the Arab League Ismat Abd Al-Majid know the truth of the matter.
The occupying forces (and the Iraqi regime in this instance) are responsible for the conditions, the inhabitants and the prisoners of war in the occupied territory.
Mr Al-Shuwaish says that Iraq took the initiative to effect a positive resolution of the issue under the aegis of the Arab League and under the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and that Iraq has 1137 files relating to the number of Iraqi prisoners in Kuwait.
What is striking is that the Iraqi regime should remember that it has 1137 missing Iraqis in Kuwait six years after Kuwait's liberation.
If Iraq is prepared to turn over this painful page from our history, why does it not cooperate with the tripartite committee, which was convened with the approval and participation of, and under the aegis of the United Nations pursuant to Security Council Resolutions 686 (1991) and 1284 (1998), and is permitted to investigate this humanitarian issue?
At the invitation of the Association of Al-Butrun Village Leaders ("Al-Nahar"), village leaders from the province met for dinner at the Samarna Restaurant in the town of Samar Jubail. Deputies Butrus Harb and Sayid Aql, Governor of the North Nasif Qalush, Head of the Maronite archdiocese of Al-Butrun Archbishop Bulus Emil Saada, Administrative Officer for Al-Butrun Ilham Al-Duwaihi Al-Hajj, and a number of officials from the Al-Butrun and Duma offices attended.
He promised, "The Association of Village Leaders will always work for the service of the public interest and would be one hand to assist the administration.
Governor Qalush spoke and congratulated the village leaders on the formation of their association. He covered the role of the village leader "who keeps in touch with the daily lives of the people and is with them from the cradle to the grave, with the people electing him and he organizing birth, marriage and death certificates, in addition to his administrative role".
The municipal police opened this link road to cars under the supervision of the Head of the Municipality Samir Shaarani after the Emergency Workshop repaired the fractured water main in cooperation with the Tripoli Water Department and prepared the road to reduce congestion.
* The Municipality of Al-Duwair (Al-Nabatiyyah) called inhabitants of the town who wished to surface their private roads, from which three or more homes would benefit within the jurisdiction of the municipality, to submit applications at the municipality headquarters for an inspection and subsequent surfacing.
Commenting on this, Deputy Qasim Hashim said, "...Since the United Nations declared the Blue Line following the withdrawal of Israeli forces, Lebanon has expressed reservations at this situation at more than one point, predominantly the Shabaa Farms and the Kafr Shuba hills, in addition to various areas of land along the Blue Line, notably that of the town of Al-Adisah..."
The Israelis occupied 1800 dunums in 1976 and reoccupied 1200 dunums in 1983.
The weather prevailing over Lebanon for the last three days has been cloudy at times, clear at others. The cold has been everywhere, whether ice in the peaks or very cold air on the coasts.
The total rainfall this year is 399 mm, which compares with 192 mm for this time last year.
It may continue or stop on account of the wind, which plays with the weather as it wishes.
It called on the Lebanese authorities and the security agencies "to stop these practices".
In the desolate area of Aliyyah and Al-Matan Al-Ala ("Al-Nahar") snow-ploughing and road-opening operations have continued, notably in Kafr Al-Salwan, Hamdun Al-Mahattah, Hamdun Al-Dayaah, Balshamaiya, Aliyyah and the villages of the "Hamdun-Al-Jard Al-Ala Union".
For this reason, most of the schools in Aliyyah and the area of Al-Jard and Al-Matan Al-Ala closed.
Pupils were unable to reach their schools in the morning out of fear of slipping.
One week after the snowstorm the opening of all mountain village roads in the area of Rashiya ("Al-Nahar) was completed; however, the accumulation of ice on most of them, has prevented citizens from moving about early in the day. School pupils only reached their schools at 10:00 am.
Following the National Anthem, Archbishop Saada gave a speech focusing on "the importance of the responsibility entrusted to the village leader
Elsewhere, the United Nations Media Office issued the following statement: "After a calm that has lasted 10 days, 9 Israeli military aircraft breached the Blue Line on three occasions on Sunday, the 13th of the present month of January.
Ukkar - "Al-Nahar"
Citizens from the Al-Makhul Street, in the Farah, Qansu and Abu Shaqra buildings, have complained about the power cuts, which continue for several hours, when the supply is available in neighboring streets. They have demanded that it be provided in theirs.
At this time, it also became apparent that the officer was absent and that the person charged with dealing with Division 19 complaints in the Company had been transferred to another, unspecified Directorate.
I repeatedly contacted those responsible at the Utility, but they have done nothing despite their promises to me.
He pointed out that, from the technical point of view, the water will not reach the point where the meter is presently installed, i.e. a high point in an agricultural building.
From Amin Muhammad Tabbarah
"With reference to my previous letter, I can now tell you that the Municipal Council of Beirut has recently begun to restore lighting in Al-Istiqlal and Al-Jazair streets and to repair the faults there.
Unusually, however, the Israeli tale of the operation to capture Karin A has not been woven well.
This haste to announce the arrests at the first sign of American pressure nullified all the arguments about the capability to acquire weapons from the Israelis themselves and the troubled relationship with Tehran, and put the Authority in the position of one found guilty of a crime that has been witnessed at first hand.
What Powell did not say was said by other American officials, who did not hesitate to stick the charge on the Authority, Iran and Hizbollah collectively without any evidence, as if they were preparing to target them with a single stone in order to save time and effort in a rapidly changing, take-away world.
And between Arafat's attempts to escape from the Israeli rock and his failure to comply fully with the American will, the Palestinians find themselves in an Arab climate very different to the reality of 1948.
Of course, Dr Muhammad Al-Atrash does not attribute this high rate to himself alone: it was the combined efforts of the government, institutions and individuals, in addition to other objective circumstances.
We ask you to look at and publish this clarification in your respected newspaper.
As many do not know the extent of the effect of changing petrol types on a vehicle, it may be useful to give a brief presentation on this important topic.
- There is no link between the use of lead-free petrol and engine problems, such as knocking or deficient burning of the petrol after ignition.
The use of lead-free petrol aims to improve the environment by limiting the emission of harmful gases from the exhausts of vehicles running on leaded petrol, which, in turn, limits the health problems linked to the use of leaded petrol.
- We can use lead-free petrol safely in small internal combustion engines, such as motorcycle engines provided that such engines are compatibles with lead-free petrol.
It was nominally closed at an average published price of 1507.50 lira, as it has been for more than 2 years and 4 months.
However, to date, this has not provoked a wave of speculation on an increase in European currencies, the Euro and Sterling in particular, notably following the study published yesterday by National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies, which indicated that industrial activity in the Euro region continued its fall last month. At the same time, it was apparent that the number of unemployed in Germany touched on 4 million for the same period and British industrial production fell by 0.3% in November and 4.8% annually.
- 1.4495 against Sterling, compared with 1.4480.
In line with this move, silver fell with one ounce closing at 4.62 dollars in London, compared to 4.6910 dollars last Friday in New York, after it had settled at 4.65 dollars in the afternoon.
Wall Street and Nasdaq continued their fall due to the impact of Greenspan's speech on the one hand and the fears linked to the seasonal results to be published this week for large companies, such as Intel, Microsoft, IB
The Tokyo exchange was closed due to an official holiday.
In his speech, Al-Qassar referred to the continuing contributions of the Arab Trade Funding Program to encourage trade exchange between Arab states "whether at the level of providing basic information about Arab trade, or at the level of providing the funding necessary for import and export operations". He believed that these contributions were in line with the Arab moves to establish a free Arab trade zone.
He believed that the permanent development of Arab economic labor organization in the manner seen with the Arab Trade Funding Program constitutes the cornerstone for the process of establishing integration on firm foundations to ensure the best for the Arab states.
He spoke about the signing of another agreement with the Lebanese-French Bank to a value of 12 million dollars, which will increase volume of cooperation and facilities provided by the Program to agencies and banks, in the service of the Lebanese economy.
In reply to a question about the Arab states benefiting from the Program, Al-Manai said that most countries of the region were benefiting from the contributions of the Program: "Five years ago, we were dealing with 18 agencies (or banks) and now we have 129 Arab banks, which confirms the comprehensive nature of the cover and that facilities are not limited to any one country".
He pointed out that the Arab Trade Funding Program had begun with capital of 500 million dollars, which had now risen to about 700 million, "bearing in mind that we are keen to distribute profits to shareholders regularly".
Following two weeks of improvement, ready liquidity in the lira fell by 10 billion from the week between 28 December and 3 January as a result of a fall in the volume of money in circulation and a reduction in deposits on demand.
1. Ready liquidity in lira (1) recorded a fall of 10 billion, as a result of a fall in the volume of money in circulation by 8 billion and a reduction in deposits on demand by 2 billion lira.
4. Development of the cash block in its wider sense (4) over the year reached 4.38%.
1 = cash in circulation + deposits on demand.
Cash rule = cash outside Bank of Lebanon + current banking deposits with Bank of Lebanon + term banking deposits with the Bank of Lebanon.
Egypt is thus required to make available 1.6 billion dollars annually to resolve its chronic unemployment problems given that the cost of one job opportunity is 50,000 pounds."
Kuwaiti Fund Delegation Visit Lahud and Birri; Al-Humaidi: New Loan Today to Complete Funding of Al-Laitani Project at Birri Birri.
Lahud was acquainted with the work of the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development and the projects that it funds but which are executed by government departments under the supervision of the Development and Construction Council by Al-Humaidi.
"I had the honor of meeting Speaker Nabih Birri. The aim of the visit was to inform His Excellency about the work of the Kuwait Fund.
And as we promised, the agreement, under which the Kuwait Fund will provide a loan of 20 million dinars to fund the project, in addition to other contributions from the Arab Fund, will be signed.
We note that the first operation under which it attacked Lebanon in 1978 was called Operation Al-Laitani.
In this context appears a new book by Abd Al-Qadir Al-Jannabi, who, in addition to being a poet, continues to follow his career along another path, which does not conflict with that of his innovation.
Al-Rumaihi says that his confidence in Prince Khalid is great on account of the latter's long experience in cultural work and describes the Institute as promising and embodying the meeting of Arab capital and Arab culture.
The poet says, "Even the colors of the painting, the blue of the virgin's dress, the natural emerald and the absolute redness of the Dracula red, replays the essential musical notes which are at the heart of our being human and our desire to escape everything that limits us...". Bonfoi asks whether, apart from our desires and outside reality and its conventional forms, there is anything beyond the Self, a Word or Divine existence?
We can say that it is a cloud that has been able to take different forms through history without change to its content, as happened, for example, in the children's story of Snow White, who slept for a hundred years in a miraculous wait for love and its appearance in the form of a brave knight on a white horse coming from a vivid red horizon.
The military court had issued a ruling last November declaring that it did not have the jurisdiction to continue to examine the case.
Whereas, on the basis of the provisions of Article 8 of the Law of Public Exemption number 84/91, from the date they were perpetrated, all crimes of assassination or attempted assassination of political leaders committed prior to 27/03/1991 are deemed to have been referred to the Council of Justice for judgment;
Therefore, we charge persons unknown as having perpetrated at the Mari Jirjis Monastery, Aukar, and on a date for which the period has not yet expired, an assassination attempt on the leader and members of the Lebanese Front, which included President Kamil Shamaun and other political leaders.
Palestinian Rima Salih Saad, aged 30, attempted to kill Laila Hasan al-Jardali, aged 37, wife of her employer, dentist Jamal Muhammad Rashid Salim Hamud, aged 46, in her home in the village of Al-Hilaliyyah, east of Sidon, by stabbing her repeatedly with a knife, before throwing her to the floor struggling in her blood.
Two months ago she stole the keys to the dentist's home from his clinic and made a copy of the house key. On 10/01/2002, whilst the dentist and his family were away from home, she went there, stole the jewelry of his wife Laila. She then set fire to the house and sold the jewelry in the market to Husain Ali Gh.
They were arrested and the stolen jewelry was seized with them. They claimed that they had purchased the jewelry after the Palestinian Rima had claimed that she owned it and that she needed the money.
they left their residence documents and Rima was remanded to trial on the charge of attempting to kill her employer's wife, set fire to the house and steal the jewelry. The crime confirms to provision 549 of the Punishments Law and the death penalty is prescribed.
The second individual assisted the first in stealing vehicle cassette players and other effects inside the vehicle. Both sold the effects and divided the money between them.
The Public Relations Department of the Internal Security Forces have distributed the following announcement: " The Directorate General of the Internal Security Forces, pursuant to the instruction of the Public Appeal Prosecutor in the south, Jamil Bairam, have made public the photograph of Muhammad Ali S.
Al-Hindi will be transported from his place of detention in the Rumiyyah Prison directly to the Sayyidat Al-Bisharah Church for a period of two hours, accompanied by members of the Internal Security Forces, in order to take part in the burial and final viewing of his mother, who died last Friday following a chronic illness.
On the reason for his rejecting the request made by the editor of Al-Hayat, detained colleague Habib Yunis on an earlier and similar occasion, he said, "The investigation with Yunis had not yet finished and the charge sheet in his file had not yet been issued".
It is understood that the investigation include the captain of the vessel, a Syrian who part owns the ship, and a Lebanese maritime agent, who obtained permission for the Bengali detainees from the General Security Department to bring them into Lebanon for 48 hours, provided that they leave Lebanese waters at the end of that period, after they have traveled from their country on the vessel on which they are now detained.
It is noted that a German security delegation had visited Adum before
He added, "When we draw up the draft Permanent Appointments Laws and it comes before the Chamber of Deputies, they strike once more.
He hope that those contracted would primarily concentrate on the Permanent Appointments Law, which would take its time in the Chamber of Deputies until the Civil Service Council set a date for the Permanent Appointments examinations.
He added, "The implementation workshop for school buildings, the corner-stone of which we have already laid, starts next March. We will meet with the Chairman of the Development Council soon to this end. We will have about 150 new schools in all areas."
Lebanon's Hotels: History, Nostalgia and Future.
"Lebanon's Hotels: History, Nostalgia and Future" is the second title, following on from "Lebanese Industry: History and Civilization", published by Capt. Joseph Al-Raidi in volumes by which he seeks to inform about "the long history of the economy and tourism in Lebanon and the extent of its worth, experience and excellence, which allow it to meet the challenges of the future".
But important historical stages have changed much in this industry and put it in front of new demands towards constant development...".
The first section, Back to Roots, returns to the time of Phoenicians and their accommodation and travels, continuing through the religious tourism seen by Lebanon in the first centuries AD when pilgrims traveled to the holy places, notably in Palestine, passing through Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and other countries.
The second section of the book, "A Trip through Memories", focuses on Beirut and the splendor and lights in Al-Burj Square before moving to the regions: The Mountain: Heart of Lebanon and the reminiscences associated with it; The Beqaa: Romance of the Plain; the North: Happy Nights; and the Dreamy South.
The book calls 1974 "The Year of the Summit and the Fall", and then begins to discuss the dusting off and the return of the dancer to light the nights of the East.
Perhaps some like the Weakest Link so much that they have exaggerated their praise for it, talk of its success and the manner in which it is presented, which those responsible for it have tried to make comparable to the similar original, which the Lebanese have been able to watch over the satellite, even to the extent of matching the haircut and spectacles of the presenter.
During the voting it is clear how the bigger players are able to push the smaller ones to adopt their way of voting, so that they burn each other up and leave only the bigger players at the end of the game, when the clock stops and the struggle comes to have no limits for them. This embodies the capitalist mentality of competitiveness where only the strong, and not just the good, survive. Strength does not require that one stand on the side of truth, but with the strength, on the basis of the saying that "Truth is Power".
This is similar to the situation of some developing countries, which strive to win a point here and a point there at the expense of the larger countries, which allows these countries to win some points in order that they be kept busy with one another and it remains on top of the struggle.
In this respect the weakest link is an exemplary program in expressing the reality of life in the world, and no one has the right to object to the attack to which one of the players is subject when they make a mistake, since there is no room for mistakes in a game which is supposed to be played by adults, i.e. those with more knowledge and technology. Otherwise, they will end up like Afghanistan, when it decided to confront the United States.
The National Union of Private Associations contracted with the Ministry of Social Affairs has organized a protest movement at the failure to pay their salaries and financial dues for the months of November and December.
He added, "The problem of the Private Associations is this: 79% of the Ministry of Social Affairs' allocations have been withheld and how can this Ministry, which it was said would solve or help solve social and economic problems, work when 79 billion lira is today being withheld from it. Why this Ministry?
We hope to cover as soon as possible the urgent portion despite the difficult financial circumstances. But our aim and concern is to alleviate people's problems so that we, and not the people, bear them.
The delegation from the Private Associations then proceeded to the Ministry of Finance where they met Minister Fuad Al-Sinyurah, who promised to look into their demands.
Colleague Antwan Shidyaq, representing the Syndicate of Editors, spoke at the conference. He said that education in Lebanon was in need of patronage because it concerned the Lebanon of tomorrow and future generations.
Remember that the hourly contract rate at the secondary stage of education is 24,000 Lebanese lira; the rate for the primary stage is just 6,000 Lebanese lira, which clearly demonstrates the extent of the injustice and deprivation."
- The hourly rate shall be retrospectively increased for the years following the decision to increase the salaries of all government employees and teachers.
- The number of years of experience and university qualifications shall be taken into account."
Student Khalid Rammal Muhammad Al-Salah will debate his Masters thesis, which is entitled "Common Points of Doctrine in Judaism and Christianity and the Stance of Islam towards Them" at 9:30 am tomorrow morning (Wednesday) at the building of the Imam Al-Awzai Faculty of Islamic Studies, Al-Tariq Al-Jadidah.

What was the result of the meetings, which continued until 9 pm?
They informed them of the decision taken by the "Student Government" to suspend lessons.
The students distributed two statements; the first addressed the academic staff, accusing one of them of sowing discord.
In the second statement, which was addressed to the students, the student government covered some problems, saying, "Either we have freedom within ourselves or it will not exist, liberating and not restricting us.
People who work to put an end to us because we took part in the bread of true independence and rejected the bread of false independence among the columns of the university, and because we want a solution to the problem of the new Finance Law, bearing in mind that the suspension of the strike on Monday was conditional on implementation of these promises and a solution to the bus problem. The response, as if to put pressure on the students, was to pay a subscription allowance for the car park.
Our work today is to justify to the University our rejection of its unfair policy and that we, as students, will be one hand in confronting all the means of pressure imposed upon us. The closing of classes today (yesterday) is no more than an expression of our rejection of the status quo but without us closing the door to dialogue."

American investigators said that they are convinced that Abu Zubaydah is now trying to activate sleeper cells in the Al-Qaeda network in order to mount new attacks on the United States and its allies.
It noted that he was careful not to raise suspicions about himself and for this reason his name had not been included on the American Ministry of Justice's list of suspects involved in terrorist activities as those of the other known members of the organization had been.
They pointed out that he was, for example, responsible for volunteers in Peshawar, Pakistan, and that he determined the missions that the volunteers would carry out abroad.

Egypt intends to buy 4 rapid patrol boats that can be used to fire anti-ship missiles and Phalanx artillery.
American aircraft carriers were the main base for American air attacks on Afghanistan. They reached their locations in the Gulf within just 5 days by passing through the Canal, as opposed to a further 20 days required for the journey around the Cape of Good Hope.
In an unprecedented step 15 reports on the strategic importance of the deal were submitted to Congress and the Senate.
Bin Ami arrived in Cairo in October and this month submitted his papers for approval to the Egyptian President, Husni Mubarak, but he had not yet moved into his residence, which is different to that used by his predecessor Zafi Mazil.

Washington - Reuters - Sources in the Congress have reported that the former intelligence official Britt Snider is to head the investigation to be conducted by the two intelligence committees in the Congress and Senate into the reasons for the failure of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in predicting the 11 September attacks, despite some objection on the basis that he was very close to the agency, making it difficult for him to form independent views.
Following a closed session on Wednesday, the Congress Intelligence Committee approved the start of the investigation following discussion dominated by differences over Snider's neutrality.
However, Pakistani officials, led by President General Pervez Musharraf, cast doubts on his confession, whilst American President George Bush expressed hope that Pearl was still alive.

Whether I was right or wrong, I had my reasons.
Commander of the Al-Sind regional police, Inspector General Sayyid Kamal Shah, explained that half of those involved in the operation were currently held, bearing in mind that the police are holding just 4 people, including Said.
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said that he was not in a position to confirm Pearl's location, whom Bush "strongly" hoped was still alive.
We will continue our work with him. We will put pressure on him. We will ask him where Pearl is being held.
Bin Ladin Most Probably Alive, Possibly in Pakistan; Knowledge of Al-Qaeda members in Lebanon.
Sources reported that they had agreed that the threats were serious but this did not mean that Tehran and Baghdad would submit to them.
- Afghanistan has taken a step on the road to peace.
- Most probably he is still alive.
* How would you assess the work of the symposium?
They noted that European contact with the Israeli Prime Minister would not be beneficial because he was armed with absolute American support, which has made the Union and more than one European foreign ministers make stinging criticism of American bias, against the positions of George Bush in particular.
It quoted the spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Minister Hamid Rida Asfi, who is accompanying Minister Kamal Kharazi on his visit to Bangladesh, as saying that "this information is old, incorrect and inaccurate".

* In Islamabad Ghirat Bahir, spokesman for Hizb-i Islami, which is led by Qalb Al-Din Hikmatyar, stated that the latter was prepared to leave Iran, where he lives in exile, if this would help improve relations between Iran and the United States.
He pointed out that Hikmatyar had been planning to return to Afghanistan last year, but he changed his mind for "specific" reasons.
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Perez confirmed yesterday, "The immediate declaration of a Palestinian State will get us past the impasse". He affirmed that he had failed to persuade the American administration of his point of view.
Then international support must be secured, but we see a difference between the United States and the European Union.
We inferred this in 1996.
It convinced the Palestinians that they are subservient and come under the State of Israel, as was the case in the past.
For this reason a path has been prepared to reach the final solution and will be implemented gradually, according to stages determined previously (...).
(The proposals) comprise the following stages...return to stability and establishment of a ceasefire, allowing progress on the political front.
Talks on the final solution would begin in the eighth week following a ceasefire and conclude within a year.
The FBI previously reported that Al-Mihdar was a Saudi national and one of the five hijackers on board flight 77, which crashed into the American Ministry of Defense, the Pentagon.
It quoted a security official as saying that the dead man "was one of the most dangerous to be pursued by the security services for some time on a charge of belonging to Al-Qaeda and perpetrating terrorist acts," noting that he "had received high-level military training whilst in Afghanistan".
Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Salih has recently spoken of the security forces pursuing three Yemenis thought to be members of Al-Qaeda.
The fact is that to deal with the dire economic, financial and living conditions requires difficult decisions, some of which will harm large sections of the people, whilst others will affect large merchants and owners of monopoly agencies, which causes the voices of protest to increase.
A review of the status of monopoly agencies undoubtedly provokes the anger of those who have benefited from them for 60 years, given that these agencies are limited to a small group of major merchants and importers, who represent economic and financial figures and prominent persons and who form one of the centers of power in the country, a center that is hard to touch.
The disturbances that are preceding the results of the implementation of value-added tax and the review of monopoly agencies are thus disturbances with political background or a background of self-interest.
Some of these measures concern maritime estates, the excess in government departments, a review of the status of the Chamber of Deputies, the Supreme Aid Authority and other organizations and councils that can be dropped in order to relieve the pressure on the Treasury and reduce spending. This is to stop the waste of public money as far as is possible in all its different forms, including the continuing corruption in some departments and organizations.
Emil Khuri
Chance would have it that most monopoly agencies are Christian and most petroleum agents are Muslim, and so the blessing of liberalization and the opening of the way to imports, replaces justice with oppression in balancing out the two monopolies and the people enjoy the blessing of moderate prices.
In the sense that optimism constitutes one sectarian affiliation and school of thought, whilst pessimism another.
As the recent crisis reflected the chronic split between the state and the people.
But this has been lost in the preparation, the resistance, the clamor, the suspicion and sectarianisation.
But there is one monopoly that dominates us: oppressive injustice and an overwhelming weight from above.
Arafat has been in the fiery swamp of the Ramallah siege for weeks, but his patience is waning thin and he wants to get out.
Of course, there is no need to answer.
Even were the above decisions merely a contrived exercise, can we begin to imagine the emotions of Palestinian and Arab public opinion no more than 48 hours later when the hear news of an armed incursion into the Gaza Strip resulting in six Palestinian dead and dozens wounded?
Of course not.
Recognition of 1967 Borders, Evacuation of Settlements and Return of Refugees.
It also accepted the evacuation of Jewish settlements in the Jordan plain and the Gaza Strip, provided that it would incorporate the major settlement blocks, which contain 80% of settlers.
The first concerned return to Israel, for which no numbers were agreed, but the unofficial paper speaks of 25,000 in the first three years of implementation of the plan, and a figure of 40,000 refugees annually for the first five years was mentioned verbally.
It also agreed to make Jerusalem an open city.
He quoted Advisor to Ehud Barak and the Director of his office at that time, Jalaad Shir, as saying that the document was just "scribble".
And there are serious doubts about whether the lessons of the present Intifada will allow the Governments of Israel to adopt these same positions."
Successive developments in the wake of approval of the draft general budget for 2002 by the Chamber of Deputies have released a range of very negative indicators, with the spat between the government and economic organizations over the abolishment of commercial monopoly agencies and liberalization of medicine imports forming only a small part.
Some confirm that the media campaigns against the Prime Minister would not have gone as far as they did unless they wanted to exploit the distance drawn by the President of the Republic.
In parallel, the government has been obstructed in carrying out what it had intended to be a moral step before being a practical one, irrespective of whether these steps were innocent or otherwise, for ultimately the abolishment of protection for monopoly agencies, as in the case of liberalization of medicine imports, may have a positive effect.
According to specialist observers, this indicates one of two things: Either there is a new policy on information technology or the payments budget has some negative aspects and the Bank of Lebanon does not wish to publish negative information, given that this would imply a difficulty in covering the commercial debt and the consequences this would have for the principle of transparency of information, given that much of the information at the present time is damaging and harmful and, as such, there is no need for it.
Amidst the glory of the chatter about exclusive rights, monopolies, agencies and trades, and a preoccupation with what comes next, there passed the furtive glance that Jacques Chirac set aside for Beirut.
And the tale of monopolies and the debate surrounding them occupied the whole country without exception.
The brothers took offence, and they had the right to!
And they left the door open for other measures, which may go so far as a withdrawal of ambassadors and unsheathing of swords.
So let's say that God is kind, that it was noticed and the new boycott will pass with apologies, smiles and embraces.
"Zayyan"
He said that the Court "believed in the first instance that the Investigating Magistrate had no right to consider himself as competent in respect of the crimes presented on the basis of a comprehensive jurisdiction that is not recognized by international law".
The legal advisor to the Belgium Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jan Daveddar, predicted that the ruling would encourage Belgium to drop the case against Sharon.
- The decision was a shock for international humanitarian law and a step backwards for the rejection of the immunity established by the international courts and competent authorities.
- The court in the Hague focused on the fact that immunity did not constitute a pardon and that following up the case was important, especially for people like Amosiron, who do not have immunity.

Of course, matters are always complicated in Lebanon where the arbitrariness of the ruling class must also corrupt the "perfection" of the class contradiction, not to mention the hidden intentions that quickly become semi-public in the name of "sectarianisation". Then everyone seeks the forgiveness of God at this metamorphosis as if it had just entered the life of the nation but without anyone daring to refute the sectarian dimension to which a modest reference was made.
Nor can the fury of the campaign be explained by some of the visual media, which is usually compelled to ruminate on the higher national interest on behalf of their exclusive agents, the lords of censorship and political security, finally finding an opportunity to express the oppression they feel.
But none of that should diminish the significance of the context against the government's proposal.
For the issue is not a battle between those who have monopolies and the deprived.
In this sense, a class-based analysis will only be correct if it also includes the "old" and "new" classes in Lebanon, but also the classes in control and those trying to gain control in countries that belong to the same geographical and economic area, but enjoying one "major benefit": they are not governed by laws as much as they are governed by customs and, sometimes, by the scales of pure power.
Or let us at least say that it may prevent the trade area from becoming a dedicated arena of secret wars, similar to the police stories in circulation in Lebanon and Syria, or indeed the Arabian peninsula, by virtue of the integration of interests, or the lack thereof, between the laws.
Birri then met with Armuni along with members of the fund in a courtesy visit.
Former Deputy Habib Sadiq welcomed the plan to abolish monopoly agencies but he questioned "the competence of the government authorities, in both their visible and invisible wings, to bring about this required move".
But this does not, and should not, prevent clear and firm positions being adopted on the principal issue, the subject of this furious clamor.
Here the Lebanese, with the exception of those with an individual or group interest, join to welcome the lifting of every official order concerning monopoly agencies, in particular those that have a monopoly on the things which people cannot live without, such as food, medicine, clothing, educational items and housing.
Does the request for a tax on added value imply a change of method has taken place in the tools of government, one that aims for the good of the country and its servants, or is it a measure that will increase the severity of the present crisis and add to the misery of the wretched, who form the vast majority of the people?
The Defense, Interior and Municipal Councils Committee has unanimously approved the draft law for a security agreement between Lebanon and Armenia, but has postponed a decision of the draft law relating to organization of civil aviation in order to examine some of the observations made by Deputies.
We therefore discussed the draft at length without going into the details of the articles.
The Chairwoman of the Deputies Committee, Bahiyah Al-Hariri, stated, "This is the third meeting that we have allocated for this project, which requires more detailed examination in order to ascertain the real need for secondary teachers, to secure schools' requirements and thereby decide on the excess teachers. We have begun to draw up plans for the coming stage, to distribute teachers among schools according to requirements without resorting to contracts by opening the Faculty of Education in the manner specified by the Ministry.
In response to a question about the amendments made to the draft relating to secondary teachers, she said, "We incorporate precise amendments in order to maintain the level of teachers, specialization and competence, which make them suitable as secondary teachers. We also take into account social and educational circumstances."
She added, "The transfer of teachers from one school to another can no longer take place in the traditional way, as was prevalent. It now requires a Causal Decree issued by the Council of Ministers and on condition that transfers take place before the start of the academic year."
Health Investment: Our Salvation from Poverty.
The report, which is titled "Macroeconomics and Health: Investing in Health for Economic Development and Progress", stressed the urgent need to put people at the heart of the matter.
But we must be more determined to improve living conditions for hundreds of millions of poor who do not obtain a fair share of the world's wealth and opportunities.
Health directly contributes to human security.
Basic health services can be provided for 34 American dollars per person per annum.
Namely, an amount equivalent to one cent for every 10 dollars of the Gross National product of the wealthy countries of the world.
The key to lasting work and effective results certainly lies in health becoming a priority at the highest levels of political leadership.
The Commission recommends establishing macroeconomics and health commissions in each country, the task of which will be to determine the tangible steps necessary to support the health system and organize the known and effective methods of protection against the principal diseases of poverty.
The countries of the world have no interest in ignoring an opportunity like this to carry out effective work for the benefit of future generations and to preserve the health of the peoples and the earth.
Therefore, Friday the 10th of Dhu Al-Hijjah 1422 AH, which corresponds to 22nd February 2002, will be the first day of the blessed Al-Adha Feast.
Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri yesterday issued an administrative memorandum requiring the closure of public departments and organizations and municipal councils on 22, 23 and 24 February on the occasion of the Al-Adha Feast.
Lahud met with Minister of Communications Jan Lui Qirdahi and discussed with him the Ministry's projects and the results of contacts about the cell phone.
"We praised the patriotic stances adopted by President Lahud, notably his firm defense of Lebanon's right to resist, to reclaim its occupied land and to liberate its prisoners from Israeli prisons.
And as we have become accustomed, the position of His Excellency was very positive as regards lifting this deprivation and improving the region, so as to make redundant the expression "marginal regions".
The President of Republic sent a telegram to Patriarch Aghnatiyos IV Hazim congratulating him on his recovery following the road accident in which he was involved whilst traveling from Lebanon to the Patriarchal Headquarters in Damascus.
It also approved opening of imports of petroleum and gas materials and their derivatives. The decision will take effect three months after the date it was issued.
Hamadah later said, "It was an extended working meeting, from which the following decisions emerged: First, the Returnees file remains as stated in the National Accord document at Al-Taif and continues to receive the support and commitment of the Lebanese State at all levels, from the President who
At the same time, he stressed "the right of the Lebanese people to strive to reclaim the rights of which they have been raped, to liberate their occupied territory, free those detained in prisons of the occupying powers and end the on-going Zionist violations and threats against Lebanon."
Prime Minister Al-Hariri responds to those who criticize his stance of monopoly agencies by asking, "Can I become Karl Marx?"
Al-Shuf - Al-Nahar
Elsewhere, Musa opened a workshop organized by the Lebanese Association for Environmental Protection in cooperation with the Friedrich-Eibert Institution, to draw up the working plan for 2002-2004 at 9 am this morning at the Bristol Hotel.
* The Committee for the Protection of the Ahdan Remote Area and Al-Mukmil Mountain urged officials to intervene to protect the woodland of Karam Sadhu Sabaal, Ibtu, Saraal, Al-Tuffah farm, Arabah Qazhiyah and the sacred Qadishah Valley against the dangers posed by the sandalwood worm.
In a statement issued by it, it outlined the reasons for postponing the departure for several days, hinting at the concerns of the relevant government agencies, starting with the internal security forces, which inspected Al-Kasarah and conducted the initial investigations, and continuing with the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of the Interior and the Municipalities.
On this basis, and under funding from the World Bank Mediterranean Technical Environment Assistance Program, a project was begun in March 2001 to manage harmful waste.

This matter of the ten colleagues poses a fundamental question: Why were they detained?
Eid appears to be certain that I have rushed to interpret the expression attributed to President Al-Asad, and says, "It would have been better for Hadidi's reading for him to have waited and checked the sources for the evidence and the veracity of those sources."
My sources were (in addition to the Arab press and the news agencies, which I have no reason to accuse of deliberately and willfully distorting Al-Asad's words) the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), which I doubt is as reliable - at least in the official documentary sense - as "a Baathist friend allowed, to some extent, to know matters from the inside", whom Eid questioned about the veracity of the expression. The Baathist friend responded that "he had only heard it in the press comment, but had not seen it in official sources" and consequently "expressed his surprise".
And, secondly, I wrote the article in Al-Quds Al-Arabi not to commemorate the 20th anniversary (notwithstanding the fact that I believe this anniversary to be a fundamental break in the duty of commemorating recent and contemporary Syria memory, which is wholly at odd with the "picking the wound" story), but as a central part of the comment on the statements of the Syrian President in relation to terrorism, and to make clear the disastrous political, security, economic and social aspects of the "Syrian experiments" in combating terrorism.
And he will see that society is with him because our people are good and our nation as generous as the father who forgives the prodigal son."
Tripoli Port - Al-Nahar.
The vessel's arrival was accompanied by talk of several ports refusing to accept the sugar it was carrying because it was sub-standard.

Economic Expert Kamal Hamdan yesterday gave a lecture at the headquarters of the Al-Maqasid Graduate Association on "The Economic Reality and Fiscal Policy in Lebanon".
He added, "What has been spent on construction and the pursuit of the policy of consolidating the divorce between industrial, agricultural and commercial sectors has not benefited the veins of the economy." He warned of the "danger of continuing with things as they were, with the deficit eating into resources, which could reach the point where the state is unable to meet its payments."
He responded to what has been said about cash fixing being in the service of the poor saying, "This fixing, which has helped to create the large public debt, impoverishes the middle classes and the poor, because financing and servicing the debt is done through taxes and from the pockets of the poor."

Ghandour spoke first and noted, "The Saudi market is a market for Lebanese products given that the Kingdom is the biggest importer of Lebanese products. The North's share of the week and the accompanying activities in Riyadh is fair."
Tomorrow, when Lebanon joins the World Trade Organization, then competition between Lebanese merchants and everyone else will reach Lebanon itself.
He said, "Lebanon today stands at a crossroads: Either it must continue its efforts in all fields to achieve tangible development, control the budget deficit and deal with the public debt, or it must surrender to the present situation, submit to the conditions that limit economic development, make distinctions between Lebanese people and increase social contradictions.
And what these forces cannot resolve, the official department can resolve and, if necessary, legislation can deal with such matters."
He said, "I support the abolishment of protection for monopoly agencies if it will lead to a reduction in prices, maintain quality and protect the Lebanese market and foreign speculators.
The Syndicate of Medicine Importers and Warehouse Owners believed that monopoly agencies in the sphere of medicine had been lifted 20 years ago; the decision allowing parallel imports by importers other than agents had been in effect since 1992.
The final recommendations from the work of the Conference, which has held over two days at the Phoenicia Intercontinental Hotel and organized by the Economic and Business Group, were issued yesterday as follows:
- Urge government to formulate policies to provide services in remote and deprived areas, since private sector investments has shown notable success.
- Note the limited circulation of cell phones in the region, despite there being 20 million lines, which is no more than those of a major European capital, and the limited frequency space available to users in the region, given that the present total is about equal to that taken up by 512 individual connection cables in the United States.
Are medicine and treatment the right of every citizen, and should they be subject to controls so as to become available to all?
For example, imposition of control over the price of medicines and prohibition of monopolies would save the government a lot of money, which currently ends up in the pockets of the importers.
The large profit margin made by the monopoly agency and the failure of officials charged to check the accuracy of the recommended prices in the country of origin help to raise the prices of medicines when there is no competition to the monopoly on medicine. The Social Security Organization, it should be recalled, previously conducted a successful trial, in which it imported a selection of medicines being sold in pharmacies and from the same source and sold it to those covered by the security at half the price adopted by the pharmacies.
The government move to abolish the monopoly on medicine is good, provided that it does not hide a sharing of unrestricted profits and give an opportunity for new sharks to enter the market.

Lebanese Wind Quintet Evening: Lively Rise to Korsakov's "Bee".
Perhaps this music, as it was presented in the four selections, bore in its composition a geometric construction more than a literary value in which the ear would find expression and, on its wings, reach the peak of emotion.
Enjoyable expressions, easy to absorb, but what skill they required from the breathing of each player, a skill that was still apparent in the second half of the evening, with Kloghart's quintet, as was the harmony that we had noticed gracefully and sharply penetrating the nature and mood of the work.
The humming brought out from the instruments, from the lungs of the players, moving pictures that each instrument then colored according to its qualities and the vivacity and skill of each player.
Beirut Investigating Magistrate Riyadh Abu Ghida referred for trial before the Sole Criminal Judge in Beirut the two owners of an internet company and shop selling mobile phones on charges of conducting international calls on the mobile lines and selling them to third parties illegally without the calls being routed via the government's central exchange, a misdemeanor under paragraph 1 of Law 623/97.
In doing this, they intended to lease them for international calls via the internet or via an artificial "link" line. They also intended to continually change the lines they purchased after asking the mobile company to cancel and replace them. All of the above was to conceal their use of these lines for illegal international calls and avoid paying the fees due from them to the government, which has cost the Treasury million of Lebanese liras.

You work in silence, remain awake without tiring or becoming bored for the security of citizens and the well being of the country. You remain steadfast in the face of self-interested conferences and stand against the treacherous Israeli enemy with honor, sacrifice and determination.

The request dealt with what it viewed as an error in the application of Article 182 of the Punishments Law "which prohibits the pursuit of one act twice and we have established to the Military court that this act was pursued at the time, for the same crime, before another authority, namely Chief Investigating Magistrate in Mt Lebanon, against those bringing this appeal.
The appeal concluded by calling for "the case to be seen as falling outside the period and a ruling for the public right brought against Kairuz and Samahah to be set aside on account of the 3 year rule and on an account of the previous case involving the same incident, and for the investigation organized by the Intelligence officials with the clients to be ignored and removed from the file on account of it violating legal principles."
Afifah Karam was born on 26 July 1883 in the village of Amshit, which, at that time, prospered politically, socially and culturally.
She wrote books and stories, devoting herself to writing, which filled the gap caused by her longing for her hometown of Amshit, to which she never returned, and strengthened her, as she suffered from poor health and was deprived of children.
She was thus the first female journalist from Lebanon and the Arab World and was "a pioneer in the writing of the novel and the long story, which only a very limited number of Arab writers had dared to write".
She was helped in doing so by the liberated environment to which she moved.
She, who was forced to marry, bore the banner for the freedom of women to choose their marriage partners.
She wrote, "Father, is the suffering of your daughter equal to the satisfaction of the priest?

This emigration is not restricted to them: it includes both Muslims and Christians. Its cause is not religious persecution but a continuation of the path of our forefathers in leaving the country on account of the limited land available in Lebanon, and on account of the aspirations of the Lebanese and their success in countries abroad.
He stressed, "Democracy cannot be divided. Deterioration in the quality of Christian representation will lead to qualitative tyranny over quality for Muslim representation, which will certainly harm Muslims. This reality can be seen in Lebanon now and is growing year on year."
Defenders of classicism in art say that it remains fresh from one age to the next and that it cannot become "out of date" as in the case of fashion, where what is new cancels out what is old.
This also applies to our senior sculpture, Wajih Nahlah, whose seventieth birthday we celebrated yesterday (along with Valentine's day). He himself is a major lover: of the brush, of diligent work, of sublime human and artistic beauty.
Only a proficient exponent of classicism has the permanent basic tools for the most modern and most abstract expression, able to shine in either school, because he has his roots firmly embedded in the original capacity developed through the ages.
Today it applies to Lebanon.

The Poet Nakhlah.
Tarbih's poem runs thus:
Who sang to him and gave him the choicest wine to drink.

Here, son of sincerity, the swords of fidelity rusted.

Right hand - set the forest alight. But no.
Your free branches high among the years.
Your intelligence sheds light on the darkened tomes.
On the roads of a moist autumn.

Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan Al-Muashar welcomed the resolution, "the first on which the United States has voted for a long time (...) since it not only voted positively for it but even formulated the draft resolution which, in itself, is the start of a change in the American position towards the Palestinian problem."
Iranian President Muhammad Khatami supported the resolution which "opened new possibilities for solving the problem", describing events in Palestine as "unprecedented".
The Parisian press was skeptical about the implications of the resolution.
Draft Proposed by Syria Condemning the Attacks Withdrawn Following Arab Pressure; Resolution 1397: Security Basis for Saudi Ideas?
However, diplomatic information arriving in Beirut in the last few hours from sources that followed closely the discussions that accompanied the resolution talks about the motives in which the Syria reservation was concealed:
This position appears to have been a compromise, interpreted by diplomatic information as being neither a rejection of the Security Council resolution, nor an approval.
4 - The Security Resolution reflects the import of the Saudi Crown Prince's initiative, namely to create a security solution to the Palestinian question in return for what he viewed as full normalization.
But the official Lebanese position on the resolution is in line with the Syrian point of view, but due to its ambiguity and lack of clarity, Lebanon did not appear to be siding with a negative stance towards it when it is in the midst of preparations for an Arab summit at the end of this month.
And this, they add, is what was expressed by the other clauses in the resolution, of American origin, as equality between the two sides in calling for a ceasefire to be respected, and in terms of attacks and excesses.
Between the gradual withdrawal from Ramallah and the return to the ceasefire lines there is considerable distance, which will not be crossed easily.
It was clear yesterday that the presence of Israeli tanks at the entries to the Palestinians Presidential Compound was merely intended to bring out Sharon's "response" to Zinni's mission via the ceasefire, albeit within Al-Manarah Square and in the heart of Ramallah, in addition to portraying Sharon's "positive attitude" by means of his call for a gradual withdrawal from the town and redeployment at the entrances thereto.
In addition to this, reports talks of security measures and defensive arrangements, such as the digging of trenches and the erection of fences and control towers along 54 km from the north, east and south. This means that Jerusalem will have a reality imposed upon it, one that is sufficient to destroy any future talks dealing with the basic demand to make East Jerusalem the capital of the Palestinian state.
Of course, Bush denies this, as does Cheney. But the Arab region is lost in the maze, which makes the calls for peace no more than the drumbeats for war.
In a day, a month, a year...
In any case the ink in which these resolutions are written is indelible no matter how great the passage of time, because this ink is international, not made in China.
And now the ball, with all the rights and obligations this entails, is in the court of the Arab community and everyone, here, overseas and across the continents, is listening.
The details are not left in the hands of the devil this time, but are postponed until the fires have been put out, the wounds bandaged, the ruins rebuilt and the specter of death lifted from the skies above Gaza and the West Bank.
Palestinians yesterday succeeded in destroying three Israeli tanks. One was destroyed with an explosive charge set off in front of it in the Gaza Strip, which left three of the soldiers in its crew dead and two others wounded.
A spokesman for the American State Department, Richard Boucher, said that Washington "had taken note" of Israel's decision "to redeploy" its forces in Ramallah.
He stressed at the end that Washington "is still worried at the tragic human losses and the escalation of violence in recent days".
Commandos killed five Palestinians in Ramallah.
The Haartz newspaper quoted Israeli military sources as saying that in parallel with Palestinian steps to stop the violence, Israeli forces would freeze their operations in Palestinian areas, make symbolic withdrawals from the towns and refugee camps and remove check points. They would continue their operations to prevent the penetration of armed persons and the smuggling of weapons.

But one of the commanders of the northern area in Israel, Brigadier Meir Kalivi, said at a press conference in the border village of Biranit that Israeli soldiers had combed the borders after the attack and uncovered the point where the two fighters crossed the fence using a ladder, entering Israel at least one day prior to the attack.
Israeli security sources reported that the armed men had planned meticulously for the attack and had hidden in the middle of crops on a strategic hill, from where they opened fire on cars passing along the road, which is near to the borders between the Shalomi and Mistiba settlements, 4 km inside Israeli territory.
He added that Israel would try to bring to bear intensive international pressures on Syria to remind it that it was "playing with fire" and that if this method failed or Hizbollah carried out more cross-border attacks, the Hebrew state might give a military response.
* In Beirut, Hizbollah Secretary-General Mr. Hasan Nasrallah said on the occasion of the first nights of the month of Muharram, "Everything of which Israel accuses us, whether it is true or otherwise, whether it is proven or not, whether it is real or otherwise, everything of which it accuses us in supporting and standing beside our people in Palestine is a great honor for us, for Hizbollah and for everyone who stands beside Hizbollah. It is a great honor of which we are proud."
We are the children of this school, its courage and wisdom.
When the battle becomes one of defense for the basis of religion and for the basis of the existence of Islam, there is no need to look for the number of friends, the number of aides, what we have, what we don't have, or the like."
But one of the advisors to Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Salih said that Yemen had informed Cheney that it would oppose any American military action against Iraq, fearing that it would wreck regional stability.
He said, "The discussion dealt with many bilateral issues, including cooperation to counter terrorism, the Arab-Israeli conflict, the genocide to which the Palestinian people are subject at the hands of the Israeli government, the situation in Iraq and the implementation of the resolutions of international law."
Washington fears that Al-Qaeda fighters fleeing Afghanistan may head for the remote mountains of Yemen.
They believe it to be a personal matter, which they want to conduct by themselves."
He will continue his tour on Saturday, heading to Saudi Arabia.
Deputy Faris Buiz called on the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority, Yasir Arafat, "not to leave Palestinian territory and the Intifada because Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon will not permit him to return".
This summit will, furthermore, take place at a time of battles and resistance mounted by the Intifada on the domestic front, which represents the fundamental turning point for the Arab - Israeli conflict.
Concerning the initiative made by Saudi Crown Prince Abdallah, he said, "There can be no doubting the patriotism, nationalism or Arabism of His Highness, Prince Abdallah, but they manner in which he expressed this proposal, in the media or the press, appears somewhat ambiguous.
I believe that any proposal on this matter must include clear expressions; for example, defining the extent of the Israeli withdrawal from the Golan to the 1976 borders. The process of putting forward this matter cannot ignore the Palestinian right of return, at least to their liberated homeland of Palestine.
Chairman of the Committee Deputy Abd Al-Latif Al-Zain noted that the draft proposal would have preference over other proposals.
For its part, the Administration and Justice Committee has continued to study the draft Communications Law. It has studied the articles relating to the promotion of communication services and license procedures and will continue studying this draft at 9:30 am next Monday.
Several years have passed since the review without a ruling being issued. Only two years remain for naturalized persons to acquire full political and civil rights.
The Council believes that it is a duty to preserve its independence, so that it will remain a refuge and authority for all citizens and anyone with a righteous demand.
Emigrants Abroad Association Calls On Officials to End Interference of Civil Servants in Its Affairs.
2- The Continental Council for Australia and New Zealand is a fundamental part of the International Council of the Association. It undertakes to continue in the struggle for the Lebanese cause and for organizational solidarity with the decisions and recommendations of the Mexico conference. It is surprised by the actions of some officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in respect of the Association and the Australian Continental Council.
We call on all those loyal to take part in this conference in order to unite ranks, make progress and flourish."
Yesterday, commenting on events in Beirut on the anniversaries of 14 March, 14 July and 13 October, Aun said that this was the norm for all seasons; it was not seasonal.
The Lebanese should know that matters will not be put right today or tomorrow without a vision of political and social independence with free and unconditional decisions, not by subservience to Syria.
No one can suppress or silence the independence current.
The cabinet held its weekly meeting at 5 pm yesterday. The meeting was chaired by President of the Republic Emil Lahud and attended by Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri. Ministers absent included the following: Deputy Prime Minister Isam Faris, Secretary of State Talal Arslan, Minister of Transport and Public Work Najib Miqati and Minister of Health Sulaiman Faranjiyyah.
He noted, "The lack of clarity in international resolutions has, in the past, led to confusion in the interpretation and a debate that is still on-going. The new resolution will add to the debate because it can be interpreted in more than one way, and it does not distinguish between Israel the occupier and Israel the aggressor.
Former American President Bill Clinton stressed, "The establishment of Palestinian and Israeli states was necessary to bring about peace and guarantee security and prosperity in the region". He criticized the manner in which the American envoy to the Middle East, General Anthony Zinni was working and commended the initiative put forward by Saudi Crown Prince Abdallah to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict.
"Come on, get out Syria", "The only army we want in Lebanon is the Syrian Army", "Freedom, Sovereignty and Independence", "God, Lebanon and Aun - and no one else".
On the anniversary of the war of liberation on 14 March 1989, about two thousand students from the "Patriotic Free Current", the Free Patriots Party, the Brigades' Base and the "Lebanese Forces" from different faculties at the Lebanese University, and Al-Hikmah, Sayyidah Luizah, the American-Lebanese, St Joseph universities and numerous secondary schools came onto the streets.
During the protest student Rami Saab from the Syrian National Socialist Party spoke. He believed that the choice made by those mounting resistance in Palestine was the choice of all free people in the Arab nation and Arab world, and that the future of students and young people depended on the future of Palestine and the removal of the racist Zionist entity."
It has been decided that he will meet Maronite Patriarch Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Butrus Safir in Bakarki this morning to communicate to him the concerns of the Palestinians and the state of churches in the Holy Land.
Dizzy Spell Causes Al-Jamil Head Wound; De Friege Welcomes Stance of "Students Freedoms Organization"; "Parties and Forces" Criticize Movements of Aunists.
In the evening President Al-Jamil's office issued a statement saying that Al-Jamil, "experienced (yesterday) afternoon an emergency health problem requiring that he be transferred to the Al-Hayek Hospital in Sinn Al-Fil, where some medical examinations were carried out. They were completed in the afternoon at the Mar Yusif hospital in Al-Dawrah.
In a statement yesterday he said, "The Organization has done well given that the defense of students rights and freedoms is not limited to this Organization.
They believed, "The renewed movement of the group of (Brigadier Michel) Aun to confuse Lebanese-Syrian relations does not serve Lebanese national interests."
The Council of Ministers has approved the draft law aiming to set up an account to manage, service and reduce the public debt.
"The Council of Ministers held its weekly meeting on 14/03/2002. The meeting was chaired by His Excellency President of the Republic and His Excellency Prime Minister. Ministers absent included the following: Deputy Prime Minister Isam Faris, Talal Arslan, Najib Miqati and Sulaiman Faranjiyyah.
On this occasion we renew our salute to the resistance, the south, its people and the Lebanese people, who have withstood all these years and have had their patience and efforts crowned with victory. We also salute the Intifada in Palestine, hoping that it, in turn, will force the implementation of international resolutions and establish the right of the Palestinian people in its land.
But we distinguish between the state finances and the economy of the country.
* Approval for draft law aiming to set up an account to manage, service and reduce the public debt.
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Immigrants Mahmoud Hamud met with the American Ambassador at 8:30 am yesterday and discussed with him the results of the meetings of the Ordinary Session of the Council of Arab Foreign Ministers in Cairo last week.
I heard from Minister Hamud the results of the conference of Arab Foreign Ministers held in Cairo.
General (Tony) Zinni is known to be arriving in the region. American Vice President Dick Cheney will continue his tour in the Arab world.
Following the meeting Echifari said, "I asked Minister Hamud for Lebanon to support Colombia and co-operate with it at this time when it is confronting terrorism and the drugs trade.
I believe that the co-operation of the Lebanese government to combat the terrorism in our country would be beneficial to the Lebanese working in Columbia."
They currently have more than 1000 hostages. The security authorities are continuing to search for the missing Lebanese (...)."
American Ambassador Hears Lebanon's Observations on Resolution 1397 at Foreign Affairs.
They noted that the "the situation between Iraq and Kuwait" was missing from the summit agenda, the headings of which were decided in Cairo last Monday. The agenda of the 117th meeting of Arab Foreign Ministers was also missing.
Patel asked about the circumstances surrounding the operation at the Shalomi settlement, in connection with which the Israeli forces are still trying to accuse Hizbollah of being responsible, either with the help of Palestinians with whom they trained or by using elements that succeeded in penetrating the international borders.
2 - It merely referred to Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, without affirming their implementation.
6 - The resolution dealt with the two states of Israel and Palestine and therefore was not comprehensive.
This means that the Resolution was cooked up outside the Council and was submitted only for approval, not debate.
...Qablan on the Anniversary of the Hijra and the Beginning of Ashura: The Year of the Intifada and Fidelity to the Arab Right.
This anniversary brings back to us the glories of Islam, the day when Imam Ali bin Abi Talib (a) confronted Marhaba the Jew and wrestled with him on the day Khaibar was conquered and the Jews were expelled from it.
Given this, what is required is fidelity to the Arab right in Palestine and rejection of all formulations by which people want to promote a solution to the Palestinian issue, for it is not permissible to concede the right of the Palestinian people in their land, the land of Palestine, which includes Jerusalem, representing the capital of the Palestinian state, and which will be achieved by the return of Palestinian refugees to their homes and by the destruction of all Zionist colonies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
And for whose interest do you legislate?
The people also have the right to ask: How did they agree, and in the Council of Ministers as well, to the draft rent law, which strips tenants of all his basic rights: the right to extend the rent contract and the right to obtain fair compensation to help him secure alternative accommodation.
And how?
The security organizations of whose excesses they complain will remain, as will the taxes of Al-Sinyurah to which there is no end and the debts of Al-Hariri which have now reached thirty billion American dollars. Some of them may return to the saying that was put forward before the events of 1975: "Security Before Bread". It is as if they have not yet learnt that when people's basic food supplies are threatened, there can be no security for anyone, not before nor afterwards.
Expanded Meeting to Tackle Problems of Al-Damur River; Junbalat: Remove Infringement to Use Clean Water; Junbalat.
He noted that studies and field surveys on the course of the river, which were discussed at a first meeting held last year, had shown that the most important problems affecting it were: pollution created by the waste of factories and instillations surrounding the course of the river, which included tourist installations, incinerators, stone factories, cement works, asphalt works, olive presses, chicken and bovine farms, abattoirs, rubble, agricultural pesticides and household refuse,
Regarding the company's decision, he said, "We are grateful for their decision. The issue is that the Ministry of the Environment and the United Nations should give us guarantees as to how to preserve this natural environment. If there is the potential for economic benefit, I have no idea about this."
French Ambassador Philippe Lecourtier spent the day yesterday at Baalbak and the surrounding area, during which he was familiarized with the educational, cultural, agricultural and economic conditions. He inspected agricultural projects that France is helping to develop, in particular grapevines, in preparation for a study that is to be drawn up about projects completed with French, Lebanese and European Common Market collaboration.
The French Ambassador and the delegation then traveled to the Maronite National School where he was met by the Archbishop of Baalbak and the Maronite Al-Ahmar Monastery, Bulus Munjid Al-Hashim, and members of the administrative, teaching and student staff. A female student welcomed the French delegation and Lecourtier shook her hand and kissed her. He then toured the school and playing fields, bearing in mind that they were the property of the French state before they were offered to the Maronite sect in 1946, and it became known as the Al-Matran school after having been accommodation for the French officers.
He added, "We have a cultural comment after having read and heard that some French schools have expelled female students on account of their wearing the veil, which detracts from this aspect. We know that France is a secular state and also that it was involved in Israel's celebrations of the fiftieth anniversary celebration of the establishment of its state, participating with its aircraft. It is a political matter but may affect France's reputation with the Arabs and Muslims."
He was familiarized with the agricultural of grapevines, which are now in the production stage, and with a small field in which saffron is being tried in Dir Al-Ahmar, and the potential for adopting agriculture, which provides money and profits. He then inspected the Ministry of Agriculture milk collection center in Mahallat Durs.
We are deploying our resources for the revival of this area, which, for a long time, has been isolated, since all eyes turned to the south for political reasons. The time has come for the balance to be reset between all areas. Our educational priorities include language and experiments with all Francophone requirements."
Al-Nabatiyyah and Al-Beqaa Security Committees Provide Security Measures for Ashura; Al-Beqaa Security.

It will also lead to a meeting between the political forces to ensure coordination in the event that any measure or action is taken in the Governorate.
In response to a question he clarified, "Any security measures in the Beqaa for the holding of the Arab summit will be taken by a central decision issued by the Minister of the Interior and Municipalities, Ilyas Al-Murr."
Yesterday afternoon Chairman of the Development and Construction Council Jamal Aitani opened the Al-Kukudi transformer bridge, which links President Hafiz Al-Asad Street with the Beirut International Airport road and the Khaldah-Al-Kukudi dual carriageway within the Airport enclosure, in the presence of Deputy Basim Al-Sabaa, Governor of Al-Jabal Adnan Dumyati and the representative of the Kuwaiti Ambassador, Adil Al-Ayyar, who cut the tape.
The Syndicate distributed a précis of his life, which read as follows: "The deceased was born in 1930, graduated in Law and mastered the French, English and Latin languages.
He was a model of gentility and discipline, and constantly strove to improve the situation of the press in Lebanon.
Condolences will be accepted after the burial until 7 pm in the Church Hall.
Educational institutions yesterday witnessed protests and marches in solidarity with the Palestinian Intifada and in condemnation of the Israeli massacres.
In Sidon students from the Al-Iman schools, which come under the Al-Maqasid Islamic Charitable Association, performed prayers for the absent for the souls of Intifada martyrs.
Speeches were given condemning these practices and recommendations were issued calling for a demonstration on the eve of the Arab summit for continued contacts with international health and social institutions to urge them to condemn these practices.
It would have been better for you to write that as an environmentalist you had received this report with much happiness, had you bothered to examine the contract signed between Kasrawan Municipality and the tourist company.
This project is from national capital and those responsible for it are known for their patriotism and their capability in the tourism sector.
It will stop emigration, will strengthen environmental tourism and will make tourism part of the economy in addition to the current agricultural economy, from which the farmers of our town suffer.
Thank you to the President of the country for standing on the side of right.
I said to his Majesty, 'Is the King envious of the Vice Regent?'
This proposal was the racehorse in the consultative dialogue that took place yesterday between Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri and the economic authorities, who always used to be the strategic ally of the government generally, and of Prime Minister Al-Hariri specifically.
Exceptional circumstances have prevented me from taking a seat among you and addressing you directly at your second Arab Conference of its kind since last December's conference, in which I participated with enthusiasm in defense of the Intifada and the resistance.
You know that they were defeated and stopped thinking about it.
The rich among them do not control their resources and cannot dispose of them in a way that is politically beneficial to the Arabs, if they should have the intent to do so. The poor among them need international assistance and are drowning in a sea of debts.

To what extent will the government commit itself to act on the slogans it has put out about investment in Lebanon?

Economic Council Amends Security Structure; Proposal to Establish "Tax and Verification Agency".
A discussion about the identity of the National Social Security Fund took place, as to whether it was a public institution with a social characteristic, as the government suggested, or an independent institution?
Citing the reasons for such a step, Shaluq believed that the issue of tax and inspection represented a cornerstone of the Fund's work. "Experience has shown that the traditional method of managing this task has slipped up for several reasons, which had led to a reduction in collection and the continued silence of many organizations and individuals. This can be clearly seen by reading the data available for the number of registered persons, both organizations and individuals, and the amount of subscriptions."
The verification rates for social security are known to vary between 40 and 45% for well-known political, sectarian and administrative reasons.
- Article 2: The Agency, for the interest of the Fund, shall be responsible for collecting established subscriptions and for inspecting registered organizations and individuals and those who are not registered, for the purpose of legally registering them.
It was also learnt that the amendment has given to the supervisory committee of the Fund, which has become the supervisory department, additional powers.

He noted, "The Bank of Lebanon is a legislative authority for the banks. The governing body consequently believes that one of our duties is to provide banks with sufficient opportunity to reach the criteria required by the Bal committee, which is working to draft the criteria, which are almost final.
He noted, "Operating risks are apparent internationally because conventional banking work, represented by deposits and lending, have started to be transformed into operating work as technology has created a different situation; for example, automated banking, electronic banking, telephone banking and other work of an executive nature that witnesses day-by-day development."
The speakers will include Secretary-General of the Banks Association Makram Sadir, Secretary-General of the Money-Laundering Investigation Authority, Dr Muhammad Baasiri, Mr. Charles Ceventa from the audit company, member of the Banks Supervisory Committee Amin Awad, and Director of Legal Affairs at the Bank of Lebanon Pierre Kanaan.

Murad met with a delegation from among them at his office in the Ministry of Education after they had protested outside the entrance to the Ministry at UNESCO. He listened to their demands. The lecturers stressed the importance of concluding their contracts, which total 582 contracts accumulated over 4 years. Students from the Faculty of Health demanded that lecturers be provided because they are only learning 20% of their program due to the missing contracted staff.

He informed them that he would discuss this matter with the Council of Ministers.
His appearance remained grave, but his face opened up to another horizon, a broader horizon, as he spoke freely in elegant and stylish French in a patriotic, cultured preaching voice with an unusual admonishing echo.
Why?
Just for His Holiness, which delighted me, as I heard him talking about Lebanon at the Burj Vazlian evening. He smiled with the gravity of the old and said to them plainly, "What is there to be surprised at if this is the truth?"
He said, "There are no front lines between Lebanon and Armenia.
Every Armenian should be aware of Lebanon's particularities in his surroundings, culturally, historically, morally and spiritually. He should understand that the Armenians, following the massacre, achieved their renaissance in Lebanon and that they must carry Lebanon with them in their hearts wherever they settle, as a cultural bridge between Armenia and the countries of the Armenian Diaspora."
His Holiness concluded with a brilliant truth: "The heart of every Armenian strives to preserve the Lebanese nature of Lebanon, to be an Ambassador for the Lebanese nature of Lebanon in his heart.
Chapters from Lebanon's History in Book by Provincial Translator Francois Khuri, Lebanon's First Press Correspondent in France?
But I found the answer via Mrs. Françoise Khuri Al-Hashim in an old book entitled "The Memoirs of François Khuri, Former Provincial Translator to Mt Lebanon", beneath which in a thin font it said that he was the correspondent to the Al-Astrasiyun, Independence Pledge, Journal de Caire, Havas Company in the Ottoman period.
To the conflicts in Mt Lebanon between the narrow party currents, which caused the country and people much trouble for no clear or obvious reason but were, in most cases, disputes between feudal leaders and families affecting their private interests under the cover of patriotic slogans or concerning the public interest.

Lucian George and George Farshakh, suggested that we put on this major national competition.

Away Round of European Federation Cup Quarterfinals; Hapoel Tel Aviv Defeat Milan!
The referee dismissed Valencia's Argentinean player Kily Gonzales in the 54th minute for his tackle on Inter's Sierra Leone striker Mohammed Kallon.
The European Federation had banned any game in the European competitions being played in Israeli on account of the explosive security situation there. Hapoel Tel Aviv, who defeated English team Chelsea and Italian team Parma in the two previous rounds, asked for it to be played in Cyprus with the return game to be played on 21 March on the "San Siro" ground in Milan.
Away team defender Jurgen Kohler was injured in the 70th minute and left the field to be replaced by Christoph Metzelder.
13 April and Its "Derivatives".
This tune relies deceitfully permitting what is taking place in Lebanon on the argument that European capitals are themselves witnessing an unprecedented expression of sympathy with the Palestinians.
The fact is that Aukar Square is now the third side of an open hole of explosion, or which will lead Lebanon to explode, amidst the frightening disdain shown towards the daily international warnings being directed against it.
And purely as a reminder at a time of remembrance: the 13 April disturbances could have been stopped in the act had the army immediately been given a free hand at that time to stop the destruction of he state.
Some of the "rejectionist" Palestinian leaders are running their operations in Lebanon from Damascus and are urging that the borders be opened.
Palestinian Complaint at Ambiguity of American Proposals; Arafat Refuses to Move to Gaza Because "He is Strong Despite the Siege".
Israeli press reports focused yesterday on two key topics: Powell's meetings with Israeli officials and his meeting yesterday with head of the Palestinian Authority Yasir Arafat; and the results of the battles that took place some days ago in Jenin Camp after the Israeli army allowed journalists to enter the camp.
He adds, "The Palestinian representatives complain that the American proposals for a ceasefire are ambiguous. The Palestinian demands are clearly formulated with a schedule whilst the American demands for Israel are always ambiguous and non-binding.
He continues, "The Palestinian leadership is searching for the idea proposed in one of the political meetings, which suggested that Arafat leave Ramallah for Gaza.
He thus no longer feels weak and banished. In fact his strength has increased.
Is it time to move on from "Besiege Your Siege" (Mahmoud Darwish made this expression famous when Beirut defeated Sharon in 1982) to the phase "Break the Siege"? The siege by which Sharon, the mad barbarian, has imprisoned Arafat, and imprisoned all of us with it, by lighting the fire around us and establishing the pillars of hatred as the Wailing Wall of a new Israel inhabited by fear, in an attempt to terrorize us.
The United States has given its strongest diplomatic references to its concern at the situation developing on the Lebanese/Israeli borders since the end of last March, with its Secretary of State, Colin Powell, deciding to undertake two quick visits to both Beirut and Damascus to discuss with Syrian and Lebanese officials how to contain the escalation on the borders.
Two days after his overthrow and detention following a failed military coup, President Hugo Chavez returned victorious to the presidency in Venezuela, raising his fist in greeting to his supporters following his return to the "Miraflores" Presidential Palace in the capital Caracas.
Twenty thousand Palestinians and Lebanese attended the "Besiege Your Siege" Festival.
The United States has given its strongest diplomatic indication of its concern at the situation developing on the Lebanese-Israeli borders since last March with its Secretary of State Colin Powell suddenly deciding today to mount two quick visits to both Beirut and Damascus to discuss with Lebanese and Syrian officials how to contain the escalation on the borders.
An official Lebanese source had previously announced that Powell would arrive in Lebanon on Monday and then travel to Syria, two countries that were not originally included on his regional tour.
The only official information available in this regard indicated that the visit to Beirut would not last more than three hours.
He visited Damascus where he met with Syrian President Bashar Al-Asad and Syrian Prime Minister Muhammad Mustafa Miro.
Leader of the Progressive Socialist Party Deputy Walid Junbalat believed "the curse of the Palestinian blood that has been shed in Jenin, Nablus and the West Bank will fall on all those who do not answer the Arab cause, from the Occupied Territories to some Arab or non-Arab rulers".
Junbalat answered: "When we made this visit to see Hasbiya, and I wish to see you always, it was first of all a political visit, during which we addressed a message to Druze patriots in Palestine, some of whom have answered whilst others have failed to do so.
Let us look to the future because history is not merciful and because peoples do not forget, albeit that they do occasionally turn a blind eye in specific difficult conditions when there may be a feeling that the peoples will be defeated. But peoples are not defeated. The Palestinian people will not forget who stood alongside the Palestinian issue at home (Palestine) and those who did not do so."
Written by Khalil Falihan:
They said that Powell had decided to withdraw from his position and to visit Beirut and Damascus in an attempt by him to prevent further escalation of the situation that had flared up, following the talks undertaken by Powell last Friday with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and after he inspected the borders with Lebanon with to see what was happening his own eyes.
The sources confirmed that Powell's visit to Beirut would be an opportunity to give the Arab peace initiative, which was approved by the Arab summit by consensus and supported by Washington, a push. It will be a priority on the agenda of the talks to be held by the person behind it, Saudi Crown Prince Abdallah bin Abd Al-Aziz, who is to visit Washington on the 25th of this month, with President George Bush.
According to an American diplomatic source yesterday evening, Powell will arrive at Beirut airport from Israel at 8:30 am. He will be met at the airport by Minister of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants Mahmoud Hamoud, who will accompany him to the Republican Palace, where we will hold a meeting with President Lahud for 90 minutes. Prime Minister Al-Hariri and Minister Hamoud will attend.
It has been decided that Powell will travel to Damascus after Beirut. From there it will be decided whether to return to Jerusalem or Washington in light of discussions undertaken by the team accompanying him, which has remained in Israel.
He called the Palestinian Authority "to trust its people, their resistance and great gifts, so that it will be worthy at this stage to represent hopes and aspirations because it relies on genuine strength provided by the Palestinian people. These sacrifices can only confront Israeli arrogance. We also appreciate the pressures applied by America, Israel and the arrogant states for concession and the effacement of the vestiges of these sacrifices". He stressed, "With a little patience, forbearance and confidence in this noble people, Palestinian hopes will be realized and Israel will not be able to achieve what it wants."
"Palestine Day" in Sport City; 20 Thousand Gather; Darwish, Al-Rumi and Qaabur: Our Pains Great, Our Hopes Greater; Darwish.
As Ahmad Qaabur called out, "I call on you, I grasp you hands more tightly", and at the songs of Marcel Khalifah and Al-Sheikh Imam, the public entered the stadium with the flags. Those of the Progressive Socialists dominated.
Near here, Yasir Arafat was asked: Where are you going?
Now we are all Palestinians (...) the land is the body, the body is the land and the road to Palestine only passes through Palestine.
Our pain is great but our hopes are greater (...) we will love life because we are children of life."
"What is taking place today in Palestine is a crime against humanity and I have come to declare my final and eternal rejection of the occupation of Palestine."
From this spot we say today: We do not commit suicide for the love of it, but we sacrifice ourselves as martyrs in love for life".
Sport City Becomes "Palestine" City.
It opened its arm to embrace the Palestinian cause and to recall, with its people, bitter, sad and black memories.
Sport City yesterday was not just an open playing field for 50 thousand people, nor just a place for a massive celebration. The choice of the location, as the organizers said, and as those who attended, took part and undertook this act of solidarity felt, was first and foremost linked to memory.
And the place became piles of rubble from which the smell of gunpowder and death rose.
This is how Sport City cut short the distance of time once more.
The Palestinian people fight on their land, land that is in the body and the body the land.
It is no small detail that we should commemorate Palestine in Beirut today under the slogan "Besiege Your Siege".
Their signs indicated who they were. Supporters of the Lebanese parties did not hesitate to climb the electricity pylons from which to hang their flags, so that they might fly high, as part of a competitiveness the Lebanese cannot hide no matter what the occasion, bearing in mind that it was the Day of Palestine and only the Palestinian flag should have been flying. Public auctions will take place on other occasions.
Mahmoud Darwish's calm, loud and warm voice united the echo and put Palestine back where it belong, in the hearts and minds of all Arabs: "Now every Arab bears a Palestinian heart.
Pictures from Jenin.
But it is certain that the pictures that Powell would have seen in Jenin Camp would have changed the effect of the scenes he saw onboard his military transporter of the effects of the attack mounted by a Palestinian girl on a bus station in Jerusalem. It would also have changed the reverberations of the bombing exchange between Hizbollah and the Israeli army,
And perhaps if the American Secretary of State wanted to settle the debate surrounding the "missing corpses", he could have read the ruling issued by the Israeli High Court of Justice, which allows the Israeli army to remove the corpses of Palestinians killed in Jenin Camp despite the objections of human rights organizations.
Only women and children remain in the camp.
But what is the use of such delusional achievements and long meetings when Colin Powell is unable to force Sharon to commit to a clear schedule to end military operations against the Palestinians. Foreign Minister Shimon Perez talks about the need for a week or more to end the operation, but Israeli military commanders are talking of much longer, more than several weeks.
The book "Contemporary Lovers", recently published by historian Claudine Montai, expounds Chaplin's life from London to his Swiss exile in Vivai, passing through the Hollywood studios and the Charlie's great love for Oona.
Charlie Chaplin married three times before meeting Oona O'Neil, daughter of novelist Eugene O'Neil, to become his eternal partner and provide him with the psychological support over seventeen years.
My mother used to see films at home. My brother Michel used to cry when he saw Charlo eating his shoes.
She has supported her statements with rapid examples in a lively style that reflects her personality.
Chaplin played the film "The Baby" in 1919 following the death of his three-day old son.
Chaplin felt attracted to and enmity towards Hitler at the same time.
My father was conservative.
Oona could not accept her husband's death on the 25th of December 19777 and did not forgive him for his death - "How did he dare to do something like that?". She tried in vain to overcome her grief and search for new love, until she found that love in July 1991.
During his contribution, Fr Naji Adalbi spoke about "eastern interpretations of the patriarchal texts" under the spiritual and intellectual authority of the fathers of the Church in our Arab society, and of "their conspicuous attempts to bring the concepts of Christianity closer to the language of the Arabs, for example in explaining the meaning of the Trinity".

He added, "We have many appropriate and safe dedicated reception centers."
The Deputy Speaker in the Italian Senate Roberto Caldiroli, executive member of the Confederation, said, "I strongly oppose the idea of receiving even one of those Palestinians."
Referring to the smart hotel overlooking the sea, British tourist George Dodd said, "We know that they are staying at that hotel and I cannot say that we feel relaxed at their presence and all this number of policemen around us."
Talking to the guards stationed on the roof of the hotel, German tourist Paul Hoffman said, "I think it strange to surround the place with all these security procedures.
A British tourist laying her towel on the beach meters from the hotel entrance said, "Had I known that they were coming here I would have gone to Pavos (...) Do you think I like everyone watching me?
The representative of the Palestinian Authority in Cyprus, Samir Abu Ghazalah, sent food to the exiles, including stuffed vine leaves, milk and cakes.
There is no need for us, against the background of this political chaff from the Ocean to the Gulf, to form demonstrations, make speeches and issue statements. For 54 years we have been reaping defeats and disasters and mastering the art of demonstrations, speeches and statements.
It may be too early to seek mercy for Ariel Sharon following the return of the wolf, Benyamin Netanyahu, to the surface. But we must at least consider the words of King Abdallah, who said that the Sharm Al-Sheikh meeting discussed a mechanism for providing security to Israel in return for providing an independent state to the Palestinians. What security are we discussing when we face the impossibility of a Palestinian state?!
Only God knows!
Sharon Reassures Americans: Policy Unchanged; Highlights "Advanced Weapon" Deployed by Hizbollah.
Within a short time of coming to power he signed the Wye Agreement. His government also ordered the evacuation of parts of Hebron.
Today, because he sits in the Prime Minister's chair and bears responsibilities, he uses a different, more ambiguous language.
When the time is right and the Palestinians come to the negotiating table, there is a suspicion that the head of the government in Israel may not, like those before him, try to reach an agreement with them, including the establishment of a state."
He confirmed that there would be no elections before the 28th of October 2003.
He added, "We see increasing Iranian activity among the Arabs of Israel."
Let us sit and think for once, and make some simple comparisons:
* Secondly, Yasir Arafat revealed nothing when he said that the Likud decision constituted the demolition of the Oslo Accord. He was preceded by Israeli ministers and analysts who mounted a strong campaign against this decision. He did, however, reveal a new facet of the concessions when he told the "..." television station to the letter: "We hope to see an independent Palestinian state alongside a Jewish Israeli state".
* Fifthly, the Jordanian monarch says that he bore an urgent (note the word urgent) message to Washington saying that the region was in need of foreign intervention to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian dispute and that Washington must replace its policy of "managing the dispute" to one of "ending the dispute"... This urgent message calls us to recall the time when the Arabs opposed any American intervention in the dispute out of the fear of bias towards Israel, as if that bias has now ended!
Of course, there is no need for any of us to scream: where were we and where are we now, because where we were has led us to where we are.
Researchers at the National Institute for Health conducted experiments on mice in an area of the brain known as the dentate gyrus, which produces new nerve cells throughout life and helps in the processes of learning and memory.
The analysis of data collected on these rodents showed that the consumption of nicotine reduced production of nerve cells.
It should be noted that research demonstrating the existence of a negative effect for nicotine on the brain is small. Some even speak of nicotine having a positive effect on the nerves and consequently on nerve cells.
We hoped that His Excellency the Speaker would take into consideration the recommendation of the free professions syndicates, given the interests incorporated therein for the Exchequer, the State and citizens, and the commitment of all to the Law.
The Settlements Law was incomplete and imposed unreasonable settlements on those who had not made a statement. It was not appropriate for the financial and economic situation in which citizens generally, and practitioners of free professions specifically, find themselves. The amendments are in the hands of Speaker Birri."
We also discussed the issue of production costs, specifically the cost of electricity in Lebanon, which is the highest in industrial terms in the world. His Excellency the Speaker promised to tackle the matter, especially during the night period."
Al-Hariri explained that following the meeting, which lasted an hour, he and Lahud discussed various domestic issues. "There was an agreement of opinion that it was important to make administrative work more effective and speed up the start of privatization."
Al-Hariri met at the Saraya with Deputies Qablan Isa Al-Khuri and Jibran Tuq in the presence of former head of the Lawyers Syndicate Michel Khattar and attorney for the Bishri municipality Hani Rahmah, then with Deputy Wajih Al-Bairini.
He also met a delegation from the Lebanon Ambassadors Forum headed by former Ambassador Fuad Al-Turk, who gave the following speech: "In the name of my fellow ambassadors, I thank you for welcoming us despite your many preoccupations and concerns, especially at present.
However, the Forum's aims in the first instance were to put the experience of its members at the disposal of Lebanon's interests, without charge, given their awareness of the necessity of mobilizing all Lebanese moral, intellectual and scientific powers and capacities in the march towards renaissance, salvation and development.
Lahud Discusses Domestic Conditions with Four Ministers and Archbishop Bisharah.
Salamah clarified that he had also discussed with Lahud the necessary preparations to be taken in preparation for holding the Francophone Conference next October.
Lahud also informed Minister of Labor Ali Qansu of the results of the meeting of the Board of Directors of the Arab Labor Organization held in Cairo. Lebanon, represented by Minister Qansu, was elected Chairman of the Board of Directors for one year by consensus.
According to official information, President Lahud discussed with him political conditions and stances.
Safir: We Hope For an End to Many Interactions, Economic Situation Contemptible But We Haven't Lost Hope.
The economic situation is continually deteriorating and we no longer see a future in this country. The horizons are blocked and the living conditions are very difficult, to the extent that our hope in the nation's resurrection is almost lost, especially when the continuous disputes among the pillars of the government cause institutional paralysis and loss of confidence in the country.
The Patriarch responded, "We share with you your concerns, and you referred to the political and economic situation and to the situation of Engineer Airani.
The economic situation is contemptible. This is no secret. All the people complain.
The Patriarch had met with Professor Dominic Chauvilet from the Sorbonne University, followed by Sheikh Wadi Al-Khazin, the Director General of the Maronite Brothers of Mary, Abbot Francois Aid, who sought permission to travel to Rome and Paris, and attorney Bahiyyah Abu Hamad.
The deadline for withdrawing municipal candidacies officially closed at midnight Monday evening/Tuesday with four withdrawals in the town of Bishri, leaving a final total of 30 candidates competing for 18 seats.
But the problem does not lie in this increase, but in the number of families putting forward more representatives that "custom" allows whilst representatives from other families want to tackle the deficit, bearing in mind that the internal regulations allow for the candidacy deadline to be extended until next Friday for families who have not yet completed their candidacy, i.e. 48 hours before the elections take place..

He confirmed that all bills due for the year 2001 would be paid within ten days of receiving them from the Ministry of Health. This will be followed by payment of the bills for this year, which will lighten the severity of the financial crisis experienced by the hospital over about 8 months.
Baalbak - "Al-Nahar":
At the height of the cell phone battle, citizens ask: Where has the matter of violations against maritime public property gone, or the violations against the mountains of Lebanon, which the machines are tearing to pieces, in order to sell their sand and stones for dollars, whilst the state does not benefit from these two items with one white piastre in these dark and gloomy times?
On the 14th of May this year the Iranians celebrated the 110th anniversary of Al-Mirza Al-Shirazi, the strongest religious authority in Iran at that time, issuing his famous fatwa prohibiting the use of tobacco. The people obeyed and threw the water pipes off the roofs of their buildings into the streets, in what was known as the "tobacco uprising", thereby causing the British authorities to submit to the volition of the Iranians.
There are many studies and views in the history of contemporary Iran that analyze the phenomenon of the men of religion and their place in Iranian society, and whether they constitute a social class or not.
In the Safavid period their political strength grew after they grew closer to the Safavid "Shahs", who relied on the scholars as one of the pillars of their rule. But many of them removed themselves from government and turned to the teaching of the religious sciences alone.
The clerics would walk in the streets and the people would bow before them putting their right hand on their chest in respect, as is the social custom in Iran.
And many Iranian clerics have confessed to making mistakes when they came to official positions.
However, what was on offer was tiny outside the framework of the Bank of Lebanon, which by retaining its margin of intervention as it was, between 1501.00 lira (buy) and 1514.00 lira (sell), caused it to close nominally as normal since 9 September 1999 at a declared average price of 1507.50 lira.
All these facts have worked together on both sides of the Atlantic to give the dollar a new impetus, such that it closed in London with a further increase against the other principal currencies as follows:
128.65 Japanese yen against 127.85.
European Stock Markets have continued their upward progress following the example of Wall Street and Nasdaq after the publication of retail sales figures in the United States which stimulated hopes once more of a continuation of growth in the American economy at a good level, reflecting positively on the economies of its European partners.

Were the sun less sad, or more patient.
Tomorrow, departure.
They wake up a girl swallowed by smooth rocks.
Like the white scattered across the sky and in dust.
This is the full autumn.
I dissolve, under the rain.
One god is not enough.
Take your stick and your veils and leave.
My mother tears apart the chains from the moment the word began.
With another face, another heart.
Only the mirror does not give birth to children, or pictures, or even moons.
Prepare me the way to the beginning.
When I am with you and think of nothing but the butterflies.
The petition read: "Despite the widespread international condemnation of the violent policy of the Israeli government towards the Palestinian people in the Occupied Territories, it appears to be unconcerned by the moral calls addressed to it by world leaders.
When will we examine the Israeli war crimes perpetrated on a daily and regular basis as more than an isolated act, but as a national political issue?
We note that in light of the opposition of some academics and cultural elite in Israel to the Israeli government, with the participation of others in Israeli-Palestinian research projects, the vast majority of them have offered support for the wicked attack of the Israeli army on the Palestinians, or have failed to make their opposition effective or have any impact.
As happened in the days of the boycott of the policy of racial discrimination in South Africa, what is required now is a rapid international move to stop the massacres against the Palestinian people."
He spoke of the efforts of the security services, which had led to "the arrest of more than 1500 persons accused of dealing in and promoting drugs in 2001, in addition to operations to destroy fields in which poppies are grown, which have continued since last month, especially in the Beqaa Plain."
He believed that the study "constituted a pioneering example of interaction between the efforts of the security services and the efforts of relevant ministries and non-governmental private associations". He confirmed, "The efforts to deal with the problem will not achieve success unless they focus on reducing supply and reducing demand."
He added that the United Nations Program is about to announce a new program in this area and discussion had started with donor countries providing finance.
The study included a sample of students in the secondary departments of schools and universities. It said, "The comparative percentage of drug taking between secondary school pupils and university students has doubled from 1991 to 1999 at least." The study also revealed, "The average age for starting use varies from 14 to 17 years."
The International Osteoporosis Federation has opened its conference, attended by more than 6 thousand doctors from numerous countries, at the Conference Palace in Lisbon, the Portuguese capital.
For the younger of them it impedes daily activity and prevents productivity. For the older it hinders their life to a much greater extent, especially given that the costs of health care and treatment are high (...).
Assistance must also come from the patient and those who help him. There are today 139 national associations in 71 countries who are members of the International Osteoporosis Federation. They spread knowledge, change health legislation, provide material support and educate the community."
During the conference there was a round table for women chaired by Queen Rania and managed by a member of the European Parliament, Mel Reed. She started by presenting a commemorative placard to Mrs. Nazik Al-Hariri, following her appointment as first ambassador for the International Osteoporosis Federation out of regard for her efforts in Club 206, which now has 30 members who are working to assist in combating osteoporosis.
This is out of my belief that what man does in this area and in other charitable areas he will do for God's pleasure, without seeking thanks or recognition.
Two doctors, Ghassan Maaluf and Basil Al-Masri, spoke about osteoporosis in the Middle East.

President of the International Football Federation (FIFA) Joseph Sepp Blatter has denied in a press conference held yesterday morning in Zurich all the illegal activities attributed to him. He expressed confidence that he would be re-elected for a second four-year term at the Federation Conference in Seoul on Wednesday, the 29th of May.
In a report to the executive committee of the international Federation, Zen Ruffinen had claimed that Blatter had paid the sum of 25 thousand dollars to Nigerian referee Lucien Bouchardeau from the funds of the Federation for information about the President of the Somali Football Federation and the Vice President of the African Football Federation "CAF", Farah Addo, who accused the President of "FIFA" of buying votes to guarantee his success in the 1998 election, when he defeated the President of the European Football Federation "UEFA", Swede Lennart Johansson.
The Nigerian referee previously revealed yesterday in a press interview that he had asked the help of the "FIFA" President to confront personal problems. He had responded and written him a cheque from his personal account. As far as the 100 thousand dollar payment to Koloskov was concerned, he confirmed that he should not have allowed it to be paid without the knowledge of the Finance Committee of the international federation.
It should be mentioned that the English federation voted for Blatter in the previous elections in place of Johansson, as part of his campaign to host the 2006 World Cup finals, which Germany has won.
This will be the first visit by members of the Japanese imperial family to South Korea since the end of the Second World War, with the exception of two visits in 1970 and 1989 to attend the funerals of two members of the former Korean royal family.
The Japanese public NHK network also reported that they would lay flowers on the tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
In the first exercise 25 out of an original group of 29 players took part. Four were missing for legal reasons.
Kiefer led 2-0 in the first set, but Kuerten, who is taking part in his third competition since having surgery on his thigh last February, won four games in succession and won the first set.
Crowning a packed European season, Spanish team Real Madrid and German side Bayer Leverkusen will meet at 9:45 pm tonight at "Hampden Park" in Glasgow (Scotland) in the final game of the 47th round of the European Champions Football League (previously the European Club Champions Cup).
Islamabad announced yesterday that it had withdrawn its battleships from the Arabian Sea five days after New Delhi took a similar step as part of the framework of initiatives undertaken to reduce tension between the two countries. This follows its affirmation of a reduction in penetration by Islamists across the Monitoring Line in Kashmir, which continues to witness an exchange of artillery shelling between the Indian and Pakistan forces, which yesterday left six dead and ten wounded in spite of American calls for calm.
Since last week, indications of calm began to appear with Islamabad's undertaking to Washington to stop Islamists penetrating the Monitoring Line to Indian Kashmir. New Delhi responded with positive initiatives, including raising the embargo on Pakistani aircraft crossing Indian airspace and withdrawing its battleships from the Arabian Sea.
Regarding Rumsfeld's suggestion to deploy a monitoring system along the Truce Line to monitor penetration by Islamists, he said, "We discussed this proposal but no decision in this regard has yet been taken." He added, "Officials at the Indian Ministry of Defense and the government of the United States will discuss the relevant technical articles."
Batankar, responsible for security in the Kashmir valley, especially along the Monitoring Line, said "it was possible" that members from "Al-Qaeda" were active in the region.
In Pakistan, the government news agency reported that six civilians, including three children, were killed and eight others wounded by Indian shelling of the Nikyal strip, 120 km south of Muzaffarabad.
Security of Unplanned Settlements in Bank Causes Problem Between Army and Settlers.
Following this meeting, Idyal Mintis, who administers the Council, stated that he had met with Israeli Chief of Staff General Shaul Mofaz and had asked him for an increase in soldiers charged with protecting the settlements, including the unplanned settlement points recently established without government approval and which are, even in the eyes of Israelis, illegal.
These points are isolated and exposed to attacks, and most are built without licenses.
Head of the Beit Eil Municipality Israel Rozenburg, who continues to put pressure on the Israeli army to retain regular or reservists soldiers to protect the settlers, expresses anxiety. However, for the time being the settlers will have to look after their security themselves.
The prevailing opinion in the Israeli Ministry of Defense is to issue orders to dismantle the most isolated unplanned settlements.
Instead of trying to expel the residents of these settlements, it would be better to combat the Palestinian terrorist infrastructure."

American Catholic Bishops, who, since Thursday, have been holding an historic meeting in Dallas aimed specifically at discussing ways of dealing with the child sex abuse scandal that has shaken the American Catholic Church since last January, yesterday proposed a policy requiring that a principle of zero tolerance be applied ( ) to those priests proven to have been involved in sexual exploitation. However, officials at the Vatican said it was unlikely that a policy such as this would obtain the agreement of the Apostolic Chair.
An Israeli military spokesman reported that a Palestinian was killed when he attacked an Israeli settler with a knife near the Qadumim settlement in the northern West Bank.
He warned that the image of Palestinians should not be tainted with terrorism.
He said, "We have to put an end to all the militias.
At a meeting of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, he said, "This man washes Arafat's hands. I do not believe that he will control terrorism and combat it."
The visit of the Syrian military official will last three days, during which he will sign a number of agreements of a technical and training nature with the Chiefs of Staff of the Turkish Army between the military institutions of the two countries.
He said, "The President believes that this is one of the hardest issues and one that most breaks hearts (...) in which two parents fight for the custody of a child.

However, officials at the Vatican said it was unlikely that a policy such as this would obtain the agreement of the Apostolic Chair.
The head of the assembly of American Catholic Bishops in the United States, Bishop Wilton Gregory, affirmed on Thursday that men of religion had in some cases failed to report to the authorities accusations such as these.
They then held closed sessions during which they discussed the proposals that aim to reform the mechanisms adopted by the government to deal with accusations of sexual exploitation against members of the priesthood.
Raids in Islamist Ranks in Belgium; One Hundred Maoists Killed in Nepal; Referendum on Socialism in Cuba; Calm in Brazzaville After Confrontations.
The Public Prosecutor in Brussels refused to make any comment.
The local press in Nepal reported yesterday that more than one hundred Maoist rebels were killed in confrontations with soldiers over the last few days, following an attack mounted by about one thousand rebels in the west of the country.
Cuban leader Fidel Castro urged his citizens on Thursday to vote in the referendum that will run from today to Tuesday on the proposed amendment to the Constitution to approve socialism as an "irrevocable" system.
He believed that the referendum would, like the demonstrations on Thursday, in which millions of Cubans had taken part, be a "major response" to American President George Bush, who supports the continuation of the policy of sanctions against Cuba.
A military source announced, however, that eight rebels had been killed and one hundred others detained, without referring to the losses suffered by the government army.
Paris - from George Sasin:
It is likely that the "Union for a Presidential Majority" will win 384 of the 414 seats and the "Union for French Democracy" between 24 and 30 seats.
According to a poll conducted by "EFOP", 56% will choose a candidate from the right and 44% a candidate from the left in the event of a two-way contest between them.
His electoral tour in Toul represented a major challenge to the Secretary General of the Socialist Party, Francois Holland, who is the candidate for this city, in view of the fact that Rafaran has moved the battle to his backyard with the blessing of First Lady Bernadette Chirac.
The difference is that this phase of co-existence was considered "an obstacle to work" whilst a number of politicians believed that it was "a balancing factor".
Witnesses told that an armed group of three men attacked at 10 pm last night (21:00 GMT) residents in the Al-Maqam district of the small town of Al-Duwairah, twenty km south west of Algiers. Six people were killed, including two women and two children aged three and four. Two others were wounded.
It should be mentioned that 11 people were killed and nine others wounded on Tuesday in an attack by an armed group on a bus in Al-Madiyyah, 80 km south of Algiers.
Since the start of June, more than 45 people have been killed in violence in Algeria, relying on official statistics and figures published in the press. Acts of violence have left more than 670 dead this year.
United Nations Housing Expert: Building of Settlements Constitutes War Crime.
He believed that the building of new settlements was "provocative and created discord" and the settlers were "free to throw themselves into violence and confiscate territory".
He criticized the destruction of homes during Israeli incursions as happened in the battle for Jenin Camp, believing that this aimed to "create the maximum physical and moral suffering".
The "Associated Press" Agency quoted the Israeli representative to the United Nations headquarters in Geneva, Ya'akov Levy, as saying that Kothari's "accusations" were "one-sided".
It is noted that since 1967 Israel has built more than one hundred settlements, giving refuge to about 200 thousand people.
A Palestinian was shot dead by Israeli soldiers guarding the Qadumim settlement in the West Bank. The Israeli Army detained three people in Hebron and entered the town of Bir Zeit near Ramallah.
Soldiers who were guarding the settlement also opened fire on the Palestinian.
The three women were taken to the hospital in the town.
The Israeli authorities are accusing the three persons of participating in attacks on Israel.
Amnesty International Organization, which has its headquarters in London, has called upon the Palestinian Authority to release the Secretary General of the People's Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Ahmad Saadat, "immediately", and has also called upon Israel not to threaten his life if he leaves prison.
It has also urged Israel to "guarantee that it will not subject Ahmad Saadat to extra-judicial measures, in particular his assassination."
Arafat's advisor, Nabil Abu Radinah, announced that the Israeli policy of segregation and the establishment of segregated areas "will not have any value."
He explained that the way to security and peace would come "through Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian territory, cessation of aggression in all its forms and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state."

The United States signed this treaty with the Former Soviet Union in 1972.
They may also threaten our allies and friends across the world. We must work together to defend against them. This is a major task that the ABM treaty was impeding."
There is therefore no justification for talk about revenge measures."

On Thursday he won the right to defend himself in the court and paved the way for a dramatic end to the session with repeated pleas to give him "ten minutes, five minutes, two minutes" to explain why "the court would be forced to withdraw the case today".
He did not mention any information possessed by the United State and how it could establish his innocence.
However, she said that the defense team would continue now to help him.
I understand this.
Coalition Aircraft Bomb Iraqi Locations: Bush "Will Take Care" of Saddam "With All Means"; Bush and Howard; Baghdad.
The raid targeted the Al-Amarah location, 265 km southeast of Baghdad.
In Washington, following their meeting, American President George Bush and Australian Prime Minister John Howard expressed the conformity of their perspectives on the Iraqi file.
"But I have not changed my opinion on Saddam Hussein (...) he is a person who has poisoned the Iraqis with gas and possesses weapons of mass destruction.
It said, "It is enough for Britain to have killed the people of Iraq and plundered its national resources in the age of colonization. Its government should amend its policy towards it instead of vulgar subordination to American policy, because it is Britain itself that loses out as a result of the hate that it creates for itself in the Arab and Islamic environment."
Washington Demands Damascus Take Action Against Terrorism.
Chapter Seven gives the Security Council the authority to impose sanctions on Member States who do not comply with its resolutions and to issue an order to mount military action if the sanctions are insufficient.
He added that Syria, which was elected to the membership of the Council, would not "stoop to this low level of diplomacy".
He said that Syria had allowed "terrorist" organizations, such as "Islamic Jihad" to adopt Damascus as their headquarters, had occupied Lebanon and feigned forgetfulness of the "mass killing" of its people in 1982 when its forces bombed the town of Hamah.
In a report recently prepared at the request of the "International and Strategic Studies Center" ( ) in Washington, former American diplomat and noted expert on Middle East affairs, Anthony Cordesman, warns of the risks of stereotyping the problems that may face the United States in its rapprochement with the Middle East region, at the level of both its relations there and its war on "terror".
All these countries are viewed as backward in terms of international development, including the more well-off oil states, because oil is not an alternative to a balanced and diverse economy.
Cordesman expands his description of the region, saying, "All these countries have witnessed fundamental social changes by virtue of their transformation from societies based on agriculture to urban-based societies.
Most inhabitants of the Middle East states are young: for every ten people, four have an average age of 14 or below.
Emigration is rife. Statistics indicate that the percentage of young people wanting to migrate to the West touches on 70%."
Even the Iranian revolution, which started as a symbol of the struggle between the people of the region and totalitarian regimes supported by the United States, has ended with a popular contradiction, embodied in the election of President Muhammad Khatimi, and delayed the state on account of the struggle between the reformist and conservative sides.
On political Islam, Cordesman says, "The pressures arising from religious tensions in a number of states, such as those of North Africa, Bahrain, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, have increased dramatically."
These factors explain the beginning of the move in a number of areas to religion, in search of security and hope.
It must deal with each state in the region on an individual basis.
Supreme Organizing Committee Begins Preparations for Francophone Summit; 55 Countries Participate, Costs Estimated at 9 Million Dollars.
The Supreme Organizing Committee expects the number of delegations participating in the summit to reach 55, including about ten delegations that do not speak French well and require the provision of interpreters from French to their own language.
Heads of delegations will arrive on the 17th of October, one day before the beginning of the summit.
It should be mentioned that the Beirut Arab summit recorded 16 thousand and 400 nights in hotel accommodation.
The Organizing Committee faces difficulties in contacting embassies and obtaining the necessary information in view of the fact that there are only 16 embassies of Francophone states in Lebanon from a total of 55 countries, which requires that the Committee conducts its contacts with the embassies of these states outside Lebanon.
On arriving at the Airport, the delegations will follow the same route used by delegations to the Beirut Arab summit.
The government also hopes that the end of the current year will record a number of economic, financial and developmental successes and that this summer will see a successful season and the privatization of some utilities and the arrival of international companies to participate therein, securing good revenues for the exchequer, in addition to the success of the Francophone summit following the success of the Arab summit. It is hopes that no local or regional incident will disturb this and that Lebanon will be able to welcome the New Year with great hope and greater confidence.
"The regional conference, reforms, Yasir Arafat - topics that attract the attention of public opinion and the media at a time when the northern front is boiling from within.
In return they continue their strategic cooperation with Iran, which, for its part, continues its frightening efforts to obtain nuclear weapons.
What is meant here is an unofficial and non-binding dialogue, which may, on some occasions, turn into a means for communicating messages from one capital to another.
The escalation on the northern borders and the encouragement for terrorism will lead to a harsh strike, the end of which no one can predict.
All the evidence indicates that the law stopping gas oil vehicles will enter into force today as was decided, in spite of the fuss the country has experienced in recent days, leaving both political and syndic consequences.
At the same time, President of the Federation Abd Al-Amir Najdah called for the release of more than 20 drivers who were arrested during the movement yesterday.
However the Minister of Finance, Fuad Al-Sinyurah, pre-empted the discussion of the matter of petrol and deemed recourse to the "support" resolution unlikely, stating that "they had not been successful" previously.
This issue will exert pressure on many drivers, who obtain their livelihood from day to day, and any stoppage will put them in need.
The challenge comes in the wake of the announcement by the Seles Company that it is about to have recourse to the International Arbitration Tribunal "to refute the injustice it has sustained as a result of the discretionary violations that will rob the company of its ownership."
Washington responded by closing its embassy in Islamabad and all its consulates in Pakistan. American President George Bush announced that the perpetrators were "fanatical murderers" and insisted that they would not frighten the United States.
The explosion destroyed tens of vehicles, caused a gap three meters wide in the wall of the consulate and threw rubble a distance of one kilometer.
It added that among the victims there were four policemen, one passer-by and two unknown women.
A group calling itself "Al-Qanun" announced responsibility for the explosion.
However as professionals we must take this fax seriously and we will conduct an investigation."
This attack is the fourth of its kind since the beginning of the year against Western targets in Pakistan.
They are nothing more than that.
He concluded that he shared the grief of the victims' families.
Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh said, "The incident is very unfortunate and we strongly condemn it (...) I feel great pain that another attack has occurred in Karachi." This was a reference to the attack that had previously targeted the French work team.
Khalil Falihan wrote:
They noted that the initial indicators showed the existence of a difference regarding the means of handling the Arab-Israeli dispute and determining the mechanism appropriate for stopping violence and resuming political negotiations.
The other incident arising from Bush is his lack of enthusiasm for the international conference, in that from the beginning he wanted it to be a meeting in respect of the labeling of which he differed with Powell.
They stated that Bush was speaking about "a vision" for the state, which will give the Palestinians a greater right and for a longer period, whereas in a "temporary" state the rights are fewer and the period shorter.
This will become clear in the coming meeting of the international Group of Four.

Following discussion the Assembly gave its blessing to the people of the diocese for their desire to have their diocese acknowledged as autonomous.
It is expected to hold its first meeting at the beginning of next autumn.
The fathers expressed great fear at the plans for the future of Jerusalem.
Circumstances in Lebanon were the subject of special concern on the part of the Assembly. The fathers expressed their anxiety at the economic and social difficulties from which the people of Lebanon are suffering.
He also thanked the Holy Spirit, who is always our inspiration to work for the good of the Church, because every one of our brothers has borne the dialogue and concern of his whole diocese to the Assembly and will bear the spirit of the Assembly to his diocese so that it may be embodied in the Church of the Lord, may His name be glorified."
Lahud met with Deputy Jubran Tuq and discussed with him the political and economic conditions.
Jones expressed his delight that Lebanon would become a field of work for the university, which graduates students in 40 specialisms in administration, finance and economy, and provides graduates to major international banks and companies.
He then received the Director General of the Internal Security Force Staff Major General Marwan Zain, and discussed with him the security conditions in the country and the conditions of the Internal Security Force organization.
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants Mahmud Hamud said that the Lebanese-European Partnership Agreement "allows Lebanon to strengthen its role as a financial and service center for the Middle East and the Arab World, and improves its competitive ability".
Hamud will travel to Luxembourg tomorrow morning via Paris, and will then travel to London on Monday afternoon to join the delegation accompanying Prime Minister Al-Hariri on his official visit to Britain.
2 - Liberalization of industrial materials with some exceptions.
He believed, "The importance of the Agreement lies in Lebanon joining the communities surrounding it, as a member of the international community."
The European Union constitutes Lebanon's first commercial partner in terms of imports. Lebanon exports more than a quarter of its production to the Union area.
A diplomatic source reported that the senior officials discussed the political and security tracts for a plan of action agreed at the Conference of European Union Foreign Minister in Valencia on the 24th of last April, specifically, its implementation and the schedule allocated to it.
Al-Hariri Responds to Question from Mansur: "Middle East" Losses Continually Falling.

Thirdly, concerning privatization of the Company:
Fourthly: in the matter of the leasing of three 200-330 type aircraft and the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding to purchase six 200-321 aircraft:
The financial situation of the company has been improving continuously since 1998 with operating losses falling by 30 million dollars to 50 million dollars, compared with 80 million dollars in 1997.
The Supreme Council of the Free Patriots Party demanded that those in power derive benefit "from the Al-Matan by-elections by adopting the principle of neutral government to supervise the elections and draft an election law that provides the requirements for common life".
We believe that the regional conditions and the socio-economic crises must encourage all to commit to frank and serious dialogue, and avoid categorizing citizens into groups and levels, and the attempts at openness and containment on a seasonal basis.
Elsewhere, we are surprised how the government can mobilize its agencies to work for the success of the summer season when we see its gross inability to provide an electrical supply and put an end to the law making.
Acknowledgement of the other is a right for which there can be no exception. The respecting of an opposing view is a sacred duty, especially in pluralist societies. We recall that the dark ages have gone never to return, and with them the inspection courts and the fatwas of death, blasphemy and oppression.
President Emile Lahoud of Lebanon welcomed to Ba'abda Palace yesterday the State Minister for Administrative Reforms Fuad Al-Sa'ad, who briefed him on the results of a seminar held in Beirut on the "republic mediator" issue. Republic mediators from more than eighteen Arab, European, and American states attended the seminar. Al Sa'ad gave the President the primary copy of the annual report of the Ministry of Administrative Reforms. The copy includes the ministry's most significant administrative achievements and the training courses it organized, particularly those involving the relationship between the state's authority and citizens.

Salama Holds Press Conference Today to Highlight Tal Irqa's Archeological Significance
The event brought to Irqa for the first time the importance it deserves in official sources of information and to archeological expeditions. It is hoped that this attention continues to grow, in order to reveal the site's outstanding archeological and cultural heritage and to bring about its historical and archeological importance.
Deputy Prime Minister Essam Faris held a banquet in the Jannat Irqa hotel in honor of participants. The manager of PM's office in the north, Brigadier William Mujalli, attended the banquet. He conveyed greetings and welcome messages from the Deputy Prime Minister to the archeological expedition members in Akar, in general, and in Tal Irqa, in particular. "Tal Irqa is considered a historical and cultural beacon for the peoples and civilizations that crossed the area four thousand years ago and left valuable signs that, we hope, will be discovered by the archeological researchers."
Subsequent lectures will focus on the second intermediate and modern Bronze Ages.
However, the deterioration of the situation in the West Bank and Gaza to a point that is likely to ignite a full-scale regional confrontation forced Bush to intervene further, especially in view of Sharon's failure to stop Palestinian resistance to his repeated incursions in the West Bank and Gaza.
However, the mere American tendency to mention a political return for the Palestinians within the framework of solving the conflict scared Sharon, who does not wish to get involved in any political process with the Palestinians. Sharon fears that his "Likud" rival Benjamin Netanyahu, who is opposing him in the upcoming general elections, will use that against him to strip him of the support he enjoys among Israeli electors.
When Sharon realized that the conference would give the peace process a new push, regardless of the level of participating delegations, he asked the U.S. to postpone it.
In this regard, the administration partially agreed to the Israeli request when Secretary of State Colin Powell announced that he recommends the establishment of a temporary Palestinian state.
Overall, Bush is avoiding confrontation with Sharon. His major task now is to talk to moderate Arab states, particularly Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan, to convince them that Washington is seriously pursuing a solution in the Middle East. In reality, the U.S. is not taking any steps toward a serious solution, which should start with exercising pressure on Israel to withdraw from the occupied lands in return for peace.
Before heading for Washington, Egyptian President Husni Mubarak was keen to win support for his initiative by contacting countries involved in the Middle East peace process and providing them the details of his political vision for settling the conflict.
To avoid embarrassing President George Bush, he drafted his initiative in consultation with the U.S. State Department, which in turn approved the 1967 borders as a basis for negotiations.
The 35th anniversary of the 1967 war, or what has become known as the day of relapse, produces a large number of questions in the Arab world. The questions are not related to reasons behind losing that war-much has been said about that. The questions actually wonder why Arabs have been standing by helplessly against recovering the minimum of their rights lost in the 1967 war: Security Council Resolution 242, regarding the withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces from occupied territories.
"But in spite of the attempts to split these forces, especially the Kataib Party and Lebanese forces, into opposition and pro-ruling, and the readiness of these forces to split and scatter in the framework of the opposition section of these forces, within and beyond the 'Qirna Shahwan meeting,' the Matn elections demonstrated the solidarity of that section and included it in the 'Sectarian system'. . ."
First, what happened to Archbishop Haddad clearly reveals the emergence of dormant fundamentalist Christian movements. There are other indications of this conclusion. They have started to express themselves in many practices that Lebanese society, particularly the Christian community, has not known before. Those practices appear as prayers, worship, demonstrations, processions, and so on.
Third, what is the benefit of religious media? That is despite objections to such projects raised here and there. There is no doubt that harm resulting from such media organizations is much greater than benefits-if there is any kind of benefit, especially in a diverse society such as Lebanese society, which has been witnessing overwhelming, increasing sectarian emotion and affiliation.
Fifth, the danger of all forms of fundamentalism and consequently demagoguery, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, is the threat facing Lebanese civil society. No matter how patriotic, noble, and sublime are the motives behind a fundamentalist movement, it cannot protect society from further rupture. The damage will be huge then.
It is useful to know that the goals of the campaign against Archbishop Haddad at that time were not to push him against the church, but were goals that were less modest and more "local."
During yesterday's invitation of the Union of Chambers, he spoke about the integration of the private sector into the global trade system. Chairman of the Union Adnan Al-Qassar, a large number of chiefs and members of economic and trade organizations, businessmen, and other interested parties attended the invitation.
"In our view, it is no longer possible to achieve sustained economic growth within a single state or a single area without a wider economic domain, in a time where barriers are being lifted to guarantee the flow of commodities, services, and capital. It drives the economic departments to respond to and coordinate with such freedom."

Total Deficit 41.43%
As to implementation of the budget, its deficit until the end of last May was 1020 billion, i.e., a deficit rate of 33.3%, compared to a reported deficit of 1134 billion for this period the previous year, at a rate of 19.3%.
On the other hand, the summarized financial position shows a 30 billion pound decrease in non-tax revenues. The majority of this is due to the continued drop in the transfer of the communications budget reserve at an amount of 16 billion until the end of the current month of June, compared to what was the total until the end of May of the previous year.
President Emile Lahud received a delegation from the European Investment Bank yesterday, including its President Francis Mayer, Head of the Mediterranean and Balkan Loan Operations Antonio Buglizi, and the Chief Officer of Loan Operations for Lebanon and Jordan Rene Perez Diaz. The meeting was also attended by Chairman of the Construction and Development Council Jamal Itani and Secretary General of the Council Ghazi Haddad.
President Lahud expressed his thanks to Mayer for the support Lebanon gets from the European Investment Bank.
The discussions included developing relations between Lebanon and the European Bank, especially after signing the Partnership Agreement next Monday, "which makes it imperative for Lebanon to increase its industrial competitiveness and to generally improve its technological abilities, as the European Partnership Agreement will encourage foreign investment in the industrial and service sectors. The Agreement is also to open markets for Lebanese products all over Europe with no customs or other obstacles."
On this occasion, Miqati delivered a speech in which he expressed determination for developing the Port of Tripoli to prepare it for the expected trade movement, and so that the Port of Beirut becomes another gateway to the eastern Arab homeland.

He indicated that funds can be received in cash from the company's office, or if the amount is more than 500 dollars, it will be transferred directly to the buyer's account abroad.
Governor Riyad Salama sounded optimistic about several recent measures, particularly the marketing of Euro bonds, "which has attracted big demand in all banks." He also sounded optimistic about the balance of payments, which achieved a surplus 220 million dollars in March, and he expected it to increase in June.
The monthly meeting of the Governor of the Bank of Lebanon with the Bank Society delegation was held yesterday at noon in the Bank and chaired by Salama.
During his talk about development in the financial and banking sectors, the Governor mentioned the positive climates that were prevalent in the parts market during the past few weeks and the Bank of Lebanon's intervention in U.S. dollar purchasing.
"As to priorities in this regard, they will be based on the offers submitted to the state and might include more than one type of these inputs."
The meeting raised one of the agenda issues regarding internal supervision systems. Bank Society Chairman Joseph Tarbiya mentioned the immense effort made by the banking sector in this regard. Moreover, he clarified the continuous efforts to pave the way for banks, in preparation for the adaptation of internal supervision systems and their common systems, particularly those being developed by the Society.
The Society finally presented the proposed bill. A copy was sent to the Minister of Finance and to the Bank of Lebanon.
His fingers barely touch the piano.
The father and son intended that the break time be filled with birdsong.
The performance was full of life, simple, and compliant with the touch of the notes, making the melody warm in its core, emerging from the serenity of the hands and indifferent to the inner self.
He is a romanticist even when his fingers play the impressionistic music of Rafael, who himself has been liberated from the past's melodies into a more transparent and personal freedom in his compositions.
In every piece played is a tragic memory, melancholy and dark.
Al-Basha knows the way to it. He is farsighted. He gets to the essence of things by breaking through the exteriors.
The "Funeral March" from Chopin's Sonata No. 2 was part of the evening program. Abdel Rahman Al-Basha had chosen gray and black colors as a theme for the evening, along with some divergences, like the one he played accompanied by his son and dedicated to Oxilia's childhood and to all who long for the age of spontaneous innocence.
Keep the Memory Without Mourning
The events of September 11 broke all barriers that block information and provided a good opportunity for officials to tell the international public and media about everything related to people who committed such crimes.
The judiciary did not want the event to be devoted to blaming a certain person or party. The Chairman of Supreme Judiciary Council, Nasri Lahud, emphasized this approach and was determined that the memorial ceremonies should reflect the event's significance.
A slap in the face? Two slaps in the face like bullets . . . and Bishop Gregoire Haddad falls to the ground amid overwhelming astonishment.
He was quiet and sad.
The Public Relations Branch of the Internal Security Forces released the following statement: "At 8:00 p.m. on the 14th of this month, three young men arrived at the entrance of the Tele Lemiar television station building before the arrival of Bishop Gregoire Haddad, who was expected to be interviewed by Tele Lemiar. Father Sami Mihanna, one of the officials of the station, was waiting for him in front of the building."
"An investigation was started under the supervision of Jabal Libnan, Prosecutor General of Appeals Jean Fahd and Attorney General Elias Eid."
It is of utmost concern to Al-Nahar to assure readers that it did not mean any offence to Deir Al-Ahmar or its people. This information was based on relevant church circles and was published literally.
A Mercedes 280 public vehicle with license plates 190887 caught fire inside the Firdan parking lot opposite Sayyar Al-Dark at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. The cause of the fire remains unknown.
"The defendant Awad Umar Ibrahim was brought before this court, son of a woman named Um Kulthum, born in 1966; he is a Sudanese by nationality. He was arrested on 6/14/2001, put in jail on 6/18/2001 until this day. Moreover, two defendants were brought before this court."
The audience felt as though they were falling with the Bishop, then rising with him, stunned by the incident. It is terrorism. It is a copy of the cold-blooded mass killing taking place in some Arab cities. It is the violence that denies the right of others to speak and to live freely.
Bishop Gregoire Haddad is used to confronting "people of darkness" and combating them within their shelters, without fear of the consequences, whatever they might be. Thus, he is now asked to resume his open dialog with believers and non-believers, as he used to do in his articles and with his brilliant ideas.
Perhaps the assault against the Bishop will provide an example that must be learned by all those who resemble that reckless boy, and all those who stand behind him. An example of tolerance, but the tolerance of the strong, the sensible, and the educated. The tolerance of Gregoire Haddad, the bishop who will continue to carry the torch in the midst of the darkness that threatens us.
Unburied
Thoughts of passion
And the child awaits the impossible
To the carriers of swords
Wearing the clouds of the sky
Hailing the homes
A thousand thousand shames
Destruction and extinction.
Pass by the crucified homeland
And victory is a song
In morning and evening
And the sounds of wind
They say:
The scent of the country
Where are the poems
Pass above the minarets and churches
Coming as a bride comes
"Going Back To Roots" by Amaal Malik; A Lebanese Lost Between Home and Abroad by Matar Jum'a
"Undoubtedly, the book raises several challenges, such as the new world that inspires new aspirations in pupils and students, which can lead to conflict between their Lebanese identity and the other nationality they acquired abroad."
"What is this returning Lebanese woman?"
"The advice and suggestions given by Mrs. Malik in her book, particularly on page 272, are useful, valuable, and worthwhile."
Educational Reform Conference Inaugurated: The Pupil is the Only Cornerstone, Sa'ada Yusif Murad Said
"The Ministry of Finance is continuing to put obstacles before paying retired teachers' salaries. It also hinders procedures for promoting teachers to high school professors. These are major demands by government teachers and solving them will give positive support to the image of government education."
"No doubt you all know that the Teachers Association in Lebanon, as any other professional association, is affiliated with the Ministry of Labor."
"This duplication has frequently caused the Association much confusion."
On his part, Rasheed Yusif, the Chairman of the League of Graduates of Administration Institute and the Bureau of Coordination Between Teachers and Public Sector Employees, called for support of the Lebanese University and for enabling it to activate its role in educational planning, cultural development, and communication with the market and developing needs for professional excellence.
"The essential elements of the educational process are objectives, content, teaching methods, and evaluation. Each of these essential elements needs improvement, and there is no one who can assume and perform this role better than you, the education professionals."
The Minister inspected examination center rooms in the Raml Al-Zarif secondary school of Beirut (Rene Muawwad). The Minister was accompanied by the Head of Beirut Educational Administration Wael Al-Tanneer, Director of Exams Department Hassan Malik, and his office manager Hisham Tubbara.
After the tour, Murad stated, "These exams are being held for the last time on the old curricula basis. They combine two types of students; the first group consists of students who failed last year, and the second group consists of students who left school years ago."
"We look forward to good results. We applied the idea this year considering that every person and every citizen is entitled to apply for a baccalaureate regardless of his/her age, provided he/she is more than 20 years old, while those who apply for the intermediary exam must be more than 17 years old."
He was asked what the gain would be for someone who takes the exam but does not write a single word, and he replied, "Perhaps some people thought it would be a walk in the park and they could pass easily, but that is a misconception."
"We don't intend to intimidate or frighten; giving marks will be a fair process. Every student will receive his/her mark against what he/she wrote. We will not make up marks."
Minister Murad also visited the Zok Misbah public intermediary school and toured the handicraft, scientific, and artistic exhibition that was organized by pupils. Present were the school director Samira Al-Debs, members of the educational staff, Public School Friends Secretary General Suhail Matar, Deputy Director of the Zok Misbah municipality George Mughamis, Zok secondary school director Makhayel Eili Khalil, and a group of parents.
A strong-willed person, whether healthy or disabled, can perform miracles. Such a person is so determined that no obstacle can stop him.
Deaf, dumb, and blind, Helen Keller represents a story of challenge, a poem of hope, and a song of "Yes" for life.
At the age of eighteen months, she became blind, deaf, and dumb.
"The world is paradise," she used to repeat.
She used to say, "I love it."
"That is why I say that 'I see' and 'I hear,' because I understand as well as others do."
Helen Keller wrote 25 books, each of which was a message of hope.
Let Helen Keller be a lesson for those who have the power of sight but cannot see anything, for those who have sound ears but cannot hear anything, and those who can speak but do not say a word.
Director of the Centre culturel français in Tripoli, Philippe Ardoine, delivered a speech in which he said, "Mrs. Bushra Adra deserved recognition for her diligence, energetic drive, and success in establishing several organizations relevant to culture and spreading the French language in the North and in Lebanon."
French cultural attaché Alain Fuque spoke on behalf of the French government about the award recipient since she graduated from the Orthodox school in Tripoli, and about her interest in teaching the French language and educating people. He hailed her teaching experience in the Akar group of villages, along with her "understanding of the negative impact of poor French on children's educational achievements."
"Mrs. Bushra Adra has an extremely lovable presence, is tactful when she speaks, objective when she complains, erudite when she lectures, and persuasive when she discusses. That is why her success and recognition are not a surprise. Perhaps she should have been honored earlier."
The International Federation released a statement saying, "Having seen the videotape recording of the match between Brazil and Costa Rica held on June 13 in Suwon, FIFA's Technical Study Group decided to assign Brazil's first goal scored in the tenth minute of the match to Ronaldo."

"The coaches discussed the matter for 40 minutes before making their final decision."
Yesterday, President of French Football Federation Claude Simone gave the French team's coach Roger Lemerre until July 5 to make a decision regarding his future. The announcement came after France exited the first round of the 17th World Cup finals, failing to defend its title.
On the other hand, the Federation president revealed that national technical manager Eme Jacke, who was invited to the meeting, did not attend and that he is considering retirement in 2003.
Noteworthy is the total number of goals scored by the end of the first round of the 1998 World Cup in France-126, including 12 penalty kicks. No penalty kick missed scoring.

Warsaw Criticizes Jewish Demand to Condemn Massacre; New Development in AIDS Research
Poland's Prime Minister Lecik Miller said yesterday, "I believe that Bad Fashim's demand to change the inscription was made rashly (...) This is an extremely painful episode in our history (...) Let us put emotions aside and let the wounds heal. Through agreement and calm,"
Bad Fashim sponsors research and cautionary programs related to Nazi crimes against Jews.
Published on the prominent Nicher web site, the research showed that this protein's biological restraint enabled the SIM 15 gene to function and prevent the virus from multiplying.
"The problem is that few people are working in this field, and that is the reason why progress might not be rapid."
He said, "I do not understand why a Bedouin Arab or a Circassian1 community gathering in one place is considered legitimate, but when a Jewish community does the same thing, it is considered racist."
Critics described the bill, which was proposed by the Religious National Party Mifdal, as racist.
The controversy goes back several years, when a married couple by the name of Adel and Iman Qi'dan tried to purchase a house in the area of Katsir in Jalil, where better services are available. Their request was denied.
Spanish Foreign Minister Ana Palacio called on Morocco yesterday to understand the message that Madrid is trying to send by deploying its naval units near the island of Berjil, or Laila according to the Arabic name. The Moroccan army established a surveillance center there last Thursday, triggering tension between the two countries.
"There is a symbolic language, such as patrol boats, understood by everyone."
"We are a democratic, European Union-member state (...) Accordingly, we will let some time pass and then analyze the possibility of no response" from Morocco, she added.
Yesterday, a source in the port of Ceuta reported that Madrid has sent a frigate to reinforce its naval fleet off the two pockets.

It expressed the opinion that "the presence of civilians and Moroccan authority on the island of Laila has continued for 45 years."
It said that it is appropriate in the meantime, "to distinguish between the status of the island of Laila and the case of the last Spanish-occupied Moroccan strongholds."
*In Cairo, the Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa was informed by Moroccan Foreign Minister Muhammad ibn Eissa of the latest developments on the Moroccan island.

Indian Foreign Minister Jasuant Singh said, "It is obvious that this attack was inspired by Pakistan." Known as a hard-liner, Edvani will inform Prime Minister Atal Pihari Vagbani and senior ministers of his mission's results.
According to the police, the attack's death toll rose to 27, including 13 women and a 3-year-old child, and 35 others were injured.
It also called on "the government of India to end its suppression in Jamo and Kashmir, and to adopt reason, justice, and dialog as a means of settling the Kashmir dispute according to the aspirations of the Kashmiri people."
Kashmiri Prime Minister Faruk Abd-Allah said, "Until the superpowers, the U.S.A. and others, understand that as long as terrorism is based in Pakistan, this type of violent operation will continue."
Intensive diplomatic efforts succeeded in limiting the crisis in early June, and Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf vowed to "permanently" stop the violation of borders.
It explained that the exercises will last for ten days. Navy, air force, and land forces units will participate. The location for the exercises has not yet been chosen.
Deputy Inspector General of the Pakistani Abotabad region, Rao Amin Hashem, stated yesterday that police want to interrogate a tour guide of a group of German and foreign tourists who were injured in a blast that took place while they were inspecting an ancient cultural site in Mansehra, around 70 kilometers north of Islamabad.
"Then I saw blood and two people lying on the floor. I asked what happened."
Television media reported yesterday that the authorities arrested 16 people in order to interrogate them for possible connection to the attack.
Sheik Umar Said, who is a London-born son of a Pakistani cloth merchant, faces possible extradition to the U.S.A., even if he is acquitted.
The "Babel" daily newspaper, supervised by the Iraqi President's eldest son Uday Saddam Hussein, was the sole newspaper to publish a photograph of former Crown Prince of Jordan Hassan ibn Talal attending the London conference. The Prince is the uncle of King Abd-Allah II of Jordan.
Three kings reigned in Iraq from 1921 until the 14th of July Revolution, namely King Faisal I, King Ghazi, and King Faisal II.
He added, "There are plans to invade Iraq from the south (Kuwait), west (Jordan), and north (Turkey)."
Concerning the London conference, General Najeeb Al-Salihi, a former leader of the Iraqi Republican Guard and member of the joint staff before fleeing Iraq in 1995, stated the U.S. will discover that launching a military offensive against Iraq to topple Saddam will be much easier than they thought, foreseeing an immediate collapse of the Iraqi army once an American attack is launched.
He dismissed American concerns about the possibility that Saddam's regime is producing chemical or biological weapons, saying the Iraqi President does not have means to use such weapons.
He expressed an opinion that the diplomatic path is the only option "and if that fails, then the other option would be intelligence operations aimed solely at overthrowing the regime."
Washington Rejects Afghan Supervision on Military Operations and Kabul Remains Silent Regarding Southern Governors Action; United Nations
Deputy Governor Muhammad Shuayb Wafa confirmed that "one or two governors" arrived Saturday in Kabul and held an informal working session.
Commenting on Gol Agha's suggestion, a spokesman of the American Central Command in Tampa, Florida, Major Ralf Mills, said that Washington will continue to work closely with the Afghan government but will not allow the Afghans to manage military operations.
It quoted an Afghan army officer as saying that the attack took place in a desert area on soldiers who were patrolling the area, searching for suspected smugglers.
He also explained that the interim government needs 397 million dollars in the next three months to fund its aid programs.

This retreat can be seen in the political discourse of the two victorious partners of the 2000 elections, Prime Minister Rafeek Al-Hariri and Deputy Walid Junbulat, which has started to be influenced by the emotional effect on the Los Angeles Conference. It demonstrates a tone and concepts that place the two owners of that discourse in a position totally contradictory to the condition that carried them to election victory two years ago.
In the current political climate after the secondary elections in AL-Matn and the Los Angeles Conference, those are below the Syrian red lines even if Junbulat does not admit that publicly.
Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri's claim could be understood; he is attempting to protect himself before anything else, as numerous political fronts are opening their doors before him.
Is Lebanon facing a new hard-line phase launched by talks with the Syrian president that returned us to linking Lebanese-Syrian relations to Lebanese- Lebanese relations? This has brought back a cold war of coups to internal politics, bringing everything back to zero.
I swear! It seems that someone developed this invention by expanding the database that contains blacklists of actors, directors, and films to include live performances and singers. Moreover, he found a way to feed the database continuously so that if a mistake is committed, "The Monitor" records the offender's name and marks him/her with a black mark. His file is then distributed to all boards, conferences, links, and clubs that are against cultural invasion, so that they take action at the first opportunity and so no one escapes punishment.
Two months ago there was a hue and cry in Palestine, but surprisingly our nation can sleep peacefully.
Maybe Khalid made a mistake, or let us say it is indeed a mistake.
If only those campaigners had asked Simon Shahin, Khalid's partner in today's concert.
But performing in those two concerts is at least a statement to those against naturalization, saying that the world is not black and white. If only they paid attention.
Let them be a minority at Beiteddine tonight.
Police said the assailant, Maxim Bronri (25 years old), has a criminal record, indeed, and he is a mentally unstable "right-wing extremist."
four days have passed since the incident with no arrest of the suspect, Badi' Waleed Hamada, alias "Abu-Ubayda," in the army.
Before traveling to New York. Mahir said, "President Bush will discuss the latest developments of the situation with the Arab ministers. In particular, we are aiming at putting an end to the deteriorated situation, achieving Israeli withdrawal, and providing political assistance in establishing the Palestinian state."
General Tawfiq Yasiri, who was elected as a spokesman of the council, stated in a press conference, "The major task"
It quoted security sources as saying that this operation was carried out by a "terrorist group." It took place Saturday evening in Milyana, a suburb of the city of Ayn EL-Dafla, 70 kilometers southwest of the capital.
Concerns about deterioration of resolve were raised because of the blurred position of Palestinian factions, on one hand, and the lack of any practical steps to arrest the murderer, on the other hand.
Although Al-Miqdah mentioned that 100 Palestinians were in the custody of the camp's security committee "in pursuit of the criminal and attempting to detain and hand him over to the army," all communications and efforts failed to detain and hand him over.
On the other hand, it is obvious that measures taken around the camp are likely to be intensified until the man accused of killing the three soldiers is turned in.
On another issue, the decision to prohibit the use of diesel-fuelled vans will be enforced as of today.
Former Iraqi officers and representatives of the opposing Iraqi National Conference ended a meeting in London yesterday. They elected a military council to represent them in attempts to overthrow President Saddam Hussein and work towards initiating civil rule. They called on the Iraqi army to join them.
Among members of the Council are General Najeeb Al-Salihi, who commanded a mechanical army division, and General Saad aL-Ubeidi, who was in charge of psychological warfare before fleeing in 1986.
The officers, like other opposition groups, believe that Iraqis are yearning for the fall of the regime but are afraid to join any new uprising without guaranteed military support from the U.S.
He said the Iraqi President "poses threats that we cannot live with indefinitely."
Meanwhile, in a press conference he held in Damascus, Iranian Chief Judge Ayutallah Mahmoud Hashimi Shahrudi warned the Iraqi opposition of the consequences of falling into the "American trap." He said the U.S. wants to use this opposition for "its own interests in the region."

Before traveling to New York he said, "President Bush will discuss the latest developments with the Arab ministers. In particular, we are aiming at putting an end to the deteriorating situation, achieving Israeli withdrawal, and assisting the establishment of the Palestinian state."
During a meeting at the Arab League headquarters in Cairo, the nine members of the Arab Peace Plan Monitoring Committee confirmed that the Arab triplet delegation will inform the quadrilateral committee of its commitment to that plan.
In Jerusalem, Sharon's office mentioned that the prime minister approved the new meetings between Perez and Palestinian officials.
He said that the meeting between Perez and Muhammad Rasheed, Financial and Economic Advisor to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, was held with prior approval from Sharon.
It considered that the priority is to "stop Zionist aggression and appropriation and to stop the blood shed in Palestinian territories," and that not doing so "will remain a type of futility, a maneuver, a waste of time, and going around the peace process and emptying it of its content. It will represent a collusion and will contribute to the elongation of suffering and extension of the conflict, occupation, and aggression."
Prime Minister Rafeek Al-Hariri telephoned French President Jacques Chirac last night, congratulating him on the anniversary of French National Day and for surviving the assassination attempt on his life during the July 14 celebrations in Paris.
After the one-hour meeting, Junbulat said, "There is no doubt that the incident that took place in Sayda is really disturbing, and we must take care of it. National and faithful factions inside the camp must hand over the murderers because the Lebanese state will not, and may not, neglect this issue. However, this matter must not be an incentive or a pretext for some organizations to say that there are unsecured pockets."
"Dialog is not just for the sake of dialog; it is intended to generate results. The result, as I mentioned before the politically and religiously united France rejected Le Pin, is what we have seen happen there today, when a right-wing individual tried to assassinate Chirac. Right-wing extremism is extremely dangerous, and that is why we all have to reject any type of extremism."
The sources expressed surprise that these states accept blocking the Arab Peace Initiative until the Palestinian issue is finalized, which might last until Spring of 2003.
In light of the New York meeting with Maher and Ma'ashar, the international Quartet, particularly the U.S., will assign Egypt and Jordan to the task of negotiating on behalf of the Palestinian party. Both states maintain full diplomatic relations with Israel and can open direct lines with the Hebrew state. If such authorization is given, it may be lead to further Arab repulsion instead of solidarity.
The three ministers will work effectively to defend the Palestinian issue and for the implementation of the Arab Peace Initiative. In fact, it was Saudi Arabia who launched the initiative. They hope that the New York and Washington meetings will pave the way for a meeting between the Quartet and all members of the Arab Initiative Committee soon to develop a comprehensive working mechanism for all Peace Process tracks, and for adopting the Arab Initiative, which includes a comprehensive resolution mechanism that is the first of its kind.
The reception started with a military exhibition, after which Ambassador Le Cortier promoted some military personnel before placing a wreath on the shrine of martyrs.
He referred to the French support of Lebanon, quoting French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin on France's efforts toward Lebanon's independence, sovereignty, and prosperity.
"It also has to include a solution for the Palestinian refugees issue that should take the interests of Lebanon into consideration."
He renewed his confidence in the Lebanese determination to double their efforts in the area of economic reform and development, stating his delight that "Lebanon has signed partnership agreements with the European group, which opens new horizons for it, not only economic but also political and cultural."
"It will also emphasize the important position that Lebanon occupies among countries, and lastly, it allows for initiating an international meeting for cultural dialog, a dialog that has become necessary since September 11."

President Amin Al-Jumayil announced, "We will continue to confront all conspiracies aimed at devastating the Lebanese case and destroying the body, sovereignty, and dignity of the Lebanese people."
Karama then spoke and said, "We are in dire need these days of a leadership of love, dynamism, patriotism, and freedom, a leadership that believes in deed more than words. The dispensary whose opening we are celebrating today is an image of the Phalanges that was always the party of laborers and strugglers, a people's party in the true sense of the word. It was not a party for cadres comprised of scores of people who make groundless, inapplicable decisions.
"The current stage is extremely crucial, and Lebanon is a focal point. In face of all these dangers, the entire Lebanese people miss the Phalanges Party that they knew throughout the dangerous and difficult phases of Lebanese history since 1943. The Lebanese people miss that pioneer institution and the Phalanges youth who inscribed the history of Lebanon with their blood."
Junbulat Receives Palestinian Delegation Condemning Sayda Incident and Accepts Rule of Lebanese Law
"In the meeting we confirmed the historic relation that links us as Palestinian people with the late Kamal Junbulat, and today with His Excellency. We also emphasized the substantial relations that link people in the occupied territories with the Druze Initiative Committee. Such meetings have a deep effect on the general situation in the occupied lands."
Junbulat also reviewed development and service issues with a number of delegations, municipality directors, and mayors of several villages.
He called for increased attention to the architectural designs of projects, so that they may acquire a heritage resemblance to the houses in the area, particularly some houses in the town of Batloun, and to the preservation of environment and heritage.
Baalbak - "Al-Nahar":
The visit had a family atmosphere.
Syrian President Bashar El-Assad received Deputy Prime Minister Essam Fares yesterday afternoon in the Asl-Shaab Palace in Damascus.
"And why do people get killed there?"
He expressed his point of view, saying, "If this hand commits a crime, that is because the person it belongs to wants it to commit that crime."
Maronite Patriarch Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Boutros Sfair stated, "The government's tolerance toward criminals by not arresting them and bringing them to justice is a serious example that encouraged those other criminals who committed the awful crime of Sayda, in which three Lebanese soldiers were killed."
Former PMs Hussein Al-Husseini and Rasheed Al-Sulh; Ministers Fuad Al-Saad, Marawan Hamada, Fuad EL-Senyora, and Asaad Diyab; MPs Nabeel Al-Bustani, Naseeb Lahud, and Nim'mat-Allah Abi Nasr; former MP Kameel Ziyada; former Ministers Fuad Boutros, Michal Eddah, and Essam Nu'man; Bishops Rolan Abu-Juda, Boulos Matar, and Elias Ouda; ambassadors and diplomats; the President's Media Advisor Rafeek Shalala; Sheikh Wadee' Al-Khazin; and other figures also attended the event.
Last Saturday afternoon, Umran visited the artist Abd al-Haleem Karkala in his traditional Arab tent inside his new country house on the northeastern outskirts of Baalbak. Chief Editor Rafeek Khouri of "al-Anwar" newspaper and Umar Karkala attended the meeting.

Unlicensed Radio Stations Suggest Technical Solution; Qublan Meets Iranian Chief Judge in Damascus
He proposed that "to prevent interference, stations be required to operate from a single location, and that the transmission center should be owned by the government." He also suggested that "adopting this modern technical solution will enable the government to increase revenues and save employees from losing their jobs because cutting off livelihoods is like cutting throats."
Qublan delivered a speech, saying, "We in Lebanon are with the (Iranian) Republic, with all its noble, truthful, and straightforward aims. We also consider Syria to be a center for noble endeavors and for supporting revolution and resistance."
Minister of Health Suleiman Franjieh criticized "the unresponsiveness of the ruling government regarding projects in the Zagrata - Ehden area." He described it as "the rule we thought had arrived with wealth (...) We cannot say more."
The national anthem opened the event.
Director of the Hospital Dr. Joseph Franjieh delivered a speech and explained the phases of obtaining, repairing, preparing, equipping, and recruiting for the building.
"The confidence that Zagarta had given us throughout our lives is, of course, much more than any material project, hospital, or ministry."
"After four years, we are now doing what we should have finished four years ago."
"The interest of Lebanon and the region is what joins me to people who are cooperating with me and my brothers, the leaders of Zagarta. No one wishes to hamper any project."
Then Minister Franjieh cut the ribbon and inspected the hospital's sections and departments with attendees.
There are hopes to provide the hospital with a surgical operating room and a recovery room.
It seems the pledge of Municipality Director Usta Abu-Rejeili when he assumed office in 1998 is bringing positive results. In 1998, Abu-Rejeili pledged that he would "work to bring it back to its normal position as a summer capital and a favored location for Arab summer visitors by rebuilding it and rehabilitating its infrastructure to restore its busy past." This town has become a model for many towns and villages in the area that enjoy the same Bahamdoon Station features. Its commercial market and fresh air are positive factors in restoring our basic "industry," i.e., tourism.
Commercial shops that were inactive last summer are receiving customers this year.
He added, "Anyone who passes by Bahamdoon today notices the difference. It is an unequalled upswing, just as Solidaire's previous upswing. But Bahamdoon remains a wonder, because tens of design engineers worked for Solidaire, and millions of dollars were spent. Conversely, Bahamdoon Station was set before a municipality director within a difficult outlook, but he worked for it with full confidence. The work has produced tangible results, especially the commercial market packed with shops. If we had more shops, they would also be fully occupied by customers."
He noted that "speeding up the work can destroy everything, particularly from a city-planning perspective. That is exactly what happened in Beirut (...) Bahamdoon Station needs a high percentage of visitors, and this has not happened yet. However, I believe all factors notwithstanding, it is now experiencing the start of a golden age for a summer season that was preceded by Prime Minister Rafeek al-Hariri's announcement that he expects hundreds of thousands of immigrants and Arab summer visitors in Lebanon."
"It is well-known that summer visitors spend money in restaurants, cafeterias, and shops. As such, they do not come to Lebanon to buy cars or air conditioners."
Qassim: Accusations Against "Hezbollah" Meant to Ruin its Ability to Confront Israel; Seminar Commemorating Haffez Assad's Shebl Eissa El-Khuri's Anniversary
Israel is not confident that it will achieve any possible results if it launches any new attacks against Lebanon. The Zionist enemy must defend its position, because they are the aggressors who are fervently trying to manipulate us with unprecedented American support to legitimize the occupation and to make the most of the aggression on Lebanon and Palestine."
MPs Robert Ghanem, Muhammad Ali Al-Meis, and Faisal Al-Dawod, Metropolite Esperedon Khuri, Colonel Fayez Amhaz was a representative of Army Commander Brigadier Michel Sulayman, Military Intelligence Deputy Director Colonel Ali Samili, Biqaa State Security Director Colonel Charles Atta, Colonel Abd-Allah Al-Hariri on behalf of the Security and Reconnaissance Branch of the Syrian forces operating in Lebanon, and several party, political, and social figures, attended the event.
Eli Al-Farazli expressed his view that Haffez Assad "Was the only Syrian president since the Sikes Pico agreement to talk about Lebanon as a state."
After reading from the Bible, Bishop al-Besri gave a sermon in which he talked about "The meaning of martyrdom in the Christian church and the renaissance after death."
"Lebanon was victorious, and Palestine restored its presence. That is why we find the discourse of (George) Bush and his attack against Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine, and the attempt to form an authority.
Nabatiya - "Al-Nahar":
Khreis said, "Lebanon is experiencing a state of security and political pressure that is meant to disturb internal stability and destroy all the achievements that have been made since the agreement of Al-Taif, in light of the internal peaceful state witnessed by Lebanon consequent to that agreement, as well as the comprehensive national development state and the liberation that was accomplished two years ago."
"From the Arab age we live under today and the Israeli age that we fought with all our abilities."
Explosives were attached to the foundations of the hote,l then detonated around half past eleven. Prior to that, security forces had blocked all roads to the location.
Perhaps this is what its Municipality Director Usta Abu-Rejeili referred to when he assumed office in 1998, that he "will take it quickly back to its natural position as a summer capital and a preferred location for Arab summer visitors by rebuilding it and revamping its infrastructure so that it is restored to its past status." Perhaps all of that places this town on the right path as an exemplary model for many towns and villages that enjoy the same features of Bahamdoon Station. Its commercial market and fresh air are factors for reviving our basic "industry," i.e., tourism.
Municipal work is new to Talabbas. The first municipal council was established there in 1998 and consisted of 12 members presided over by Tony Hanna, who noted, "The conditions of deprivation experienced by the villages and towns of Akkar largely apply to Telabbas, which has suffered a lot at the level of services and infrastructure development projects, such as electricity, water, roads, telephone, potable water networks, and sewerage, in addition to the basic problems related to the basic agricultural return."
So what happened?
The culprits declared that they "are proud to be Muslims, and that they raped non-Muslim girls."
The culprits were all born in Lebanon or are the children of Lebanese emigrants who fled the civil war in the 1980s.
Angry reactions kindled hostile emotions against Muslims and increased the conservative government's stringency towards emigrants in general, and asylum seekers from Muslim countries in particular.
Religious leader Sheikh Khaleel Al-Shami strongly criticized Lebanese families, which he accused of isolating their children from Australian society and of not promoting harmony between various sects.
Among 25 filed complaints, 18 Lebanese young men were accused of committing 380 violations of the law against 11 women.
New Political Status Quo
Signed agreements, on the other hand, are now void of any significance or true value; a new political status quo is developing under ceased negotiations and continuous hostilities.
True enough, the Israeli prime minister is still far from keeping his promise of restoring security to the lives of Israelis. In spite of the Israeli re-occupation of the West Bank, the Palestinian operations, albeit seriously reduced, have not stopped. There is also no guarantee that Palestinian suicidal operations, which may target Israeli soldiers instead of being carried out in Israel itself, will not recur.
Criticism of his policy in the press has abated, and there is no fear that his government might collapse soon. It will most probably remain solid until it is time for the general elections in 2003. His popularity among Israelis also remains large and firm, and his leadership of his Likud party is now more deeply entrenched.
And there is another point. Anyone who believes that the Palestinians' political loss will currently be restricted to them alone is mistaken. It is also a loss for Syria, who is still waiting for an opportunity to liberate the Jolan Heights of Israeli occupation.
On the Eve of Telecom Law Discussion, Ojero Employees: We Want Equality
"Members of the Parliament, tomorrow you will have the Telecommunications Law in your hands. Let your sole reference be your consciences."
"In its new tenth article, Law 161 shows how to calculate the end of service compensation:"
"It was signed for initial approval by Minister of Telecommunications Jean Louis Qirdahi on the April 6, 2001."
"So, can there be a simultaneous combination of summer and winter?"
"The Association Council has made intensive contacts and consultations with a number of members of the telecommunications and administration and justice committees, judges, and lawyers, each of whom gave responses contradictory to the others'. This has led to the open strike called for by the General Assembly on Friday 7/12/2002."
Shuayb mentioned, "The company succeeded recently in reducing legacy debts from 40 million dollars to approximately 22 million, taking into consideration the Bank of Lebanon debt exchange with real estate transaction, which was approved by the bank's Central Council and its implementation is pending some procedural details."
Bint Jubayl - "Al-Nahar":
In its Saturday statement, the Electricity Organization of Lebanon announced that it "was obliged to stop steam group number 3 in Al-Zouk station to perform necessary maintenance operations on it. Completion of the work and resumption of operation is expected within three days, which affects the supply negatively in some areas in Jabal Lebnan."
Minister of Economy and Commerce Bassil Filayjan inaugurated the Second Shopping Festival in the city of Bint Jubayl on Saturday evening on behalf of Prime Minister Rafeek Al-Hariri. Attendees included MP Muhammad Fineish, Bint Jubayl Municipality Director Fayyad Sharara, members of the Municipal Council, members of the Commercial Enterprise Owners Association, association members from southern villages, a delegation from the International Forces, and regional association, security, and religious figures.
He also thanked the supporters, Parliament Chairman Nabeeh Birri in particular.
He demanded completion of the government house and criticized the absence of some ministers from the area. He also emphasized the necessity of compensating the owners of demolished houses and implementation of the potable water project.
Then there was a cocktail party in the city plaza, along with fireworks, athletic shows, and distribution of flyers about the festival, locations of participating shops, and the types of prizes and lots.
The mind, usually affected by words, pictures, and ideas, mixes them together to form a poem; the same thing happens when someone sees a movie.
"A friend introduced us to each other; we smiled and said hello."
"She had rented a house surrounded by land in Saint Tropez, and she later bought it."
Emmanuelle Devos is one of France's new stars who quickly found her way to fame and awards. She was given the Best Actress Award at the last Cesar Awards festival for her role in "Read My Lips." Here she tells some details about her career as an actress.
"I was a student for two years in the free study class at Florent Institute where I had the chance to be a student of Francois Florent. At that time, the Institute was not yet transformed into a factory."
I have talked to you before about "The Monitor," this wonderful invention that allows any viewer who owns a computer and cares for the national interest to face successfully the waves of cultural invasion and globalization brought through satellite dishes.
I swear! It is really an honor to have unknown soldiers taking care of monitoring concerts around the world, watching for suspicious events of normalization (with Israel).
But those against naturalization are still telling the same old story. They do not like the idea that an Arab singer justifies his/her participation in a concert with an Israeli singer in the presence of representatives of the Palestinian authority by helping revive the notion of peace, as Israel seeks to bury it.
Is it worth jeopardizing an art festival that is considered one of the few noble events in Lebanon's cultural life?
This doesn't mean that the Palestinian lute and violin player by himself is enough to grant innocence to a "suspected" colleague.
But if "refusing naturalization" has become an art for the sake of art, then its followers will be happy to learn that they are a minority.
*How did you find your way to the top?
She also worked with Pierre Romain and with Francis Huster, who was a tutor at Florent Institute.
"When I remember that fact, I realize playing a role like that in my twenties was an act of defiance."
*What made you take on this adventure?
"The old mistress of John-Claude Romain wears fur ..."
"I tried hard to imitate her."
"We had to go deep inside that man."
"But the truth is I want to do everything. I would like to act in a comedy."
"I loved the Taviani brothers, Bergman, Fellini, Tovo. I hardly know anything about movies of the 1980s."
"Go back to the numbers of old 'premieres'; half of them are gone."
*Do you have a system of working?
Teachers' and professors' associations are organizing a solidarity meeting under the title "In Solidarity with Public Education and Support of Professors' and Teachers' Rights" at eleven o'clock this morning on the premises of the League of Public Secondary Education Teachers, Onesco.
They called on representatives of educational organizations to "participate intensely."
1- It is now known to all that merging the financial allowance does not impose any financial burdens, so why hasn't the government promptly approved the bill proposed by the Ministry of Education seven months ago to merge the financial allowance into the basic salary?
Having discussed the situation and reviewed supporting positions of youth and student organizations, people, powers, and political and association figures in supporting action and rights, the conferees decided the following:
Fourth: Adopting a series of solidarity pressure-escalating steps during the following (current) week.
They deemed "the authority responsible for the situation resulting from boycotting the correction of public exam contests due to its failure to perform its duties in implementing laws and meeting the legitimate demands of teachers."
The Arab National Forum announced that Archmendrite Dr. Atallah Hanna will be the guest of honor for its Revolution Anniversary.
At seven o'clock in the evening of Friday the 26th, an oratory festival will be held on joint invitation from the Forum and the Arab Cultural Center in the Umar Al-Mukhtar Educational Center, during which two speeches will be delivered by the Arab National Forum and the Arab Cultural Center, in addition to Father Hanna's speech. On the same day, Father Hanna will also go on a tour in Biqa' to include Zahla and Baalbak.
The Forum also announced that arrival of Arab youths participating in the Twelfth Arab National Youth Camp will start on July 30th and 31st. The Camp will be held in Sayda from the August 1-15.
The national anthem and then an introduction by Abd-Allah Nasser El-Deen were followed by speeches by El-Hermel Municipality Director Ibraheem Shaheen, and MP Muhhamad Baghi, who said, "Balanced development is yet to be achieved. At a time when billions of dollars' worth of loans and grants are flowing for reconstruction, they would mostly stop at the entrances of our area."
"The construction area of this secondary school is approximately 8000 square meters, with a capacity of 1400 pupils. The construction cost is approximately 2 million U.S. dollars, and execution will be completed within 18 months as of the date of work commencement, which we expect within this year after offering the project for bidding."
He added, "No one is answering me as to why the teachers under contract have not been paid yet."
The celebration was ended with setting the secondary school's cornerstone.
The celebration was attended by Educational Center of Research and Development Director Dr. Laila Mileiha Fayyad, North Educational Administration Director Fawzi Nima, Secretary General of Orthodox Schools in Lebanon Shafeek Haydar, former Engineers Association Chairman Atta Jadour, the secondary school's Trustees Council Secretary General Elias Bushaheen, members of the Council, members of the Parents Council, directors of a number of schools, and parents.
"For knowledge to be effective and creative today, it must be accompanied by freedom so that it develops a critical mind that never accepts the easy answers. That only is the creative mind."
In her speech, Dr. Fayyad referred to the curriculum evaluation workshop in the Educational Center, now applied for four years. She said, "These curricula that were published in 1997 formed a pivotal element in the history of educational renewal in Lebanon and achieved a categorical shift. However, the general economic situation in Lebanon prevented the application of the curricula according to the plan that was developed for them. It also partially or fully prevented provision of the supplies necessary for teaching essential procedural subjects such as Information and Technology, Translation and Arabization, and the second foreign language."
The ceremony was attended by MPs Wajeeh Al-Ba'reeni, Muhammad Yahia, and Jamal Ismail, and Al-Hedaya Model Schools Secretary General Sheikh Abd El-Razzak Al-Zubi, who delivered a speech in which he mentioned "a number of activities that Al-Hedaya Schools try to carry out at the educational level, such as inauguration of the Al-Hedaya General Technical Center for next year, holding of the summer club with the Lebanese Canadian Educational Center, holding a qualification course for teachers of the first, second, and third rounds on the teaching methods and approaches according to the new curricula."
Entry of the graduates parade was followed by the national anthem, and then prayers by Priest Ameen Awad. After that, Academic Affairs Vice-President Dr. Nabeel Haydar delivered a speech in which he said, "There are two reasons for the success of the Lebanese American University graduates, the first being the type of qualification provided by the university and the second being the spirituality that drives its graduates."
"Continuous training, in addition to these professors' devotion, is what leads to the production of graduates who benefited from the wisdom of the wise and the experience of the experts."
The ceremony keynote speaker, American University in Greece President Dr. John Paili, then delivered a speech in which he lauded the scientific and cultural standard achieved by the Lebanese American University, emphasizing that it is very important for the university to continue disseminating knowledge to the generations. He said, "All what this university has offered is the result of what many people diligently offered. Many of those were graduates such as yourselves. Give back what you can to it so that the generations after you can enjoy the privileges you enjoyed."
My first poem to be printed in a newspaper was of the colloquial rhyme (zajal) type.
"Well, pay close attention to what I will tell you: every piece we write with our pen is part of our conscience."
Since that time, I try to follow my father's example, always remembering his advice, because things that are beautiful and noble must be given out to everybody, not kept inside chests and hearts.
Antalyas, the fragrance of your breeze
Intoxicated in the arms of the moon
As our love for beauty
The similarity of the two drawings amazed me
And nothing remained to be added to my drawing
Moaning, not for what our fingertips wrote
He was the poet whom money could not humiliate:
Teachers' and professors' associations are organizing a solidarity meeting under the title "In Solidarity with Public Education and Support of Professors' and Teachers' Rights" at eleven o'clock this morning on the premises of the League of Public Secondary Education Teachers, Onesco.
from the Lebanese Baccalaureate Certificate under its four branches in a celebration it held in our schoolyard under the sponsorship of Patriarch Agnatius IV Hazeem on behalf of the Bishop of Tripoli, Kora, and Surroundings, Metropolite Elias Qurban.
Before he arrived, some of the attendees kept saying, "A minister will fly."
Entry of the graduates parade was followed by the national anthem, then prayers by Priest Ameen Awad. After that, Academic Affairs Vice-President Dr. Nabeel Haydar delivered a speech in which he said, "There are two reasons for the success of the Lebanese American University graduates, the first being the type of qualification provided by the university and the second being the spirituality that drives its graduates."
Under the sponsorship of General Religious Representative of Imam Khamini in Lebanon, Hezbollah Secretary General Mr. Hassan Nasr-Allah, represented by his deputy Sheikh Naim Qassin, Hawzit Al-Imam Al-Sadiq organized its first conference on development of Hawza curricula, under the title "Religious Studies in Shiite Institutes, Curricula and Problems" in the Fatima Al-Zahraa compound of Sayda.
Mrs. Lahud awarded the Red Cross medal to Dr. Baseel as a token of gratitude and acknowledgment.
Religious Studies Conference in Shiite Institutes; Qassim: Arms Replaced With Westernization and Ideas Transferred Through Blind Imitation
Sheikh Qassim then talked about religious scholars between the religious and the political. He said: "With the recession of Islamic presence due to arrogant domination, and with the fall of the Ottoman state as the last stronghold of Islamic rule, regardless of the detailed view of that, a general atmosphere of frustration and retardation prevailed. Westernization replaced Islamization, and western ideas moved to our countries through blind imitation that lacks the minimal steps of objective comparison between two disparate fields and two divine messages that differ from one another."
On the second day, the conference resumed its proceedings, where two sessions were held. The first was presided by Senior Scholar Al-Nabulsi, and Mr. Muhammad Al-Farwi lectured in it about the Hawza books and experimentation of alternatives.
Sexual disorders are as common a disease in the Arab world as in Western countries.
The conference lasted three days and was sponsored by Jordanian Minister of Health Falih Al-Nassir and presided by Dr. Mamoun Al-Zabda, Renal, Urinary Tract, and Genital Surgery Consultant and Chairman of the Mediterranean Sexual Disorders Society.
He added that the "Uprima" medication developed by Abbott Labs in Saudi Arabia proved to be effective in treating men's weak erection problems, taking into consideration that this medication stimulates the brain to excrete Dubamin, which affects the central nervous system.
When Herbert von Karajan released the complete orchestrated Beethoven collection, the "New York Times" wrote that if "Beethoven was able to hear his works played in a concert led by von Karajan, he would have loved them more."
What is the value of the singing of a nightingale alone in an arid, secluded place? It has no meaning unless someone is sitting under a tree in the splendor of a meadow, enjoying it.
That is why great poets (such as Ahmed Shawky) asked others to read their poetry for them before large audiences.
Maybe not many poets (who do not have the gift of perfect stage performance) wish that Aziz Khyoun, or another gifted Aziz Khyoun, would interpret their poems.
British driver Colin Makri broke a new world record in a Ford Fox car yesterday, when he won the 50th Kenya Safari, the eighth round of the Rally World Championship. His total now is 25 victories, as opposed to 24 each for Spanish Ford Fox driver Carlos Sayenz and Finnish Subaru Impreza driver Tommy Maccinin, both of whom withdrew on Saturday, as did Finnish Peugeot 206 driver Marcos Grunholm on Friday, although he remained on top of the general driver rankings.

Musharraf rejected Kashmir's elections planned by the New Delhi government, describing Kashmir as "occupied." In contrast, the Indian President confirmed that Kashmir is an "indivisible part of India" and that it is not an international issue.
Musharraf said that the attacks are in the interest of Pakistan's enemies and are carried out by "a minority that has taken the entire country hostage."
"Those criminals and terrorists have strayed, and their leaders have the nerve to believe that their actions will take them to Paradise."
He warned, "Pakistan faces multiple challenges, some of which carry opportunities while others bear invisible dangers."
He rejected the elections that New Delhi intends to hold in Kashmir in July because their aim is to legitimize the "illegitimate occupation," as "the Indian government previously organized similar, corrupt elections and was boycotted by the people of Kashmir."
He added that it is "not an international issue."
Indian police reinforced security measures in New Delhi after receiving "reliable intelligence information" that the "Askar Tayyebah" and "Jeish Muhammad" groups, who are fighting for Kashmir's independence, are preparing attacks on Indian politicians during Independence celebrations.
Pakistani cabinet official Elias Khan announced that the 11 French marine engineers killed in the explosion of a booby-trapped car in Karachi last May were granted the Pakistan Star medal, the country's second most important medal.
When Suarish heard the verdict, which is considered the first in a series of trials for former Indonesian officials on charges of committing crimes against humanity, he brandished his fist and said, "They made me a scapegoat (...) How can a single person like me disband a militia armed with spears, axes, and rifles?"
Activists have repeatedly claimed that Jakarta is incapable of bringing to justice the people who were responsible for the bloodshed in East Timor.
She added, "The letter demonstrates a spirit of reconciliation, which could have been buried in the case of a severe sentence."
The violence ended when Australian-led peacekeeping forces arrived in the country in September 1999.
A spokesman for South Korea's government stated that progress achieved could strengthen the possibilities of dialog between North Korea and the U.S., South Korea's major ally.
South Korean officials admitted that the Northern version of the statement indicates that both parties "recommended" the military talks.
Several plans were accomplished before the deterioration of relations last year, but new initiatives were few.
He added, "The two Koreas agreed to hold military talks as soon as possible. We have also agreed that each party should take military steps to help build the railway that links the two countries."
Red Cross officials will meet in early September to discuss the details and to prepare family lists.
The Northern Korean Central News Agency quoted another similar statement released by the Japanese foreign ministry saying, "Talks will deal with issues related to the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries and other important issues of mutual concern."
Freshman students of the University of North Carolina will discuss a book entitled "Approaching the Koran: Primitive Inspirations" by Michael Sales. However, state legislators and members of conservative political groups are still trying to stop that from happening, fearing that some students would be influenced by the book and would embrace Islam.
Sales explained that the book does not mention verses that criticize Jews and non-Muslims, considering those to be too complicated for an introduction to Islam and could confuse people who know little about this religion and the history of the Middle East.
Islamic affairs professor at the university Karl Ernest proposed discussion of the book in hopes of helping students understand the religion that bewilders many Americans.
On Tuesday the state senate approved a draft budget that allocates less funds for the project unless equal time is dedicated to each religion. This is a symbolic step, because the program does not cost much money, and it is unlikely that the senate will approve the budget in its final form for several weeks.
President Joe Gloffer of the Family Policy Network, which filed the lawsuit against the university, also said, "It is ridiculous that such a number of people adopt Islam and call it the religion of peace (...) It means peace through submission to God and death for any non-Muslim."
It also mentioned that the aircraft crew of two was taken to Bagram airbase north of Kabul, where they received treatment for slight injuries.
He said, "Dr. Khaleel Zadah is holding consultations with President Karzay, senior Afghan officials, and U.N. officials on the situation in Afghanistan and our continuous efforts to assist Afghanistan in its progress toward security and economic reconstruction."
The "Hayat Nu" newspaper reported that Iran offered Afghan officials a rapid plan for reconstructing damaged factories.
Only one newspaper dealt with the strategic aspect of Khatami's visit to a country in which the U.S. administration had installed a government like its own.
"We also do not know who did it."
*In Peshawar, Afghan Consulate spokesman Ahmad Saidi stated that Kabul promised to release an unspecified number of Pakistanis detained since the fall of the Taliban.
New Formula for Co-existence with Palestinian Arms
As to the Lebanese state, it remains beyond "internal disagreements," as stated by Lebanese Minister of Defense when asked about the nature of the armed conflict that took place during the past two days.
And in it the elements of cooling are manifested.
Rather, our objective is to say that the Palestinian situation in Lebanon cannot be based on broad talk that is repeated on all occasions, and which confirms respect for Lebanese laws while reality testifies to the exact opposite.
The Lebanese cannot be asked to submit voluntarily to the state if it wastes its minimal duties and rights.
It is also time for pressure on the Lebanese government and president to devise a new formula for the Palestinian armed presence on the basis of control and restriction to the narrowest possible range.
Former US President Harry Truman could have looked at George Bush slyly and asked him: What are you doing?
When the Iraqi opposition delegation arrived in Washington, they were surprised twice: First when the discovered that the American administration still has an extremely negative view of the scattered aspect of this opposition, and then when the delegation members expressed surprise at "the seriousness of the American administration" with regards to ousting the Iraqi regime. Maybe they were under the impression that Washington is joking or boasting with Baghdad.
Along with Al-Bayati stood representatives of the "Constitutional Royal Movement", "National Accord Movement", Kurdish Democratic Party", "Kurdish National Union", and "Iraqi National Conference".
Even the "Washington Post" did not hesitate to raise what seems to be ridicule last Saturday when it said that the delegation members "want to appear as a united front, and this was demonstrated for only five minutes after the meeting."
But even Riva Levenson, manager of the PR bureau (Borson Marstler) that provides its services to the "Iraqi National Conference" wondered: "How many are there"?
Rajih Al-Khuri
His view was that the USA is preparing for the operation, and is still determined to make it a harsh operation in spite of international protest.
At the Palestinian level, "Ha'arts" commentator Zaif Shif expressed concern with the current internal Palestinian debate with regards to stopping suicidal operations and declaring a unilateral cease-fire.
With that they mean citizens within the borders of the green line.
And if he does not want that, they will not be held.
It also does not seem that the economic-social situation, which is the basic factor of his decline, will change in the months to come.
The writer adds, "Sharon is using elections as a threat- only a threat to intimidate, because he knows that some will be intimidated."
"Therefore, it is most likely that Sharon will calm down and sit with them both and with the minister of finance to reach agreements allowing the Labor and Shas parties to vote for the budget in the first reading - and maintain the safety of the coalition until it is time for the next crisis."
As much as the Ein El-Helwa Camp incidents as broadcast by Arab and foreign satellite television stations, and the exchange of fire between disputing parties in it, seemed damaging to Lebanon's image abroad during the peak of its publicity campaign for tourism and investment, there was also justification strongly emphasized in these pictures for Lebanon to finalize the abnormal situation in the camp, as well the impossibility of leaving it without remedy.
The final question stems from the essence of assertions made by security officials that the negotiations which led to the handing in of the accused Badee' Hamada to the Lebanese state early this August were under direct support from Syria, and had it not been for the pressure Damascus exercised in the camp that had direct effect on them, things would never have turned out the way they did.
Rather, what is happening basically in the camps today, according to these sources, can be considered a local card in the full sense of the word.
The state now fears, despite its well-known intelligence infiltration in the camp, that the camps in their current state may form a trigger for a situation similar to the one before and during the war, which is totally refused.
The interest of Lebanon and Syria joins the interest of the Unites States in putting a limit to the growth of radical Islamic fundamentalism, which poses a threat to internal situations in Lebanon and Syria much more than it poses to America. Threats in the camp have reached the extent that the Lebanese state may no longer remain a spectator without abandoning its usual policy towards Palestinian camps.
Today, the parliament summer leave also starts, and will last for a full month to September 15th.
By approving the electricity privatization law, the parliament has approved in a matter of few months the third law for privatization of the sectors listed for this schedule, following the mobile phone and telecommunication laws.
The parliament also approved a proposed law to prevent the use of 24-passenger diesel-powered vans as of 31/10/2003, giving their owners additional incentives, including exemption from importation charges and increased financial compensation depending on the car model.
The appointments included Fadi Samaha as Ministry of Industry General Manager, Fadi Makki as Ministry of Economy and Commerce General Manager, Ali Fakeeh as Research and Guidance Department General Manager at Central Inspection, Waleed Safi as South Council Financial Controller, Fadia Budagher as Dental Medicine College Dean, Eli Assaf as Public Administration Institute Chairman, and Antoine Massara, Hashim El-Husseini, Bassem Tarbah, Abbass Halabi, and Robert Fadil as members.
Lahud added: "The cabinet previously approved a re-draft of the appointment mechanism law, taking the Constitutional Council's remarks into consideration, and assigned the task of drafting the amendment to Minister Baheej Tayyarah.
"Al-Nahar" learned that the president was informed by the prime minister of his remarks on a diplomatic formation proposal that includes 20 ambassadors and was proposed by Foreign Minister Mahmoud Hammoud to Al-Haritit two days ago.
If nothing obstructs the proposed formation, it will most probably be approved in the first ordinary cabinet session after the budget approval session.
In another precautionary measure, Israel's Ministry of Defense announced that it will distribute to all Israelis tablet medications that give limited protection from effects of radiation.
He said that, on the contrary, in doing so Germany adopts a full partner position in a right that it acquired through its participation in the NATO strikes on Yugoslavia in the spring of 1999, which was the first external military intervention for Germany since World War II, and also through supporting the USA in the war against terrorism.
In Amman ("Al-Nahar"), Russian Ambassador to Jordan Alexander Shein reiterated his country's refusal of American plans that aim at striking against Iraq, expressing lack of conviction with the seriousness of "speculations about the inevitability of striking against that country despite the escalated American threatening tone, and that the international community does not accept the use of force as a solution to the Iraqi problem."
He told the "Al-Jazeerah" satellite channel of Qatar that the statements attributed to him by American television network CNN in this regard are "inaccurate."
He added, "The stance of the Kurdish National Union, as part of the Iraqi opposition, is clear. The mission of change is an Iraqi mission assumed by Iraqi opposition forces for a complete democratic change (...) However, these forces would not mind receiving international assistance, including America, to accomplish this mission."
Yesterday, on the eve of the start of the second round of talks between the Sudanese government and the "Sudan People's Liberation Movement" in Kenya, Egypt managed to draw parties concerned with the peace process in Sudan, in which they signed the Machacus agreement protocol that grants the south autonomy for six years followed by a self-determination referendum. This raised concerns in Cairo regarding potential separation of south Sudan from the largest African country.
He added,"The US position is that normal relations (with Sudan) are dependent upon peace and upon cooperation in the area of combating terrorism and the free movement of humanity (organizations) in combat zones."
These peace talks are being held under the sponsorship of the Governmental Agency for Development and Combating Drought and Desertification in East Africa and the African Horn "EGAD", and mediated by the USA, the UK, Norway, and Italy.
He also welcomed Ottawa's appointment of Senator Mobina Jaffer, a special Canadian envoy to Sudan.
He said: "We have objectives in common with Egypt in connection to unity... I appeal to Egypt to do what it can to guarantee the unity of Sudan in this agreement."

Iran Islamic Republic's Guide Ayatollah Ali Khameini accused the USA of endeavoring to impose its hegemony on the world, comparing the language used by US President George Bush with that of Adolph Hitler.
He added: "Iran does not wish to engage in war."
Iranian television described US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's accusations that Iran is harboring individuals from Al-Qaeda as being "illogical."
Rumsfeld had said on Tuesday: "With regard to terrorists (...) they definitely (the Iranians) will not extradite anyone to us."
He also accused the Iranian regime of producing and storing amounts of chemical and germ substances as part of an "alarming WMD program."
First: Minister Franjiya gave the audience the impression that MP Naila Muawwad belonged to his political line then left it in order to damage him, and that she turned against Al-Taif, which brought Muawwad Rene forth as president.
Does he know that the four fundamentals represent an indivisible whole, which means that disturbing any of them is considered a grave diversion that endangers Al-Taif settlement?
Did he read the Al-Taif document well enough?
Second: Minister Franjiya repetitively suggested that those who demand sovereignty want to replace Syrian power with American power.
The struggle in Lebanon is not, as Minister Franjiya and other interested beneficiaries want to picture it, between an Arab line and a "Zionized" American line, but between a corrupt, suppressive, and exploitive authority that takes Arabism as a disguise and a sovereignty, reform, and salvation opposition that believes in true Arabism.
So how can Minister Franjiya allow himself to picture the Syrian presence in Lebanon as protecting one sect from the other?
For the second day, official, political party, media, and social figures headed for the Editors Association building in Al-Ashrafiyyah to congratulate Association Chairman Milham Karam and the members of the Association Council for winning the recent elections unanimously.

On Assumption Day, Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Boutros Sfair, Patriarch of the Maronite Church, headed yesterday a celebratory Mass at the bishopric's monumental seat church in Kanouin, as is traditional every year. He was assisted by Reverend Francis Al-Bissary, Monsieur Fouad Barbour, and Al-Khoury Habib Saab.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by chants. The nuns greeted him standing at the church's door, where he headed a Mass during which he preached about the meaning of the celebration of Assumption Day, the annual visit tradition, "and how it indicates a necessary return to spiritual roots to face the crisis of this era and its different problems."
After the Mass, chief mother thanked the Patriarch for his visit. After returning to Al-Diman, Patriarch Sfeir headed the monthly meeting of his general deputies Reverend Francis Al-Bissary, Reverend Guy Boulos Najeem, and Reverend Samir Mazloum. He discussed issues related to the church, congregation, and national matters.

Participants of the Al-Taif Conference and members of the media were invited.
The Council had held a meeting two days ago, headed by Director Abd al-Munim al-Arees, and issued a statement saying it discussed "the increasing problems caused by motorbikes, such as traffic violations and serious accidents. In addition, such motorbikes are used for robberies."
The Council also approved the municipality's 2001 financial statement; a cash advance to purchase and maintain electrical appliances for the municipal playground; construction of a metal fence for playgrounds in the Beirut Forest; a cash advance to buy rat control materials; and an offer to kill and transfer street dogs.
He welcomed all attendees, assuring them that "Hamana welcomes His Excellency the Minister, who has purchased a house in the town." He expressed hopes that other Kuwaiti officials would do so, as well.

Municipality Director Mustafa Najm explained, "The road is approximately six kilometers in length, and its width varies between five and six meters. The works performed on it included construction of retention walls on its sides and water draining channels."
This expression, which matches to some extent the situation in the camp yesterday, does not fully match the difficult and complicated living standards inside the camp for the past ten years, specifically since the Oslo agreement. It also does not match the consequences of the events that took place two days ago between members of the al-Daniya Group, its Islamic affiliated militias from inside and outside the camp, and members of the Fatah movement, the backbone of PLO factions that are directly affiliated with President Yasir Arafat of the Palestinian Authority.
There is a tendency not to use force to resolve the issue of al-Daniya members, while emphasizing that "everyone must bear their responsibilities in finding a suitable solution for this problem."
Only media people and photographers were wandering in the camp in search of an interview with an official, but efforts to do so failed. Some meetings were held, the most important of which was the Fatah and PLO Military Committee meeting. It was held under media blackout. Reporters knew about it by chance.
At six o'clock, a verbal clash took place between a member of Fatah and an Usba member, and the latter started firing in the lower street near the emergency area. Armed men from both sides interfered.

He added, "Beirut has sacrificed itself for the sake of the Arab nation when it stood up against the Israeli enemy in 1982, challenging its might, its American weapons, and the will of invasion with all its strength. Beirut was burned down but never raised a white flag."
Why should the average citizen remain prey to bureaucracy in most governmental agencies and nearly have his head explode before receiving his rights?
"Another day of fires and more vigorous efforts by those heroes who are in charge of fire-extinguishing in all Lebanese lands."
"Third: Purchase one or more aircraft to extinguish difficult fires by modern methods. This can be done through donations by Lebanese, inside and outside Lebanon. This will not be impossible, because preserving Lebanon's beauty, greenery, and environment means a lot to the Lebanese people, especially the immigrant Lebanese."
Basaleem Municipality asserted that it cares a lot for environmental safety and for relieving the complainants of their worries by inspecting the pen and requiring its owners to comply with legal and health regulations.
From a citizen:
A Beirut Water official said that the cost of installing the water meter is paid only once, and that it was determined with approval of the ministers of finance and energy and water. The subscription fee is paid annually at a rate of 225,000 liras, at a monthly rate of 15,000 liras. It has to be noted that there is a big difference between the electricity bill and the water subscription fee.
But it is easy to realize that in the long run, extreme Islamism does not form a realistic alternative as a ruling ideology for the world communities.

It assured that it will not accept anything less than "direct penalties that must be enforced on violating organizations."
With regard to the privatization issue, the Union emphasized that it is totally against it "because its major target is the laborers, and the target has always been to guarantee permanent jobs in order to protect the working class from any social problems that may weaken it."

Is it required of the Lebanese media to change its face, so that it becomes more harmonious with its environment, developing the habit of meeting injustice with silence, ignoring disasters, giving cold shoulders to suppression, forgetting liberties, forsaking sovereignty, cheering economic collapse, and promoting arbitrary decisions even if they are wrong?
That day, the President promised to ensure freedom of the press.

Brigadier General Kim Kyong-Duk headed the South Korean delegation, while Brigadier General Yu Yung-Chol headed the North Korean one.

Israel generally avoided talking too much about the issue of Iraq, leaving it to its powerful ally, the United States, which argues that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is developing or is trying to obtain weapons of mass destruction (WMD).
Later, Perez informed reporters at the White House that Israel is committed to the U.S.-led war against terrorism, warning that the Middle East will be "either peaceful or nuclear" within five to ten years.
China and Russia are permanent Security Council members and enjoy the right of veto, which makes their support essential for adopting any "extreme resolution" wanted by the U.S. against Iraq.
At his end, Tang supported a "political solution for the Iraqi issue," emphasizing the "important role" that the U.N. can assume to call on Iraq to implement the international organization's decisions with "accuracy and goodwill."
Al-Sabah welcomed the dialog between the U.N. and Iraq regarding disarmament.
Now that U.S. President George Bush has delivered his speech before the U.N. General Assembly, the U.S. has caused another rift among the Arab effort to reject the war on Iraq.
In that regard, French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin's clarifications of the French position is a sign that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein must read very carefully.
This is because the Egyptian President knows better than anyone else that the U.S. is "going to Baghdad" with an international decision or without.
Hence, we would like to ask the Iraqi brothers to make, at least for once, a decision with a higher content of cautious and foresighted policy than that of the abyss edge policy, if not the abyss policy itself.
3- Giving Iraq two to four weeks for implementation.
An authorized Arab diplomat in Paris told me that he heard from several Western diplomatic circles in Paris of negotiations currently underway regarding the Iraqi President's destiny.
But what is more important is that all indicators suggest that America is "going to Baghdad," and that Iraq might still be in possession of one last card it could throw in the face of American "warlords": accepting the return of inspectors.
This is expressed in the approach that the authority has started to take in handling the problem, first, by isolating the station-closing incident from its chronic political disagreement with the opposition. Second, it is emphasizing that it does not consider the Qirnat Shahwan Meeting to be a target within the confrontation except to the extent of cohesion between the Meeting and the station and its defense thereof as a political problem that is greater than the magnitude of the legal violation problem into which MTV fell and is now in the hands of the judiciary.
At the end, the court will have its say with no intervention from the President or any other official.
On the other hand, Lahud was not confused as much as he reinforced his authority when Marunite Bishop Mar Nasrallah Boutros Safeer emphasized that he still believes in continuing dialog with the President.
Accordingly, discontinuing the dialog with the President, regardless of its reasons and motives, will lead to closing all open issues at once, leaving the country in the predicament of confrontation between authority and opposition.
While the Festival aimed primarily at exceeding the essence of the occasion toward organizing a well-planned campaign against the opposition, it also reflected the state's ability to present major evidence, which is its control over the street through all these forces it mustered, as much as it controls by military and security means.
However, the President's desire to separate public opinion and the opposition also indicates his concern with promoting political dialog with all opponents, including the Qirnat Shahwan Meeting as long as this does not affect public opinion, according to same sources.
Why 38 years?
Since then, a systematic process of stealing al-Litani water has been continuing.
In the light of a number of American messages to the Israeli government, it seems that Sharon has stopped threatening. His sources informed the "Ma'arif" newspaper two days ago that he did not say the phrase "reason for war."
Can we assume that Lebanon has conclusively won the battle of getting part of its water rights, and the chapter of Israeli threats has ended?
To Sharon, striking Iraq is a "lifetime chance" in order to achieve his colonial and aggressive plans. His plans obviously include Lebanon and Palestine.
Two research teams at the Royal University of London and Hammersmith Hospital believe it will be possible in the future to develop medications limiting the effects of Ghrelin as a treatment for obesity and to help prevent the development of type 2 diabetes. Those two diseases have come to be most prevalent in urban regions in the developing world and the advanced world alike, and they have made obvious the pressing need for new medications.
An English-American team recently discovered how the Leptin hormone, which is made in fat-storing cells, can control weight.
Today, easy access to unhealthy foods, in addition to the life of laziness we live, have overloaded the control mechanisms in our bodies, which have not become accustomed to the modern way of life. It is merely beyond the capacity of our ability.
Dr. Rain asked volunteers to fast for a certain period of time before he offered them a regular meal containing a specific number of calories.
It is quite obvious that a medication that might reduce the substantial effects of Ghrelin will have an enormous impact on obesity and probably on type 2 diabetes.
Because it is possible to synthesize quite easily the Ghrelin molecule, which is relatively small in size, it will be tested soon as an appetite stimulator for people who need it badly.
Finally, it might be possible to provide normal quantities of food and mechanisms for weight control. Currently, those are mostly inaccurate, particularly since new medications depend on discovering the roles of Ghrelin and Leptin. Accordingly, it will be possible to control the contemporary growth of the two diseases of obesity and type 2 diabetes.
French President Jacques Chirac reconfirmed yesterday his participation in the Beirut Froncophonic Summit next month.
U.S. units, assisted by Pakistani forces, detained last Wednesday in Karachi two members of the al-Qaeda fundamentalist organization. One of them is the Yemeni citizen Ramzi ibn al-Shaiba, a coordinator of the September 11 attacks against New York and Washington and who was supposed to be the twentieth hijacker of the four planes, two which hit the two World Trade Center towers, the third which hit the Pentagon building, and the fourth which crashed in Pennsylvania. However, he was unable to enter U.S. territory because he did not obtain an entry visa.
Sha'ath said that the conversation lasted for seven minutes, and Bush reiterated his support for an economically viable Palestinian state.
The two newspapers added that three armed Islamists were also killed in the Batenah attack.
Since September 1, more than 70 people have been killed in acts of violence in Algeria.
He expressed his belief that "Jamal Mubarak will be elected head of a new committee called the Policy Committee. It will enjoy wide authority to develop the party, draft general policies, and prepare legislative bills before referring them to the government."
"As to the secretary general and assistants, they used to be appointed."
But his view is that "something new is happening inside the party," noting that "the evidence which proves that is the massive attention that the conference preparations have attracted for the first time."
Abd al-Majeed said, "In the absence of political reform, there will be no hope of renewal but rather a balance of power between the old guard and the fresh bloods, whose ideas form a different political environment because they act as though they come from states that enjoy modern election laws and party programs governing voting processes."
Al-Wafd Opposition Party Assistant Secretary General Ibraheem Desouki Abadha's view is, "Experience has proven that any party that wants to stay alive must derive its power from the people, not from the government or the head of the state. Parties that are born on top of a ruling palace must end with absolute failure."

This is the first time Patriarch Sfeir has celebrated this Mass in al-Diman. He was assisted by Reverend Roland Abou Gouda Shoukralla Harp, Francis al-Bissary, the patriarchal vicar in al-Diman Monsieur Fouad Barbour and Deacon Khalil Arb.
"And he said, 'He who cannot bear the Cross and follow me cannot be my disciple,'"
"If we are witnessing here young boys and girls becoming interested in ministerial life and priesthood, and believers frequenting churches and places of worship more and more, and many among them rushing to get the blessing from Mother Teresa's relics while she is visiting Lebanon these days and asking for her intercession for blessings, it is because the wars that have made us suffer and our martyrs who have died earned us the blessing of our solid faith and trust in God, despite the difficulties and hardships that we face."
"A true Christian believer endorses both the Cross with Christ."
Fransinc on Second Quarter: Budget Deficit Reduces to 38.4%
Part of the statement read:
The debt service has increased during those two periods, reaching USD 858 million in the second quarter after being 640 million in the first quarter. It also totaled one billion and 498 million in the first quarter of the current year compared to one billion and 336 million in the same period of the past year.
External indebtedness totaled an approximate value of USD 11 billion by the end of June 2002, at an increase of 400 million dollars quarterly and USD 2.9 billion annually.
Inaugurated a Dispensary and Sponsored a Tourism Survey; Hamada: Reinforcing Our Internal Unity; Tourism Survey Announced
After a welcome by the ceremony presenter Manal Ewidat, speeches were delivered by Mustafa al-Hallaq, Salam Saad on behalf of the Municipality of Berja, and Abd Elhassan Qassim, chairman of the National Social Organization, who supervises the dispensary.
In addition, Hamada sponsored the announcement of results of the tourism and environmental survey for villages of al-Shouf al-A'la area in a celebration held by the Ministry of Immigration, the U.N. program supporting return of immigrants, and the College of Tourism
Hamada then spoke: "Reinforcing the status quo of areas to which immigrants will return is a fundamental prerequisite of any plan to make that return successful." He emphasized the need to "consider the issues of tourism and environment as a common and interactive element of tourist attraction and as a source of job opportunities for the people of the area, as well as a link and effective developmental means of communication between municipalities and organizations, whether governmental or non-governmental."
"This is particularly true in view of our desire to provide elements of economic, social, and livelihood stability for every remaining resident and every returning immigrant."
On this occasion, a mass will be held in the Mar Antonios church of al-Fawwara in the presence of a representative of Cardinal Patriarch Mar Nasralla Boutros Safeer and Sayda Marunite Parish Patron Bishop Tanius al-Khuri. Representatives of the President, Chairman of the Parliament, the Prime Minister, ministers, Social Progressive Party Leader Waleed Junbulat, MPs, and spiritual and contemporary figures will also attend the event.
The town of al-Fawwara is surrounded by Barieh to the east and Wadi al-Sitt to the west.
The Municipality Director considers that one of the most significant achievements after the war is the rebuilding of Mar Antonios Church, which is constructed on approximately 4200 square meters in its new location. It is now considered one of the biggest and most beautiful churches in the area. Beautiful Maronite-styled architecture distinguishes the building from its surroundings. The church contains two large halls, the priest's two-story house, and a large yard of more than 2500 meters for festivals.
Cardinal George will begin his rally today from the Maronite Diocese, visiting the Mukhtara Palace before reaching al-Fawwara, where a morning meeting will be held with Cardinal George, Patriarch Khuri, and a number of figures. Al-Fawwara Municipality Director Yusif Elia and members of the municipal council will also attend the meeting.
Al-Fawwara earned its name because of its abundant water and many springs. Some people say that the name originally means "grape mill" in the Armenian language. It is 50 kilometers from Beirut. Approximately 1200 people inhabit the town and belong to the families of Elia, Tanius, Abi-Habeeb, Toma, Ra's, Mansour, Najjar, Eid, Shukr-Allah, Bishara, Fadl-Allah, Kamil, and Yusif.

The workshop was also attended by 39 people representing 20 municipalities in Western Biqa.
"television station, for which the Union expressed a supportive position."
The Guidance Administration of the Army Command released the following statement, "The Army Command informs citizens that army units in conjunction with Syrian naval units will hold joint drills on the Silata-Shaka shore from 9/15/2002 to 9/17/2002."
The board staff and consulting committee positions will be assigned at a later time.
The official National Media Agency reported that six members of the municipal council in Bajja held a meeting in Jubeil District President Khaleel Nasr al-Deen's office and withdrew confidence from current Municipality Director Saeed Abi-Akl, who did not attend the meeting. The six members unanimously elected Muawwad al-Khuri as the new director.
He inaugurated yesterday the Modern Management seminar organized by the Minister of State for Administrative Development Affairs in cooperation with the Civil Service Council. The seminar was held in the Royal Park hotel in Ein Sa'ada. It was directed toward senior first- and second-class administrators. It was funded by a European Union program dedicated to supporting the process of qualifying Lebanese management groups.
He also said, "It is true that changing needs is a life situation. However, our era has witnessed rapid changes that people have never imagined, and has forced people to develop new skills in order to cope with the new era, according to Toffler's hypothesis in his book 'Future Shock.' The most important skills needed are creative leadership skills to bridle and manage such changes to people's benefit."
Al- Saad added, "It is a new and continuously changing administrative environment in which economic, social, political, and technological factors and effects interlace to govern the performance and growth of societies and apply to all sectors of those societies, including the private, public, and popular sectors." (...)
"A plan to improve performance in the following ministries and organizations: finance, environment, customs, the National Employment Organization, Beirut Water Authority..."
He also said, "You are required to build the administration of the future. Those who refuse to change will go with the wind."
Lebanon's Memo to Annan; Mahmoud Hammoud
"Lebanon is keen on clarifying this issue."
"The quantity of water that Lebanon uses since the liberation is approximately 7 million cubic meters annually. This is an extremely inadequate quantity and does not meet the normal needs of the area's inhabitants, according to international laws and customs and the provisions of the Agreement on Utilization of International Waterways for Non-Navigational Purposes, which gave Lebanon the right to secure the social and economic needs of the inhabitants of the al-Hasibani and al-Wazzani River valleys."
"The statements of Israeli officials to launch war against Lebanon threaten international peace and security. The aftermath of this situation will be the responsibility of Israel, who never stops pushing the situation toward increasing tension, ignoring Lebanon's determined wish to maintain peace, calm, and stability, while continuously demanding the liberation of the rest of its occupied lands."
"Al-Diyar" Resumes Publication on Tuesday; Al-Ereidi Expresses Hope in Government's Attempts: TV Stations Paid 60% of the Charges
"I used all the time given in order to submit a comprehensive and detailed report."
"For that, we asked every organization to send us a letter containing their remarks. It appeared from the figures set by the National Media Council for the charges that there were some errors."
"On the other hand, some of them have different circumstances."
Yesterday, the relics of St. Teresa Jesus the Child entered the North from the coast that opened the gates, passing by Maniea and Tripoli, to arrive at Kobayat, which was waiting anxiously for the caravan; a public reception took place at the town plaza. The Caravan then advanced to Mar Doumit Monastery for Carmelite Fathers, which shall host the mortal remains until next Thursday.
He said: "As I know, Al-Karmel monastery is one of the fortified Carmelite monasteries, where the person who enters can never go out, and meeting others or outsiders is done behind the speaker bars."
He added: "If we want to give meaning to the anniversary of the Cross, we would find that it lies in the profound love of Christ for human beings, and that is what the great St. Teresa Jesus the Child has told when she found that the real meaning of her life lies in love and true love, sincere, away from all exaggeration, and that there is a simple way to sainthood, which is great love, when she said: 'My call is love, and in the heart of my mother the church, I will be love.'"
"And you are invited to scream to the rest of the youth: man is loved by God."

"should be postponed."
"If all newspapers close down, it will be a very valuable present to the rulers to mix up the case and pass their requirements."
"Whenever we talk about dialog, they try to shoot it down and make some believe that there are battles to win ground and points."
He noted, "Due to concerns that the MTV issue might be blurred,"
Now that it has become imperative for hundreds of administrative officials to prove the integrity of their financial books, we can start expecting more sound accounts in the future.
"While the revenues of our transmission section are declining, we have exerted all possible efforts to reap every dollar we can from transmission hours that the mother company stole from the public."
"At the television level, we managed to flood the market with more ridiculous ancient programs."
"We have reduced the number of producers and researchers, as well as those who still yearn to practice true journalism."
"we guarantee them the freedom of choice"
"In this context, we are wondering if we can convince some stars to assume temporary surnames when we are about to launch a new movie. You cannot imagine how large a profit we can make if we manage to make a deal with Julia 'Marlboro' Roberts, for example!"
"On the Internet, we endeavored to compensate partially for the low revenues by filling people's screens with surprise commercials and other abominable pictures."
"It would be better to improve the commercial budget for Tom Clancy's next book (or whoever he hires to write 'his new book' for him) than placing any bets on valuable literary books written by totally obscure authors."
"As we proceed toward a new and daring world of media, we are confident that the best awaits tomorrow."
"Fortunately for us, the 'Federal Collusion Gang' answers all our requests positively nowadays."
Moreover, these "emergencies" often result from continuous deterioration in social and economic situations, as well as general irresponsibility and lack of discipline (what we usually call the human factor).

Fifty Years After Dividing Palestine (1947-1997)
In fact, one might need a fly's brain or less to deny that some people in the West deliberately distort the image of Arabs and Muslims.
The draft, which stipulates payment of 3 billion and 450 million Deutsche Marks- worth of manufactured products to Israel, was initialed in The Hague today.
The Front also considers that the act of dismissing the prime minister then appointing ministers without the head of state making any consultations and without the ministers themselves knowing, followed by the announcement that this government is only a transitory one that will rule temporarily in isolation from the Parliament, whose agenda might be altered as long as this government exists, is a constitutional transgression and a violation of parliamentary traditions by the President, as well as a reduction of the powers of the legislative authority, which exclusively represents the people's sovereignty.
In fact, one might need a fly's brain or less to deny that some people in the West deliberately distort the image of Arabs and Muslims.
But this is not indicated in their numerous articles, which are loaded with suggestions to boycott the world that "only bears enmity for us."
According to the importance of the two events, we present them successively, starting with the encounter or confrontation between Matisse (1869-1954) and Picasso (1881-1973), as the gallery includes about 160 works of art from both of them.
His portrait "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon" (1907) marks his start of cubism, which he developed with the close participation of Braque.
In 1937, he painted "Guernica" after the destruction of the small village in Basque by German air force bombardment during the Spanish civil war.
Throughout the twentieth century, he left his mark in the arts.
His interests focused on neo-impressionism, and that is clear in his portrait "Luxury, Tranquility and Delight" (1904), where his colors became brighter.
He searched for a way to express space, as in his portrait "Lesson in Music" (1916).
It is worth mentioning that a museum named after him was inaugurated in his hometown Le Cateau and another in Cimiez.

He prepared the morning coffee for himself and his wife, leaving on her skin a "look of life" that was a bit overdue.
She closed her book quickly with fear.
She saw the girl returning to her bed.
He was late.
Their little girl was running like a rabbit whose mother has not taught it yet how to jump and leap.
We went away from him.
She ran to him, and he put in her palm a fig: "It is for your mom."
They continued; and he walked behind them, his steps burdened with the past and future consequences. Three of his sons intend to travel abroad.
They went away.
He spent the night and the day.
"Search for me in the game of life and across time."
She left her grief to be treated by songs of a long trip.
Three U.S. military bases were attacked with missiles in east Afghanistan last weekend. The U.N. moved its planes from the capital Kabul to U.S. military command headquarters at Bagram air base due to security threats. The move took place on the same day the Afghan authorities had reopened the airport for air traffic after closing it last Saturday for security reasons.
Although Azhar was defeated in the elections, his party won 77 out of 272 seats in the National Assembly.
After the army of Cote d'Ivoire had failed to recapture the city of Bouake last week and after the fall of the "Cocoa Capital" Daloa to the rebels, they (the rebels) are now taking control politically and militarily and have stopped negotiations aimed at reaching a cease fire. Moreover, they are repeating their demands for President Laurent Gbagbo to resign his post, and they have threatened to seize the commercial capital, Abidjan.
Yesterday morning, inhabitants mentioned intensive exchange of gunfire in the southern outskirts of Daloa city. One of them mentioned heavy artillery battles in the south, as well as the continuous sound of gunfire.

Israeli Minister of Defense Benjamin Ben-Eliezir warned yesterday that a large-scale operation in the Gaza Strip could turn into a "hell."
Washington had accused Kuchma in late September of personally approving the sale of four "Kolchuga" radar units to Iraq for a hundred million dollars, violating U.N.-imposed sanctions on Iraq.
Minister of Information Muhammad Affash recently stated that Arab army units will participate in the exercises, including units from Jordan and United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.).
London Suspends Parliament and Government Functions In Northern Ireland; for the Fourth Time
He announced the appointment of two British Labor Party MPs in his cabinet, Angela Smith and Ian Pearson, to assume responsibility for the Northern Ireland bodies formed according to the peace pact.
British and Irish Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern said they were "extremely affected" by this step. However, they confirmed in a joint statement that the decision protected the coalition government from inevitable collapse.
It is noteworthy that there are four people, among whom is a senior assistant to one of the Sinn Fein MPs, behind bars waiting to be tried on charges of espionage and stealing files from Reed's office. The files are said to have contained details of potential I.R.A. targets, as well as recordings of conversations between the British and Northern Ireland parties.
The rebels told the International Radio of France that they achieved a massive victory by seizing Daloa, which is known for cultivating cocoa. All cocoa shipments to Abidjan have to pass through Daloa to be prepared for export. They also confirmed that they are now in a position allowing them to march toward Abidjan.
The tension affected international cocoa prices. The price per ton for next March delivery went up to 2340 Euros. That is the highest rate in 22 years.
He repeated demands for Gbagbo's unconditional resignation.
He revealed that he had warned France of the growing influence of the Burkina Faso government on some Cote d'Ivoire soldiers, but his warnings were not taken seriously at that time.
Moussa: Not a Single Arab Soldier will Participate in an American Military Action Against Iraq; Kuwait, Syria, and Egypt
He explained, "Arab diplomacy and the Arab League played a decisive role in Iraq's acceptance of the return of international inspectors," believing that "this is considered an achievement and a huge contribution that has led to many consequences so far."
Doha had previously announced that it will take into consideration an American request to use al-Udaid military air base, where 2000 U.S. soldiers are currently stationed, and more reinforcements are expected.
It added that the expected war in Iraq "is a war for oil and cheap energy supplies. The Americans are keen to establish a foothold in Iraq, which possesses the largest oil reserve in the world."
About one thousand students of Islamic tendency demonstrated inside the Ain Shams University campus in protest against the American policy toward Iraq.
Yemeni Foreign Minister Abu-Bakr al-Qurbi said, "This summit was dedicated to supporting regional security, particularly the tension that looms over the relations of the three states with Eritrea. (...) However, this summit is not intended to be against Eritrea, rather it is aimed at easing tensions and reinforcing the region's security and stability."
Al-Basheer and Zeinawi will head today to Kenya to participate in a conference on Somali reconciliation under the sponsorship of EIGAD, which includes Sudan, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and Uganda.
A regional observer, who spoke under condition of anonymity, expressed his view that there are three promising factors that were not present before: "First, Kenya is assuming a neutral position regarding Somalia," in reference to Djibouti's support for one of the factions and Ethiopia's support for the Somali Council for Reconciliation and Construction.
Sudan Liberation People's Army spokesman Samson Kuaji stated, "The signing was delayed due to the background of the truce's wording."

We are not dealing in illusions here. The Francophone summit will not succeed in what the U.N., the Security Council, and nearly all the countries of the world have failed to do, which is rationalize the American impulsiveness to establish the empire of military and economic power, which at the end will be equivalent to the "Empire of Absolute Evil."
Even if the summit does not utter a single political word, its convention under the political line being drawn by Paris in the international relations board, particularly within the framework of legitimacy as represented by the U.N., represents a political attestation for the age and how it should be.
The summit is also being held at an extremely crucial spot of the regional geographical domain that is represented as "terrorism" combating the military operations field in American statements and plans.
Israeli press highlighted yesterday Ariel Sharon's expected visit to Washington and talks he is to hold with U.S. President George Bush.
Bush will show a U.S. understanding "of the internal Israeli public opinion pressures, but he will explain to Sharon the importance of Israeli self-control."
"In return, Sharon is demanding a formula that would approve Israeli self-defense if attacked and give it the freedom to act."
However, it has been clear for a month that there is a failure in preparations for the Paris 2 conference, which was due to be held last year. Al-Hariri is dedicating a lot of his time and effort to prepare the proper atmosphere for holding the conference during the current year.
The Lebanese prime minister has been performing his role on the same front.
He also visited a number of economically influential countries to convince them to respond to Lebanese needs.
It seems from the communications and meetings he conducted recently that his success in making Paris 2 an occasion to announce the results hoped from it might not be too far away.
The first obstacle is the United States waging a war against President Saddam Hussein's Iraq before the end of the current year.
All of them agree that it is impossible for U.S. President George Bush to start the war against Iraq before the Congressional elections early next November are finished, in order to avoid being accused by his people of utilizing it to the benefit of his Republican party.
This must be respected to avoid provoking Muslims, who are already provoked because of the Palestinian issue, and because of what Muslims consider to be an American war against them, regardless whether they are right or not.
And also because Syria, the most influential country in Lebanon, sees no alternative to al-Hariri at the moment and considers that his leaving office and the ensuing economic crisis will cause extensive damage and that it might be targeted by them.
A Shrill Francophone Voice
However, the summit will remain in the dictionary of international politics a unique occasion for the voice of reason against madness. It is also the summit of logic against rashness, the summit of adherence to international laws against the one magnet world, and the summit preserving the values of justice, participation, and responsibility at the edge of exclusivity that imposes upon all others the principle of voluntary or involuntary affiliation with the "Empire."
To elaborate further, the summit is being held at the crossroads of a new American strategy that does not only attempt to sketch a new world, but also very nearly to announce that it wants that world annexed to it as an obedient ally, a subdued enemy, or a mercenary carrying out orders.
That is the slogan that opens the door to the establishment of the "American Empire."
Undoubtedly, the Francophone states group's voice will rise from Beirut in parallel with the Arab States group's voice to call for giving international legitimacy, through the inspection team, the right to handle the issue of Iraqi arms, and for urging a return to negotiations to find a solution for the Palestinian issue in such a way as to stop Ariel Sharon's continuous investment of America beating on the drums of war against "terrorism" to the benefit of the open massacre he is carrying out against the Palestinians... and against the American interests in the region!
The five-page statement dated October 12 did not include direct claim of responsibility for the two attacks that it said had come with the start of American strikes against Afghanistan. It represents a clear "and strong message to all enemies and friends alike that the mujahideen have not been discouraged, weakened, or subdued, because of what they have suffered for the sake of Allah (GOD)."
It mentioned, "The political bureau [of al-Qaeda] will issue two separate statements for the two operations and their indications."
It also noted that "U.S. invading forces in Afghanistan are now starting to sink in the Afghani marsh... and that the consequences of the American occupation of Afghanistan will not be any better than those faced by the Soviet occupation."
Gunshots targeted the U.S. forces in Kuwait yesterday. It was the second armed attack of its kind within a week in the Emirate of Kuwait. A few days ago the tiny Arab Emirate dismantled an extreme cell affiliated with the al-Qaeda organization, following the killing of an American Marine on the island of Failaka last Tuesday.
However, an American official who refused to mention his name responded that the concerned U.S. forces have "no doubts" that the shots were targeting them.
The Kuwaiti Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Army, in cooperation with the Ministry of Interior, are investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident.
U.S. forces are currently conducting joint maneuvers under the name "Spring Desert" with the Kuwaiti army in the northern desert of Kuwait. In spite of last week's incidents, a U.S. military spokesman said that U.S. forces still feel comfortable in the Emirate and denied that they are close to feeling they have become targets for attacks.
The "New York Times" newspaper quoted last week that the Head of Information Department in the Ministry of Justice and Islamic Affairs Muhammad al-Mileifi expressed his sympathy with the September 11 attacks against the United States, and he described himself as "close to al-Qaeda beliefs." Al-Mileifi was accused of working against Kuwaiti interests.
Summit Preparatory Meetings Launched, Francophone Council Discusses Agenda
After praising once again the "excellent" preparations for the Beirut Summit, which he described as "one of the most successful so far," he said that Lebanon, by hosting this event and the Arab Summit before it, is being resurrected from the ashes like a phoenix."
"An agreement was made regarding procedures that will be required of the Francophone Organization to contribute to settling the aggravated disagreement."
"- It has been decided to participate in the 2004 celebrations for the 200th independence anniversary of Haiti, which was the first Black republic."
Ghali did not wish to give further details on the decisions to be made in the coming meetings, because the recommendations that were submitted yesterday are likely to change in the ministerial meeting or the presidential summit.
He said, "Only ten years ago, Switzerland became a member of the Francophone Organization, because the major language in this country is German, not French."
Paris - "Al-Nahar:"
"We believe in international cultural values that Francophonism is spreading in the world, and we consider them to be a motive for peoples of Francophone states to live under freedom, justice, equality, democracy, and development. In Lebanon, we are proud of these values, but at the same time we are concerned that the authority hosting the Summit in Beirut may attempt to impose its own values on the conferees. Such values do not agree with the Francophone."
"Fourth: There is no freedom of press or speech in Lebanon, in spite of some signs of resistance against tyranny and injustice. Violent suppression of peaceful demonstrations is the norm. Closing media stations and brandishing the threat of closure at the rest of the media is a policy used by the authority and the Syrians to repress the Lebanese."
"Seventh: The Lebanese system of accord between its multicultural communities, which was described by the Pope as the example, the model, and the mission, is gradually disappearing in favor of the single party system and of eliminating co-existence with no respect for the rights of groups. Stalin-like suppression has become extremely obvious, and you have the documents. (...)"
In addition, he announced the idea of holding "a conference for the Christians in the Arab world to defend Iraq."
"On one hand, the American preparations to attack Iraq make Washington exercise political pressure on Israel to avoid opening a front with Lebanon. On the other hand, the existing Palestinian front inside Israel prevents the Israeli army from opening another front."
He also said, "Muslims have started to send messages of anger through violent operations all around the world."
He said, "The greatest danger does not lie in military war, but rather in the religious war that the United States is being dragged into by adopting the Israeli view, which wants to transform the war against terrorism into a war against Islam. This leads to a rift between the Christian West and the Islamic Orient that will mark human development in the third millennium."
Paris Mass Commemorates October 13
Said told the attendees, "Big projects require tears and sacrifices and even dying for them. The project of the salvation of mankind leads our God to exaltation and the Cross; the salvation of Lebanon our homeland and the people will require self-sacrifice. It will result in leaving one's homeland and loss of one's freedom."
"When the chains have broken"
Lahud Welcomes al-Mur, Hoffnanian, and Bahia al-Hareeri; Saudi Arabia Backs the Nomination of Karam for WHO Presidency
Karam said that he "found all of them very supportive of nominating Lebanon."
"However, Arab unanimity in supporting Lebanon's nomination will have maximum effect in international political circles."
Al-Hareeri said, "Delivery of such a message will have a great impact on the discussions of the Women's Summit. It will also reflect the concerns of the Summit President with Arab women's role through their dealing with public affairs."
During the meeting, the recent developments related to the issue of al-Wazzani spring water were discussed.
The President informed the international delegate "that Lebanon places extreme importance on the efforts exerted by the U.N. to prove its right to use part of its share of al-Wazzani waters."
After the meeting, Rod-Larsen spoke to reporters and said, "I have just met with my dear friend, President Emil Lahud."
"At this time, I have no comments."
"I have just met with my friend, Prime Minister al-Hareeri. We discussed general issues related to the Middle East and particularly the situations looming over the area that are not specifically relevant to Lebanon."
The international delegate also visited Parliament Chairman Nabeeh Berri in the Parliament.
"I will go to New York to meet with the Secretary General, and I will also meet with others in the areas that are involved with this issue to discuss it."
He said that this policy "explicitly means that the U.S. President sees through his mirror the people he wants or does not want, and this applies to President Saddam Hussein."
"Resorting to military force to achieve a certain goal is unacceptable."
With regard to the Syrian presence in Lebanon, the parliament chairman emphasized, "the role performed by the Syrian army in Lebanon was necessary," indicating that "such presence comes under the framework of Lebanese strategic benefit."
Mentioning the issue of al-Wazzani water, Berri emphasized that "beginning to pump al-Wazzani water will practically and officially start as scheduled. Lebanon will never change that timing." He denied that Lebanon chose that date to coincide with French President Jacque Chirac's visit and the start of the Francophonic Summit.
He also formed a Lebanese-Senegal parliamentary friendship committee.
The visit of French President Jacque Chirac the day after tomorrow bears particular significance, as it comes among crucial and sensitive circumstances at the internal and regional levels.
He will then launch the INA as he previously launched the ISA (Higher Business School) in 1998. Those two institutions are important for young Lebanese men and women to receive higher education in Lebanon, instead of going to France.
2 - Al-Wazzani water and Chirac's personal intervention in supporting Lebanon's natural right to benefit from the spring's water and his condemning of Israeli threats.
They also mentioned that Chirac is exerting diplomatic pressure to prevent Israel from attacking the new facilities in any way on the pretext that Lebanon has no right to utilize them. Military reports received in the Elysée Palace regarding the Israeli muscle-flexing in southern Lebanon and particularly above the new al-Wazzani facilities raise concern, although the Lebanese workshop was not affected by the intimidation desired by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his military leadership over Lebanon to stop the workshop. U.S. diplomacy had tried to persuade Lebanese officials to do so, to no avail.
4- The Palestinian-Israeli situation and its gravity in view of the failure of international efforts to stop the killings and resistance operations, the continued Israeli siege, the silence regarding Israel's assassination of resistance movement officials including civilians among whom are children and women, and the destruction of houses and property.
They expected that U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan would assign to Rod-Larsen the task of shuttling between Lebanon and Israel to settle the dispute over al-Wazzani water and to return to New York to agree with Annan on the suggestions and required steps to move toward Lebanon.
Giving congratulations for "holding the Francophone Summit in an Arab country for the first time," it expressed hope that the summit will not only represent a guarantee for Lebanese authorities, who are criticized for their measures and practices in the area of human rights.
He stressed, "It is necessary for the Summit to make tangible decisions with regard to the serious and collective violations of human rights or the banning of democracy and threats of banning it, such as what is happening in Cote d'Ivoire or in the Great Lakes area, in addition to strict positions with regard to the Near East and Iraq."
She also mentioned the martial courts, "the presence of which is unjustifiable in a democratic country,"
He directed an acknowledgement of gratitude to the organizations "defending human rights, liberties, and democracy at the expense of their own freedom and the safety of their members."
Al-Diman-"Al-Nahar":
After reading the Bible, the Archbishop preached, calling to strengthen the faith and encouraging the practice clerics to plant the seeds of faith, fear of God, and virtue in the hearts of people around them, and said: "It is a great joy today in the region, our beloved region, as four young men continue today to devote themselves to serve the Lord Jesus in serving people."
"It saw off a good plowman who devoted himself to cultivate the land of the region, and seed the good in its fertile soil, then beautiful plantings grew and embellished the church, Church of Lebanon, and the Church of Overseas with wheat grains gathered on time, ground, kneaded, and of which Hosts are made and offered on God's Altar for the salvation of the believers."
"It was an extraordinary event and a huge continuous manifestation in each city and village, as she, upon visiting, blessed our region and families for the region to remain the land of sainthood and families to be centers and schools for faith, and for always giving us a mission such as the ones we are sanctifying today."
Minister of Culture Ghassan Salama welcomed them.
"Several Francophone summits have been held previously, but I am expecting many important things from the summit that will be held in Lebanon, particularly since the Secretary General of the Francophone Organization, Dr. Boutros Ghali, has supervised several summits, and today he came ahead of us to Lebanon after visiting the offices of the Francophone Organization in Monaco."
Prime Minister Bumaya said, "As you know, Rwanda is a prominent Francophone member and had a distinguished and vital role in the previous summits. We respect and appreciate the Francophone family, and today we see that Lebanon is a distinguished Arab country to host this summit. We will cooperate culturally to intensify the dialog of civilizations, and we will endeavor to have this summit radiate Lebanon's prominent role in civilization."
Canadian Francophone Affairs Minister Denis Paradie was accompanied by the Cultural Attaché.
Honorary Consul in Lebanon Ara Fanilian received them.
Honorary Consul in Lebanon George Fernini received him.

After the meeting, Galloway emphasized the Lebanese people's right to complete the liberation of what remains of their land and to protect their water resources and said, "It was obvious that Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1978 aimed at stealing Al-Litani water," indicating, "Lebanon will meet any Israeli attack against its water resources with resistance."
Galloway then visited Al-Rashidia camp, where he met PLO and "Fatah" Movement Factions Secretary Sultan Abul-Enein.
"Every day, I enter the room and see what some have written"
"Sykes-Picot was a true disaster for the Arabs. Palestine was torn up into four directions in the world. They made Israel an international super power. A century of indignity has passed. The question to Arabs is: Will you accept a second Sykes-Picot?"
"If their absence continues, they will face a new threat."
Abul-Enein then spoke and thanked Galloway "The great friend of Palestine and its cause" and said, "We are in need of this strong voice from a friend of the Palestinian people. As I told my friend a moment ago, we are people filled with sorrow because we saw in your country 500 thousand demonstrators in solidarity with Palestine and Iraq, while the Arab street is in a coma."
Akar-"al-Nahar":
Members of the civil defense, army, and internal security forces are making immense efforts in a desperate attempt to control the fire, while clouds of thick smoke cover the region's skies.
While commending the efforts of army, internal security forces, and civil defense personnel, the crowds appealed to the ministries of interior and defense to send additional reinforcements to the area, particularly helicopters and personnel to expedite combating the fire in the rarest forest in Lebanon, where some of the trees are 500 years old.
It also extended to minefields, where 40 landmines detonated.
Crisis of Reducing UNRWA's Services Looms
They blamed the Agency Director in Lebanon, Alferio Metthio, for the aggravated situations of refugees due to the policy of injustice and neglect he has followed since he assumed office.
Elham's problem is identical to that of Subhia Jabir al-Tahhan, who was also stripped of her ration card. She says, "My children are orphans and cannot benefit from anything. They also dare not move from one area to another and are banned from work."
Amal Zubayda talked about her children's suffering in education and health. "Until now, my children have no books or stationery."
"I hold Metthio fully responsible for the deterioration of our condition."
"We are dying and cannot do anything."
al-Wazzani-"al-Nahar":
Qublan then presented medals to "everyone who worked to make the dream come true."
Regarding cost, he said: "It is priceless."
Russian Ambassador Boris Bolotine inspected the spring basin and the facilities constructed around it. He was accompanied by the designer of the project, engineer Mazin Ramadan, and a security escort.
He then made the following statement: "It is important to us to form an accurate perception of this problem. As it is known, Russia is exerting efforts with other international parties in order to contribute to finding a solution for the water issue in this area."
And does his country support Lebanon in implementing this project?
Concurrent with the visit, five Israeli military vehicles were standing by in the street overlooking the spring from the occupied Syrian town of al-Ghajar to observe what was happening. Five Israeli officers were seen carrying maps and pointing with their hands towards the al-Wazzani basin.
The spring was also inspected by European Union water expert Walter Maziti, who took photographs of the spring and the newly constructed facilities.
- Undeclared U.S. support for the conference that was observed in lateral communications by high-ranking officials in the U.S. administration with the Japanese prime minister before Al-Hareeri's arrival in Tokyo to promote Lebanese efforts exerted to make the conference successful.
The Lebanese Industrialists Society launched yesterday a media and advertising campaign in cooperation with the Ministry of Industry, carried out by "/" company, aimed at gaining consumer confidence in Lebanese products, building long-term loyalty for them, and sending a message that the products are competitive in terms of quality and variety and that Lebanese exports will contribute to the progress of national economy and will make new job opportunities available.
"1- Gaining consumer confidence in Lebanese products."
"Following that, there will be a second campaign that will address emotion and reason to encourage the Lebanese consumer to buy Lebanese products, then a third campaign that will focus on the issue of the environment and its importance. This will be an awareness campaign to encourage recycling under the slogan 'productive industry for a better environment.'"
The campaign film was shown on a large screen, along with broadcasting a radio advertisement for the campaign. Also presented were advertising posters that will be widely posted in streets and that have the following titles: "Our Lebanese Industries Are Quality Imported Worldwide," "Exports of Our Lebanese Industry Improve Trade Balance," and "Lebanese Exports Spread around the World."
This event comes under the slogan of the "Overlapping Views Beirut - Paris" exhibitions organized by the French Cultural Center and the Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts (ALBA).
The High National Institute in Lui Lumiere developed the photographic copies.
From these considerations and based on these archaeological sites and the findings therein, in addition to other areas, all of which are anchored in historical, social, ethnic, religious, cultural, and art sources, the students compiled the unique of the successive civilizations to present them as photographic reporting that highlights Beirut's historical, geographical, and archaeological role in the area.
The photographic approach is multifaceted and complimentary.
Between the bank and El-Saraya roads lie the Roman baths that go back to a hundred years B.C. They were photographed by Reema Hishaim, Nimat Khair-Allah, Darine Zeidan, and Danial Khattar.
Various elements, of which the most seductive are the musical accompaniment to the dance, are seductive in the show titled "Awaiting the other" (*), leaving behind a long strong impact, upon the end of the last scene, in the eyes of the audience who experienced, during the fifty-minute show performed by the team of the French choreographer Michel Halette Ygayane in Abdel Kader School in Beirut, progressive feelings: partiality, concentration, delight, to some wondering, confusion, and boredom, then a kind of unconditional conciliation with Yetsashoy's audio-visual developments while performing attractive and restless rhythms.
Number of volumes: 1
A historical and artistic event covering the life in Lebanon from the political, literary, architectural, artistic, athletic, and social aspects over a hundred years of constant events, year after year, in more than 1500 pictures with labels in both Arabic and French.
All of them took the traditional photos during a period between February and April 2002, and collected the necessary documents, wrote the texts, and selected the best shots.
Within this framework, the selected subjects had an important cultural significance, especially since the excavations taking place downtown were very rich for whoever desired to show the civilization's wealth characterizing our capital, which witnessed successive historical periods.
The boy has two curls to which all the story was related as he is blond with a dirty face and uncircumcised (was not circumcised as in the Muslim tradition).
"Awaiting the Other" is a title inspired by the discussion of the Mediterranean cultures from which Michel Halette Ygyanne has been quoting since long ago, the topics he discussed in collusion with artists from countries of which memory is confused in this wide, colored, black-white civilization, i.e., in the Mediterranean Sea.
The dancers' performance acquires a double expressive elegance at the moment when this performance meets the spoken vocabulary flying in the space of the place and seem to grant the bodies' obedience and other features as coquetry, flexibility, femininity, and that lightness showing the moves of the four female dancers like a wheat spike touched by the breeze.
The links between the performers is restricted to similar moves and steps, probably according to the choreographer's wish to give a strong inspiration through the absolute adhesion between Gilgamesh, who is seeking, for his affection to Ankido, a human fate similar to that of Ankido, who is dying.
The music starts to play as waterfalls sound, then the rhythms go higher with folkloric resources and current changes as a result of continuous experiments realized by Jean Christophe Desire and Serge Folly.
The costumes match the bodies' flexibility, particularly the women's, and responding to the meanings of the events, which are horizontally told and vertically inspired and do not repeat as a summary.
One Drowned and One Strangled; Addoum Circular For Completing Assignment Coordinates; Consideration Of Oun's Lawsuit Vs. Al-Herawi Postponed; Madi Completes MTV File Investigations, Justice Palace Delegate, and MTV Assault in Suburb Against Electricity Employees; Common Transport Buses Burning Attempt; Various Incidents in Ein Al-Helwa
Part of the circular read:
Beirut Senior Magistrate Hatem Madi finalized his investigations into the public prosecution against the MTV television station, the editor of the "Poll" program, Ziyad Naheim, and the station officer in charge of the program.
He declined to attend to other witnesses who were guests or contacted the program by telephone during its broadcast.
Clarification was due.
He reported that the car that was passing through the area and threw the bottles after igniting them was a green Mercedes 230.
But Beirut Attorney General Afeef Al-Hakim recommended keeping Ali detained for investigation until today.
Adham S. J.
It expressed regret for "the continuation of the official Lebanese approach, which is always trying to deny the presence of Lebanese detainees in Syrian prisons, in spite of all the proofs and evidence, and even of confessions."
"Syrian authorities have also not contacted the families committee to verify the submitted information."
"Such positions do not help solve the issue."
"The awkwardness sensed by Lebanese authorities toward Syrian authorities with regard to the detainees issue is much less than the awkwardness toward the unhealed wound that causes hundreds of Lebanese families severe heartache."
The current problem is to secure 14,000 U.S. dollars required to cover the two surgeries.
Some of the demonstrators say, "A number of hospitals refused to admit Muhammad Ali before securing money."
"But he is in danger and needs two surgeries to treat his fractures."
"But we are not in a position to provide financial coverage for such health emergencies."
"We are currently awaiting a response regarding available means of aid in this case."
She responded, "I hope he does not die."
"In case the Commissioner's Office does not respond to our legitimate request, it will bear full legal, moral, and humanitarian responsibility for the health condition of our son, Assad."
"Examination revealed that he suffered a skull fracture and brain hemorrhage, as well as a fracture in the right thigh bone."
"He has started to regain consciousness without the need for the artificial respiration system."
Honor Celebrations for Pupils in Districts; Fattoush: Lebanon is Suffering Political Malaria; Al-Awzai
The honored pupils' speech was delivered by pupil Muhammad Ayyoub of Al-Imam Al-Hassan Secondary school, while the parents councils' speech was delivered by Zaynab Bakr.
He wondered, "How can this government ask employees and teachers to work afternoons, while it is complaining of the surplus?"
The Islamic Business Administration College-Akkar Branch affiliated with Al-Imam Al-Awzai University celebrated the graduation of the first wave of its Bachelors students in Northern Lebanon. It was a gathering with the graduates and their families in the plaza of the University branch in Akkar and was attended by its staff.
The board of delegates of the League of Lebanese University Full-Time Professors rejected parts of the budget bill and emphasized the legitimacy of their demands to restore the authority of the University Council and to legitimize representative councils.
"2- Absolute refusal of rescinding the University Professors' Cooperative Fund through the cooperative funds recommendation project in various sectors and refusal of the proposed reduction in the fund's budget."
"The board of directors asserted the priority of accomplishing reform in the university at various levels."
"2- Develop a new law for full-time employment that will take the university out of the current law with all its confusion and infringements."
"c- Authorization of the executive board:"
With the criticisms of Turkish Foreign Minister Sina Gorel, whose term in office has expired, by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's plan to unify Cyprus, basically aimed at "pushing toward application" of the European Union's scheme to admit the island to its membership, Turkish army Chief of Staff General Helmi Uzkok warned the European organization that a unilateral decision regarding admission of Cyprus to the Union might raise a regional crisis.
The European Union says that it prefers to admit a unified island. However, it announced that it might agree to admit the southern half if no settlement is made.
He noted that the U.N. scheme "imposes a final period of time to allow Cyprus (which is internationally recognized and represented by Greek Cypriots) to join the European Union without trouble, but it does not solve the existing problems."
He said, "It is not yet time to set a time to start membership negotiations."
"Terrorism must be condemned regardless of its source."
Afghani police opened fire Monday evening and Tuesday morning at thousands of demonstrators who gathered in protest of their poor studying conditions in the university campus, where they said there has been no electricity or heat for days.
Afghan President Hamid Karzai expressed his "sorrow" for this tragedy and criticized the police for firing at the students. He demanded an inquiry to determine who was responsible.
It explained, "Representatives of the organization spoke to witnesses who said that the police beat the students in the university housing and threatened at the hospital some of those who were injured." Reporters were denied access to Kabul Hospital, where those are being treated.
Milak lies between Baluchestan and the Afghan state of Nimruz, where there are confrontations between local Afghan leaders. It is one of two border passage points between the two countries.
Dogharun has been open since the fall of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan in 2001. It is the major passage for the return of Afghan refugees and also for trade exchange between both countries.
The same diplomatic sources say that implementation of Resolution 1441 is limited to removal of WMDs in Iraq, whereas President Bush's administration wants, in addition to that, to overthrow Saddam Hussein's regime, which will not be achieved through implementation of the mentioned resolution.
On the other hand, Arab states will stand against an unjustified strike launched by the U.S. against Iraq. In fact, such a strike will embarrass friendly Arab states, because they approved Resolution 1441 to spare Iraq a destructive war, not to expose it to the danger of such a war despite approval of that resolution and facilitating its implementation procedures.
British journalist Patrick Seal said in an interview that "U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell scored a remarkable victory within President Bush's administration over the neo-conservative wing and the Zionist extremists, who have an unrealistic geopolitical imagination."
From the information provided by the same sources, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell reassured his French counterpart De Villepin that Washington will allow a true Security Council discussion if International Chief Inspector Hans Blix reports to the Security Council an Iraqi challenge or deceptive attempt, and that President Chirac informed President Bush that if the Iraqi president defies the U.N., then France will be willing to consider overthrowing him.
Had this paper been written in Arabic, it would most probably have differed substantially in many of its items and concepts.
The good thing about this paper is that it unleashes imagination.
Somehow, it is a successor of "Al-Taif ideology" and also of applied diplomatic patterns and methods in formulating international decisions.
The pressing need for financial aid made that mind "glorify" external support in an official governmental document that should be maximally conservative in touching on any external matter.
Therefore, the government senses exceptional superiority in its autumn years, to the extent of feeling no anxiety in pronouncing glorification for such support, even if it is using it as a passage to states to urge them to lend a helping hand.
Is it truly the audacity of revealing facts, or is it that the government confiscates opposition discourse to contain the opposition internally while soliciting support from abroad?
However, if it is only valid on the basis of partial criteria of this hypothetical plan, then the paper heading for Paris will, regardless of its yield, be transformed into a ministerial statement preceding the formation of his fifth government. Most probably, the Lebanized interpretation of the paper at that time will ascribe to the required external financial support the attribute of "necessary and temporal."
Ha'arts published an editorial yesterday under the title "Searching For a Way And Searching For a Leader," in which it summarized the current picture inside Likud and Labor: "Two political events took place simultaneously the day before yesterday and gave a good synopsis of the start of the Knesset election battle."
"The impression was that this support was maintained after the speeches were delivered."
"He seemed to rely as of now on unprecedented coordination between the Israeli government and the U.S. administration and was capable of allowing himself to mock slogans and magical solutions."
"His popularity revealed by polls as a new figure with no link to politics might transform with the continued battle into a burden when he is required to deal with the complex and intricate political status quo."
Amid the rumbling quake at the edge of the Middle East and the Gulf, and at a time when the world from end to end seems obsessed by the Iraqi issue and the consequences it might leave behind affecting the regional situation and international balances, it seems interesting, nay captivating, that the superiors should open parentheses of attention for Lebanon.
It is now confirmed that 17 countries, among which are major states, and eight financial institutions of international weight are going to the French capital to participate in Lebanon's support conference. This in itself is sufficient to give the event special significance. It might be important for us to recall another current fact at this point, which is that George Bush has not managed so far to gather 17 countries behind him to establish a coalition to wage war against Iraq.
Additionally, it must provide political "advice" based on principles of reinforcing cooperation, rather than struggles, between states and the expansion of supportive friendship horizons instead of releasing winds of hatred and hostility.
The conference will undoubtedly score financial success, otherwise Jacques Chirac would not have personally sponsored that demonstration, and a number of countries including the U.S. would not have agreed to participate in it.
Rajih Al-Khuri
Minister Al-Shar' is undoubtedly performing magnificently in this regard, at least within the limits allowed by the programmed ambiguity of Syrian policy.
No wonder, as Lebanese consumption talk is at a standard between two standards.
In the first place, there is no room for releasing any purposeful and clear "external" talk from Lebanon, as long as the "Lebanese arena" remains the preferred location for Syrian ambiguity.
For example, it is a characteristic of Lebanese consumption that Lebanon is most probably the only country in the world where Syrian talk about not participating in "a U.S.-led international coalition to attack Iraq beyond the U.N. framework" bears any meaning.
On the contrary, as long as the United States prefers to keep away from the Lebanese headache, it will not hesitate to reward Syria if necessary.
Here, undoubtedly, will be the biggest test for Lebanese consumption talk. It is thus not surprising that Minister Al-Shar' should start practicing it while waiting for the return.
While the cabinet was absent in its ordinary session yesterday from the conference rounds with its members' working paper published before holding the conference, the electricity issue was present in the Higher Privatization Council that was held after the cabinet.
The technical report, which is being handled by an engineering firm.
Baydhon dismissed the possibility of raising the 40% share, which is currently offered for tender.
Establishment of the two companies is planned for the first quarter of 2003 and after the government sells 40% of the first company's shares to a private partner before mid-2003.
In parallel with the working line of the Paris 2 conference on the 23rd of this month, the governmental workshop continues to achieve the internal pledges committed by Lebanon before the external world to obtain its aid for the government's program for financial correction, privatization, and structural reform.
Of these reports, he specified three: the financial report, which is being prepared by the auditor.
He added, "If any delay is caused by the accounting audit, it will not exceed one month, and then privatization of electricity can be started in January 2003."
Chinese Prseident Jiang Zemin stepped aside from the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party at the end of its sixteenth General Conference. His deputy, Hu Jintao, is expected to be elected as his successor today.
Maronite Patriarch to Rome on Sunday; Patriarch Council Re-elects Father Nasr General Preacher for Prisons
With regard to the Council's meetings yesterday, the following information was released: At nine o'clock this session was started with morning prayers, and its proceedings were coordinated by Bishop Gi Boulos Najeem, where the outcomes of the four discussion forums of yesterday's topic "Universities in Lebanon and Higher Education" were reviewed, and the conferees discussed the practical suggestions in this regard.
Bishop Kameel Zeidan then highlighted a number of aspects of the relationship between private schools and state institutions through laws, decrees, decisions, and ministerial circulars. He recalled the initiatives taken by the Catholic Schools Secretariat for cooperation and participation with the state in the education policy at the administration and curriculum levels.
He also talked about the Union of Higher Education Institutions in Lebanon.
MP Faris Buwez expressed a view that "the importance of Resolution 1441 lies in blocking the way of American unilateral action and its postponement of a previously made war decision and preparations that had advanced far ahead."
"The importance of this resolution also lies in the fact that it postponed a war decision that was previously made and preparations that had advanced far ahead."
"With the intelligence of its position, Syria has also contributed to the prevention of establishing a principle suggesting that war can be waged in isolation of international legitimacy."
"For Paris 2, we have to secure a political truce that will induce internationally required confidence to make it as successful as possible."
Fadl-Allah was speaking during a fast-breaking banquet held by the Islamic Religious Education Society in Al-Batoul Secondary School in Bi'r Hassan.
He added: "Why were we confused when the cultural and media attack was launched on the issue of the terrorism of Islam, or what is called fundamentalism and so forth?"
"The only result is more taxes, more debts and financial encumbrances, poverty, and the results of poverty."
He noted, "The people cannot endure any new taxes. Any official who says that the people can endure that is asked to kindly present the figures he has."
* In a fast-breaking banquet held in the Marriott hotel in Al-Jinah, MP Nazim Khuri said, "Lebanon is an exceptionally constitutional country based on accord, consultation, and wisdom."
* Al-Imam Al-Sadr Foundations held a fast-breaking banquet for ladies in the Venecia hotel. Among the attendees were Mrs. Muna Al-Herawi and the wives of ministers and MPs, and women figures.
Minister of Public Works and Transport Najeeb Miqati praised Kuwait's "standing as Emir and government by Lebanon at all times, particularly in difficult phases, reconstruction, rebuilding, and economic revival."
An agreement was then made to resume discussions during the visit to be made by Miqati to Kuwait next January.
The discussions dealt with the importance of expediting ratification of the air and sea transport agreement signed between the two countries, because of its positive ramifications on the economic movement.
He also met with a delegation from the Steelyard Merchants Association of Lebanon presided over by Association Chairman Arsilan Sno.
Miqati delivered a speech in which he stressed the importance of cooperation between the Ministry of Public Works and Transport and the Ministry of Preparation and Housing in France. He emphasized commitment to the conference recommendations with a view to making maintenance more effective and developing its performance.
On the opposition front, and specifically Qirnat Shahwan, the internal media mud-slinging between its seniors and the withdrawal of its national bloc leader Carlos Idda from it have not cleared its general skepticism that the authority's war against it continues.
It is also their view that continuity of its statements' high ceiling did not hide its experienced state of confusion, with which it needs to draft a new policy based on profit and loss assessment of the past few months and on setting a new working strategy for the future.
1- Halting campaigns between Qirna members through the media.
The Qirna is currently absent from all active issues, and it would be useful, according to those, for it "to regain its role on the opposing political level with a new strategy based on comprehensive calculations."
It is their view that "these three major stations will be open for dealing by political rivals except the Qirna, which has isolated itself from any internal entitlement."
"Anything else will not exceed the limits of casual meetings bearing no practical interpretation."
Lahud was speaking yesterday morning upon receiving Beirut Attorneys Association Chairman Rimon Shedid and Antoine Akl, the new International Attorneys Union, on the occasion of his election at the conference held in Sydney on the Union's diamond jubilee.
"We celebrated its diamond jubilee in Sydney (Australia)."
Shedid mentioned that Akl raised in his speech the issue of dangers threatening humanity and said: "The United Nations and its Security Council are paralyzed. Their decisions are enforced on some and are not applied to others. The same crimes against humanity are penalized for some and permissible for others. Identical war crimes are cruelly penalized for some, while disgraceful silence is exercised in their regard for others. States that have lifted the torch of liberty and justice high are setting legislation that are fatal to public liberties and human rights."
Within an hour, the cabinet restricted its discussion to an agenda out of which it approved 24 of 27 original items.

And today, UNRWA is considered the major source of basic services in the areas of education, health, social services, and relief for Palestinian refugees registered with the agency in the Middle East.
The refugee camps are the pivot of the agency's operations in its operating areas.
In addition to that, seldom do the voluntary contributions that fund the agency's programs match the increasing needs of the Palestinian people.
Vocational centers provide youth refugees with skills required by the market, while the teachers house trains teachers qualified to teach in the agency's schools.
It also provides some assistance in secondary healthcare, particularly in emergencies, through a contract with non-governmental and private hospitals or though partial payment of medication costs.
In the recent years, UNRWA has faced an increasing deficit in its budget, and its resources have constricted.
UNRWA head offices are in Gaza and Amman.
Those who exploit existing disagreements are the enemies of Lebanon and are planting dissension and rifts internally and externally.
3- As to national unity, you can speak as much as you wish of the "state of institutions," starting with the honorable ministers who yell at one another and publicly exchange serious accusations, occasionally more than once a week. The only thing they have in common is the spirit of sacrifice to remain in the ruling paradise to serve public interests.

The hopes of political tradesmen who are accustomed to seeing transgression without blinking in continuing to enjoy the delights of their proceeds are the same as the hopes of barren land for rain, a sterile woman for offspring, and a seriously ill person for recovery.
On the bridge known as Chevrolet Bridge, connecting Al-Hazimia Quarantine, which passes over Al-Maklas road, the lower front layer is sheared and the front collapsed on what was underneath it. (...) Considerable time has passed with this condition without action from the concerned authorities to repair the damage.
Is the road passing under the bridge elevated above its level due to repetitively paved layers of asphalt, which affected in turn the elevation of the bridge above the surface of the earth?
After the relics went inside the Monastery's church, believers hurried to get their blessings and for prayers.
Ramiz Ismail, "Al-Nahar" correspondent in Baalbak, wrote that the relics traveled Wednesday-Thursday nights in Christian villages in Baalbak's provinces and especially Marunite ones after a wait for about 5 to 8 hours, during which people of all ages were waiting for her outside their homes to receive her and get their blessings from her.
All apologies.
Finally he said, "Restoration of the South from the grip of Israeli occupation is restoration of the Arab dignity."
The sales price of state property totaled tens of billions of dollars, but instead of fulfilling its external debts, these debts were multiplied by a factor of sixteen. This is because corruption and bribery among the political layer and the administration absorbed those billions, and the state was on the verge of bankruptcy, thus losing its assets and multiplying its debts, while the middle class was eradicated and poverty prevailed.

Iraqi "Oppositions" and Resolution 1441: Cautious Welcome
"Or as a second option, the tyrant of Baghdad can continue with his illusions and calculations and obstruct the inspections teams, thus causing more Iraqi innocents to be exposed to death."
As to whether compliance with the resolution would dismiss the war phantom, Talibani says, "It dismisses war but does not strike it out, because Saddam is obliged to change the regime according to a law issued by the Congress during the term of President Bill Clinton."
The Iraqi Turkmenistan organization Islamic Union of Iraqi Turkmenistan, which represents Shiite Turkmenistan Iraqis, commented on Resolution 1441 by saying that this resolution is booby-trapped in each one of its lines and does not prevent a war or a U.S. military attack against the regime.

Arab Banks Union Chairman Dr. Joseph Tarbiya considered that Lebanon has no choice beyond corrective steps and financial reform that it started this year and on which it will continue to work with determination and persistence.
In a short speech, Tarbiya confirmed that the Arab Banks Union, the headquarters of which is in Lebanon, is closely and with deep concern monitoring the events and development, "as Lebanon will host this year the two most important conferences in the area, those being the Arab Summit and the Francophone States Summit, and the most important international financial conference will be held for it in Paris."
"Were it not for your endurance, Lebanon would never have arrived at the Paris 2 conference that it deserved." He emphasized that the support that will be authorized by Paris 2 for Lebanon is neither charity nor aid, "but rather a fundamental investment in regional peace and security for an influential country in the Middle East area that deserves attention and care from the international community."

She shows, as she really is, the perfect creature ever.
When the angel appeared to the Nazareth Virgin and said to her unfamiliar words, this ideal agreed and said: "Cheer, O Woman Full Of Grace."
Acknowledging that the Virgin Mary is the one upon whom an endless grace is headed means that the ideal of which she has been known is not a goal she reached by her hard work and persistence but accepted it from God and has totally adhered to.
She is a chosen creature, free from any sin and full of grace, according to what the Angel Gabriel said.
No wonder, then, to see our mother the sacred church surrounded, since the day Christianity was founded, by a halo of respect, estimation, and honor.
A Yemeni official confirmed yesterday that Sana'a received the shipment of 15 Northern Korean Scud missiles, which was intercepted then released by the United States at sea. In addition, Yemeni President Ali Abd-Allah Saleh starts on Monday an official visit to Moscow on invitation from his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to hold talks on bilateral relations, the Palestinian issue, and the situation in Iraq.
According to military sources in Aden, the Yemeni army possesses "20 Scud missile launching pads provided by the former Soviet Union in the early eighties."
It was then found that the missiles were being sent to Yemen.
Sana'a is trying to clear itself of its image as a safe haven for extremist Islamists and had detained ten suspected of being members of the Al-Qaeda organization in a huge campaign, as part of the U.S.-led war on "terrorism."
In June, Yemen received the first batch of MIG 29 aircraft from Russia.
The Two Koreas Clear Mines to Facilitate Ground Transportation; Pyongyang Bears "Deep Hatred" Toward Washington, Getting Ready for Confrontation, and Fighting a "Deadly and Challenging" Battle; Deep Hatred; Mine Clearing
He said, "We believe it is important that we all tell North Korea that it cannot hope to develop its relations with the rest of the world unless it eliminates these programs that aim at proliferation of nuclear arms in the Korean peninsula."
In the light of American threats, a comment made by the ruling party in Pyongyang and published in the "Rudong Sinmon" newspaper stated, "The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is not disturbed, because it made full preparations for confrontation and combat with the Americans."
Clearing mines to construct railways and freeways in two passages in the demilitarized zone is one of several projects between the two Korean divisions.

Akbar said that Karzai "will emphasize the need for more aid, particularly with regard to reconstruction."
He said that this force, which will take the province of Paktia in the country's south- east as its base, will be the first Afghan force to participate directly in the campaign that is led by the United States against "terrorism."
Karzai says that constructing a national army is a basic priority to assist Kabul in tightening its grip on the area beyond control of the central government.
Included in the statement was that two aircraft of the Harrier type belonging to the Marines were sent from the Bagram base north of Kabul to secure aerial support, but it was not possible to find the attackers.
The source did not reveal the specific role of the international organization in the process.
His name was mentioned in a list of 150 terrorists pursued by the Egyptian authorities, published in early 2001.
It said that he lost one of his two legs and two eyes in a mine explosion during his participation in a "military operation," without specifying the place of this operation and its time or its nature.
Tehran Repeats Invitation to Nuclear Agency to Visit the Two Sites of Natanz And Araq
He said that Tehran itself reported in September about the building of facilities and issued the invitation to visit them.
He scoffed at the American accusations and said that it is not appropriate to talk about "a new discovery" in the issue of Araq and Natanz, emphasizing that Iran entered talks with the International Nuclear Energy Agency in this regard and that "all Iranian nuclear activities are subject to the observation of the International Nuclear Energy Agency."
Iranian newspapers saw in the issue an attempt by Washington to divert American public opinion from internal problems and international public opinion from the "massacres against the Palestinians" and the failure in the campaign to combat terrorism.
Delegates of the permanent NATO council ratified Friday night, at the end of a long day of discussions, an agreement regarding establishment of permanent relations between the European Union and NATO that the Europeans were pursuing for years.
He welcomed this as a "vital event in the history of relations between the Union and NATO."
The agreement between NATO and the European Union was suspended recently due to the objection of Turkey, a NATO member-state and Union non-member, after Ankara demanded guarantees that the European rapid response force will not move against its interests in Cyprus and the Aegean Sea.
Robertson said, "The possibility of the European Union using NATO means in planning for military missions presided by the European Union have become ensured as of this moment."
He said in a press conference held before delivering his speech in the Royal Edinburgh Society in Scotland that "more special forces are definitely necessary."
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez announced that he is willing to use foreign oil workers in an attempt to end a strike that was started by the opposition 12 days ago and resulted in paralyzing Venezuela's oil exports.
He said after meeting with the leaders of the government and the opposition, "We believe that if this crisis does not find a quick solution, then we will be on the verge of chaos."
He told reporters, "I know nothing about any statement and therefore cannot give an opinion."
He said, "Nothing and no one can hinder the current boom in our oil industry."
They say that they will not return to work except after the President's resignation.
Pollution of Egyptian Water by Israel Stirs Storm In Cairo
The issue had exploded after statements made by North Sinai Governor General Ahmad Abd Al-Hameed late last week; he revealed in them the aggravation of the problem of polluting the coasts and water of the sea opposite the Egyptian city of Rafah because for more than a year the Israeli side deliberately discharged tons of sewerage wastes of Gaza Strip settlements along the coasts of the Egyptian city. This obliged the governorate authorities to restrict fishing in the area completely because of severe pollution that seriously affected the fish and marine life.
As to those who stayed, symptoms have started to appear on many of them of different diseases, such as intestinal infections, rashes, acute dermatitis, eye inflammation, respiratory difficulties, and others.
Al-Chalabi (57 years old), descending from an affluent family of bank owners, managed in spite of his conviction on a charge of embezzlement in Jordan to become one of the most prominent Iraqi opposition figures known in Washington, to the point of assuming the post of president of the Iraqi National Conference participating in the opposition meeting in London.
In spite of that, his efforts were what led in 1992 to the joining of several opposition movements, particularly of the Shiite and also of the Sunnis and among them the Kurds, to the the Iraqi National Conference.
However, Al-Chalabi's relationships and contacts contributed to make changing the regime in Iraq among the objectives of the Democratic government presided over by Bill Clinton in 1998, despite the reluctance of this administration to interfere in Iraq.
But Al-Chalabi asserted that he was the victim of a conspiracy plotted by Saddam Hussein who was then on good terms with the Jordanian regime, and Muhammad Saeed Al-Nabulsi who was governor of the Jordanian Central Bank.
One of his most prominent supporters is Richard Pearl, member of former President Ronald Reagan's administration, and who is close to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.
Media in the 15 member-states of the European Union unanimously hailed yesterday a new European Union consisting of 25 states, expressing at the same time their concern about the challenges that will be created by this expansion process, while the newspapers of the potential member-states expressed their enthusiasm to join.

The protestors demanded conducting a new trial for the two trials because of the accident, which took place in June.
This blast focused light on the instability in the province, which is being administered by the United Nations since1999 after the air war that was waged by NATO to stop the Serbian repression of the province's inhabitants, most of whom are of Albanian origin.
The Child and the Emperor
And from this advice is generated the ability to differ even with Heneidi herself.
Because the start is with the innocent minds, before their pages are filled with the ink of hypocrisy.
Starting with "a hand you cannot bite, kiss and pray that it be broken" to "a door that brings you wind, close and relax," passing by "lying is the adornment of men" in conjunction with "fleeing is two-thirds of manhood," appended to "a clever person dies not," all the way to "an adventurer is never praised even if he comes out safely."
- As to the saying of the poet, "And aspirations are not obtained with wishes," it does not mean in this world of ours diligence and perseverance on the straight path.
The story of the child and emperor, if we retell it, becomes as follows:
After Becoming Two Partners and the Government Converted to Fuel for Their Relationship, the Cabinet Flotation Embarrasses Lahud and Targets Al-Hareeri
The cabinet did not succeed over the past two years to assume the safety valve role in the vacillating relations between the two presidents to an extent that it became a captive of political and personal temperaments.
1- That the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister agreed more than a year and a half ago following the last vote in the cabinet on the "Solidaire" project, to "regulate" their management of the cabinet's operations in isolation from it, and this is what was expressed by their agreement not to include any item on the agenda that they have not approved.
2- Despite the lessons of democracy inspired by the government composition after the 2000 elections being a government representing in fact the political balances that emerged from those elections, and hence expresses the force of the majority that succeeded in controlling the parliament.
It might also be necessary to remind, at least in the secondary elections in Al-Matn, of the necessity of confrontation between both presidents by mediation through their ministers, the most prominent of whom is Minister of Interior Elias Almur.
3- There is something that falls under the necessity of what is not necessary to reconfirm, which is that the President of the Republic who is keen on attending all sessions of the cabinet and presiding over them-and that is his constitutional right- deals with the role of the cabinet as an actual partner in it more than an arbitrating president.
Whether Hans Blix agrees or refuses, the tasks of his team operating in Iraq will turn from inspection for chemical and germ weapons to searching for asylum seekers who usually envisage the "American dream."
And if the previous statements set the bet on some scientists whispering in the ears of Blix and his group, Lugar went directly to the "target": providing safe haven for the Iraqi scientists and their families in return for disclosing the secrets of Saddam Hussein's arms programs.
And it is no secret that Condoleezza Rice is personally presiding over a team working to develop a plan to access the Iraqi experts who can lead the inspectors to the sites of weapons.
In any case, the American response to the "Iraqi report" that Washington is moving toward convicting Saddam because of several missing links in the report, is a conviction that needs the testimony of scientists and reports by witnesses for it to be conclusive and to help Bush in drawing the reluctant into war.
No one needed to wait for the American reactions to the "Iraqi report" to discover that matter, because it was absolutely clear even before the arrival of the inspectors in Baghdad that the basic bet is not based on the element of searching for the "needle" of weapons of mass destruction in a huge stack of Iraqi geographic "hay," but rather on the element of exploring for the secrets in the chests of Iraqis, who can lead the inspectors to those weapons if they exist and reveal to them the secrets and information they know about them.
To that end, Blix announced that he does not want to turn into an official in charge of an "asylum agency" that attracts Iraqi scientists, because basically he leads a team searching for prohibited weapons and not for scientists who want to exit the "Garden of Eden."
Information leaked out of the American administration last Thursday, confirming a name list of 500 experts from among approximately 20,000 scientists, engineers, and technicians who previously participated in manufacturing the restricted Iraqi weapons.

The Secretary-General of the High Council for Privatization Ghazi Yusuf reported to "Al-Nahar" last night that "the next stage after signing the ownership contract was delayed because of the developments in the negotiations between the Minister of Telecommunications and the two companies Celles and Lebancell.
Amman-"Al-Nahar":
He stressed in an interview with the "Neue Zuricher Zeitung" that "we are negotiating with the European Union with regard to an agreement on the taxes that the Union is trying to impose on saving in Switzerland and not about banking confidentiality, which is not negotiable."
It is planned to resume negotiations next January.
Palestinian President Yassir Arafat was asked about these statements, and he replied that he informed the international parties and particularly the U.S. administration ...
And now what, after the transfer of the sector ownership to the state?
He mentioned that "the previous preparatory announcement for bidding attracted 19 expressions of interest from Arab and international companies."
After the Chairman of the Company Salah Bu Raad announced, after the signing in front of reporters, that the collection document that was issued by the state previously and not executed will be referred to international arbitration to the time of issuing the arbitration award and implementing it, he added that an agreement has been made to "include that in a letter that was attached to the contract and signed by both parties."
Amman Detains Two Accused of Assassinating Foley and Confirms Their Confession of Their Affiliation With Al-Qaeda; Israeli Concern
The Minister of State for Political Affairs, Minister of Information, the official spokesman in the name of the government Dr. Muhammad Affasg Al-Adwan reported in an official statement transmitted by the Jordanian News Agency Petra that "General Intelligence had arrived at information leads about the organization that stands behind the crime and refrained from revealing them early for intelligence and technical considerations related to completion of investigations and revealing the links of planning and execution."
The Minister mentioned that Al-Khalayla "provided them with machine-guns, a silencer gun, grenades, and cylinders of teargas that were smuggled into the Kingdom illegally and stored in a house rented for this purpose in the city of Al-Reseifa near Amman (...) and that arrangements were also made to attempt to smuggle a number of rockets into the Kingdom and provide them with an amount of 18,000 dollars out of an original 50,000 allocated for the execution of the mentioned program of missions and terrorist operations."
He emphasized that the two accused will be tried before the Jordanian judiciary, because "the crime occurred on Jordanian territory."
He stressed the pressing necessity of establishing greater "international cooperation" to confront the danger that is represented by the networks that are led by Usama bin Laden.
He explained during the opening of the fifth session of the workplace to activate the actions of non-governmental organizations in the center of the "social movement" in Pedaro yesterday, in the presence of deputy Ghassan Mkheiber and some representatives of non-governmental bodies and organizations.
He was accompanied on the tour by the Head of Municipality Vissen Abdo Kataya, mayors, and personalities.

Saadeh preached and talked about Hardini's life, which was spent in fasting, prayer, and meditation.

It was a good occasion for the classic music to accompany the first poem "Gharib" by Nadia Tueini, as an opera composed by Dr. Hotaf Khoury, performed by the Italian soprano Lara Mitilini, and played by the pianist Tatiana Berihak Khoury.
What a beautiful occupation, what a sweet compulsory union between the word, the melody, and the inattentive ear when the angelic singing surprises it, holding the message and calling to come into the conscience/emotional areas and make "Al Ghareeb" (The Stranger) close and familiar; this stranger is the poetic "me" and "me" is whoever suffered and is suffering war, disasters, poverty, immigration problems, or deracination.
In fact, we have to point to the skills of the soprano Lara Martilini as she could, in a short time, memorize the poem and sing it while it is composed by a composer whose music is known at least as "not easy" and renewed with a writing style, harmonic colors, and continuous moving between levels and degrees.
Might the singer be able to make all the Lebanese, Arab, and world listen to it so they would share our honor and joy?
Numan: Three Defects in Cellular Contract and Alternative is Managing not Privatizing Sector
"The first defect is that there is ambiguity and mystery surrounding the arbitration conditions in terms of the right of the state to demand all rights and indemnities rising from the violations committed by the two cellular companies since the start of executing the contract and specified by the Auditing Authority in its first report dated 6/21/1999 and its report addendum dated 7/19/2000 and which the two companies continued to commit to 8/31/2002, knowing that the rights and indemnities due in this regard are approximately one billion, 200 million U.S. dollars."
He said: "We appeal to the President of the country to adhere to his policy aimed at the conservation of public property by preventing the selling of the cellular to the private sector and replacing that with conducting a tender to select two new companies to manage the two cellular networks on behalf of the state in return for a fee."
Vice Chairman of Parliament Eli Farazly pointed out, The attempt to strip Bakraki of its political character at the current stage is even more damaging to the situation of Christians and the state. He also expressed his belief that Bakraki is the alternative to Christian extremism.
Regarding his relationship with President Emil Lahud, Al-Farazly said, I deal with President Lahud through the institutions. I also deal with everyone according to the Lebanese constitution. I call for constitutional preservation. I urge President Lahud to fulfill his oath of office.
In his opinion, the Syrian presence in Lebanon, is related to the development of the Middle East settlement. It has regional consequences. Hence, it is not in our favor as Lebanese people that the Syrians move out of Lebanon. The issue will involve different security aspects if peace is settled in terms of fundamentalism, extremism, and the conflict with Israel.
He also emphasized that it is necessary that Bakraki continue to assume such a national role.
"It is extremely regretful that the Canadian ambassador committed such a grave mistake when he attempted to clarify the background of his governments decision. He argued that the decision is based on a statement made by the Secretary General (of Hezbollah, Al-Sayyed Hassan Nasr-Allah) on the al-Quds Day anniversary, in which he allegedly supported what the ambassador described as terror attacks not only in Israel but in other countries, too."
"'It is a political party known for that in Lebanon, and it is an organization struggling to liberate the Lebanese lands, particularly the Shebaa Farms region.'"
The General Secretariat of the Arab National Conference, the National-Islamic Conference Monitoring Committee, and the General Secretariat of the Arab Parties Conference issued a statement in Beirut describing the decision as clear bias toward the American-Zionist alliance against Arabs and Muslims and the Nations right of self-defense and resistance to the occupation, which is a right granted by all international charters and resolutions.
He called upon all parties, powers, figures, and institutions of the civil community to express their resentment against any oppression or intolerance against Hezbollah and its firm commitment to resistance.
He called on young people not to yield to the logic of depression, because they are the hope of the future and will play a major role in it.
"This does not mean that someone who leads a certain operation or is active belongs to a certain group, while others are neglected."
He added: This is a point I would like to mention. In spite of all that is said about the situation and problems in Lebanon, these practices represent a sort of pressure on us as young people, in the context of our daily activities inside or outside the university. I do not encourage anyone to surrender to the logic of depression or to the status quo; in fact, I reject any such surrender that is due to a simplistic reason or that is far from reasonable consideration."
Replying to a question, Al-Aridi asserted that previously there was an Armenian bloc in the parliament, but today the Armenian bloc no longer exists. However, they are putting great efforts toward keeping up their demands for Armenian rights since our law allows that."
"I foresaw two serious issues: The first is political; what happened is unacceptable. The second is social; many families have lost their income, regardless of the mistakes made by MTV."

He said that the attack took place on Saturday when 50 people entered (...) carrying rocks and shouted, "Kill the Jews".

Notwithstanding our respect and fondness for you and Miss Khalifah, and our constant delight at the unique and distinguished media message carried by your newspaper, making it a pioneer in communicating the truth and reality, we have been forced to record some observations in response to errors contained in the investigation either in the words of Mr. Jadd Risha or in the way that the writer of the investigation broke up various responses that we had given, separating what we said from its context.
2- Risha's statement that "President Al-Jamil did not put forward a different political proposal in his statements, but his message was similar to that of the party, and from here we can see that the state of division was no more than a game of personal interests (...), which is evidence either of ignorance in the political reading or of no political reading whatsoever.
Our presence together in the arena of struggle for more than a year, and in a coordination committee that brings us together with the Free Patriots and the Free Nation Current, results in national awareness and kinship, which paves the way for the establishment of a united and strong society, one that those who like to play with strings and wires cannot deceive.
A senior source revealed that the force had this week stopped 24 people of different Arab and Asian nationalities who did not have work permits to work in the border area.
Residents of neighboring buildings are living in a state of fear that the dilapidated building may collapse at any moment.
The residents of the building say that the security forces informed them that they must leave within 48 hours, but the people complained that there was nowhere for them to go.
The delegation expressed a desire to help restore some of the remains in Tripoli.
Demonstrations, protests and statements of condemnation of the siege imposed by Israeli Prime Minister Sharon against the Palestinian people continued in condemnation of the attack to which Jenin Camp and the other towns and villages of the West Bank were subject, and of the military blockade on the headquarters of Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat.

It defines corruption as an immoral and prejudicial act in the use of power or position, giving preference to some over others.
On 06/06/1996 the Chamber of Deputies passed the Law Developing the Finance Market and Credit Agreements.
At the time we wrote an article strongly criticizing this arrangement under the title, Call to the Chamber of Deputies for the Moveable Value Collective Investment Organizations Law, which is published in our book "What is New in Lebanese Trade, Banking and Arbitration Laws in Light of Jurisprudence and Ijtihad" on page 63.
The Municipalities Law promulgated under Legislative Decree 118/77 represented a serious and qualitative shift. Senior legal figures, who have been involved in municipal work and helped regulate and head unions, have been involved in it.
It should have read:
This concluded a visit to Lebanon during which preparations were made for the visit to be organized for more than 100 American businessmen of Arab origin next October to Lebanon, to find out about the country and investment areas, and to establish commercial relations with Lebanese businessmen.
Farah then introduced the Lebanese Trade and Information Office, noting that it was "a non-profit making institution for public benefit with headquarters in California, and a full member of the American Chamber of Commerce and of the American International Development Consortium, which plays a fundamental role in assisting the American government to achieve its mission of promoting international development".
Farah said, "Tackling this problem via official channels takes much time. The patient solution lies in establishing mixed Lebanese-American companies in which the American partner applies for a loan for the mixed company and receives it within three weeks at appropriate interest rates.
Farah and Deputy Sakkaf also visited the town of Zahlah - Muallaqah.
1336 engineers voted out of a total of 3032 allowed to vote, i.e. 44%.
There are two pillars to the Beqaa economy, which will only make progress when they are healthy. They are agriculture and the food industry, which complement one another. What ever happens to one is inevitably reflected on the other.
President of the Food Industries Syndicate Atif Idris answered these and other questions saying, "The food and agriculture industries have bee through a very difficult period over the last seven years as a result of illegal competition from the state and development programs.
The arrival of American Secretary of State to the region and his initiating contacts with the leaders of its state as part of a serious attempt to find a settlement to the dispute between Israel and the Palestinian Authority had only limited effect on the activity of the local market, but not on its direction. The same could be said of the calls from more than one regional, international and local party to reduce tension on the southern front and not to give Israel a pretext to expand its war against Palestinians to include Lebanon and even Syria.
Fierce Battle Sees Professional Consideration Triumph Over Political Decision; Al-Bassat Breaches "Al-Hariri List"; New President of Syndicate for Engineers; Long Day.
The results show a notable difference, namely that Al-Bassat penetrated the list of Hamad Fusat Al-Akhir with the five members of his list winning. The results were as follows:
* Branch 7: Lutfi Salum (Baath Party) 2686 votes against 2126 votes for his rival Ibrahim Abu Sawan.
Bashir Abi Akr (Progressive) 2543 votes.
It was also noticed that the "Free Patriotic Current", which took about 1200 votes for Al-Bassat, lost their candidate Abi Aql in Branch 1, as a result of the votes being shared between him and other candidates.
It was a long election day, which began calmly in the morning thanks to the internal security forces, who had deployed at the entrances to the syndicate building in order to guarantee that the election process was sound.
Al-Bassat could not hide his annoyance at the focused political intervention for the benefit of his rival's list, noting that the pressures on votes had led them to be exploited for private benefit and some had been tempted by the promise of work.
"They either want me imprisoned, expelled or dead. I say to them that I will only be a martyr, a martyr, a martyr."
If "Under Siege" started from the circumstances in which Chairman Arafat finds himself, the title, by means of the daily contacts, has come to apply to most Arab leaders, who are now also "under siege".
Film production stopped and the workers who dared to protest at the tyranny were dismissed.
It was difficult to find innovative staff, because a number of professionals had transferred into other areas during the difficult years, or left the country to work in foreign studios, given that the Russian film school has always been appreciated.
According to Shilobriev, Vidov obtained the right to distribute the films, which represent a Russian national heritage, by making a prohibited agreement with the former director of "Soyuzmultfilm" Serge Skulyabin. There is no need to point out that "Soyuzmultfilm" got nothing in return.

He then noted that there was no contradiction between citizenship and membership of a sectarian group provided that the area of common ground was expanded because common action was important.
He concluded by answering the sixth question - what is needed for the future?
The principles of democracy and international human rights, these must be commended. But educating for citizenship drowns in the particular details."
He noted, "The freedom of every person ends where the freedom of the next person begins. If the other's freedom is not respected, there can be no opportunity for a life of freedom. We must also not cast the responsibilities on to others because we are all responsible."
The meeting was attended by the Chairman of the Ecclesiastical Education and Cultural Committee, Archbishop Ghi Bulus Najim, former Director of the Association, Fr. Malik Abu Tanus, Director General of University Pastoral Work at the Holy Spirit University in Al-Kaslik, Fr. Shirbil Kiruz, a group of priests, Dr Antoine Musarrah, Deputy Director of the Association, Marcel Ishaq, and the members.
He noted that many people used the term state in order to throw responsibility on its shoulders.
He continued, "If in reason I am a believer, I cannot abuse the other from another religion because my faith prevents from this, not because I believe in common living."
He continued, "We should not fear the truth. The truth is man.
He believed, "Practical love is that which encourages people to faith. Christianity is full-time citizenship. Christians today, more so than at any other time, are called to live in open Arab citizenship."
He stressed, "Her role has not come to an end with retirement because people like her do not like to live with nothing to do. It is certain that she has more than one option after she leaves this secondary school to continue her mission and open up a new field of production and achievement."
In the face of this crumbling situation there exists a project study prepared by the Municipality of Baalbak to re-establish the garden and an implementation decision to be determined by the contractor, but no one knows the reason for the delay.

Yesterday morning the two leaders held a meeting to examine the possibility of a rapprochement in their stances shortly before the arrival of the Secretary-General.
Denktash is insistent on full sovereignty for each group within a framework of two independent entities, giving a central authority limited powers. The Greek side, by contrast, stresses implementation of the 1977 and 1979 agreements under UN supervision, which provide for the establishment of a federation comprising two groups and two areas.
The possibility of one side joining has seemed more likely recently given the impasse in which the talks between two sides find themselves.
Jewish Lobby in America in Strongest Position; Gains Republican Allies and Widespread Support for Israel.
Congress is moving towards increasing aid to Israel after associations were able to mobilize about one hundred thousand people, some of whom had come great distances, for example from California, to participate in a mass demonstration in support of the Jewish state, which was organized on the 15th of April in front of the headquarters of Congress in Washington.
American Jews represent one of the most powerful and most influential interest groups in the country. Their numbers are estimated at between four and six million in the United States, the population of which is reckoned at about 280 million people.

An opinion survey conducted by the "Gallop" institute has shown a slight increase in the number who believe that the United States should support Israel, although the total number of such people is no more than 25%.
Secondly, there are the conservative religious republicans, who from a substantial political force. They have joined some democrats and AIPAC in stressing that the Bush should not put pressure on Sharon.
President of the American Arab Institute James Zughbi notes encouraging trends for the pressure groups that it represents. He notes that 82 members of Congress voted against the decision supporting Israel, which is a record, and that 35 members of the chamber criticized the lack of balance in the decision.
In an interview with the Saudi Okaz newspaper he dealt with his first meeting with Bush last month saying, "I saw a completely different man to the one I had imagined prior to my meeting him, in fact he was not what I was expecting at all. He has human feelings, he listens, discusses and talks cogently, but he was not wholly aware of the reality of conditions in the region, especially the conditions of the Palestinian people."
Asked about Bush's response he replied, "I saw in his eyes surprise and astonishment as well as deep sadness after he was shown these terrible and upsetting pictures."
Prince Abdallah was asked about bilateral relations between the two countries. He answered that he had not wished to discuss this matter but that Bush had himself raised it. "He told me that the Saudi people harbored feelings of hatred against me (...) I told him that this was the case with all peoples of the world."

Hours before the meeting of the American Deputy Secretary of State for South Asia, Christina Roca, and Indian officials including Minister Foreign Affairs Jaswant Singh, whilst she was in New Delhi on Tuesday as part of efforts to avoid another war between the nuclear enemies of India and Pakistan, armed men, believed to be Islamic extremists, mounted an attack on a military barracks in the Indian-controlled region of Kashmir. 30 civilians and soldiers were killed in an exchange of fire, including the three attackers
The army detained three Palestinians in the attack, which continued for several hours.
He added, "We have many appropriate and safe dedicated reception centers."
He said, "We must turn directly to the final solution" because that is the only way to push the Israelis and Palestinians to commit to the political process and end the crisis.
He believed, "The ending of the violence requires a solution to the dispute not for it to be managed. This, in turn, requires that we focus on final solutions and peace principles". For this reason, "What is required is a detailed timetable and plan of action to restore hope and turn it into reality."
The Algerian news agency (WAJ) has quoted the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs as saying that the summit of the Arab North African Federation, which includes Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Mauritania, will be held on the 21st and 22nd of June in the Algerian capital.

About 50 Egyptian women assembled near the Israeli embassy in Cairo, seeking the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador.
He said, "If this comes into effect, this will paralyze the activities of our organization and will have a major impact on all agencies working in the Occupied Territories."
He added, "My policy is one of unity.
However, Reuters asked Khatimi whether prominent conservative relatives had held unofficial talks with American officials. He responded, "No, I do not believe something like this has happened (...) our relations with the United States are always characterized by bitterness (...) America is responsible for that."
But it appears that the legal authorities, which are dominated by conservatives, withdrew this permission.
The United States' Ambassador to Thailand, Darryl Johnson, said at the ceremony of the start of the maneuvers at the Utaphao Sea and Air Base that these maneuvers include counter-terrorist training for the first time.

Mahathir was an eloquent critic of the West a few years ago.
In Washington Indonesian Minister of Defense Matori Abdul Djalil confirmed that Indonesia would not allow the deployment of American forces on its territory to help combat terror. But it was keen to repair military relations, which were cut in 1999.
Rumsfield said that human rights violations had led to these restrictions and "we now believe that it is time to reform them fundamentally".
In a defense submitted by her to the Jordanian State Security Court yesterday, former member of the Jordanian Chamber of Deputies Toujan Faisal criticized Jordanian Prime Minister Ali Abu Al-Ragheb and accused him of "distorting Jordan's image at home and abroad" and confirmed that he had offered her "a bribe in return for her stopping the criticism directed against him" in the sitting preceding the ruling in this case, which will be announced tomorrow.
Faisal has been on trial since the 16th of last April for criticisms she directed at the government via the Qatari Aljazeera satellite channel and e-mail. She called on King Abdallah II bin Al-Hussein last March to dismiss the government and accused it of corruption.
In testimony given before the court at the beginning of this month, Former Jordanian Prime Minister Abd Al-Karim Al-Kabariti believed, "What Toujan has brought before the court amounts to constructive criticism - it should not be counted as an insult to, attack on or distortion of Jordan's reputation."
She explained that she had resorted to making statements to the satellite channels and over the Internet because she was banned from writing in the Jordan press.
Following the difference of opinion between him and the American administration in respect of the American accusations that Cuba is trying to acquire biological weapons, which Washington reiterated yesterday, former American President Jimmy Carter found himself contradicting Cuban leader Fidel Castro in terms of the concept of democracy and human rights.
He noted that the "Carter Center", which is based in Atlanta, "helps (countries) to conduct fair and just elections" and that "Americans are proud of their freedom, which allows them to criticize the government and to change it when they believe it necessary by voting against it."
He added, "Cuba is striving to achieve this dream with justice, true freedom, true democracy and true human rights."
He hinted that the American administration had tried to complicate his visit by means of the accusations made in this respect, saying, "These accusations were made, and perhaps it is no coincidence that they were made immediately before my visit to Cuba."

49% of Americans expressed a desire to lift the restriction imposed on traveling to Cuba, compared with 45% who opposed it.
Nor is it a mistake when, in response, we reject the logic that sees in the results of the Intifada a catastrophe by all standards.
There is no economic facility that can stand on its own two feet.
The army has seen no major divisions.
But the purely security treatments have proven to be fruitless.
But Islamic-Christian unity in Palestine has been consolidated.
Secondly, we need a new Palestinian Charter, one which defines the phased program for the struggle: Israeli withdrawal to the borders of 4 June 1967, the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with its capital in East Jerusalem, establishment of the right to return and the dismantling of settlements.
If the call to "reform" the Authority comes from the American administration, and for its own aims, this does not mean that no reforms should be carried out, in fear of being seen to submit to "American pressures".
But Palestine has entered the world's heart.
...Even the Opposition!
Thus the religious authorities driving in this direction, albeit with good intent, expose the oppositionist camp with their provision to some of its wings, to a dangerous error, one that cannot be tolerated.
What applies to oppositionists who lie under the roof of the "Qarnat Shahwan Forum" applies equally to more fundamental oppositionists, such as Brigadier Michel Aun.
For principles are not to be played with except in light of major changes that permit a review.
In no case can the opposition agree on major principles and then drop them for a by-election battle, for if they do the meaning and purpose of this battle will be lost as a result of selfish and self-centered passions.
Men of Religion and the Government.
But what Al-Mirza Al-Shirazi did was the first public clash.
In fact the legitimacy of the political authority was, to a great extent, linked to the support of men of religion and their backing of it.
However the revolution in February 1979 embodied the rise of those calling for the establishment of Islamic government. A republican regime was established based on the clerics and supervised by a religious authority known as the Al-Wali Al-Faqih, which increased radiance of this group and thereby raised their social standing and the respect offered them by the majority.
For he could not remain as he was and nor were the people prepared to forgive him when he slipped up.
A Horizon Narrows and a Circle Widens.
In turn, Abu Mazin, the number two in the Liberation Organization and in power, called for immediate and urgent reforms to the political and administrative structures.
In politics there are many possibilities and the facts are complex.
Any time, no matter how hard or cruel, is fit to put an end to internal corruption because it is the most destructive and dangerous enemy.
His previous trials and tribulations were with Israel, America, the Arabs and Arab interactions. Now, however, he is confronting his leadership.
The historical leader found that two years of maltreatment, genocide and Sharon had attracted the people to Hamas and the notion of salvation by means of more death and more destruction.
Given that Arafat is the one central figure in the issue, it is natural that the movement of general Palestinian feeling should be reflected in his breast.
"Hamas" and "Jihad" had more than 10% in the past and Arafat retains more than 20% now, because such a figure would mean a coup.
The situation is also that no one can say the words of condolence over the rubble of Jenin, even if it is the "old man", who appeared for the first time on the tour of Palestine truly to have a head of grey hair.
Legal sources reported that the chamber will not take any decision on this matter before a month, under a controversial law promulgated in 1993 which allows Belgian courts to examine cases against foreigners accused of violating human rights wherever they occurred.
Over the last ten months the lawyers have tried to persuade the Belgian court that the criminal investigation against Sharon must proceed to his role in the massacre.
He added, "Belgium did not have competence.
The debate today will center on the extent to which the decision of the Court of Justice in the case of the Congolese minister applies in the case of the Israeli Prime Minister.

Patriarch Abd Al-Ahad gave a speech in which he said, "Your presence here, if it is evidence of something, then it is evidence of a popular and official Arab stance with the Palestinian issue. The Arabs have never been united and spoken with one voice as they have been united by the Palestinian issue. The Palestinian issue has several aspects: political, social, civilization, humanitarian and religious.
I did all of this feeling that I was fulfilling a patriotic and religious duty."
The appointment of a committee to examine legal matters comprising people of knowledge and inhabitants of the House of Justice, which forms the basis of government, has been announced.
I do not excuse the ignorance of the ignorant, but I stress the crime of the criminal perpetrators and instigators, who drag the people to criminality and war "who make them carry heavy loads, which they do not touch with their fingertips".
The people are peaceable.
Despite the explicitness of the provisions that created just one judiciary, one that does not need the present number.
The expression "take measures" is explicit in meaning. It does not in any sense mean that provisions should be passed "in the name of the Lebanese people" as happens today.
..."The judge in whose competency the basis of dispute lies...".
Article 580 is explicit. It requires that an urgent measure be taken in commercial cases by an individual judge competent in commercial cases.
Article 589 confirms verbatim as follows:
Both articles confirm that the competent judge in the two cases is one in whose competence the basis of the dispute lies.
And the urgent judiciary, which violates the principles, is absorbing a large number of judges.
5- Compliance with the text of Article 580, which establishes one judiciary, corrects the error, secures justice, and make the present number of judges excess, not a shortfall, may God lengthen your lives.
The Palestinian Liberation Organization called for a general strike today and for participation in a central political festival at Al-Rashidiyyah Camp.
Marches set out in the Ain Al-Hilwah Camp in Sidon and there were calls for a strike.
During their regular meeting, which was held at the Hizbollah Offices in Baalbak, the Lebanese parties discussed various political developments and "contemplated the 54th anniversary of the rape of Palestine". They confirmed, "The option of resistance and Intifada that many of the Palestinian forces have adopted practically is the only option capable of recovering Palestine and liberating the land and the people."
Foreign Ministry Discusses Challenges to Peace Facing Work of Arab Initiative Committee.
He believed, "There is a need for caution and suspicion, indeed rejection of the invitation promoted by the international sponsor, the United States of America, especially, and the Russian Federation, the United Nations and European Union to hold a special international conference in the Middle East, because holding such a conference will lead inevitably to revocation of the authority of the Madrid Conference, which is based on the formula of land for peace and implementation of Security Council resolutions 242, 338 and 425."
However this does not bind Israel after the decision taken unanimously by the Likud block to reject the establishment of a Palestinian state."
- The draft law laid down in Decree number 6364 to join the Treaty of Cooperation on Patents held in Washington on 19 June 1970 amended in 1979 and 1984, and the executive regulations thereto as amended on 01/10/1997.

He said that in relation to production "the differences with the companies on the operation of steam complexes at the Dir Ammar and Al-Zahrani plants have been dealt with" but "there still remain some obstacles facing implementation of the works for completion of the networks."
He said, "Sealing of meters has started to prevent interference. 80 thousand meters have been sealed in Beirut and the suburbs of Al-Shiyah and Antilias, and 5000 in Juniah.
He stated that the Financial Prosecutor General has confirmed that immediate prosecution has begun for reports referred to him and that a representative of the internal security forces has shown the response of the security forces in following up collection work.

There is interference and some of this interference is technical.
The Director General for Lebanon Electricity, Kamal Al-Hayik, had promised during the session that rationing would end in Al-Minyah and its environs and in Tripoli at the end of this month after completion of inspections of the main Al-Minyah 20 kilovolt transformer and the Tripoli 66 kilovolt transformer.

Mukhaibar conducted a series of other consultations with some prominent people in the area and met in the afternoon with the leader of the Free Patriots Party, Duri Shimun.
He added, "Despite the Ministry of the Interior being neutral there are some agencies in the government interfering."
He asked, "For whom should I withdraw?
"Christian Unions": Disappearance of Airani Serious Setback for Credibility of State.
1 - "The Federation dealt with the dispute that broke out among those in power against the background of the privatization issue starting with the matter of the cell phone. Despite the way out that was found, it believes that it is a dangerous indicator, one that does not give much cause for optimism, if the institutional rules on which the state should be based are not respected.
3- Recently, there have been worrying developments on the security front, which have attracted the attention of the Lebanese. They include the issue of the disappearance of Engineer Ramzi Airani, which recalls the kidnappings that dominated a black stage in the history of their country and one that cost them much.
Kidnapping is prohibited, as are unjustified detentions and arrests, The opening of cases such as that of Kafr Ubaida gives the impression that the war file is still with us, at least for some Lebanese, and this we forcefully reject.
This is one circumstance of the stage following Arafat's liberation from his siege, which leaves him facing two dangers: the permanent Israeli danger and the immediate "Palestinian danger" arising from the complications of the past cruel weeks.
Through his excessive flirtation with the Jewish election balance, Bush hopes to gain control with a clear majority over the Councils of Deputies and Senators, thereby completing the mission of his victory of the executive (the White House) and the legislative (the Congress).
But "Israeli-style democracy" puts the fate of the establishment of the Palestinian state in the electoral auction, and would refuse to do otherwise. Sharon and Netanyahu compete in terms of who holds the greatest contempt for the Palestinians and the Arabs. It is not a competition for equality or how to achieve it - it is an escalation that is pivotal and provides the criteria.
Perhaps there may be more resolutions in the future.
It is not sufficient for Israel to say that it will not seek to try them. There is something more dangerous than that, namely to leave them as prey to Israeli eyes spread throughout the world.
No matter how the two slogans differ in terms of technique and policy, the aim is one.
Situation in South Worries Anan Because It Is Fragile and Could Flare Up.
They added that despite the substantial reduction in tension compared with levels prior to the visit of US Secretary-General Colin Powell to the region, anxiety continues to dominate de Mistura and the staff of the international force command, on account of the daily provocation engaged in by Israel from time to time, with its violation of Lebanese airspace and sovereignty.
Lebanon also protested about the continuing and provocative Israeli violation of airspace to the same command.
However, one of the international officers responded sarcastically, asking whether Hizbollah elements were deployed in Beirut, Al-Shuf, the north and Al-Matan.
Ministry of Information: We Received Blow, Looking For Way Out; Vacancies in Civil Service Paralyze Administration; "Cell Phone Calm" May Produce Appointments Soon; Ministry of Information.
This point was a matter of discussion in the last session of the Council of Ministers derived from known facts raised and they were followed by a detailed reply from the President of the Republic Emil Lahud.
In the Civil Service Council there is a vacant Maronite position and a proxy member (Orthodox) to the President naturally.
Sources in the Civil Service speak of thousands of transactions held up as a result of the current situation.
Ministry circles speak about "a blow" sustained because of this situation; however, they point on the contrary side to the fact that a search is underway for administrative - financial solutions to legitimize the position in the event that the anticipated appointments to the Civil Service are delayed.
Based on prepared tables, it is clear that a hundred of those who have so far been transferred to the surplus list have not been distributed among the ministries.
It is reported that the Civil Service Council has expressed no negativity towards the move.
Today, we bring to the attention of Beirut's excellent Municipal Council that a large hole has appeared on the pavement parallel to the Ministries of Tourism and Media, to hold a parasol for the traffic police. The parasol was put up more than 25 days ago but the debris from the hole still covers the pavement parallel to the glass structure where exhibitions and celebrations are held.
An area of low pressure dominated the area. It was accompanied by cold air blocs that changed into storms and rain in the different areas surrounding the Mediterranean.
The speed of surface winds in Lebanon will today reach 50km. The expected temperature on the coast is 16-22 degrees and in the mountains from 9-14 degrees, as in the Beqaa.
As a result of the works to prepare the road, which is 35 km long, to the Sir-Al-Safirah road, which extends for tens of kilometers.
The lady supervising the landscaping and planting, Eng. Ghanwah Al-Aris Zantut, representative from the "Jinico" company, noted that about 100 palm trees were being planted along the two pavements of the boulevard, in addition to 55 mullein, cypress and pine trees in Al-Wastiyyah.
Azar was quoted as being prepared to follow up the matter with those concerned in the government, calling on the heads of municipalities to move towards the executive authority, which will take the decision to dispense the municipality dues.
Syndicate Head Baalbaki thanked the Al-Damur Municipal Council in the persons of Mr. Ghafri and Mr. Aql for this initiative, hoping that the project would be completed at the earliest opportunity.
As a result of the works to prepare the road, which is 35 km long, to the Sir-Al-Safirah road, which extends for tens of kilometers.
If the work continues like this.
Instead of preparations, a large part of the road, and at various points, have been turned into some sort of planted fields on which citizens break their cars every day."
- The contractor should be forced to abide by the schedule signed on 30/03/2002, which requires that the works of the first section (up to Irdah) be completed on 30/04/2002, up to Kafrhabbu by 30/05/2002 and up to Bakhuan by 30/06/20002. Of course this is unlikely for one reason, namely that the contractor has not made available the equipment and machinery necessary to carry out his commitments.
- Remove the direct and indirect corrupt controllers and their political cover over the project, because the company, when faced with every crisis, fears resorting to the security forces and prefers material approaches, which imposes on the project major additional burdens that affect the quality and period of implementation.
The slogan of some officials is "Starve your dog and he'll follow you". This is a clear fact, for no project is implemented unless the people of the regions crawl to the important officials first.
Merchants and vegetable shop owners in the area of Ain Al-Ramanah have complained of roaming vendors, who stand at the doors of their shops and take their livelihood. They asked, who is responsible, especially given that they are not allowed to wander through the streets?

Beirut 29 April 2002.
The President of the Republic won in media terms (but not politically or "economically").
The recent second installment of Dr Huda Rizq's study of the relationship between the state and the Lebanese university (Social Sciences Institute Model):
During the war the militias exercised their authority over the branches on issues of appointment and acceptance. The branches in the regions also reflected the balance of political powers prevalent there.
The process of branches has increased costs; for example the leasing of university buildings, in addition to the loss of service offered to students and the absence of university grants, poor capacities and the failure to equip libraries, etc...
It announced that the workers and employees are standing beside the new management, in order to make the rescue and development plan a success, which will have a positive effect on the continuation of the Organization and will guarantee work for those employed in it.
Having examined the reasons for the two aforementioned decisions.
Whereas the specified decision of the Council of Ministers number 4 introduces a burden on the utility that was not originally present in return for very small contributions from those no longer in service.
Whereas the result of the meeting of his Excellency the Prime Minister and His Excellency the Minister of Energy and Water dated 12/05/2002 has led to approval for the opening of the required credit in full and the provision of medical care and treatment to the employees of the utility in service and those no longer in service, until such time as the subject is reviewed by the Council of Ministers, on the basis of its decision number 25, dated 27/09/2001, and the Voluntary Social Security Law for Elderly Lebanese in the National Social Security Fund shall enter into effect.
Minister of Public Works and Transport Najib Miqati and his Syrian counterpart Makram Ubaid signed two agreements for cooperation between the ports of Beirut and Al-Ladhiqiyyah and the ports of Tripoli and Tartus. They discussed technical, economic and commercial cooperation and coordination in the exchange of information, studying ways to make these ports capable of competing with those of neighboring countries.
Miqati said, "Our visit to Tartus and Al-Ladhiqiyyah is part of a series of meetings to develop transport arteries.
Jordanian Minister of Transport Nadir Al-Dhahabi attended part of the signing.
The Jordanian Minister said, "Our permanent aim is to achieve integration between our countries and not competition."
At the end of the visit, Miqati, Ubaid, Al-Dhahabi and Khuri visited Al-Qardahah where they laid wreathes of flowers on the tomb of late President Hafiz Al-Asad. They read the fatihah over his tomb and that of Maj. Basil Al-Asad.
He explained that the campaign, which began yesterday, would continue until the end of next September and includes the distribution of about 290 thousand Visa cards through the banks, 50 thousand of them to be distributed in Lebanon with the remainder to be distributed elsewhere in the region, thus targeting tourists who have high spending power that allows them to travel and spend in the tourist destination country.
He noted that Visa International expects, by launching this campaign, to increase the spending of Visa card-carrying visitors to Lebanon by 25% during this year.
He drew on Visa International statistics, noting that travelers around the world prefer to use Visa cards to pay instead of cash "and this trend has reached many countries of the Middle East as well".
Banking Business Horizons Conference in Syria: Banking Reform Part of Administrative Reform, Legislation Must Include Protection for Deposits.
The discussions, which focused on a number of subjects put forward in banking work, were tantamount to recommendations, especially given that they dealt with delicate issues directly. They believed that banking reform in Syria was part of a large and more comprehensive process, which included reform of the administration and other production sectors.
- Interest rates in Syria and the possible options in this respect: Should the Central Bank set them in an inflexible way?
- The obstacles confronting the development of the banking sector in Syria and the legislation and regulations required by it, especially given that the reform process cannot be limited to one sector because banking reforms form part of a larger and more comprehensive process, which includes the reform of the administration and the rest of the economic sectors.
- The submission of monetary authorities in Arab states to the authorities of the Ministries of Finance or Economy, which results in a lack of independence on the part of the Central Banks and weakens their role in pursuing and determining a monetary policy, the role which the Central Banks are supposed to play to increase the effectiveness of the banking sector to finance the requirements of the economy, secure competition between the banks and offer advice to the government on the liberalization of the economy and financial and monetary procedures.
- The experiments of Islamic and investment banks and the relationship between them and commercial companies and banks.
The author has been invited to literary seminars in Geneva, Laussanne, Berne and Zurich for the occasion.
This movement is an original Lebanese phenomenon, which had lessened over the past decades, but returned to its peak during the war.
The translator believes that a rapid review of the development of Arabic literature in general since the Second World War will help us "categorize" the works of Hasan Daud, which have a special pathological concern.
The translation explains that these examples of change dominated the Arab world generally, but Egypt and Lebanon in particular.
From time to time successive activities surface in the city, and invitations to exhibitions, lectures and films increase.
As soon as I enter I feel that I have once again met Shahfah, whose workshop I visited in Montreal.
Robert Munsif wrote in Montreal about Joseph Shahfah, "A fabric that hints, an elegant body at the beginning and end of places, at the end and beginning of the seasons.
A look above to seek spiritual inspiration according to what is expected in this instance, but what surrounds us and is before our eyes denies such existence and underlines the material nature of things and their complete separation from the spiritual plane.
Joint exhibitions do not usually create the impression of being new or serious.
They are not all of the same standard. Our attention was grabbed by the miniature pictures, stuck on wood, with projecting faces beneath thick and thin lines, scattered by red spots giving them their warm life, especially as an elegant script had delineated some of the areas forming the depth of the white space, waiting futilely for an audience that had not come.
Rita Aun does not stop simplifying this flourishing, naked body, returning to some childhood, standing on two legs extending to almost swallow up the body.
We do not know why Hussein Madi became involved in an exhibition that appears to be for young artists or why Ghufdir exhibited what was previously shown at the "Alice Maghabghab Gallery"! Nor was there anything new from Jan Mark Nahhas.
At no time and for no race has empire been absent from the religious text. Prophets and the metaphysical example they represent have criticized the example of power represented in the most powerful state.
Whether Rome, the Pharaohs or the Persians - they are met by an idealized religious awareness that substitutes material power for spiritual strength, the worship of the individual with that of God, the East with the West!
This was all due to the tyranny that characterized the power of the state, although the cover was the propagation of religion or something similar.
The terrible structural error committed by the Arabs was that they viewed the Ottoman occupation of their countries as a conquest. For just as they occupied Spain under the cover of the propagation of religion, they also believed that the Ottoman occupation constituted protection for their religion. This occupation continued for over four centuries.
The meaning is the same, whether one is propagating a religion or a pack of cigarettes. But the key problem is the message.
The second relationship with the West, the broad relationship, is the individual trend represented by people who were original religiously educated (Al-Afghani, Muhammad Abduh, and the many others as is well known) and others with the entry of the nineteenth century.
Great slogans and great literature from the whole West, all of Rome.
How can some come and think that not buying a packet of cigarettes, a pair of jeans or some type of food is a good way of dealing with Rome/America?
Everyone dreams of power, of empire.
Only the prophets can deal well with Rome...
At this meeting we can only welcome with pleasure the members of the Beiteddine Festivals Committee, at the forefront of whom stands Mrs. Nura Junbalat, head of the festival.
Nura Junbalat then spoke about the program of the Beiteddine festival and the nine performances.
A combination of piano, lute, drums and singing, making a warm atmosphere and reflecting a new dimension to his art.
On this night Zakir and Laswell will also join Ustad Sultan Khan and Karsh Kale, in addition to guests specializing in electronic music, alongside Iranian singer Susan Dehim.
On the first of August: Africa will enter the festival via " Youssou N'Dour ", the artist who has innovated a new African style.
Whilst we believe in the candor of the positions adopted by Honorable Deputy Najah Wakim on Arab issues, nevertheless negative actions will not serve us, nor will they dissuade the Americans from supporting Israel. So let us look to more beneficial actions towards them, especially in the wake of 11 September and their views on the Arabs and Muslims.
The prevailing belief on the part of the ordinary American, which has distorted his mind, is the propaganda that Israel is the most civilized and democratic state in the Middle East, and they empathize with it on this basis.
Even that Syrian lady who threw the American consul out of her restaurant, had she taken the opportunity and invited him, gathered the visitors of her restaurant about him to express their vexation at the policy of his government, then her position would have been stronger and more powerful.
We must not leave any means, but use it with all the capacities that we possess.
Marguerite Yourcenar: Last Journey Major Event in Francophone Year.
The meeting was opened by Alan Fukih, cultural advisor to the French Embassy, who said, "The photographs are of prime importance in the Francophone Year of 2002.
Fareer was then given the opportunity to speak. He started his speech with a glance at Beirut where he had just arrived, but he still felt hospitality, a welcome and warmth immediately.
"In 1968 I left Rio de Janeiro and traveled to Paris.
And with every artist or sculptor or author it was as if through my pictures I were drawing a book of life."
During my first meeting with her she asked me: "Mr. Farrer, where are you from?"
We did not speak about literature, even though I was in front of a major writer with her unique status.
In 1988 I had to meet her at the beginning of the year in a hotel in New Delhi, her station before she went to Nepal, but she died on the 17th of December."
She refused not to pay me the small sum.
"It includes 32 pictures and was welcomed for the first time by the Pompidou Center in Paris where it was visited by five hundred thousand people.
Book Exhibition in Al-Batrun; Al-Sharaa Intellectual Forum; "Jubail in History" Exhibition.
He insisted that a country that does not concern itself with culture and does not encourage the educated is no longer to be reckoned a nation accepted among the nations.
After the national anthem, Head of Jubail Municipality Rafail Safir made a speech in which he noted the importance of the historic city of Jubail, its artistic heritage and the need to maintain and develop it in line with Jubail's classification as a world heritage site.

The Faculty of Public Health at the Lebanese University has issued an invitation to the Sixth Celebration to hand over certificates to graduates at 4 pm, the 2nd of June, at the UNESCO Palace.
It also issued an invitation to meet the Amnesty International Organization and the United Nations on their activities and objectives, including a display of a number of photocopied documents and a video film, at one pm on Thursday, the 16th of June, at the university.
The exiles responded with one voice, "No matter how beautiful the country to which we are being exiled, nothing will compensate us for the homeland."
Perhaps history is repeating itself and confirming the link between the catastrophe of the Lebanese and Palestinian peoples.
It is the "Hotel of Lebanon" and the Lebanese.
A large number of Lebanese used to resort to it to take refuge from the fatigue of travel before leaving for the countries of the world. It was also a waiting stop for those returning by steamship to the homeland.
If the "Flamingo" Hotel was a place of temporary residence, the "Terrace" restaurant opposite "Scotch Corner" was the venue for discussions, meetings, contacts, thought and planning for the future. The great question was:
What is this distinguishing mark?
"Good trip to Lebanon" was the last phrase I heard from one of the Flamingo's staff in the summer of 1994, saying goodbye and waving his hand.
Wales beat Germany 1-0 (first half 0-0) with Robert Earnshaw scoring in the 46th minute in an international football friendly game between the two sides conducted yesterday at the "Millennium" stadium in Cardiff as part of the preparations of the German national side for the 17th World Cup finals. 35 thousand spectators attended.

He consulted a specialist in Belgium on Monday and the X-ray confirmed that he needs an operation, which will be conducted at a later time this week.
Wenger, aged 52, who took over at Arsenal in 1998, and led it in his first season to a similar achievement, was selected by "Barclaycard", the company sponsoring the English league and the Association of League Team Coaches.
Since George Bush declared on the 4th of last April his vision for the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel as the only point of entry for settlement in the Middle East, many await an objective translation to implement this vision in the form of a solution, when Ariel Sharon is bent not only on destroying Palestinian towns but on destroying that vision specifically.
Thus, as Powell announced a few days ago that it was certain that there would be an "international conference" to study the establishment of a temporary (!) Palestinian state as a step towards the establishment of a Palestinian state, Ari Fleischer, spokesman for the White House, hurried to clarify that this was not an American proposal but one of many ideas being discussed between Bush and the leaders of the region whom he had visited.
There is nothing to clarify this. There is nothing in the history of establishing states, nor in the history of international law, that can offer an answer to this nonsense.
Despite the fact that the translation available to date of Bush's vision for the Palestinian state, recalls the story "What wonders I saw in Aleppo", the refusal comes not from the Palestinians, which would be understandable, but from Sharon as well, who does not want them to see the state even in their dreams... or in the American nightmares!
There is no need to advise a careful person.
Such a situation means that any communications with Israel regarding the settlement are paralyzed for at least six months, during which time it will be pre-occupied with the Likud and Labor party elections and then the general elections.
However, with the restrictions imposed by the two dates, the one fixed and the other probable, and with the contradictions we have seen in Washington in recent days - such that Sharon will come out of his meeting with Bush very relaxed, indeed victorious, and the Saudi Foreign Minister, Saud Al-Faisal, will come out of the meeting also "very happy" with what he has heard - caution against the content of the anticipated Bush plan and the possibility of implementing it increases.
Opinion is unanimous to call on the Christian churches in Lebanon, Catholic and non-Catholic, not to show any leniency in the face of the disease of alleged fundamentalism, and take severe and speedy action to combat it by all means of awareness, enlightenment and explanation of the dangers of this disease.
It was clearly apparent that there was negligence on the part of elements of the internal security forces who were engaged to protect Bishop Haddad. The police command suspended ten persons last night as a procedural arrangement.
A declaration was issued by a large number of prominent figures including members of the Supreme Council of the Roman Catholic sect and members of the "Qarnat Shahwan Forum" and independent figures who considered that the perpetration of the crime witnessed by a number of security personnel "was more painful and abhorrent than a crime" and they were appalled by "the appearance of new sick personalities in our society, which knows only tolerance and a recognition of others".
They condemned the incident and called for "the spirit of love to overcome every violent action".
Of course, it is the duty of the victor not to think that this victory in itself represents the desired goal.
Qablan: Existing Treatments Do Not Reassure; Fadlallah: Poisoned Policy Threatens Country.
In his sermon scholar Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah said, "Following agreement between officials to stop vehicles running on gas oil, the people are left to ask about the political consensus which must be followed by an economic plan to tackle the many problems. It is insufficient to say that they shouldn't pollute the air in Lebanon, above the capital to be specific, because most pollution lies in the political climate that encompasses everything and which has begun to threaten the fate of the country.
Following Cancellation of Serbian Presidential Elections, Kostunica Vows to Defeat Djindic and Next Round on December 5
Kostunica and Djindic had formed an alliance that led to the overthrow of Milosevic from power in 2000. However, they rapidly turned against each other because of disagreement over a number of issues, among which was how quickly reforms should occur.
On the other hand, Djindic believed that election problems will not worsen the political situation in the country, stating that citizens have lost interest in politics. He emphasized, "There is no crisis. (...) The elections are no more than a natural assessment of our political background, not more than that."
The lasting dispute between Kostunica and Djindic has led to slowing reform in Serbia, which has been impoverished by ten years of Milosevic's rule.

League Chairman Miyan Muhammad Zahir stated, "We are willing to form a coalition government with the United Action Front, but we are keeping all options open."
In a press conference he held in Islamabad, he said, "We do not need U.S. support."
"We will show flexibility and will take all necessary measures for the benefit of the nation."
The U.S. embassy in Islamabad stated that the exercises, which are titled "Driving Force Maneuver" will focus on light weapons exercises and small units tactics. They will last for three weeks.
Meanwhile, chances of forming a coalition government between the opposition Conference Party and the Democratic People's Party in the Indian sector of Kashmir have vanished following a dispute between the leaders of the two parties, who disagreed on who would assume presidency of the province and whether talks should be held with separatist Islamists.
Senior officials in the National Conference, including the conference's leader Umar Abd-Allah, lost their seats.
The Turkish Minister of Defense Sabahattin Cakmakoglu announced yesterday that Turkey intends to establish a "security zone" in northern Iraq to safeguard the security of its borders in case an American military operation is launched against Iraq.
"If we find it necessary, we will use a show of force and will intervene if the situation demands such action."
Ankara has recently expressed concerns that American military intervention in Iraq might result in establishing an independent Kurdish state in the north of that country.
Anti-U.S. feelings burst out in anger at yesterday's electoral meeting held by Ecevit for the Democratic Left Party in the city of Qaris in northwest Turkey. The meeting turned into an event to protest the war and to condemn U.S. policy.
"We want them to hear from where they are on the Atlantic shores, 'No to war.'"
Repeated Objection to Any Single Action; Tehran Denounces American Plans to Appoint American Ruler in Iraq
He stressed the importance of the role that must be assumed by the U.N. in such issues. He also highlighted the necessity of working toward protecting Iraq's territorial integrity and sovereignty and respecting the decision of international legitimacy.
He mentioned that Tehran "informed British Foreign Minister Jack Straw (during his visit to Tehran on October 9) that Iran is against war. (...) But at the same time we would like to ensure that Iraq does not possess chemical or biological weapons, or any other WMDs." Approximately one hundred thousand Iranian soldiers were attacked with Iraqi chemical weapons during the Iran-Iraq war from 1980 to 1988.
Encouraging Talks in Ukraine; Kuchma Denies Radar Sale to Iraq
Yesterday, Kuchma reconfirmed to the independent Russian news agency Interfax that he did not transfer such advanced technology to Iraq. He said, "Ukraine totally denies the transfer of any military technologies to Iraq. (...) Ukraine denies the accusations against it."
Ukraine officials had confirmed that they can identify the destination of every single Kolchuga system sold previously. They said that three Kolchuga systems are operational in Ethiopia, while the fourth is reserved for "a major country that is not subject to U.N. sanctions."
The U.S. State Department confirmed that it has verified the tapes recorded by Kuchma's personal guard Mikola Melenitcinco two years ago, in which the Ukrainian president approved the sale of the performance system to Iraq.
In an article published in the Indian "Statesman" newspaper, he said that the war will not benefit the U.S. economy.
A source close to the investigations of the explosion of the giant French oil tanker "Limpor," which is most likely to be deliberate, reported that French and American investigators continued their search on board the vessel yesterday.
French authorities in Paris confirmed that traces of TNT and glass fibers belonging to a small boat were identified on the tanker's body.
He added that the body was found 80 kilometers offshore.
He reported that he took the piece from the vessel.
One of their Bulgarian colleagues was killed in the blast.
Major and Minor Issues
We might not wait long to see a nuclear weapon used in future regional conflicts.
The formula that was happily used by Arabs in past years, which was based on exchanging tension in Iraq with calmness and settlements in Palestine, has been replaced by another policy based on striking both Iraq and Palestine.
To us, protecting our neck means maintaining a calm, internal political scene, featuring maximum political harmony even between parties that disagree with each other.
20 Films Competing in Cairo Film Festival; Actors and Actresses Will be Honored; Egypt Will be Honored
In this Festival Round, tribute will be paid to a group of international actors and actresses, including British actress Vanessa Redgrave. Redgrave will hold a press conference in Cairo.
A review of African films, including a show of eight films produced between 1990 and 1999, will be held. A special documentary "Nisaa Khalfa al Camera" will be shown. The documentary reviews films that dealt with women's issues around the world.
"The Red Dragon" film starring British actor Anthony Hopkins brushed aside a large number of new films and remained on top of most profitable films list in North America. Meanwhile, it was confirmed that Madonna's film "Swept Away" is out of the competition.
The action movie "The Carrier" starring British actor Jason Stanley was ranked fourth, generating USD 9.7 million in the first days of release.
It broke the previous record estimated at 5.68 million Euros earned by "Lord of the Rings."
The movie will be shown in American movie theaters during Christmas.
He also challenged them, saying, "Change the tyrannical regime that is leading you from one failure to another and from one tragedy to another."
It is true that since Bush's invitation to Sharon was announced, it is being said that the American President will exercise pressure on his guest to avoid doing anything that might escalate the Palestinian position at a time when the U.S. is close to starting its military campaign against Iraq.
One of the fundamentals of Bush's policy in justifying Sharon's violations of his commitments is to say that Israel is defending itself, and that it has the right to do so.
Everything he does falls under the statement he made one day, that he is continuing the war of 1948.
So what about now, at a time when Bush and Sharon are power twins?
This came in a statement issued by Abi-Nasr yesterday. He was responding to Junbulat, who was interviewed by the Lebanese newspaper "al-Nahar" last Friday and who accused Abi-Nasr of "racism," because of his position regarding the issue of granting Lebanese citizenship.
"We did not want to reopen the issues of the past. But the excessive denial of the truth hurts the dignity of the Lebanese people. It was more appropriate for Mr. Junbulat to think before launching false accusations in his recent interview with "Al-Nahar" newspaper on Friday, 10/11/2002."
"He was never ashamed to describe himself as one of the imperialists who suck up people's money. Perhaps he was counting on people to forgive those who confess their sins."
"that accepts only their sacred right of return?"
"We enjoy neither the gift of carrying the socialist standard while teaming up with American capitalism nor the talent of practicing feudalism while calling for social justice."
"We do not have the talent to claim to care for homeland sovereignty while publicly calling for sharing it with others."
This is what French diplomat and journalist Eric Rolo tried to answer in his talk titled "American Strategy in the Middle East" at a meeting convened by the Meeting Club last night.
The other two documents date back to 1997 and September 2000, a few months before George W. Bush was elected. The two documents are signed by Wolfowitz, current U.S. Vice-President Dick Cheney, current U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and some hawks in the U.S. administration.
- Insisting on confronting anti-U.S. regimes. Here, the reports mention Iran's name before Iraq, because to them it poses a greater threat than Iraq to American interests.
- They grant the U.S. the right to act individually without approval from the U.N., "regardless of its opinion."
Specifically, those who have become known as the Neo-Conservatives (hawks) and the right-wing Christians as the Extremist Protestants.
Rolo summarized the objectives of the war against Iraq as:
- Reinforcing U.S. power in the entire region to curtail the role of oil-producing Arab states and to apply pressure on those states.
In spite of this dull atmosphere, the ninth Francophone Summit is being held in Lebanon (the first time in an Arab country) to confirm that country's ability to surmount the challenges invented by Israel to strike at the international vitality Lebanon has restored with momentum and determination, to stand once again among the prime countries shining in the world of money, business, culture, and civilization.
Having had such achievements, we have to always consider their moral and political results in order to consolidate Lebanon's civilized image among the countries of the region and the world. Meanwhile, Israel is making every possible effort to fabricate and attack its life, sometimes through venomous media and sometimes by contriving water problems, although this is in fact a Lebanese right legitimized by international law and void of any sort of piracy.
Lebanon's constant refusal of the Israeli conditions secured for it an international immunity against Israel's water and territorial ambitions.
Were not all wars economic by reasons and causes?
But other than the expected confrontation, there is something more tragic.
The Arabs are blaming everyone in the world except themselves. They consider that all states are responsible for recovering the Arabs' rights on their behalf.
Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa, the last of the optimistic Arabs, is trying to save what remains of Arab positional esteem. He told British Foreign Minister Jack Straw a few days ago, "The guarantees given to Arab states have been nothing but deception. We do not want any more of those."
Those waiting for the war are still unaware that a war has actually occurred and has actualized all its accompanying threats.
The U.S. President will never run out of ways to surprise the American people and the world with the change in Baghdad.
At that time, Washington will not hesitate to declare the Security Council's failure to meet what is expected of it and will concentrate on the Iraqi regime's attempts to keep the mentioned weapons away from the eyes of the inspectors, perhaps because the secrets of Saddam's regime remain in his sole possession since he suspects everyone, near and far. He might even go to the extent of placing the last of the ammunition under, or even inside, his pillow.
That is one rule of the big game.
There is an obvious, deep disagreement that has become more severe over the past few days about formulating the ruling method to be employed after toppling Saddam's regime.
Mr. Tarek Aziz said, "All Arab leaders have abandoned us, except for the Syrians." (He was speaking from Damascus.)
We were asked about our opinion of the issue, and our response came in the form of examples we presented:
And if our prayers are answered with a miracle, then all praise will naturally be due to the "state of institutions."
Finding this statement strange is ultimate extremism, whereas finding that resorting to the visitor's services is a natural matter and represents the very essence of moderation.
As to meetings between Arab officials and the enemy's leaders and the exchange of correspondence between them, then keeping silent about that is the peak of required moderation.
Let us all return to our previous norm of accord and cooperation as free people as we restore our emigrant sovereignty, because the heart of a true Lebanese knows not grudge or rancor.
You were born renouncing the worldly pleasures.
The summer of 1944. A few months after Emil Eddeh was dismissed from the parliament and his membership was cancelled, due to his cooperation with French mandate authorities; these events were followed by his political isolation. Yomna, sister of Sheikh Beshara al-Khuri, was seated in the spacious garden of the Grand Sofer hotel, in that summer town on the Beirut-Damascus highway. She noticed that the people passing by Rimon Eddeh's table at the center of the garden were ignoring him and not shaking hands with him.
"Would you like to dance with me?"
She repeated, "Don't you want to dance with me near the band, over there?"
The president called his brother, Sheilh Fuad and told him about what Yomna did, asking him to talk to her about that behavior at a time when Sheikh Beshara was fighting a political battle against Emil Eddeh to end his political role totally.
"We know that and will not object to it."
"Have you forgotten that you are the president's sister?"
"All of us make mistakes."
She added, "Large political families cannot be humiliated."
After reading this chapter, dear reader, don't you feel sorrow creeping into your heart and grief over the previous ages when nobility, honor, and values had a place in the politicians' life and mind?
Sorry.
on 10/11/2002 made local observers wonder whether the young Jordanian king hurried to announce the new political theme of the fourth kingdom, especially because contrasting scenarios are circulating in political circles regarding Jordan's future and regional approach.
For the Jordanians, it is because they are concerned that it might be an attempt to incorporate them in a state where they will be a minority. The Palestinians have their concerns because they are afraid that the solution might be an attempt to strip them of their dream of an independent Palestinian state.
"Our borders will be impregnable against any attempt to displace our Palestinian brothers or expel them from their land."
The typical Jordanian position regarding this is to consider them citizens until they decide to return, once that option is available.
He postponed the Jordanian administration of the West Bank in 1974 (when the Arab Summit decision was made in Rabat to deem the P.L.O. the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people) to 1988.
Perhaps we are a day ahead of its finalization.
No politician less formidable than the late king can play it. Second, because it would not gain support from the Jordanian people or approval of the Jordanian government. The late king's persistence with it was a source of constant internal tension. Third, because it is a typical "Hashemite" game, but Abd-Allah II belongs to a generation of Hashemites that sees itself as Jordanian.
The Fire Of Baghdad
Anyone who does not believe that can ask the Palestinians about the state that the Americans had promised them, and how things are progressing to fulfill that promise faster than was expected.
Hence, he will spare no effort to meet the Iraqis' humanitarian needs and fill the shelves of pharmacies and shops with commodities that the Iraqi regime had not allowed Iraqis to have!
Let every Iraqi be prepared to buy a house suitable for a citizen belonging to a rich country, from the revenues of that oil.
Caring about the Iraqi people's interests and to ensure that the promised democracy in the new Iraq is not exposed to an early relapse, Washington will not risk handing over the rule of Iraq to Iraqis after the fall of Saddam's rule, in order to prevent revenge actions after a long period of injustice and tyranny and so that the country does not plunge into chaos.
Why not to give it another try after the third one?
Crowds of soldiers and fleets are coming from every direction to save Iraqis.
Poor Iraqi people.
This time, the triumph of any party will mean a new loss for the Iraqi people.
First: There are certain things that I find indisputable; faith is one of them.
Accordingly, a non-believer who denies the existence of God may not say: I am an atheist because atheism is a scientific stance. On the other hand, a believer in the existence of God may not say: I am a believer because belief is a scientific stance.
A new thinking style, decisiveness, and determination in the statement of King Abd-Allah II to the MBC satellite TV channel
The Jordanians fear becoming a minority in the new state; and the Palestinians also have their fears that the new state will be the first step toward forgetting their goal of independence.

Fifty Years After Dividing Palestine (1947-1997)
And any case, "Israel will not permit diversion of al-Hasibani water."
It also knows, in particular, that the current status of constructed facilities cannot accommodate Lebanon's entire share of water.
As part of the answer, the timing of this Israeli position must also be questioned, as well as why Sharon slept for many weeks after Lebanon started the al-Wazzani project, only to wake up again in fury and rage?
For Sharon, who assumed office on a biblical chariot as a "legendary national hero who will save the people of Israel," still has not forgotten, and has not forgiven, that he was forced out of the South of Lebanon, leaving his "allies" to be punished by imprisonment, vagrancy, and humiliation after promising them a glorified return to their villages. The promise was never fulfilled.
The person who has almost succeeded in destroying the Palestinian Authority amid international silence, who directly rejects the Security Council resolution requiring him to break the siege on its president and cities, and who gives the cold shoulder to the American request to lessen that siege and those massacres... must be encouraged by this silence, especially from Arabs, to realize his desire for revenge and rehabilitation of the legend of the "invincible army" that waits but does not forget its enemies.
The Minister of Energy and Water, Muhammad Abd al-Hameed Baydoon, and the Lebanese University President, Dr. Ibraheem Qubeisi, signed an agreement yesterday to organize the geological map of Lebanon at a scale of 1:20000, study the geological formations, classify subterranean basins, and study the relationship between them with a view to improving the process of investing in them.
With regard to existence of other projects with the University, he said that the future concern is to protect ground water, and that it is most probable that joint projects will be prepared soon to determine the use of ground water and to survey and treat sources of pollution.
According to the agreement, the Lebanese University committed to carrying out the project of contributing to the organization of the geological map of Lebanon at a scale of 1:20000, studying the geological formations, and classifying basins in accordance with specifications and terms stated in the book of terms and the price list.
Among the attendees were Association Director Subhi al-Bisat, Water and Electricity Sources Director General Dr. Fadi Qumeer, FAO Representative in Lebanon Dr. Nur al-Deen Qadira, and a number of concerned figures.

He explained that the insurance and hospital sector is studying the establishment of a partnership to develop a special insurance contract that would secure basic consumer requirements at low prices, "which would reduce the cost born by the Ministry of Health."
He considered that these figures confirm the strength of the sector, good capitalization, and the distinguished position it occupies among other economic sectors, "as it has come to represent 3% of the GNP, and we are attempting to raise this percentage."
He considered that there is an opportunity to expand cooperation between both countries "to benefit from the preferential characteristics they have." He emphasized that Cyprus is capable of benefiting from Lebanon's experience in the therapeutic tourism sector "because the Lebanese private sector invested well in hospitals that are considered international, while Cyprus made agreements with Britain regarding medication."
He also suggested the establishment of a Lebanese-Cypriot assembly of businessmen to encourage close cooperation between the two countries.

Therefore, he enrolls secretly among the resistance, and his end comes together with that of his wife and of Ishaq.
Guitar by Jihad Azkol Solo Among the National Orchestra Harmonies from a Body
The folklore remained his tool and drove to compose his music, like "Bent El Chalabiyah," "Ya Ghzayel," "Al Yadi," and "Al Rosana," the orchestral distribution being sensitive and delicate on each stringed or wind instrument, which allowed the Mediterranean-Lebanese identity to extend and spread out of the limits, root in its soil, and expand in the world.
Some moments of high harmony characterized the ambiance of this concerto with elegant expressions and nostalgic folklore played by Azkol, along with other moments of confusion because of the guitar chord influenced by the heat of the hall.
In St. John Cathedral, the sensitive instruments went from diminuendo to crescendo and so on, orchestrating the melody according to the cathedral's size and its technical complications.

The manager asked his employees to close the door of the office until internal security forces arrived, but the two of them prevented their companion from continuing to assault the manager and managed to take him out of the office, then run away.
Sources close to the investigations reported that the investigations will be intensified. Three internal security personnel who were referred to the investigation group to clarify the nature of their relation with the disappeared will be interrogated.
It was understood that work is being done on a number of recent calls received or made by Abi-Rashid using his cell phone, which was found discarded in the town of Roumia.
Attorney Yusuf Lahud filed a memorandum with the Justice Council in which he requested, as proxy for seven claimants in the Onesco massacre case, combining his principals, the claimants to the public lawsuit.

They exclaimed objections against "the Commissioner's Office's 14-day-long evasion of its duties toward Muhammad Ali," as was mentioned in the statement. They held it "fully responsible from the legal, moral, and humanitarian standpoints for the health condition of our son Assad."

Traffic accidents have recently increased on the Zaghrita-Ahden highway because of speed.
A third accident happened in Sahl Al-Jadeeda, where the collision of two cars resulted in several injuries. The cause, according to Expert Boutros Franjiya's report, is due to excessive speed and inattention.

No longer will forums, conventions, and conferences host that thin, complacent, and fresh as morning dew face in which drive chases wrinkles of age, and from the eyes of which truth radiates to conceal that blackness in the irises, etched by years of troubles.
That beacon of Beirut was extinguished as she was preparing to participate in the Arab National Conference emergency session. When I tried to find absence excuses for her, she said sharply, "How can there be an Arab meeting of such magnitude for Palestine, Iraq, Syria, and the resistance without my attending it?"
For example, ahead of the pioneer of the women's movement in Beirut and one of its pioneers in Lebanon and the Arab world, namely her aunt Ibtihaj Qaddura, she managed to give the women's movement its cultural and national dimension.
As much as Zahia Qaddura was full of affection and love for her family, attached to each member of it, she also had her own private family, who were assembled for her by the days and who gathered around her at crucial times. This family was comprised of some of her university graduates who refused to graduate from her council, where they learned something new every day. It also included some of those she knew along the tracks and paths of life, who joined her open university indefinitely, drawing values, a model, and loyalty from her.

Ridge said that the voice recorded on the Al-Jazeera tape belongs to the Al-Qaeda leader and that the alert degree in the U.S. to encounter terrorism activities remains at "High," and mentioned that the issue "does not need recalling to memory after Bin Laden's own statements 24 or 28 hours ago."
However, he mentioned that Paris has no specific information regarding the nature of these threats and that 200 intelligence personnel will be deployed in airports and railway stations.
And in Berlin, German intelligence authorities confirmed the authenticity of Bin Laden's recording. One of the experts said, "The message is most probably genuine and raises extreme concerns" and that "the fact that it was broadcast by Al-Jazeera network is in itself a certification of its authenticity."
The Australian government warned yesterday four groups it considered terrorist and reinforced its juridical authorities with cooperation agreements with the U.S., U.K., and the major police forces in Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore.
They said that an agreement has been made between some Gulf figures possessing huge deposits abroad and the channel supervisors that those will receive the amount in partial payments, each not to exceed 300,000 dollars, from the accounts of Arab companies in Europe as advertising fees.
Luigi Mazilla (70 years old), who is a man of law with no political affiliation, will replace Fratini as assigned minister of justice in addition to his management of the Italian intelligence authority.
Agagari's wife, Zahra Yahnudi, who visited him in his prison in Humthan, said that her husband thanks the students for their support, and that he said, "It is better for the students to present their demands in a civil movement and within the limits of law, and to work toward preventing those who attempt to deviate the movement off its track through violence and disturbance."
Iranian Minister of Interior Abd Al-Wahid Mousaoui Lari called on authorities and judges to "refrain from behavior that may distort Iran's image around the world."
French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin announced yesterday that issues related to Middle East and terrorism occupied a large part of the talks he held with Tunisian officials.
With regard to terrorism, he noted that the September 11 attacks "altered the perception of the extent of the challenges," and as such, "caution is imperative to face this threat."
"Our concern today is to work so as to enable the inspectors to accomplish their mission actually and quickly."
He was asked whether he discussed human rights and responded, "When we hold talks, we discuss everything, including human rights."
Amman-From Omar Assaf:
However, the Jordanian News Agency Petra reported, "The citizens' living conditions are normal, shops are open, and provisions are available. Citizens expressed satisfaction with actions taken."
Petra confirmed that security forces arrested six of the gang members, and that they seized "large quantities of automatic weapons, machine guns, grenades, and explosive-producing materials."
In a statement carrying his name, the university administration said, "I decided to close it immediately and for further notice for the safety of students and to protect its facilities."
College of Education Aid Fund Manager Hussein Sulayman said that the disagreement between the students and the Fund was based on political motives.
On November 4, the government ordered an investigation into the entry of the campus by the police.
At the end of his meeting with Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa, he stated, "Relations are normal, and no one should be disturbed by non-positive statements in this regard." He expressed his hope for "overcoming anything that would impede building strong relationships" between the two countries.
Moussa announced that he sensed during his talks with Afurqi a will to "establish positive relations between his country and Yemen and Sudan."
The Pope's visit to the parliament bears historic indications with regard to the relations between the Vatican and Italy. It also expresses the depth of emotions borne by Italians toward John Paul II, of Polish birth and the first non-Italian pope in 455 years.
However, Pope Pius IX refused to recognize the government and described himself as the "Prisoner of the Vatican."
However, this historic event did not pass without objection. Some MPs refused to attend the session to emphasize that Italy is a non-religious state. Also, ten homosexual men demonstrated in a nearby plaza.
He called on Christian countries to work toward achieving peace and not to fall "captives to the logic of confrontation, which never introduces real solutions."
He urged the government to assist that by following family-supportive policies and by creating "political initiatives to alleviate the social and economic burden of giving birth to children and raising them." He also urged parents to instill ethical values into children "for them to grow in a healthy atmosphere of freedom."
The Pope also touched on the problem of unemployment and expressed his regret for what he considered to be ethical decadence that is being spread further with the help of the media.
She said, "It is a political event, for he is not only the head of the Church."
16th Chinese Communist Party General Conference Ended; Jiang Abdicates and Hands Leadership to Hu and Charter Amended to Include Emerging Classes and Capitalists Charter Amendment
As expected, Hu Jintao is the only surviving member of the current central committee in the party leadership.
This shift from the "third generation" of Chinese leadership, whose members are now in their seventies, to the "fourth generation", who are in their fifties and sixties, is considered the most significant political change in China since 1989, and the first orderly transfer of authority since the Communist system was established in China in 1949. Previous transfers of authority in the Asian giant witnessed cleansing and bloodshed, including the appointment of Jiang as secretary-general of the party after violent protests in the Tian In Min plaza in 1989.
The formation of the new leadership team will be announced today (Friday) after the new central committee's first plenary session. This will reveal the influence Jiang will maintain in the coming years.
The final day of the conference witnessed another event, which was the historic amendment to the Communist Party charter so as to allow for admission of capitalists. The wording "The Chinese Communist Party is the forefront of the working class" was changed to "The Party is the forefront of the Chinese working class, the Chinese people, and the Chinese nation."
He had started to promote this "idea" approximately eighteen months ago. Its major aim for the party is attempting to incorporate in the party emerging classes, among which are capitalists.
U.S. Senate Democratic Majority Leader Tom Daschle criticized President George Bush's administration for its obstruction to forming a committee to investigate the September 11 attacks in New York and Washington. He mentioned that an independent inquiry would help the country deal with future threats.
He added, "The Al-Qaeda organization remains a threat."
He said, "They want to be able to pick the committee. They do not want the Congress to intervene. (...) You will not be able to get an objective review. All you will get is a subjective review" if that happens.
He said, "This matter concerns protection of the American people and assigning the President necessary instruments he needs to better protect the American people."
Daschle said, "I am inclined to support the final text," explaining that the Democrats want to proceed with the law in spite of escalated concerns about articles related to the staff.
Recent polls in Israel indicate that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon leads his rival former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Likud bloc elections scheduled to be held next November 28. Meanwhile, Haifa Municipality Director Amiram Mitzna leads his competitors, former Minister of Defense Benjamin Ben- Eliezir and MP and former Minister Haim Ramon in the Labor Party elections scheduled for Tuesday the 19th in preparation for general elections scheduled for January 28, 2003.
"This man enjoys a great deal of credibility, and it seems he cannot be defeated."
However, the recent polls show that Sharon might have no need for Netanyahu, as he came in ten points ahead, in addition to predicting that he will win the general elections.
The secular Shinui Party will also double its number of seats to 12, and Arab parties will win 11 seats compared to ten. The extremist Eastern Jews Shas Party will be a big loser too, as its number of representatives will drop from the current 17 to 9.
Levy, who is a member of Gesher Party, had resigned last April from the national unity government presided over by Sharon, in which he was a minister without a portfolio, in protest against reduction of the social affairs budget.
It is Paris 2, which seems in its objectives and incentives to be out of the current regional and international context. In fact, it even introduces a contradictory context to the political atmosphere that is dominating the momentum of international relations since September 11 of last year.
In saying this, we definitely do not intend to give the Paris 2 convention the status of a coalition, nor even of axes, although supporting a country such as Lebanon, with all its characteristics and uniqueness, does deserve an international coalition, at least because it presents the world with a formula for creative coexistence among multiple sects and ethnic groups at a time when the world is slipping toward struggle between ethnic groups and civilizations and toward primitiveness in relations between states and ignorance in dealing with societies.
On the other hand, holding the conference coincides with a politically indicative turn in terms of the French political position against the global policy that Washington is trying to dictate in an imperialistic style that is not free of arrogance. This doubles the significance of Paris 2, which is further increased by the American participation in the conference.
Those who are going there are keen on giving their attendance an indication more than the souvenir photograph.
Christians of Principle and Realistic Christians
Personal interests and important details, considered to be the devil's hideout, might play an important role in the mentioned agreement.
However, reference may be made to the actual currents that are pulling between them at the Christians of Lebanon today, and that are pushing them toward division, discord, and perhaps fighting. Those currents must be researched in terms of roots and components in the past decade and part of the decade that preceded it, with all the events that took place then, particularly what was then termed the Eastern Issue, for which no effective and permanent solutions have been found until the present.
It also means standing against transforming Lebanon into a police state where there is no room for democracy and freedom,
Its actual implicit, and perhaps explicit, objective is to keep Christians inside Lebanon and protect their political, economic, and social role that is, in its view, threatened by various factors such as the gradual transformation of Muslims into a majority and the growth of Islamic fundamentalism in the Arab and Islamic world and the negative impact that has on Lebanon.
What is each of the mentioned Christian currents view of the other?
This means that the current and perhaps the forthcoming stages will be loaded with difficulties for the principle-based current, as the realistic current is currently "dominant," if that expression may be used.
Egyptian Intelligence Director General Omar Sulayman arrived suddenly in Ramalla and met with Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat, in an attempt that Palestinians say aims at evaluating the results of talks held in Cairo in the past four days by the two movements of Fatah and Islamic Resistance Hamas to stop suicidal operations inside Israel.
From Ramalla, the Egyptian intelligence director traveled to Jerusalem and held separate talks with Catsaf and Sharon.
Hamas asked for time to consider the proposition without rejecting it.
Arafat's advisor, Nabeel Abu Redeina, said that success of the efforts to stop suicidal operations depends on Israel stopping its attacks against Palestinians and ending its occupation of Palestinian autonomous territory in the West Bank.
He said, "The President expressed his view clearly, which is that Israel is entitled to self-defense, provided it keeps in consideration the results of its actions. This opinion is well known."
American officials noted that Washington reluctantly accepts the sluggishness of peace talks in the Middle East because Israel is unable to make important decisions before the general elections are held.
They also focused on the importance of dedicated traffic police and not detaching it for any other tasks.
After the session, Committee Chairman MP Sami Al-Khateeb said, "We promised hunters that this law will be ready before the end of this month."
"Young people will have access to a modern law allowing them good practice of their hobby."
It is a media miracle in Lebanon.
The petition was sent to most newspapers and radio and television stations. In every firm, one of the colleagues circulated it by hand around his colleagues. Ninety-five percent signed (or wanted to sign). The issue is thus humanitarian, social, and professional. Everyone wanted to raise their voices and say: It is unacceptable that 453 families be made homeless. We people of the press and media do not accept paying the price every time. We do not want solutions at our expense.
Otherwise, why were mitigating factors invented?
We are mothers and fathers, and it is the school season. Living conditions were difficult in the first place for those who have jobs, let alone the unemployed.
However, no one accepted us: the Editors Association, the Press Association, the General Labor Union, and even the Journalism Club.
When we proposed it to colleagues, the response was wonderful. Some of them said, "I will sign blindly." However, we insisted that everyone read it.
1- The media body is one cohesive whole, starting with the top of the pyramid, the owners and presidents of newspapers and media firms, all the way down to journalists, media staff, passing through technicians and laborers.
Finally, if journalists and media personnel do not act and defend their rights, families, lives, and firms, then how can they defend the rights of people and country?
The Meeting held its periodic convention in the Hezbollah Political Council headquarters and discussed the local, Arab, and international issues and developments. The conferees issued the following statement:
- "The Meeting discussed developments of the Iraqi issue after Security Council Resolution 1441 and noted that the American position is working toward marketing its own understanding of the new resolution that it gives Washington authorization to attack Iraq without referring to the Security Council. This contradicts the resolution, which explicitly stipulates that any strike against Iraq cannot be automatic, allows the inspection teams to carry out their task in Iraq, and then submit their report to the Security Council, the sole decision-making authority."
"On the anniversary of the reform movement lead by the late President Hafez Al-Assad, the Meeting addresses congratulations to Dr. Bashar Al-Assad and the Syrian leadership."
The vanguards of international forces arrived in Lebanon on March 23. Resolution 425 called for, first, strict respect for the integrity of Lebanese territory and the sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized boundaries. Second, it called on Israel to stop its military action against the integrity of Lebanese territory immediately and to withdraw at once its forces from all Lebanese lands.
Its history is considered part of the history of the South.
Combat operations continued between Israeli forces and its cooperating Lebanese forces on one hand, and Lebanese groups that declared its determination to resist Israeli occupation on the other hand.
Also, U.N. legal and military specialists studied the legal issues that could be faced within implementation of Resolution 425.
The U.N. team on the field worked toward demarcating a line to confirm the Israeli withdrawal.
The operations of the force remained focused on the blue line and its adjacent area, where the force continued exerting its efforts to maintain the cease-fire through patrolling, fixed-post surveillance, and close contacts with the parties.
The relevant incidents are latitudinal violations of the blue line in the Shiba farms area.
The Secretary-General recommended that the force make-up should be settled at 2000 by the end of 2002.
The President is aware of the ability of " " to simultaneously report and receive messages and therefore says a final opinion that the Lebanese state strategy is facing an American-Israeli war mounting the horse of cyclone winds.
Much has been said in the few past years about coordination between the government and the resistance and about an integration between them against Israel when it was on Lebanese territory, and even after its withdrawal. However, eyes beheld, in addition to political facts and information, that such coordination passes through Syria, which represented the intermediary position in the balance and as such was pulling the pans to meet at an equal distance from it if face to face meeting is not possible!
Silence Toward Iraq's Acceptance Despite Official Concern With the Issue
Highly informed sources noted that the first American reaction to Iraq's acceptance was "cautious and skeptical," and that Washington wants "deeds to match words," although the acceptance was unconditional 48 hours before the expiration of the time limit given by the Security Council.
They found that this second step is the true test and is crucial, sensitive, and packed with risks of the return of the war phantom after being dismissed by the acceptance of Resolution 1441.
This is construed differently by the U.S. on one hand, and France, Russia, and China on the other hand.
And the question this time is whether that would lead to launching a strike, or a general and partial strike, or acknowledging the discrepancy and requiring the inspectors to destroy it.
They noted the "provocation" phrase of the decision, as it led to their expulsion.
Solidarity With Sudan Meeting; Bomb in Fatah Center Wounds Member in Ein Al-Helwa; American Delegation Visits Baalbak Castle under Tight Security Measures; Qowati in Solidarity With Almir Today
Sayda-"Al-Nahar":
PLO-Fatah Movement Factions Secretary in Sayda and the South, Colonel Khaled Aref, made a statement in which he said: "The attack that targeted the Fatah Movement premises this morning is a continuation of the same series that has been going on for two months, targeting organizations and individuals of all forces and factions in Ein Al-Helwa camp. The most recent incident was the targeting of the Commandos facility in the camp, imagining that with this series they can meddle with the security of the camp and drag the national and Islamic forces and factions into internal conflicts."
Away from the media, working groups of U.S. Congressional members of the House of Representatives and Senate visited yesterday the Baalbak citadel, amid security measures of unprecedented tightness.
The visit lasted approximately 90 minutes.
Days, months, and years passed, and I lost track of that self-reliant man, until I read his name in a newspaper as the Chairman of the Muslim Scouts Society, which is a society having among its most important principles "reuniting boy and girl scouts, preserving the scouting spirit in them, promoting the scouting movement in all societies of Lebanon, respecting human rights and feelings, and promoting peace based on truth and justice."
A power generator in the town of Ghazeer is placed six meters away from the window of a nearby house. Its noise disturbs the neighbors, and its smoke entered the bedrooms.
The complainant did not specify the name of the owner of the generator nor the name of the district in the town of Ghazeer, which is quite large. There is also no reference to the process with the concerned authorities. This information is necessary to follow up on the complaint and deal with it.
For example, the continuation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can be construed as the willingness of Arabs, and the willingness of Israelis as well but to a lesser extent, to mobilize on the basis of conditions imposed by the social affair. Those are conditions that stipulate that external bets are more important than bets pertinent to each society and each individual.
Subsequently, the Arab world's economic, social, and communal failure is construed as its inability to protect the "self" against the "us," which has superlative existence even in the media.
Modernity, which is supposed to guarantee for every individual the right to live in accordance with his private will, rather than with the conditions of the group, has been exposed to repression in this world and was presented as a European promotional instrument aimed at guaranteeing European hegemony.
There is no doubt that the contribution with most depth to the book is the one presented by Hussein Ahmad Ameen under the title "The Crisis of the Individual in Egypt."
However, the sole positive point amid a general atmosphere of pessimistic tendency is Hussein Ahmad Ameen's belief that globalization and the fact that states, even the overly repressive of liberties among them, are increasingly losing the ability to fend internal sabotage schemes are two factors stirring hopes that democratic revolutions may erupt, and that would be no more than the seeds of releasing the Arab individual from the bonds of "his tribe."
Abu-Juda: Quality ISO Qualifies Our Emergence Into International Markets
In the beginning, Sadir spoke about the occasion. He considered that it is not only important to the Lebanese-Canadian Bank but also to the entire banking sector.
On his part, Abu-Juda emphasized that "this step was accomplished within the framework of restructuring the bank over the past years so as to cater to customer needs that are no longer limited to traditional transactions."
He said that this event is the start of a more crucial and difficult phase. "As such, we will involve everyone, particularly those dealing directly with customers, in collecting information, expressing opinions, and solving problems."
There are 520 institutions around the world applying ISO 2000/9001.
The Turkish delegation emphasized the necessity of promoting cooperation in a number of fields, particularly banking, tourism, and trade. Meanwhile, invitations were given for signing several agreements, most prominently on duality of taxation and transport.
The discussion touched on means of promoting economic and trade relations between Lebanon and Turkey.
The Turkish Ambassador spoke and in turn emphasized the importance of joint cooperation, thanking Al-Qassar and members of the Beirut Chamber for their care of the delegation.
He wondered: "Would it be reasonable that no serious attempt be made to build economic and commercial relations between the Arab Orient and Turkey, particularly since Lebanon, which is characterized by its composition and the quality of its businessmen, is able to utilize what Turkey can provide from its market and Asian markets that were formerly part of the Soviet Union?"
Al-Bezri noted Lebanon's distinguished location, specifically in terms of geography.
He called for joint cooperation on the banking operations level, emphasizing the necessity of benefiting from the expertise of Lebanon, which is considered a pioneer in this field, in addition to encouraging tourism exchange and developing its relevant marketing policies.

He also said, "This new, vital project expresses the government's policy aimed at reviving the educational sector by providing and equipping required school facilities." He revealed that the Council recently announced two tenders for the construction of Al-Museitba School and Ras Beirut School at a capacity of 4,000 pupils and is preparing the assignment and ownership files for the other twenty schools.

A delegation from the Union of Growers and Farmers Associations, accompanied by Southern Olive Growers Association Chairman Hassan Salami, toured some olive production areas in the South and Al-Nabatiya. They viewed the suffering of growers and their inability to sell this season's produce, in addition to the low prices, at a time when last year's produce remains in storage.
"The production cost of olives in Lebanon is the highest in the area: While the cost of a kilogram of olives in Lebanon is 966 pounds, in Syria it is only 565 pounds, and in Jordan it ranges between 163 and 412 pounds."
"- That olive oil exports be subsidized with an amount no less than 600 dollars per ton as part of the Agricultural Exports Support Program, particularly since oil is one of the commodities eligible for this subsidy upon approval of the Finance and Budget Committee in its session dated 5/2/2001 to add olives and olive oil to commodities eligible for the subsidy to promote export activity and increase it above the current rate of approximately 650 tons."
In 269 medium-size pages, the author documents an essential saying, suggesting that the colonial West saw in the Arab Orient from Iraq eastward to the Syrian coast westward a "casual incident," that Arabs are invaders, and accordingly that this "historic disorder" must be corrected by expelling Arabs from the Orient.
This was known by only a few of his generation who started their lives in remote villages, as he did, and insisted on finding room for themselves in the city. The least of those few are those who possess the talent of that refined man in gathering people around him and all their love in sincerity and without discrimination on the basis of sect, party, area, village, or foreign urbanity.
We have gained immense honor as that ancient lineage race inhabited our country and left the "genes" of its lineage latent in the blood of some of our compatriots.

The President of the country emphasized the need to strengthen partnership relations in these sectors within the Euro-Mediterranean region and to use all available resources at the bilateral and multilateral levels in light of the Euro-Mediterranean ministerial meeting that is set to begin today in Tunis on the future of the textile sector. This meeting will center on examining the status of the textile sector in this region and the means to ensure that it is kept up-to-date with recent developments, and specifically on considering the execution of the polyfiber agreements.

It is expected that the roster of candidates in the legislative elections will be finalized by tomorrow Wednesday, the twenty-four of this September , which is the final deadline for submission of candidacies and receipts according to the Electoral Law.

Dubai (AFP)- Five workers were killed and 12 others injured yesterday in an accident involving the collapse of a wall under construction in the expansion of Dubai International Airport, as reported in a statement by the Civil Aviation Department, a copy of which was obtained by Agence France Presse.
The President of the Department of Civil Aviation in Dubai, Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum, described the accident as "a tragedy for all of us", and expressed his condolences to the families of the worker victims.
The child and the donkey
Perhaps, in the image of this Palestinian child whose parents had to carry him to the hospital on the back of a donkey to save his life, after he was hit by shrapnel from an Israeli bomb and after the occupation forces closed all the paths in front of them and prevented them from entering the hospital to be treated, one finds the confirmation that there remains hope generation after generation...
The starting point for the investigation of the matter was a statement submitted by a Tunisian girl to the security officials at Al Murazaqa reporting that she had met a tourist from a European country and agreed to marry him after his conversion to Islam.
As a first step, the aforementioned passport was handed to the technical units at the National Security Administration in the Nabeul District to uncover the evidence of fraud before they agreed to look for the suspect who appears to have found it difficult to accompany his future wife to his country in a legal fashion for lack of time and because of the many procedures to follow in this matter.

And to put into effect what the President allowed in his decisions during the meeting of the Supreme Judicial Council on August 10, 2004, two decrees were recently issued aiming at improving the status of judges, and this is in the context of keeping with a greater provision of care that is worthy of the standing of a judge, and so that the judges can devote themselves to carrying out their duties in the best possible way.
This measure was part of a series of measures announced by the President of the Republic and the President of the Supreme Judicial Council last August 10, and these measures included:
- Review the Penal Procedures Code with the goal of adding a report by a psychologist to the file of every repeat offender to be considered at the trial.
The courts at all levels have also witnessed an improvement in their system of notification at a cost of approximately 5 million dinars, focusing on the set up of 1,400 computer terminals, all used to store case files and judgments, as well as data for use by attorneys and litigants.
Is the era of the kindergarten satisfied with toys and swings coming to an end?
Regardless of the evidence of the coverage index, which requires more support and drive to win the quantitative challenge and spread the services of child care institutions to the largest possible number of our children, this did not eliminate the need to be concerned with the how. In addition, we must diagnose the status of the services provided and evaluate their quality and their ability to meet the needs of today's child, desiring what is better and providing a more effective framework for budding youngsters to grow in an environment that can nurture them and direct their talents and capabilities.
The owners of 860 kindergartens were given deadlines to fix their situations with a notification from the concerned authorities to shut down close to 100 chaotic kindergartens, while 97 institution owners chose to immediately shut down of their own volition.
This is a question that begs itself after we heard the speech by the Minister of Women's and Children's Affairs at the opening session of the National Panel that began its proceedings yesterday on the topic of "Education in Early Childhood", and in which she stated that the needs of today's children have changed...

Tunis - As-Sabah. The phenomenon of inflation is a "disease" that chokes any economy, irrespective of its development, and limits its growth.
Economic schools of thought have differed in their analysis of this phenomenon. The British economist "Keynes" and his followers believe that a moderate rate of inflation can in fact stimulate the economy, which is a "short-term analysis" according to Keynes since a rise in wages will increase consumption, which in turn leads to an absorption of production and therefore encourage investments and contribute to a reduction of unemployment.
The second consists in controlling the money supply such that it is compatible with the size of goods and services that are being traded in the market in order to achieve that stabilization.
Many researchers find the difficulty in choosing between the two strategies exciting. Some find that the only difference between the policies taken is in the choice of the appropriate timing to pay the cost of inflation stabilization, namely on the short term with respect to the first strategy and on the long term with respect to the second strategy.

Movie Director Taieb Louhichi
And recently, "Dance of the Wind"...
* You returned to permanently settle in Tunisia...
It is necessary for the director to review his creative life and wonder about how to continue producing, given the personal, production and economic factors, as well as the general predominant view of the cinema in our countries, which has resulted in the cancellation of many movie projects. Since 1994, I never received any assistance from the sponsoring authority until I completed the film "Dance of the Wind".
The producer has to have the courage to present a different presentation of the subject.. We have to give a different image to the cinema that has its special characteristics..
Dream is the most important thing in our life and it is essential and the only means to go on living in these terrible times..
"Dance of the Wind" is a creative biography more so than an autobiography.. And if it were autobiographical, I would have split it with the director who plays the role and also with all the other directors who live through this suffering.
The most beautiful space for the movies of Taieb Louhichi .. All directors have shot in the desert.. It is a beautiful space for the imagination, and I am not hiding a secret by saying that I have an artistic score that needs to be settled with the desert as a space...

He indicated that as he was taking a walk near Tabiet Hindi, a village located in the vicinity of Bi'r Chlouf in the region of Nabeul, a man suddenly shot at him and wounded him in a sensitive area of his body.
Further investigations led them to identify some other suspects and the number of arrests totaled 10, all of whom confessed to the charges against them. Each one specified the role he played in the incident. It is expected that they will be referred in the next few days to the judicial authorities.

Her companion in detention, Simona Torretta, said, "They treated us with a lot of respect and dignity".
And two Iraqi women hostages were with them in the beginning before they were transferred to another place a few days later.
One of them said, "Our captors taught us the principles of Islam and offered us their apologies and asked for our forgiveness", adding that they offered her a box of sweets before releasing them.
The release of the two hostages in the Italian press
A mediator confirms the two Frenchmen to be released soon
Brett told Agence France Presse , "I met the two hostages and their release is certain beyond doubt".
A spokeswoman for the Ministry, Marie Masdupuy, said, "We are not aware of any agreement concerning the release of the hostages".
The hostage appeared dressed in an orange garment and in a deplorable condition inside an iron cage with, in the background, the flag of the Unity and Jihad Group that is headed by the Jordanian AbuMusab al-Zarqawi .
Bigley also called on Blair to work for the release of Iraqi women prisoners.
In the case of the two former Italian female hostages, Italy welcomed with great joy, and after three weeks of concern, Simona Torretta and Simona Pari who were kidnapped on September 7 in Iraq and were released last Tuesday shortly after an Iraqi man and an Iraqi woman who were kidnapped with them.
Yemen
The suicide attack on the destroyer in the port of Aden in the south of Yemen on October 12, 2000 killed 17 US military personnel, and the leader of the Al-Qaeda organization, Osama Bin Laden, claimed responsibility for the attack at the time.
Maamoun Ahmed Answa (30 years old) was sentenced to an 8-year prison sentence on charges of contributing to "falsifying official documents for the suicide bombers" who executed the attack, Ibrahim Al-Thawr and Hassan Al-Khameri.
For his part, Khaled Al-Qasei, the brother of the third accused individual, said that he will request an appeal to his brother's sentence.

He added that security forces have arrested "in the context of this criminal plan" a number of individuals in Nouakchott, among whom is Captain Abderrahman Ould Mini who was the mastermind behind the coup attempt of June 2003, in addition to his civilian and military partners who were going to participate "in a criminal act of destruction and deal a blow to security and the regime".
He further said that these weapons were to be used in executing "the criminal plan" this week.
One of the officers of the National Guard in the region of Doulouiya, 30 kilometers south of Samarra, said that 13 members of the Iraqi National Guard gave their resignations because the American forces ignored our opinions and what we had to say.
Other soldiers who submitted their resignations blamed the American forces for the deterioration of security conditions in the city because of their siege around it and their headquartering themselves in the police station located in the city center, which led to cutting off the main road in the city and the side streets surrounding the police station.
Mobile phones and their impact on health
As-Sabah Investigation * Service taxis ("Limos")
Many issues have been the subject of much debate. A vicious circle spinning around itself. The number of licenses is greater and thus there are more cars, which has led to the inability of the stations to contain all the cars. That was also a reason for taking crooked measures to provide work opportunities in order to close that circle of unlimited problems.
A chaotic situation ... indescribable
They do not acknowledge the system of registering at stations or exit permits or any... The means are numerous and the goal is one but the causes are quite numerous.
The sector has become a focus for absolutely anyone.
The lack of space was an important point mentioned by almost everyone and in the various stations. The Bab Saadoun station is slated for a change and a transfer to a bigger, more comfortable location. But the transfer has not yet occurred and even the new space has not yet been equipped, which adds to the bewilderment of the professionals especially since the rainy season is coming.
"There needs to be a large, equipped station in the capital".
What is shameful is that there isn't in the capital an equipped station that meets all the conditions for the comfort of passengers and car owners and all parties. This has led to the spread of uncivilized conduct and to the appearance of snack vendors inside the station whose products are consumed by the passengers who do not realize that these snacks are mixed with poisonous substances from car exhaust emissions."
The decision about passengers drop off spot is a very unfair one.
One of us, a car owner, dropped off a blind man. The penalty cost him several other passengers.
This question also was of concern to almost all the professionals.. Mr. Mouncef Al-Zaouaoui put it forward, saying, "I want to ask the authorities what benefit there is in defining the route of travel. What is the benefit for a "Limo" whose destination is Sfax to go through Grombalia or Sousse or other places.. and any violator has to pay a 300-dinar ticket and his car will be seized for three days..". This a decision that, in the opinion of most of those involved, was marginal and could be overlooked.

Acts of violence and unrest continued to intensify in Iraq just a few weeks before US presidential elections in November and four months before Iraqi elections scheduled for January. The number of attacks on American Forces has increased to about 80 attacks yesterday compared to 40 attacks a month ago. An officer in the American Army said that resistance fighters had detonated three cars filled with explosives in an attack south of Baghdad that targeted an American military convoy.
They mentioned that about 140 people were injured, most of them children who were hit by shrapnel. Local residents said that a ceremony for the inauguration of a new water and sewer station was taking place when the explosions occurred.
Abu Ghraib is located ten kilometers west of Baghdad and became notorious for the prison in which American soldiers violated the rights of Iraqi prisoners. In the north of Iraq, another car filled with explosives was detonated near an Iraqi police convoy in Tell A'afer, which is a stronghold for the resistance near the Syrian border.
School Massacres Move To Argentina
The spokesman said that the students told the police that their fellow student had entered the premises without saying a single word, then began shooting from a 9-millimeter pistol, and that they hid under the seats.

The writer Alain Soral, however, was unharmed.
This attack comes at a time when Jewish organizations have launched a campaign in which they claim that the Jews in France are facing increasing anti-Semitic attacks, which however turned out to be false and fabricated.
Ramallah (News Agencies) - Palestinian members of Parliament said that members of Parliament who are angry at the failure of the Palestinian leadership to implement reforms are determined to call for a vote of no confidence that could lead to the fall of the government that was appointed by Palestinian president Yasser Arafat.
Palestinian sources said that Qurei had, over the past weeks, boycotted the meetings of the Central Committee of the Fatah Movement and the meetings of the National Security Council in protest over the stalling by Arafat in approving the decisions for reforms, in particular those reforms in the security apparatus and in meeting the Egyptian demands.
Those pressures are being applied by the Quartet committee, led by the United States and Europe, as well as other parties led by Egypt.
In Kasserine
Meanwhile, police officers issued a search warrant in the affair in order to uncover the main motives and causes that led the young man to commit suicide.
After a period of time, one of his relatives noticed his body hanging from the telephone pole, which triggered the security and judicial investigations to uncover the mystery behind this young man's suicide.

Arafat Urges The World To Stop Israel's "Racist Crimes":
Nine Palestinians were martyred earlier in the Strip in clashes with the Israeli occupation forces, four of whom had carried out an infiltration operation from the Gaza Strip into an Israeli area.
Among the martyrs, three were affiliated with the "Al-Quds Brigades", which is the military wing of the Palestinian movement, Jihad,, and four were from the "Qassam Phalanxes" affiliated with the resistance movement (Hamas).
Reports indicate that the Israeli military operation focused on the Jabaliya camp and Beit Lahia aims at the elimination of the activists of the Hamas movement in particular and the end of the firing of Qassam rockets.
A call from Arafat to the world
Yesterday, the Palestinian government had for its part declared the "state of emergency" throughout the Palestinian occupied territories and demanded the intervention of the international community.
He added that the state of emergency "means that the basic ministries of health, instruction, education, energy and electricity continue to operate around the clock in addition to the operations of the other ministries".

We discovered this same behavior when we met the most prominent editor at the New York Times newspaper where a female editing manager, in answer to our question whether the newspaper was biased towards Israel in its handling of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and in defending at the same time our implied accusations, replied, "Jewish readers of the newspaper threatened about three years ago to boycott the newspaper and cancel their subscription because they accused us of bias towards the Palestinian cause and sympathy to Arafat..."

Gaza (News Agencies) - The Israeli aggression against several areas in the northern part of the Gaza Strip entered its successive sixth day yesterday, leaving more Palestinian martyrs and wounded and large scale destruction that comprised tens of houses in the Jabaliya Camp, Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun.
Their assassination came hours after the martyrdom of two field commanders in the Palestinian Resistance Movement (Hamas), Mahdi Mushtaha and Khaled Al- Amreiti , in a raid launched by Israeli Apache helicopter gun ships on their car the night before last in one of the neighborhoods of Gaza City.
These developments come at the same time that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon announced yesterday the continuation of military operations in northern Gaza and the establishment of a security belt there.
Palestinian warning
Erakat also considered "that Sharon's objective is to destroy the Palestinian Authority and destroy the institutions of the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the institutions of the Palestinian people because he wants to re-occupy the Gaza Strip... after converting it into a big prison with forty percent of the West Bank inside the walls.
Intensified American raids on Falluja.. and cautious calm in Samarra after two days of fighting
A statement by the American Army announced that "a large number" of armed militants were killed in the attack.
Another building was blown up on the evening of the day before yesterday in the suburbs of Falluja and was claimed by the American Army to shelter between 10 and 15 fighters who had confirmed earlier to have undergone training of a military nature there.
American and Iraqi forces say that they are trying to uproot members of Shiite leader Muqtada Al-Sadr's Mahdi Army.
And a spokesman for the American Army in Iraq described the situation in the city as great, adding " the city had been living in a state of lawlessness for the past several months".
In this regard, the Saudi magazine "Ash-Sharq Al-Awsat" reported in its issue published yesterday, citing Dr. Bushra Jamil from the Health Education Section of the Iraqi Ministry of Health, that "some families have refrained from vaccinating their children as a result of lingering fear in their minds about the contamination of any vaccine offered by international companies even though these companies are certified by the World Health Organization".
He confirmed that 5 million doses were donated by the UNICEF organization bearing a 2-year expiration date and others donated by the French company Pasteur, which is one of the finest vaccine manufacturing companies and certified by the World Health Organization. On this basis, there is no fear of vaccination, especially since this vaccine is administered orally and in several doses.
But the minister did not specify the measures recommended by those attending the meeting and the state of alert was raised around airports, harbors, train tunnels, strategic and military buildings, embassies, hotels, tourist resorts and markets.

After The Arrest Of A Moroccan Family Suspected Of Ties To "Terrorism":
The same source added that the investigating judge in the city of Rotterdam decided to keep him in jail and not divulge any information about him in order to protect the secrecy of the investigations.

The troubles began on the morning of the day before yesterday with three powerful simultaneous explosions, which shook the bus station and two markets in Dimapur, the commercial center of the state of Nagaland and caused the death of 28 people.
The Nagaland authorities blamed the attacks on separatist rebels who seek through this to halt the ongoing peace process in this agricultural state of 2 million inhabitants.
In a statement published yesterday, the "National Democratic Front of Bodoland" claimed responsibility for the shooting acts in Assam, specifying that they represent "evidence of our strength".
Girl held by 4 perverts
Details of the incident indicate that a married woman went to the security station in her neighborhood in the past few days accompanied by her daughter and she submitted a complaint in which she revealed that her companion was the victim of a kidnapping and assault operation by 4 perverts.
But the suspects insisted on their demand and he had no alternative but to leave, abandoning his friend to the evil ones, and he left the place for fear of being assaulted, especially considering the uneven balance of power to the advantage of his opponents.
In Mahdia
The case file documents reveal that a student in a primary school in the city of Sfax went with members of his family to one of the cities in the province of Mahdia and late one night the boy fell victim to a kidnapping at the hands of a drunk, but luckily for him, some neighbors witnessed the event and saved the boy from the unknown fate that awaited him.

Within sight of citizens and attorneys and others who were present at the Palace of Justice on Bab-El-Banat Street in the capital, a young man who works as an attorney's clerk attacked an attorney who is one of the most venerated in the legal profession in Tunis. This led to the intervention of the authorities in charge and to the arrest of the "clerk" who beat up a colleague of the lawyer for whom he worked - according to eyewitnesses.
The matter does not seem easy, particularly since one of the officials of the Tunis branch of the Bar Association asserted to us that "what happened is a precedent that never happened before and no lawyer has ever been subjected to this behavior by the clerk of another lawyer", adding that "skirmishes typically happen between some lawyers and court clerks, but we are not accustomed to hearing of this deed".
He climbed an electric pole causing complete paralysis in the city for 13 hours.
So he decided to end his life in a strange way. He may simply have thought of threatening to kill himself as a means of pressure but he failed in his plan due to collective efforts of the security and judicial authorities in Sidi Bu Zayd.
It took exactly 13 hours before the personnel of the National Guard of the Jahawiyah area, a representative of the judicial authority, and civil protection agency personnel got to the location and had the situation under control.

A Sea Disaster In The Territorial Waters Of Tunisia
Tunis- As-Sabah: 22 persons died and 42 more were missing. 11 persons were rescued, among them was one Tunisian in a boat crash Sunday evening, the day before yesterday. The incident occurred in Tunisian territorial waters. The boat had 75 illegal immigrants on board, among them were 5 Tunisians.
With continued search by the National Navy Patrol and the National Guard of the area of Jahawiyyah, Nabeul, Monastir and Sousse, and one of the helicopters which later joined the search effort in the area of the crash, it was possible to pick 22 bodies of illegal immigrants before they were examined in the presence of the judicial authority of Sousse's primary court. The bodies were taken to the Sahlool university hospital morgue for examination to verify the cause of death and determine their identities.
On the date agreed, they gathered in a forest in the town of Shatt Mariam before they boarded the boat that was to take them to the Italian island of Lampedusa. Because of the boat's small size and the large number of passengers, the boat split into 2 parts causing 64 people to drown. 22 of the bodies were found and the rest are considered missing. 11 persons were rescued and arrested pending investigation and interrogation that was started by the squad and the Sousse National Guard.

They confiscated a boat and other equipments.
The preliminary information collected revealed that 126 persons arrested have entered our country illegally. Some have settled in the province of Sousse while the others have settled in the province of Naples, to participate in a smuggling operation to Italy by sea.
We know that the regional intelligence agents of the National Security in "Sidi Al-Bashir" uncovered a number of Moroccan young men who, it seems, were preparing to participate in a clandestine sea journey. They arrested approximately 25 Moroccans in a popular hostel in "Bab Al-Jazeera" in the capital, and brought them to the area's police station.
By bringing them to the police station, it was confirmed, according to the initial information that they, actually, were planning to take part in a clandestine border crossing operation departing from one of the coastal areas' beaches. Legal procedures are expected to be taken against them.

You don't see residents of this widespread city; only some women and men for the purpose of dialogue in the movie, in reference to the spread of moral deviation. But the director mostly finds an excuse for the film's characters which seem to be deviant or in bad spirit.
Then with much mildness, the director leads us slowly to the tragic end of the movie where the child "Indala" ends up a killer and a victim. This happened after his innocence was taken advantage of and he was used in an assault operation that ended in a tragedy.

Tunis - As-Sabah - Tourism in Tunisia is essentially tourism of the sun, the sea, the beaches and the fair weather and on a lesser scale it is the tourism of the desert which is distinctively represented by the famous camel on the postage stamps. However, the obvious question here is why has ecological or environmental tourism not yet entered the system of Tunisian tourism?
And considering what Tunisia possesses in infrastructure and its distinctive image, it will be the destination of the tourist coming for its sun and sea and also of the tourist who loves the magic of its forest and mountains.

The film "Gate of the Throne" by the director Moukhtar Lajimi which represents Tunisia in the official competition of the current round of the Carthage Film Festival is of the "incoming film" type. Its producer, Moukhtar Lajimi who graduated from the Institute of Higher Cinematographic Studies in France where he resides permanently, has never previously produced long narrative films and all that is accredited to him is a group of documentary films and his film "Gate of the Throne" is his first long narrative film.
In fact, other scenes and details in the film "Gate of the Throne" make the observer use the description of "incoming films" for this type of Tunisian films that are done by Tunisian directors who usually live in the west.

The plastic containers should be deposit-free and disposable. All companies are prohibited from handling, stocking and marketing liquid bleach without casing, or if it does not have the national seal of conformity.

Gaza - News Agencies - Former Security Chief Mohammed Dahlan warned yesterday that the wide slayings and destruction carried by the Israeli forces in the northern part of the Gaza strip will bring on more acts of revenge. He further emphasized that the solution will only come within a "new political framework."
But he ward off by saying that if there is no way out of this confrontation, so be it.
He further added that the killings and launching of rockets will not help the Palestinian cause but rather will bring more relapse to the Palestinian political work .
People are under oppression by the Palestinian movements and leaders.
He added that all groups should meet and decide together. This is not the case Actually each group decides separately and in my opinion, this is a wrong strategy. It will be a disaster if each group dictates his plan to the Palestinian people and it will be a weakness that the authority cannot afford to face.
Dahlan said that as far as the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza is concerned, Sharon is running away from a loosing battle that has become a heavy burden on the government of Israel. However, Dahlan considers that the Palestinian have achieved a lot from this withdrawal.

Achieving ambitions is the legitimate right of all Tunisians, men and women; and to this end, numerous presidential reforms have been made since the Change, encompassing the various spheres of political, economic, social and cultural life. The starting-point of these is the firmly-established presidential conviction that progress to a level of prosperity in the life of the individual is the legitimate right of every citizen demonstrating his aptitude to progress for the better.
This wealth-creation program of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali caters for an easing of the fiscal pressures and burdens imposed on companies, and the realization of a gradual harmonization between the system used for companies exclusively exporting and the system for companies aimed at the interior market.

So how can we, with the situation thus, ask the ordinary citizen to uphold the law?

The Arab Common Market project: the arguments... and the reality
Sfax - Assabah During the forthcoming period (the beginning of November), Olive harvest activities will commence in the department of Sfax, which will include the entire area of the province (more than 6 million olive plants). These preparations are accompanied by the great relief and full satisfaction of the people of the province and the provincial authorities regarding last season's production and the hope of a harvest in good quantities for this season.
The price of oil fluctuated between 5.2D and 7.2D per kilo, rising from the beginning of the month of February to around 7.3D. This rise in price was explained by the volume of foreign demand. The National Bureau for Oil was able to gather in 32 thousand tons, whilst 110 tons were gathered by private enterprises, noting that 1/3 of the production was considered to represent high-grade oils.
Provincial sources informed us that initial estimates for this season's harvest fluctuate between 140 thousand tons and 160 thousand tons of olives; these estimates were made using the naked eye, and technological methods.
He added that at the end of December, a quantity of chlorophyll is missing from the olive, which is among the few substances which preserve the stability of oil quality on storage.

In response, signs have been raised in Christian areas welcoming resolution 1559. Written upon them is the expression, "Freedom, Sovereignty, Independence", which is the slogan carried by followers of Imad Michel Aoun, the opponent of Syria living in exile in France.
The International Security Council is currently holding expert-level consultation sessions regarding this resolution which, includes a demand for the exit of Syrian forces from Lebanon, and for Damascus to put an end to its interference in the internal affairs of this country.

New York (News Agencies) - The New York Times newspaper said yesterday that the administration of the American president George Bush, with European allies, was looking into the possibility of offering economic incentives to Iran within the context of efforts to persuade it to halt uranium enrichment. The newspaper quoted American and European diplomats as saying that the incentives offered to Iran could include importing of atomic fuel.
Kerry said that if elected as President of the United States he would establish an agreement granting nuclear fuel to Iran for peaceful purposes, within strict regulations, and would pressurize for the enforcement of sanctions if Iran refused. The newspaper stated that the incentives currently under discussion would allow Iran to import fuel for the civilian reactor situated in Bushehr, and might lift the directives preventing Iran from importing spare parts for its outmoded civilian planes.
It arrived in Iran on Monday night, to remain there until Saturday.
In fact, doubts began to be aired a long time ago with regard to this drug and a number of other similar medicines, both from the COXIBS family and the family of Rofecoxib, which are the scientific names for these drugs. Other names which are known and circulated worldwide, such as Vioxx, are only commercial names, which means that it is possible for there to be one scientific name, but many commercial names for the same drug, depending on the laboratory which manufactured the medicine.
However this is the first time that clinical testing measures have taken place with the aim of identifying the types of long term side-effects of this type of medicine ... i.e. over a period of 18 whole entire months!
For our part, we stress that all the experts in the world have advised against alarm or fear with regard to the danger of the situation, since the matter is merely a precautionary measure which it was necessary to take against health complications which might occur, and here we stress the words "might occur" to patients who have been taking this drug over a period of 18 months without interruption!

During this operation a number of books, talismans and pieces of equipment were seized, used by the charlatans in defining the location of the supposed treasure, besides an amount of incense and 15 antique coins, not confirmed as being genuine or forged.
Having been conveyed to security headquarters, the suspects did not take refuge in lies or the denial of responsibility, particularly since the material evidence against them was ample; they admitted the accusations immediately.

At the start of his interrogation, the suspect admitted the accusations, awaiting his handing over to justice. In parallel with this he awaits the school board taking official measures in his respect, to serve as an example to others.
Carthage (TAP): A state visit to Tunisia over the 12th and 13th of October, headed by President Thabo Mbeki, president of the Republic of South Africa, came to an end yesterday afternoon. A parade was organized for the occasion, during which President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali bade farewell to his guest President Thabo Mbeki, and the delegation accompanying him.
Yesterday afternoon a second dialogue took place between President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and President Thabo Mbeki, president of the Republic of South Africa, which was the occasion for a review of matters of common bilateral, regional and international interest.
Within this context, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali expressed Tunisia's desire to see a greater progress in common African activity through its continued support for the African Union. His Excellency the President likewise highlighted the significance of the World Solidarity Fund's contribution to promoting practical treatment of the roots of the crises seen in the African continent.
He invited the President of the State to undertake a visit to South Africa.
Tunis - Assabah: Meetings between a delegation of Tunisian businessmen and around thirty important South African businessmen accompanying President Mbeki on the state visit to Tunisia have resulted in the signing of a treaty of co-operation between businessmen in the two countries. On the sidelines of this event, we encountered Mr. Gilani Ben Mubarak, President of the Tunisian Chamber of Industry and Commerce and Head of the Union of Chambers of Industry and Commerce in the Mediterranean States, and the conversation was as follows:
We are prepared to carry out the political will expressed by the President of the State, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, and his guest President Mbeki, regarding an increase in the level of economic relations and entry into common investments which are beneficial... and profitable...
The partnership may take in numerous sectors. We have commenced dialogue with businessmen in South Africa with regard to co-operation in some very important sectors, such as sanitation, energy, electronics, communications and manufacturing industries...
We perceived this admiration previously in the course of a conference of the Union of Chambers of Industry and Commerce in the Mediterranean States held in Beirut, which elected me as its president, out of admiration for Tunisia and its economic resources. It came as no surprise that I was received by the Lebanese president and the head of his government...
As for the English language, this obstacle has been overcome in Tunisia, and most Tunisian businessmen employ at least four languages, among them Arabic, English, French, Italian and sometimes German or Spanish...
Due to Desertification
Support for an anti-desertification program
Projects of the national anti-desertification program
It has been stated that the total investments allocated to fund the national anti-desertification program and preservation of water resources is around 3 billion dinars during the period of the Tenth Development Plan for 2002/2006, a rise of 23% compared to allocations during the Ninth Plan.
This comes after the recent approval of the negotiation of the administrative council of the Tunisian Central Bank and the decision to issue 400 gold coins worth 100 dinars each, alongside 400 silver coins at a value of 50 dinars each, and 200 silver pieces at a price of ten dinars each, which have legal currency and powers of settlement.
It is anticipated that the coming month, November, will see the organization of the Provincial Conference for Civil Education in the provinces of Tunis and Ariana on the topic of "the role of civil education in citizenship and the development of school life"... a number of inspectors and pedagogical experts will participate in this, alongside a group of front-line teachers and pupils.
The market still seeks its direction
As for the remainder of companies, exchange remained generally weak with regard to SIAME (60 shares), in addition to an absence of trading on the shares of 17 companies. Perhaps the most significant trades, despite their weakness, comprised the STB (4466 shares), STEQ (3600), the Arab Tunisian Bank (1636) and the SFBT (1201).
Towards the provision of additional privileges to Dutch and Tunisian export firms
The second point concerns support for Dutch companies wishing to invest in Tunisia by accommodating them on all levels, in particular with regard to the provision of data and information on the investment climate in Tunisia and the privileges which apply. This will come alongside the material support provided for these organizations by way of a program for sharing foreign markets, financed by Holland.
For his part, the director of the export support department at the Center for Export Promotion, Riadh Attia, indicated that bilateral cooperation between Holland and Tunisia will increase the trade balance existing between the two countries, stating that commercial exchanges between Holland and Tunisia had produced more than 500 million dinars in the year 2003. The trade balance existing between the two countries is considered to be equitable, with estimated revenues of 240 million dinars from exports and 285 million dinars from imports.

This artistic event was considered a supplement to the photography competition based on "Villages and Customs in my Country", which saw the participation of both amateur and professional photographers from all parts of the country. It aimed to promote the art of photography and revive the national heritage.
First prize: Wadi' Mahiri - photograph "Hamida, Takrouna 2004"
In response, Rafiq Al-Qasantini, a graduate of the Institute of Fine Arts specializing in digital photography, explained that informatics have come to form a crucial element of the photograph, due to their effectiveness in transforming its contents according to the desires and needs of its producer. These days digital photographs are a valuable means of communication and can be exchanged or sent within seconds either with a mobile phone or through the internet.
In addition there was a workshop involving the exhibition and discussion of a group of unforgettable pictures in human history.

A New Headquarters for Tunisair in Paris
For the new headquarters of Tunisair stand in one of Paris' high-class areas, the 8th Arrondissement. They were inaugurated by Messrs. Moncer Rouissi, the Tunisian ambassador in Paris and Rafi' Dakhil, the general manager of Tunisair, in the presence of a group of Tunisian and French journalists and Tunisair staff. Likewise the presence was noted of Mr. Francois Lebel, mayor of the 8th Arrondissement of the Paris municipality.
Mr. Rafi' Dakhil says that Tunisair's share in France stands at around 32% of charter and 65% of regular flights. He added during a press conference held in the presence of the Tunisian ambassador that the company, which was counted as being one of the safest companies, would pursue its efforts to beat the competition through a new marketing strategy including a plan which unites renewal and diversification for the period 2006-2015, perhaps the most prominent mark of which is the acquisition of new planes.
Blessings are on the one who absorbs these meanings and acts upon them, particularly during this holy month, and carries them out with transparency and frankness, refraining from distortion or corruption. He devotes himself to fasting with the determination of the sincere and steadfast, rich in good deeds and in control of his desires, refraining from depraved habits and guarding his tongue, economical in his spending and wise in his consumption, pursuing his work in a good and sincere manner and adroit his performance, undertaking his responsibilities and therewith realizing the objectives and goals of fasting.

This year the "Youth Card" distribution campaign will be launched on October 21st, and continue until November 20th. This campaign includes a 50% decrease in the price of the card, i.e. it will become 5 dinars rather than 10. It is equivalent to a student rail subscription. Points of sale will be established within institutions and in public and private university hostels.
During the period from last October up until the end of August this year, more than 31, 800 tons of Tunisian dates were exported. The department of Tozeur is foremost among the areas exporting dates, with an amount of 8240 tons. It seems that the forecast for the current production and export season for dates is extremely good, given the increasing demand for them, in particular from a number of Islamic and some European countries.
As a result of the municipal repairs being carried out to the central market in the El Khadra area of the capital, vendors have been forced to set up outside the market. The resulting mode of work has come give rise to dissatisfaction, in particular in the case of produce which is quick to go off and cannot withstand the heat of the sun, such as fish, fruits, and other items.
Walid Ad-Dara'i
Seven people were killed, among them two Americans, and four others were injured in a bombardment targeting the Khadra area of Baghdad, which is subject to heightened security measures.
The explosions shook the area, which is under heightened protection, where a cloud of black smoke rose up over the location.
In Falluja, two assaults carried out yesterday by American planes resulted in the deaths of five people and the injuries to 13 others, according to the new count from the city's General Hospital.
Deaths among the Iraqi National Guard
On another topic, the Ramadi police announced that armed men had attacked a base of the Iraqi National Guard at dawn yesterday in Ar-Rabtah (450 km to the west of Baghdad) and stolen all of the weapons which were at the location.
Assassinations
It added that the journalist had been working for "Al-Hurriya" television, which belongs to the Kurdistani National Union, under the leadership of Jalal Talabani.
That came hours after the American army announced in two separate statements the death of four of its soldiers in two explosions to in the east of Baghdad.
and Sharon insists on continuing military operations
During the invasion the occupation bulldozers destroyed either totally or partially 34 Palestinian houses.
Sharon yesterday announced the continuation of the current operation in Gaza Sector, while top officers said "it was time" to end it.
On the other hand, another official in the army said "The feasibility of continuing the operation is debatable as the presence of the army in the northern Gaza Strip does not totally prevent the launching of Qassam rockets into Israel."
It is Bush's right to announce that the world is much better after the destruction of the Iraqi people, for when he talks about security he doesn't mean anyone except the United States and some of its allies.
Of course the world is safe after more than two hundred Spanish citizens died in the Madrid train explosion. The world is safe after the painful whack received by Russian students, teachers and parents in a Russian school that Russia is still grieving for and shall not ever forget.
Did he call on his army to depart Iraq and leave the Iraqis to decide their fate without treachery or custodianship?
The question is:
It is true that the attack that hurt the Russian people is terrorist.
The equation is obvious: there is no way to end terrorism and end resistance acts unless the policies of occupation, colonialism and subjugation of nations are ended.
A source at the Ministry of Health clarifies
In the same context, it is probable that the child then started vomiting and developed diarrhea, signs of acquiring Hepatitis A, before the infection spread to three other persons (12, 34 and 36 years of age). They were all taken to the hospital where the medical staff did their utmost during the treatment, resulting in the improvement of the state of the four patients.
On the other hand we contacted a reliable source at the Ministry of Public Health to clarify these cases. He assured that the infection with Hepatitis A is limited, and is treated after carrying out the necessary tests. He added that medicines and vaccinations against this non-dangerous disease are readily available.
3 clandestine departures by sea forestalled and 18 persons apprehended
Even though the driver obeyed the National Guards' signal and stopped on the edge of the road, their suspicions doubled, and they apprehended 5 persons after they admitted that they came from their places of origin to take part in an illegal trip which they had previously arranged with an organizer.

Tunis - Assabah: Thousands of patients visit public hospitals every year, and thousands of nurses and medical staff are allocated to provide various medical services to these patients. The public health sector is given much attention every year with much effort going into improving the level of services in the hospitals.
Fatima Ferchichi is of the same opinion. She is a housewife who visits the hospital regularly to obtain treatment for her disabled son. In Fatima's opinion "it is well known that registration is a difficult problem for the citizen, because not everyone can pay it, especially since the citizen has to pay for the registration and tests, and purchase medications. This makes it hard on those citizens who resort to public hospitals to avoid the expenses he would have to pay in private hospitals."
Waiting: Fatima Ferchichi has this to say about the waiting phenomenon in public hospitals: "I have a disabled son, and every time I bring him to the hospital I end up going home sick. If a normal person gets anxious about waiting, what about the sick person who has to patiently bear his pain while waiting for his turn."
On the other hand, Mrs. N assured us that our hospitals "still suffer from patients and those attending with them losing their tempers as a result of some of the male and female nurses' carelessness and lack of concern for their illness." Samia Jabali
"Usually the patient doesn't come here except after a referral from a private hospital. The practicing doctors in public hospitals are renowned for their competence."
Mrs. Amal assures that "Most of the problems that occur in the hospital are caused by the refusal by the citizen to pay the required fees, especially if he had been examined by one department of the hospital and then sent to another department, in which case he has to pay the fees for two examinations. In this case, the citizen has an excuse, because he is faced with an error and he has to bear the consequences of that error. Samia
Apart from a few consumers who dropped into the Company's abattoir, we did not notice much movement in the first hours of the morning in the sales outlet, until ten, when we saw a number of comers in taxis or on foot, starting to show up.
The process of coordinating supplies of this sales outlet depends on the levels of attendance and what the demand dictates. As a result, there are no defined quotas. Our speaker, who has described the attendance as good, said that the citizen can obtain what amounts he needs by himself without limitations. She stressed that all supplied meats are completely health assured and meet all quality and safety standards, and are being closely controlled during the various stages of supply.

10 Dinars worth of free calls with each 30 Dinars recharge. Tunis - Assabah: Since yesterday, Tunisia Telecom has started a special plan for the occasion of the month of Ramadan, which stipulates the lowering of sign-up fees for billable or pre-paid line to 30 Dinars.
In regards to the Multimedia Messaging Service MMS, the provision of which service the Tunisia Telecom has started preparing some time ago, Mr. Ahmed Mahjoub has stated that this service will be available soon and assured that the project is ready but is being trialed technically to ensure the quality and effectiveness of the service provided by the Multimedia Messaging Service. He pointed out that this project is part of the preparations for Tunisia to host the second stage of the World Summit on the Information Society in November 2005.
The company is working continually on expanding the network capacity and investments are continuing in this area, having exceeded 2 million Dinars in the year 2004.
Tunis - Assabah: The second mobile phone operator "Tunisiana" has begun recently to market new services aimed essentially at businessmen. These services are considered state-of-the-art in the communications field and consist of the double offer of "Autoiste" and the Mobile Office Services.
The Mobile Office Service enables the owner of a regular line or a business line to enjoy four services at the same time. These are professional voice messages, Mobile Fax-mail, Fax and Mobile Internet. To enable the owner of the line to use the Mobile Fax-mail and the Fax separately, the company offers a separate number for this service, allowing the professional to have all the services he enjoys in his own office.
Tunis - Assabah: The Tunisian Railways National Company welcomed the great month of Ramadan by preparing new timetables for metropolitan trains, as well as for trains to areas south of the capital and to the coastal areas. The special operating times for this month were taken into account on the one hand, and the times for Iftar on the other, in addition to the economic activity seen in the capital through the second half of Ramadan.
It is worth adding that the number of trains made available to clients amounts 119 trains daily during the first twenty days of Ramadan, increasing to 127 trains daily during the last ten days of the great month. These trains work 22 out of the 24 hours, with station masters and train guards available until Iftar time to ensure regular working.

First Operation

We did not see this shameful picture during our tour of some of the main areas and the Central Market. It seems that the abundance of products, plenty of supplies and the saturation of distribution outlets of various levels early on have prevented the appearance of this behavior. The relevant authorities had pumped into the markets significant amounts of various types of products one week ahead of Ramadan's start.
What we hope for now is that this situation continues and that supplies are coordinated regularly throughout Ramadan, hoping that the sights of bemoaning the size of Ramadan's shopping bags of long ago will no longer remain with us.
The Administration had asked the Party to amend certain paragraphs in the Elections Program because of some of these paragraphs' "illegal" content or strong, albeit politely worded, language.
According to information obtained by Assabah, the two sides reached an agreement about the wording and form of the second amendments. The Administration, however, then asked for new amendments. After negotiations between the two parties, the Observation Committee informed the body of the Party about Administration's concurrence. However, the Party's politburo had hastily convened an emergency meeting during which it decided to reject any amendments to the Elections Program, and to adhere to the initial version.

Occupied Al-Quds (news agencies) - Experts from the World Health Organization warned that the repeated closure operations intentionally done by the Israeli army to isolate Palestinian areas cause a critical deterioration in health conditions among Palestinians.
He explained that both doctors and ambulances find it difficult to assist those in need, since more than 50 ambulance cars were attacked by the Israeli army in the past five months of this year.
Skafi also spoke about "increases amounting to 21% in the past four years of malnutrition in children and in pregnant women because of anemia."
New explosions and attacks on 5 churches in Baghdad

Eye witnesses said these forces had closed the main roads and established check points.
Iraqi medical sources said that the attack resulted in the death of eight and the injury of 16 persons.

Other productions will be screened later after the coming Al-Adha feast.
It was decided to screen Omar Sharif's latest film, "Monsieur Ibrahim" in Tunisian theatres at the start of the coming Ramadan feast.
Mohsin Ben Ahmed
We asked about this problem Mr Khamis Bou Ali who is a secondary school inspector with the Ministry of Education and Training. He offered us a few suggestions for solving this problem in colleges. He said that any tardiness by the student means wasting academic time. This time is measured and set to meet the content of what the teachers present. Thus, any waste of this time affects the student's acquisition of learning and therefore affects its formation and the coordination of this formation, and especially its results.
Mr. Bou Ali pointed out that parents don't come to school except rarely, and do not follow up on their children's progress except close to final examinations. Most of them have no knowledge of their children's tardiness.
He mentioned that it might be better for students to be "semi-resident" at their schools, so as to revise during their break time. This will consequently prevent the problem of remaining on the streets during the hours in which they are not studying.
This in addition to the pedagogical role played by the teacher since he has the most contact with the student at school.

In response to the American Duelfer report on Iraqi weapons:
The report prepared by the American chief weapons inspector in Iraq, Charles Duelfer, published last Wednesday in Washington stated that Iraqi intelligence tried to bribe a number of states with oil export contracts.
He continued, "I don't believe this at all."
Anan said, "I cannot say the world is safer when you consider the violence around us, when you look around you and see the terrorist attacks around the world and you see what is going on in Iraq."
Duelfer's report alleged that since June 2000, Iraq gave France approximately 15% of all contracts entered into within the Oil-for-Food Program.
The editor of the internet published newspaper Politikon, Zdenka Ulmannova, who is part of the efforts to create this party, said that it has started gathering the signatures necessary to lodge a registration application for the party and that men will be allowed to join it but will have to take into consideration that they will not feature on its election lists.
According to the law in the Czech Republic the license to establish a political party needs the collection of at least one thousand signatures of persons who support its program and goals. Ulmannova does not see this as a problem, and believes that the party will not only be able to participate in the coming parliamentary elections scheduled for summer 2006, but obtain parliamentary seats as well.
Then vote for women!"
Cook said that contrary to the British forces, the American forces employ aggressive methods towards the Iraqi people, causing anger among the Iraqis.
Paul Adams, the British Boradcasting and Television Corporation (BBC) defense correspondent, said that some believe an American military force is involved in combat operations in Fallujah, and that the British Government considers the request made by the American forces for re-deployment of the British forces in Baghdad as a replacement of the American forces by the British forces.
He said, "Last time the American forces attacked Fallujah they left behind one thousand civilian casualties. There is widespread anger in Iraq because of these violent actions, and there is the risk that if the British forces take the place of American forces, the British forces may become responsible too for what is happening to Fallujah residents."
Loses of the American occupation in Iraq escalating
In Fallujah, the suburb of Jolan suffered massive shelling by American tanks stationed on the highway. American aircraft also bombed houses and shops in Al-Askari and Al-Sina'i suburbs.
Residents of the city assert that the air strikes kill only civilians.
In a previous field development, two helicopters belonging to the American Army crashed in the evening of the day before yesterday south west of Baghdad, resulting in the death of two American soldiers and injuring two others of its crew members.
It should be mentioned that the American Army has lost no less than 27 helicopters since invading Iraq last March.
Police in Karbala city said that those slain were part of a group that had finished its training in Jordan, and were on their way back after finishing their training course.
State Department for National Security Affairs announced in a statement, a copy of which was received by the Agence France Presse, "We call on the sons and tribes of Fallujah to immediately start expelling foreign terrorists and empty all suburbs in the city of these murderers and their criminal supporters who want to disturb the security and stability of our country."
Washington (News Agencies) American sources have revealed new torture practices against detainees in the American base in Guantanamo, Cuba, which confirm that these tactics are widespread and not just individual practices as the American Defense Department alleges.
Refused to comment
A number of states also objected to their citizens being detained in Guantanamo with their governments strongly interceding with the American administration to have them handed over to them as happened with Britain, European and Arab countries.
The timing of this case coincided with the first night of the month of Ramadan, when talk usually intensifies about the "hashish" which can sometimes cause unpredictable tragedies.

Tunis - Assabah: Mr. Mohamed Mounir El Beji, president of the Liberal Social Party and candidate for the coming presidential elections chose to begin his presidential election campaign one week prior to the elections time.
He emphasized that the principles of the Liberal Social Party call for defending Tunisia's Arab Muslim identity, support women rights and gains and strengthening modernization.

Tunis - Assabah: How will the general polling process be organized next Sunday?
We posed these questions to Mr. Abdelwaheb El Behi, Cairman of the National Elections Observatory. He stated that "the issue has been legally regulated by Decree No. 1564 issued on the 14th of last July, calling on the voters to vote on October 24th, then by the decree issued two weeks ago which ordered that polling stations be opened during this year's elections, as an exception, from seven thirty in the morning and closed at four thirty in the afternoon, that is about an hour and ten minutes prior to the Iftar time.
And if yes, who will supervise the ballot boxes?
Subsequently, ballot boxes, electoral files and the district registers are collected at the municipal level before being sent to provincial centers in preparation to being referred to the national level. After that, initial results are announced at night in the Ministry of Interior. The Minister of Interior will announce all the results at a press conference on Monday morning, and the results become official after the Constitutional Assembly authorizes them.
The National Observatory has raised this issue with the Administration representatives and were told that the issue has sometimes to do with unclear addresses and changing residence.
Commenting on this question, the Chairman of the National Observatory said that the Observatory was in touch with all lists, regionally and nationally, and that it interceded with the Administration in attempt to settle certain issues which arose in some districts, "and generally speaking the Administration acted affirmatively."
The Minister for Religious Affairs in a press conference:
For example, a large number of elegant carpets were distributed to different governorates with the permission of His Excellency the President of the Republic, to be spread in a number of mosques and religious landmarks.
The Minister said that a list of subjects was prepared by the departments of the Ministry for Religious Affairs and sent to their Excellencies the Governors, to draw upon when preparing the content of the religious lectures and entertainment by whoever will be presenting them. These subjects all revolve around the tolerant principles of the Muslim religion and highlight its noble values such as the value of solidarity, moderation, and praise of labour as a manner of worship.
One of the important milestones in the program of religious activities held during the month of Great Ramadan is the International Holy Koran Memorization, Recitation and Interpretation Competition. This is an innovative competition whose revival was permitted by the Head of the State, and is organized under his Excellency's supervision in the last ten nights. The Minister, speaking about this year's competition, informed that the number of participating states has increased on account of three new states joining in. Thus the number of participating states has reached 14.
Although this award itself is young (this year being its second round), it has become an internationally outstanding event in the Muslim World, with researchers, academics and intellectuals from all parts of the Muslim World competing in it to present the enlightened, interpretative and innovative aspects of Islamic thought.
Chairman of International Accor Tourist Group:
Plan for Reform
This question was answered by Mr. Gerard Pelisson, who said that the construction of two hotels was planned close to the airport, but the high land prices on the one hand and the impossibility to have the hotel directly open onto the airport on the other made the project infeasible.
The future of the sector
The General Directorate for the Intermediate and Secondary Education at the Ministry of Education and Training issued this year's continual supervision pamphlet designed for the intermediate schools and secondary colleges, which organizes the various stages of tests, supervised assignments and essay writing.
Foreign Investment
There are 212 Belgian corporations investing in Tunisia, their investments sized at 247.6 million Dinars and containing around 24,712 jobs. As regards private investors in Tunisia, Netherlands registers its presence among the European nations with total investments at 282.8 million Dinars, employing 10,812 workers.
Huge attendance and joyful, festive atmosphere
Singer Insaf was introduced by the lively artist Jaloul Jelassi who himself contributed to the success of the concert with his monologues. Some of these we knew and some others he made up as things occurred. Among these was his performance of a song by Nancy Ajram with the voice of the late artist Ali Riahi.
His innovations lie in adopting eurhythmic songs to grab the attention of young Arabs absorbed by Western songs for lack of an artist the caliber of Abdel Halim Hafez, despite the proliferation of voices after his demise. These voices were however copies and nothing beats the original.
And because Ragheb Alama loves his Tunisian audience and considers that it was a grand occasion, he released a new song, saying:
Loving you is insufficient
At the end of the concert the Hammadi Ben Ammar's sector in Halq Al-Wadi and the support committee for President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali granted a certificate of appreciation to singer Ragheb Alama who sang throughout the concert while holding the red booklet..
Adel Bouallag's "The Caravan": The wind when it uncovers things
"What drew our attention was the desert scene with its two aspects. In the first, the mirage prevails, with the desert's revealing rays weaving misty fantasies around it. The second is the real aspect of the desert, covered in factors of oblivion. The tourist scene, with its profit dimensions, prevails over the spiritual scene.
The second motive for producing "The Caravan" is the East and West dilemma, or that of the South and the North, the matter of secularization and the economies of the southern countries, and the issue of abuse of the rights of nations to self determination.
The south wind drags

Iraq: 14 killed and 52 injured in new explosions and acts of violence
Col. Adnan Abdul Rahman said that "the attack at hour local time using a car loaded with around 500 to 600 kgs of explosives"
This is the first assault in the Iraqi capital since the beginning of the month of Ramadan.
In the suburb of Jadiriya, south of Baghdad, a student was killed in his car and two others injured when a bomb exploded according to Wi'am Riyadh who owns a kiosk selling cigarettes in the area.
Also, the beheaded body of an Iraqi working as an interpreter for the American forces was found south of the city of Mosul.
Release
When asked about the possible return to negotiations with the government he responded that releasing Sheikh Khaled, "is a step in the right direction and that if shelling stops it will be a second positive step, and we could then reopen negotiation channels."
The Iraqi official told Reuters that the step aimed at halting the flow of arms into Sadr City, one of the Shia militants' strongholds in the capital Baghdad.
a possible violent confrontation between Sharon and the settlers
We are moving towards a confrontation."
On his behalf, Yehoshua Mor-Yussef, secretary general of settlers council told the public radio "We met with a prime minister deaf to our demands who read a set of texts prepared for him by his advisors.
And despite Sharon's currently ultimate rejection of such a suggestion, calls for organizing a referendum about the issue are beginning to increase.
It is expected that his plan will be presented for voting in the Parliament on October 25th .
On the diplomatic front, French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier started on Sunday afternoon his visit to Israel which may last longer than 48 hours, and which confirms the two countries' intention to restart dialogue after a period of convulsion.
The paper stated that these plans entail the deployment of 650 soldiers from the Scottish "Black Watch" regiment currently stationed in Basra as a reserve force in southern Baghdad and other cities such as Al Iskandariyah, Al Latifiyah and Al Mahmudiyah.
A spokesman for the British Ministry of Defense confirmed the day before yesterday to Agence France-Presse that Britain is studying a request from the Unites States for deployment of its forces in the Iraqi areas controlled by the American command, but that London refuses to send its forces to Baghdad or Fallujah.
President Ben Ali signs a decree regulating school life.

Religious landmarks in Tunisia: Change is the best proof of reconciliation with self and identity
The recent permission of his Excellency to distribute quantities of carpets to be spread in a number of religious landmarks in various provinces of the republic is the best proof of this sublime presidential care which translates through work and implementation the real reconciliation with self and identity as it was promised by the architect of this blessed transformation in his pioneering historical address at dawn of the eternal November 7th.
Current Issue
According to these organizations' diagnosis, the causes lie in the following points: misuse of public resources (expenditure greatly exceeding resources), corruption, lack of feasibility in public projects (jobs exceed needs) so that such institutions are described as "cathedrals".
- The presence of side effects of the production and consumption processes, whether they be positive or negative, with the state being invited to compensate the society and deal with these effects.
These were the arguments presented by the neoconservatives for decreasing the role of the state, which the international financial institutions adopted to promote a reform program in developing countries. It failed, as it is known, especially in African and Latin American states because it lacked methodology and timescales, dependant as it was on immediate execution without constraints or conditions, and because it did not take into account the cultural and economic specifics of these states to facilitate the transition from one economic system to another.
25% increase in production
According to the same source, leasing companies listed on the stock exchange have registered a slight decrease in their earnings, though they were almost increased by 14% if we excluded the Amen Leasing which suffers costs of loan recovery that are higher than the value of its net revenue.
A Tourist Circumstance
Massive participation in largest international exhibitions
In a step that seemed to have come in response to the recommendations made by the strategic study and national consultation into the improvement of the tourist sector, the latest meeting of the Ministerial Council issued a decision to permit the traditional handicrafts sector the benefits of loans from the Fund for Industrial Promotion and Decentralization (FOPRODI), thus allowing the funding of projects which exceed 50 thousand Dinars in costs.

Baghdad - Fallujah (News Agencies) An Iraqi National Guard Forces headquarters in the neighborhood of Mashahidah, north of Baghdad, suffered an attack yesterday morning of Howitzer mortars which resulted - according to sources from the Defense Ministry - in four dead and more than 80 injured.
Iraqi police sources stated that violent battles raged yesterday morning in the southern neighborhoods of the town, while American and Iraqi forces were deployed in other suburbs and demanded through megaphones that the residents hand over a number of wanted persons.
On the other hand, an oil export pipeline in northern Iraq was attacked when unknown persons detonated an explosive which set one of its sectors on fire yesterday morning.
The American army alleged in a statement that the shelling targeted "hideouts and arms stores of Abu Musab Al Zarqawi's network.
With the events
And did the Commissioner General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, Peter Hansen, need to wait until Israel completed its "Days of Penitence" operation staged against the Jabalaya Palestinian refugee camp to condemn these operations and consider them illegal and unjustifiable?
This is not the first time that Israel has perpetrated such a crime and it will surely not be the last. There is no doubt that what happened in Jabalaya camp is but a link added to many bloody links.
The Human Rights Watch report pointed out, for the first time, that it is essential for America to stop providing Israel with the bulldozers used for destroying houses and rendering the residents homeless.
and voting starts in Florida
This position adopted prior to September 11th is not going to protect our country at all."
The Democrat candidate had previously accused Bush of ignoring advice from the military regarding Iraq in an "insolent, dogmatic and arrogant" way.
The commentator asks, "Are Kerry and his left-wing allies a risk we can allow ourselves to take now?"
On the other hand in Florida, which remains one of the disputed states in the White House race as happened in 2000, the electorate has started voting the day before yesterday for the two candidates, the Republican president George Bush and his rival Democrat John Kerry, two weeks prior to the official start of the elections.
Two public opinion polls published at the end of the week showed that the two candidates are very close in this important state which has 27 large electors.
In this inconclusive battle Kerry has the support of a number of large newspapers in Florida, such as Miami Herald, St. Petersburg Times, Florida Today and Sun Sentinel.
France calls for vote on a new resolution against Syria
The proposed resolution sponsored by France and the United States calls on Damascus to comply with the requirements of a previous Security Council resolution demanding that Syria withdraws its troops from Lebanon.
It must be pointed out that declarations are more lenient than Security Council resolutions which are legally binding on all United Nations' 191 member states.
The day after the resolution was adopted on September 2nd, the Lebanese Parliament amended the constitution to extend the mandate of the Republic's President Emile Lahoud, who is Syria's ally, for three years.
" History teaches us that we don't choose our adversary"
The French Foreign Affairs Minister enquired on his third day of visiting Israel, "Have you heard in world history of peace between nations separated by walls?"
Europeans in general, and not just the French, are finding it difficult to accept the constant deterioration of the Palestinians' situation.
Yes, the Europeans are wondering about this, and they're waiting for answers."
The poll, performed for the American television network CNN and the newspaper "USA Today" showed that between October 14th and 16th about 51% of people deemed Kerry more qualified than President Bush (45%) to solve economic problems and promote the economy.
The poll included 1013 Americans.
The polls was conducted between September 15th and October 10th and included 850 blacks, with an error margin of 3.5 points.
Habash described the rumors about potential airlifting Arafat to Cairo for medical reasons as "rumors through which Israel aims either to remove the President from his homeland and rendering him homeless, or to prepare for his assassination in a way that would make his death look natural, by incessant talking about his deteriorating health."
The candidate for the Progressive Democratic Party in Kairouan electoral district, Mr. Rachid Khachana, invited to a televised debate one of the heads of the Democratic Constitutional Rally's lists in the legislative elections.

Why hasn't commercial activity started yet?
Since the start of the month of Ramadan, the Consumer Defense Organization has alerted the consumers, through preparatory meetings coordinated with Ministry of Trade, to the necessity of citizens to purchase all their needs early, so as to have the opportunity to choose and to avoid burdening the family budget by engaging in buying the feast requirements from sweets to clothing all at the same time, often being forced to borrow.
Some of the citizens we met mentioned the necessity to encourage shop owners to participate in stimulating activity in the center of the capital during the month of Ramadan as well as during ordinary days, when shops close early.
Under the slogan "Regular supply, moderate consumption", the regional office of the Consumer Defense Organization in Sfax started on the occasion of the blessed month of Ramadan implementing a program of gathering information and fieldwork to benefit the consumer. The aim is to encourage the consumer to adopt a moderate consumerist attitude, avoid all aspects of prodigality and wisely use the family budget.
On the hand it has been decided to contribute to the national program for energy control through promotion and information gathering aiming at changing some negative behaviors during the month of Ramadan, examples of which are overuse of power, gas and wasting fuel, all of which reflects adversely on the family's budget specifically and on the national economy generally.
Chairman of the Central Bank in Conference on Full Convertibility of Tunisian Dinar:
Tawfiq Bakkar also mentioned that the coming period is a period for building information commerce with 1.25% of gross national product - the balance for scientific research in 2009 will be around 640 million dinars - allocated to technological and research programs.
In addition, this gradual approach toward complete liberalization of the dinar is aimed at preparing Tunisian enterprises for the globalization phase and paving the way for them to take their place in the world through facilitating investment abroad or ownership of shares in foreign companies.
3 Days Prior to Raising the Issue of Withdrawal from Gaza at the Knesset:
The widely distributed newspaper "Yediot Ahronot" headlined its front page with "Country Under Great Pressure."
Settlers, right-wing parties and "fundamentalists" in the Likud party pledged to wreck the plan.
Since his adoption of the separation plan with the Palestinians in June, Sharon has lost the majority he had previously enjoyed in parliament.
Movaz warned against tearing apart the Jewish state by the rabbis' calls to soldiers to refuse orders to vacate settlements in the Gaza Strip in accordance with the unilateral separation plan which he is trying to get the Shas party to agree to.
"New York Times"
A." expected the American forces to be welcomed with flowers at a time when Kurdish leader Masoud al-Barzani refused to describe occupying American forces as the enemy.
The newspaper added that one of the erroneous readings of the Iraqi strategy was exemplified by the failure of central intelligence to foresee the role of Saddam Hussein's militia forces which carried out many of the principal attacks against American forces in southern Iraq and took them by surprise in bloody battles, in addition to its failure to pinpoint the huge weapons stockpiles hidden in mosques and schools to equip fighters with weapons, in spite of the Central Intelligence Agency being aware of the existence of vast weapons inside Iraq.
Al-Hariri's resignation and the Lebanese opposition's refusal to participate in the next government has given President of the Republic Emile Lahoud, Syria's ally, a free hand to choose the head of government.
The banker went on to say "given al-Hariri's standing, any other government will necessarily be regarded as an intransigent ministry," alluding to the support the resigned prime minister enjoys from Western countries such as France and the Gulf Arab states whose citizens made large investments in Lebanon during his reign.
Confirming this, deputy and Druze leader Walid Jumblatt confirmed on Wednesday evening that his parliamentary bloc, which includes 18 deputies, refused to take part in these negotiations, considering that the question of the government's future was decided when President Lahoud's term in office was extended on September 3rd.
Jumblatt warned on Wednesday against "the merry-go-round of political violence" after an assassination attempt against Marwan Hamada, one of the four ministers who resigned.
Lebanese sources said the new government will include 30 ministers, among them twenty from the resigned cabinet.
Karami, a close ally of Syria, entered the political scene after the assassination of his brother Rashid Karami in 1987.

Among these breaches, al-Shabi mentioned the hiding of his party's election agenda and allowing another opposition party to use yellow which has symbolized the party's lists since the eighties, not allowing his party's candidates the opportunity of political and media maneuvering and dropping 5 of the party's lists, including the lists for Tunis, Safqas and Bajah.
Al-Shabi denied the accusation of triggering a media and political crisis with the administration on the eve of the elections because he wanted to stand out and be in the limelight.

16 Killed and 46 Wounded in Anbar and Samarra:
An Iraqi police source said ten people were killed and another 40 wounded in a suicide attack against a police volunteer center in the town of Baghdadi (220 km) west of Baghdad.
Elsewhere, nine armed men and three others were wounded in clashes with American soldiers the day before yesterday in Bahrez to the northeast of Baghdad while six others were wounded in the morning in a bomb attack on an American convoy passing through to the west of Baghdad.
Medical sources and eye witnesses said in the morning that four Iraqis, including a child, were wounded in clashes between gunmen and an American patrol in the area.
An Agence France Presse correspondent noted that four Humvee vehicles barricaded the northern entrance to the town as American helicopters circled overhead.
Shortly after, the army announced the number of wounded as six.
The army said in a statement that the man, whose identity has not been specified, was captured in the course of an operation targeting "a hideout in southern Fallujah."
The statement said: "Abu Musab al Zarqawi's followers come to Fallujah to hide among the civilian population" and called on residents to "come forward with information on the whereabouts of al Zarqawi's followers."

went to fill the coffers of international organizations and companies, the truth is that these statements are intended to be a response to many of the areas of shortcoming and the trials which bear witness to the organization's failure to shoulder the role it was created for.
And no doubt in the tragedy of the Palestinian people, which started even before the United Nations was created and which it hoped it would join over the past decades, and in particular since the creation of Israel was announced within the womb of the United Nations itself, there is enough to list the stages of this continuing tragedy before Israel announced its renunciation and contempt of all the laws and standards which led to its presence within the nations of the world and gave it the right to join the United Nations.
Criminal department number 11 at the Tunis Appellate Court looked into a strange case involving four defendants aged between 27 and 59 years.

"I was surprised by the large number of Tunisians turning out at the polling stations to elect the country's president and their representatives in parliament, especially women of different ages and educational levels, in a very normal atmosphere. I think privacy in polling stations is an important matter in conferring transparency and credibility on these elections which represent a vital step in deepening the democratic trend in Tunisia."
Mr. Adbulhameed Belkadhi, president of the Socialist Union of Popular forces, Kingdom of Morocco:
Mr. Antoine Aql, honorary president of the International Lawyers' Association:
Tunis - weekly: Tunisians, of all social groups, often abandon reasonable and sensible consumption during the month of Ramadan. The common trait, with everyone, is to flock to buy and spend products. Statistics show that the consumption of food products of all types multiplies by hundreds of times compared to normal times, for example bread consumption rises by 30%, meat and poultry by 30 to 50%, eggs by 98%, fish by 250% and dates by 408%.
In this context, Mr. Altaher al-Gharbi of the National Food Institute says that physical and mental activity lessen during the month of Ramadan compared to normal days and so, logically, should the relative amount of food consumed by a person, but this contrary to what happens.
In it, we find all kinds of meats and fruits as well as sweets, carbonated beverages, dried fruits... the list grows with appetites at Ramadan with no relation to "each according to his means."
Another aspect is no less important and that is the health repercussions of unwise eating habits. Sources at the National Food Institute say that many citizens whose health deteriorates come to the Institute during the month of Ramadan as a result of overeating and consuming large quantities of fats and sugars. Some of those whose condition worsens during the month of Ramadan are those with diabetes and hypercholesterolemia who are meant to follow a specific diet and retain a good nutritional balance in each meal but they forget this when faced with the appetites of the month of Ramadan!
Surely the consumer has a right to know the price and conveniently choose and compare the cost of goods?
17% of professionals fully or partially display prices but in an unclear manner.
this section has various kinds of poultry, pigeons, partridge, rabbits, all animals we like to eat once in a while and when we come here, we find no indication of price so we have to ask and prices vary from one vendor to another without us knowing which one is right."
Other sectors as well
When the consumer has to choose between asking for prices to be displayed or contacting a consumer protection organization or the Ministry of Tourism, Trade and Crafts, he may come across some problems with vendors, especially if he chooses the first option.
The Consumer Protection Organization and Ministry of Trade agencies are his only recourse in this context and he has to resort to them because displaying prices is one of his basic rights regardless of the breaches.
However, we know that it is normal for a married man to wear a wedding ring but what is noticeable is that a large number of married men do not do so and for a myriad of reasons.

Of course, the question of wedding rings does not cover all married couples because however much we try, we cannot read the minds and intentions of every single person.

The poet Mohamed Al-Saghir Awlaad Ahmed said at a Ramadan soiree last Wednesday, where the Tunis City Cultural Center audience met as part of the cultural society's monthly activity in this space, that the song played no role in his becoming a well-known poet...
My relationship with Amina is one of shared humanity
Happy with this experience
In talking about Arabic songs today, Mohamed Al-Saghir Awlaad Ahmed said we are nearly always dealing with one song only in terms of content. The Arab world has distinguished composers, musicians and performers but an abject paucity of lyrics which are both convincing and enjoyable because the noble message of art is not a solution to the creator's personal problems... the message of art is nobler and bigger than this general direction Arabic song is taking. In brief, if all poems continue to center on one subject only, then the song will not progress.
49 Bodies Found of Recruits in New Iraqi Army:

Two martyrs in Gaza... and Israeli incursion into Nablus camp
Palestinian sources said the two martyrs were Abu Mustapha and Sharif Muslim, both aged twenty. They were killed by a missile fired by an Israeli reconnaissance plane and were part of a group of six people who were on what appears to be a night watch patrol in anticipation of an Israeli incursion.
He added "in the coming week, a first draft of the project will be voted on at the Knesset."
In a Suicide Attack Claimed by the "Taliban" Movement:
The spokesman was not able to give the victim's age or identity.

The last attack in Kabul on August 29 led to nine people being killed, among them two Americans, when a car bomb exploded outside a building containing the offices of American security company, "Deancorp," which provides security for the Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
We learned that the suspect was brought before the judicial authorities at the Court of First Instance in Soussa in a state of arrest and that a prison warrant has been issued until he appears in court.
A few days later, he received the treasure but later found that the coins in his possession were not gold and realized he had fallen into the trap of a clever swindler.

On the other side - the south - of the Mediterranean, there is a question that begs to be asked and that is: what conception do the Mediterranean partners have about the nature of this relationship?
The European Union is also relatively politically resigned with regard to issues concerning the region, particularly the Arab-Israeli conflict, a conflict with dangerous repercussions in terms of the region's security and stability, since intervention is limited to funding and does not involve internal politics in general.

Occupied Jerusalem (FP) - Members of the Israeli Knesset voted yesterday evening in favor of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's plan for withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and some of the settlements in the West Bank next year.
In a moderate speech the day before yesterday, Sharon strove to reassure international public opinion and the Arab countries neighboring Israel about his intentions, saying that the plan was not aimed at freezing the political process with the Palestinians.
Sharon, who was interrupted many times forcing head of parliament Raufain Revlin to dismiss far-right deputies strongly opposed to the disengagement plan, added "we cannot forever rule millions of Palestinians whose numbers are increasing generation after generation."
Sharon made a strong appeal to settlers in Gosh Emonim, who have been loyal to him over a long period of time, to behave in a responsible manner and act as a barrier against "enmity between brothers" and "deadly extremism."
He went on "I will make every effort to reach peace" with the Palestinians, stressing that his country was facing a "critical choice" and adding that "we will not succeed in our task by force alone."
Missing explosives.
The months following the fall of Baghdad and invasion of Iraq were marked by a series of political crises and scandals and no doubt the scandal of tons of missing explosives will not be the last link in this long chain but may just be a new chapter added to previous chapters of the war in Iraq and which may contribute to revealing some missing threads at the present time.
While waiting for the American administration to solve the puzzle of the vanishing explosives or openly admit its failure to control the security situation in Iraq, Iraqis find themselves facing further fears about what use the vast explosives might be put with the prevailing situation in Iraq and the absence of peace and stability.

No Breaches in Presidential and Parliamentary Elections in Tunisia
- Arab and foreign observers cannot replace local observers and representatives of the opposition candidates, but the presence of foreign observers was one of the means which induced all parties to abide by the law and avoid any rigging or pressure on the electors.
- I believe the success of the Arab observers' mission in a number of Arab countries such as Algeria, Tunisia, Sudan and Djibouti, may encourage the creation of an Arab observatory to monitor elections in Arab countries in order to prove to the world that the Arabs, leaders and people, have a strong belief in the democratic course.

But all this remained imprisoned within the walls of parliament and the wording of the official guidelines of the Tunisian republic for neither the Tunisian newspapers reflected this controversy and debate, with the exception of some newspapers which can be counted on the fingers of one hand, nor did this rapprochement develop into positions on the laws brought before parliament.

A significant cross section of Tunisians is deprived every year of enjoying such atmospheres. This cross section is the class of students who spend Ramadan away from family because of their studies. We can almost say that female students miss being away from home, family, and Ramadan ambiance much more.
Najlaa, an Arabic-major freshman student says: This is my first year for me at the residence, and, therefore, spending the month of Ramadan away from my family is really a difficult thing for me, but the ambiance at the residence compensates somewhat for my missing the family setting since we make sure at the residence to have breakfast together. As for evenings, we spend them in front of the television or at the residence when the residence management organizes active and cultural evenings inside the residence.
Therefore, they have no problems with the residence owners.

When the Arab imagination is incapable of creating laughter
Although the Arab satellite stations made us truly enjoy these clips, they made us face a painful reality represented in the failure of the Arab imagination incapability to create laughter. The Hidden Camera was tried for years and years and started to lose its appeal year after year because its creators assumed it was easy. So they fabricated it and turned it into pre-planned sketches, which was realized by the audience. Besides, it has become repetitive and old and lost its humor. As a matter of fact, some clips were inspired by the comic clips we mentioned.
An Evening With Singer Ali Al Deek Who Comes from Syrian Countryside:
The audience was surprised to know that this artist has to his credit many mountainous rural songs that bring together the Syrian, Iraqi, Lebanese, Jordanian, and Palestinian. His songs have a unique sweetness, and his voice has an artistic depth that does not exist in any of the artists in the Arab Orient, specifically in Syria. The song is one of those dancing songs to the point of hysteria if you will, but not the type of sick hysteria. It is the addiction that music inspires when it is beautiful and stimulating to the human soul.
In a word, this evening was enjoyable. It uncovered a real artist who knew how to preserve the sweet, rural Syrian song with its dance movements and rhythms, and with its heroic stories and magnificent virgin love.. This is combined with interacting with modern rhythms, use of modern instruments, and appeal for quiet dancing.. or rowdy dancing to the point of addiction, as it is known to fans of authentic Arabic singing.

This event recurred with George Bush senior, whose military victory in the second Gulf War for the liberation of Kuwait did not help him.
Although Bush and Kerry intentionally outbid each other, during the three debates that brought them together, as far as Israel's security was concerned, each of them also was careful not to bring up the Palestinian issue, which was discussed only causally and at occasions memory fails to recall.
No matter what changes that the next American administration, whether Republican or Democrat, makes in direction or plans during the rest of the first decade of the twenty-first century, America's interests and priorities will remain the same as the current interests that were set by former leaders in the White House and which dictate that America maintains dominance over the energy resources in the world and will not allow anyone to threaten such interests.

Topic of the Hour: Demographic Transformations
So, what is behind these transformations, and what is the extent of their impact on the course of development and also the impact on public choices in terms of managing expenditures?
This impact will be severe in the developing countries since the growth rate will shrink by a half point during the next fifty years. Also, savings will shrink, and consequently, investments will slump, as the elderly usually consume during retirement all means of savings available to them, which will reflect on the current balances of these countries due to the rise in expenditures to finance social funds.
Conversely, the developing countries do experience other types of problems. The ratio of young people in these societies is an asset that supports economic growth, provided that good training is made available, and consequently, providing significant financial resources to build the basic infrastructure that is appropriate for modern factors such as health and research.. Also, all of these countries are urged to plan now for adapting their budgets on retirement and health regulations in order not to experience a deficit in the financial resources allocated for these areas and to avoid what is happening in Germany now, for instance.

Kerry throws in the towel...
The Kerry camp opted not to wait for the results of the undecided state of Ohio and the states of New Mexico, Iowa, and Wisconsin after it was clear that Bush had advanced by a margin of more than 3.5 million votes and at a ratio of 51% of the votes versus 48% for Kerry.

85% of those who voted for Bush said that they chose him because he is a strong leader, a description 13% of those who voted for Kerry attributed to him.
If the result is confirmed, Daschle would become the first Senate leader to lose his seat in more than half a century.

I want to apologize for the premature title that I wrote in a hurry,
here are the key words that are able to summarize this imminent political moment: resistance,
standing in front of you coinciding with the fourth anniversary for liberation of Lebanon,
its glorious lessons taught every Arabic citizen,
Here we have to remember the "April understanding" which; embodied one of the most successful diplomatic battles in establishing the right of citizens of an occupied land to resist,
with Syria’s coordination and its supervision to those "Mujahedien =holy combatant",
and thirdly, some of these are repeated and reran which suggests that the paralysis that hit the Arabic world decision centers had caused it to petrify and became unable to react, if not to save their homeland yet to keep their personal dignity,
and who refuse the title of the presidency because they see it as less stature.
Some in the Arab league want to be completely liberated from their national identity, and not just its politics. They do not want to be bound by their Arabism and all its implications,
solidarity, economy, common defense,
and everything that connect them with their identity from any futuristic plan for this vast land from Morocco to Indonesia .
so that the foreign hegemony will not achieve its goal in imposing on us humiliating conditions.
Tunis, (and Libya recently), Egypt,
when the enlighten pioneer found the path to their common identity for these vanquished and lost people for more than one thousand year,
Arabism freed us from the Turks without leaving Islam as a religion and without becoming the infidel west.
The first pioneers engaged in several battles on several fronts,
a state where all its citizens are not discriminated against based on religion, ethnicity, or color.
societies,
everything around us is in a shamble,
the Arabic person almost will deny his dark skin,
and accept Israel and reject each other.
The result of all these entities will not lead to a union, unity or solidarity based on: move or walk in the steps of the weakest among you.
When the ideological foundation for nationalism ideology became unbalanced and establishing it by suggestion,
or they lived abroad and imported slogan that it was not for it or for our societies,
and then the regional state that was built too fast is unable to stand to the demand of life in this alluring area,
whether it is the Israeli who occupied some of it and built on it its state.
The public attributed to it all the shortcoming of its ideology.
build union states (by force).
The state settled in the land,
and his voice is the source for the legitimacy for decision.
because we did not know it in our land before. We were regions that transferred as states among several empires, between the Ottomans and the Umayyad,
the king, crown prince and the president.
It was impossible for ideological calling, with a goal to ensure belonging to the same identity,
Islam as they believed in it ,
authority and opposition….and what left it from rituals and ignorant dead texts or dead because of its bad meaning,
and they ran &lt;&gt;
even after all the beating that were carried out against them from some in the nationalistic movement in its political symbols after it took over authority positions.
The regional country did endure,
We have to confess that the outside world look at our realty and not our aborted hopes and dreams.
if they dealt with them willingly or by force,
The people are in disarray,

there was no political party,
not even those joining by force or need.
and to Islam that the despot borrowed from it the Jihad slogan …. The impossible! The despotic ruler became the king,
and the defeated was to all of them.
This public soon regained his awareness and began to rise to affirm his existence and right to decide This is in Iraq.
All of this in the absent of the Libyan people and without their knowledge.
Arabism is resistance completely .Arabism is rejection to foreign hegemony,
The resistance actually believes in belonging to the land,
and working toward a better future with it,
Without democracy there is no resistance. When the human spirit is crushed there can be no resistance. When a person doesn’t have free will,
When the choice is between a local despotism&lt;&gt;and foreign occupation then it is not worth sacrificing life.
through its long history suffered clear deficiency in its Arabism,
the Arab resistor,
.in Falloujah , as in Najef and karbala , in Mousal and Karkouk as well as in the Dewania,
Arabism is oppressed, chased, repressed,
This is worse what the foreign occupier can do and even despotism, this diminish patriotism and make people in to sheep, some are servants,
and the radical butcher organizations hurt the Arabs and Muslims badly; this feeling toward the Arabs and Islam will not be wiped out except after a long struggle generations to come, maybe.
its patriotic awareness is high,
or religion like Christian in all different denominations.

Saudi Arabia: Before Changing the Terror Culture Reality Must Change Following series of bloody events and confrontations between Al-Jehadi’een (Holy Fighters) and security apparatus, the Saudi government is trying to snatch victory from defeat’s claws.
debate, interpretation or explanation. Portraying the opposite equation made up of vicious fighter cells,
who is requested after every armed attack to declare his loyalty, renew his pledge in the mosque, on the street,
Iraq is resisting direct occupation and is going through a hardship of its own specifics that does not apply to the Saudi equation at hand. In summary, after every violent confrontation the government tries to establish new law upon the remains of the dead and the ruins.
is suffering from a slow war may well be called "Low Warfare Intensity" Its latest, what happened in Khubar. This war drains the country economically,
in countries that used to believe and practice such rights. The more so the case in countries that are not bound to such details, rather they refuse them for they conflict with the local culture and timeworn legacy.
in specific, form the two main sources of terrorism in the world.
The Saudi government and the society must believe that real solution to the problem doesn’t lie in the security solution only, and should also learn from the experience of the United States in many areas.
for a pure scientific reason, which is the fact based on the most important intuitive saying: before changing the mind you must change reality. Mind,
it becomes the important engine and the effective tool in shaping the individual,
tendencies and thoughts. Changing reality entails negating some behavior and practices that became coherent to the essence and identity of the government. Some of it is the following: Destroying,
and the religious term it would probably be hypocrisy.) Lately, the gap between stated policy and hidden policy has become larger. While in the past,
it will not succeed so long as the United States is following a policy that is clear in its hostility to the Arab and Muslim issues from Iraq to Palestine crossing other areas and many prisons from Guantanamo to Abu-Ghraib. As long as the government is viewed as a conspirator promoting the interest of the west in the region, it will be useless to preach to be passionate to the foreigner,
The mentality and the practice of hating the foreigner is not a result of a culture it is the result of the double standard reality and contradiction. In changing reality we must destroy double standard and contradiction in the religious stretch. This means that government should quit its failing attempt to convince everyone that it is adopting policies that are appropriate to the religion and its teachings.
While the government presents itself as a symbol of purity and decency, we find it permitting economic, social and political practices that would be least described as not related to the essence of the religion.
Another chapter of double standard and contradiction is the social and economical reality of the foreign western treachery in Saudi Arabia, and the gap between what is permissible for this aiding hand and what is permissible to the people, what those can benefit and what the people can or can not benefit.
Now this group of people is tax exempted and is allowed to sacrifice their sheep on holidays, Muslim style, in back yards letting blood run down the streets and door steps.

The papers said that the government forces used RPGs and other weapons in the area, some of which hit houses where Al-Huthi is hiding. No one was able to get into the area to know the number of the killed and injured in these confrontations which are in their third consecutive day.
The resistance, which seems to follow a systematic plan, is planning not to prevent the transfer of authority on the 30th of the month,
which includes Ba’thists and others. The Battle of Baghdad that is coming soon will cause a clear disruption to the strategy of handing over authority. This will be the basis for the shape of the resistance plan,
They were new elements of the police that were created by the American occupation. The Ba’thist police stations were avoided. It seems that the resistance is directing it activities towards police stations while distinguishing between stations that have Ba’thists in them and those that do have any Ba’thists in them.
so that they can start the plans for withdrawal from Iraq.

EGYPTIAN LEADERS CONCERNED OVER IMPACTS OF ATTACK ON IRAQ ON EGYPT'S DOMESTIC AFFAIRS
An analyst of Al-Ahram Center for Strategic Studies said Egypt "would see strong protests which can hardly be controlled by the Egyptian regime."
Therefore, the Egyptian President will suppress any public protests against U.S. war on Iraq.
The British paper noted that the Egyptian President shared the same opinion of his opponents of the Muslim Brotherhood on the impacts of the U.S. military campaign against Iraq on the country, believing that the attack would unfavourably affect Arab countries and the world as a whole. America is seeking weak targets following Afghanistan, including Iraq and then Libya, according to a Muslim Brotherhood leader.
According to Fatah officials, Cairo meeting comes after mediation by European countries and Egypt in a bid to persuade Hamas to stop martyrdom operations and armed ambushes which they considered harmful to the efforts of setting up a Palestinian state.
Hamas will be represented in this dialogue by its political bureau chairman, Khaled Meshaal and Mohamed Nizal, Moussa Abou-Marzouk and Imad Al-Alami. Meanwhile, there were several names for chairing Fatah delegation to the meeting including PLO executive committee Mahmoud Abbas (Abou-Mazin) or secretary general of the Palestinian presidency Al-Tayeb Abdel-Rehim or Zakareya Al-Agha.
Purchasing in installments has substituted cash purchasing, a phenomenon that put more burdens on traders who are suffering from sharp recession. Traders are, therefore, compelled to sell their commodities at any price ahead of their expiry dates. Some people describe the Egyptian market as a market of "shop-window viewers rather than buyers."
The high-incomed families purchased half of their purchases last year and a quarter of what they bought in 1998. This means that there is an imbalance that should be redressed. Experts say that salaries increased by 44 per cent in the last four years, while the prices of some basic commodities skyrocketed by 200 per cent.
Noticeably, traders took the depreciation of the pound rate of exchange against the dollar by 35 per cent as a pretext to increase commodity prices. Their trick was exposed when such an increase included domestic commodities that do not include any foreign component. Family providers sustain tremendous pressure, for instance the necessary needs of their families exceed their incomes and, therefore, they should seek another sustenance in order to fulfill their commitments.
Although the Government denied any rise in commodity prices in Ramadan, housewives in the posh Al-Mohandessin district confirm that all requirements are available and that there is a relative demand regardless of price rises due to the high income of people. Strangely enough, the same commodities, according to Fae'qa Rashed, are sold at lower prices in popular districts in an attempt (by traders) to attract middle-class clients who refrained from purchasing.

Now the USA wants to search for these scientists inside Iraq in a row in order to transport them abroad to eliminate all human capital Iraq might possess, or else they would be the first to be killed at the first moment of the imminent American war against Iraq!
If the international inspectors in Iraq found a locked door and the search for the key took some time, or if a traffic jam delayed the inspector's arrival at a certain site or if the family of an Iraqi expert or scientist failed to meet a call in order for investigation abroad with their breadwinner under an inspectors' warrant, then Washington might construe each of such cases as an impediment to the inspectors' work, thus giving it the long-awaited pretext to launch war against Iraq.

IN LIGHT OF THE IRAQI CRISIS: THE IRAQI-IRANIAN RELATIONS, WHERETO?
Although alliances changed, Iraq has remained a balance factor for Iranian ambitions in the Gulf.
Whether that influence is hegemony is yet open to discussion. What is more important would rely on those neighbours feeling of security regarding their more powerful neighbour and how far the American presence in the region would deter Iranian ambitions.
In that case, it would not only constitute a primary threat to the region but would subject the market to a sort of Iraqi oil dumping as a result of a step taken by Iraq to that end in order to avenge itself on the Gulf States for what they caused it in the Second Gulf War. This would eventually lead to further deterioration of oil prices which would, in turn, have negative impacts on the Iranian economy.
If, however, a new Iraqi government was set up under a direct American administration i.e. through an American military governor in Iraq, the image would be inevitably different with other implications regarding Iran.

Yesterday, Al-Hudheibi ruled out the possibility, during this period, of making any attempts to found a legal political party for the group. He said, "It is useless now to make such an attempt even though we have been for long demanding such a chance. The officialdom, nevertheless, would not give it to us and it would not be positive, therefore, to get involved in it.
The American wave of armed pounce managed to break the backs of the Islamic radical organizations, particularly Al-Qaeda and Taliban, and dismantled several rings of extremism and terrorism in more than a state - Pakistan and Indonesia in the East, Germany and Spain in the West and in Yemen, Somalia and Sudan as well. At the same degree, the political Islamic trend in general was shocked and embarrassed. The shock and embarrassment came from two or three sources.
I believe that the success of moderate organizations and parties in more than one Arab and Muslim country will tempt their counterparts in the other countries to do the same. This success also puts the general trend of the movement of political Islam in situations of challenge and response.
It is clear that the latest success of the Islamic parties in more than a country, as mentioned above, depended on this essential change that was an alternative to the slogan of "Islam is the solution" that was raised by the political Islamic trends in the past decades.
I daresay that these two different parties are placed together under horrible American pressures. These pressures begin with accusations that both parties are directly responsible for terrorism, violence and extremism. These pressures do not, at the same time, end with an urge to bring about radical reforms to the ruling regimes but want them to "modernize Islam" itself, something that causes increasing sensitivity.
This needs essential surgeries in the march of our lives and homelands.

LEAVE THE CBE ALONE!
International monetary agencies estimate the size of those funds at LE79 billion, i.e. the equivalent of 30% of the banks deposits volume, which predicts a certain disaster.
Also to be blamed is the insistence on the technique of political selection for bank leaderships without taking into account any standards of professional efficiency or expertise that can employ banks money in genuine enterprises that yield real profits for them and for their depositors and really contribute to developing national economy.

For the first time since early the 1980's, poverty rates went down from 19.4% of the population in 1995/1996 to 16.4% in 1999/2000 in spite of the fact that the bank indicated that sluggishness of economic growth since 2000 raises misgivings regarding the latest poverty rate.
Poverty rates in Lower Egypt during the reporting period increased from 29.3% to 34.2% in rural areas and from 10.8% to 19.3% in urban areas. On the other hand, poverty rates in Upper Egypt went down from 21.5% to 11.8% in rural areas and from 8.3% to 6.2% in urban areas.

Arab Banking Corporation chairman, Hassan Abbas Zaki said that the volume of faltering ranged from LE23 billion to LE25 billion while the volume of deposits reached LE260 billion. Mohamed Abdel Halim Omar indicated the American embassy's report on the Egyptian economy issued in July 2002, which said that faltering loans were in the range between 15% and 20% of the size of bank credit which reached LE266.1 billion and the faltering loans would consequently range between LE39.9 billion and LE53.3 billion.

The incumbent government should recognize the deteriorating economic conditions and unsuccessful policies, he requested.
Accusing some incumbent cabinet ministers of corruption, the premier wondered: how can a minister amass 20 million pounds three years after he takes up as such, though his salary does not reach 5,000 pounds.
The cash fluidity shortage is partly due to the flight of over 80 billion pounds in investments owing to the economic crisis in the country, he said The former prime minister, moreover, called on the government to monitor foreign cement companies in Egypt to thwart any plan to designedly slim cement prices in a bid to control the financial position of Egyptian cement companies to buy them.

The deputies cited some Israeli newspaper reports about those Egyptians being jailed in Ping, Ashkelon, Acre and Al-Khayam prisons.
Parliamentary deputies also asked for holding a joint meeting of the two committees on foreign affairs and national security to discuss the phenomenon of Egyptian youth emigration abroad with some of them giving up the Egyptian nationality.

Salaheddin Hafez, Assistant Chief Editor of Al-Ahram, writes a lengthy article under the above heading. Excerpts run to the following effect: The American and Western pounce on the Arab and Muslim world has strong impact on and deep changes in the political, social and cultural movements, the heralds of which appeared quickly among the milieus of the political Islamic trend, to be accurate.
I believe that success won recently by political Islamic organizations and parties in more than a state like Turkey, Morocco, Bahrain and Pakistan - after they had merged in a process of democratic development - opens the door for other models in other countries. The US, moreover, supports this success, as it says that it fights "Islamic" extremism and terrorism, but encourages "Islamic" moderation and democratic development. Challenge:
The current internal and international incidents pushed the winds to the sail, something that introduced to us moderate Islamic parties. These parties contest elections, declare their faith in democracy, place their announced philosophy in the square of "justice and development," and introduce themselves as an alternative to the conventional political Islamic movement, which has become outdated like the Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan). These parties also introduce themselves as an alternative to the radical Islamic organizations like Al-Qaeda, Taliban and Jihad, which brought in negative disasters to Islam and the Muslims in general.
One of the mainly required surgeries is the re-wording of the political platforms of the Islamic parties to an extent that conforms to the ideals, concepts and methods of democratic development that is inevitable in this century. Those platforms should also be re-worded in a way that harmonizes with the life requirements and daily sufferings of the peoples - poverty, unemployment and stagnation. Those platforms should also recognize the multi-party system, the right to take part in political action and the woman's role in Muslim societies, especially as women have lost their basic rights that are enshrined in Islam.
I daresay that this talk causes strong sensitivities whether among some of the ruling regimes that are suspicious of the movement of political Islam or inside this movement itself, especially as it is being pressurized and facing harsh challenges nowadays.
In this case, it is not enough to exchange (with the West) violence with violence or hatred with hatred. The issue is deeper than that and the responsibility is bigger.
"Turkey will go into the European Union trailing myriad of problems and complications, such as the Kurdish problem, sectarian conflicts, the possibility of war over the waters of the Tigris and the Euphrates, the membership of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and Turkey's roots in the Muslim countries of Central Asia," Colonel Gaddafi warned on the evening of 26 November.
Turkey is like a tree whose roots are deeply driven in Asia but whose branches entered Europe.
Gaddafi's recent comments, which are his first official statements on Turkey, are expected to have wide repercussions similar to those which occurred during the visit of former Turkish prime minister and disbanded Rafa Party leader Nemettin Erbikan to Tripoli. Gaddafi surprised his guest by delivering a severe tongue lashing to Turkey official policy towards the Kurds and demanded that the Kurds be given the right to establish their own independent state.

In statements to Al-Ahali, Dr. Ibrahim Al-Esawi, National Planning Institute consultant and member of Al-Tagamo'h Party Central Committee said that both the international and the domestic figures were correct as each relied on a different standard.
Dr. Al-Esawi pointed out that many Egyptian economists tended to approve the international figure - 53%, which approximated to the total figure announced in the report on human development in Egypt, especially as it suited the conditions undergone by the country after the implementation of the policy of structural adaptation and the remarkable increase in unemployment rates. This means that the difference between the domestic and the international figures was triggered by differences in the definition of the poverty concept.

It seems that luck is still at odds with businessman Hosam Abul-Fotouh. After his property had been sequestrated, some Egyptian businessmen started attempts to get the BMW agency from him. By the end of last week, he was having dinner with the official in charge of Africa region in BMW, Mr. Walker when he knew from him that he would have dinner with Banque du Caire President, Ahmed El Baradi. Banque du Caire was the bank from which Hosam Abul-Fotouh got the bulk of his loans that exceeded LE900 million.
The agency was the only business that provided him with cash liquidity that amounted to LE150 million annually, thus enabling him to repay part of his debts or of their interests.

Chairman of Printing Industries Chamber, Ahmed Atef uncovered that three companies, members in the chamber and producers of polypropylene had submitted a memo to the chamber's board of directors about the great harm they incurred as a result of bilateral agreements with a number of Arab countries.

He pointed out that in a few days' time the Prime Minister would open the first headquarters of investment complexes.

National Bank of Egypt (NBE) Chairman Ahmed Dia' Eddin said the NBE's financial position is strong and has no problems related to insolvent investors.
The NBE has also got back some 136 million pounds from Ramy Lakah, another key businessman, he said.
The ATFP, Mana'i maintained, is also aimed to stimulate Arab exports to other countries, particularly as Arab countries have committed themselves to free trade requirements in line with the GATT by means of offering financial support to Arab exporters and producers in order to make use of such privileges, he added.
The Association, which represents the biggest non-governmental organisation in the country, did not content itself with its call for reexamining the defaulters' files but also alluded to its readiness to put in a request to the political leadership so as to preserve the achievements of the economic reform which are eroded as megaprojects are falling together with their owners.
Second, if mortgages were not enough, sequestration was imposed on the property of the defaulters. In the first case, banks discovered a difficulty in disposing of mortgages, because every mortgage was offered as a guarantee for more than a loan and to more than a bank. Consequently, the mortgage in this case is primarily insufficient and turns into a dispute among creditor banks.
In a related incident, Prime Minister, Atef Ebeid received a memo, the first of its kind, presented by Muslim Brotherhood deputy Hamdi Hassan concerning the escape of a bank borrower although the same borrower had another escape precedent.
Saleh added that focussing on the African markets is a great chance for Egyptian businessmen and exporters because of these markets high need of Egyptian products and the COMESA agreement which allows commodity and service exchange among these African countries on the basis of mutual customs exemptions that will contribute to raising exports and improving trade balance.

In addition, Egyptian exporters should participate in some other expositions at their own expense so that Egyptian exporters could meet directly with the expected importers, the study said.
Although the Egyptian-Japanese trade balance deficit hit 498.1 million dollars in 2001, the volume of trade exchange decreased to 650.3 million dollars against 888.2 million dollars in 2000, the study said.
The agreement was signed on behalf of the Ministry by the Ministry's first undersecretary and head of the Technological Development sector and on the Danish behalf by Dr. Prepian Findlob.
The minister pointed out the importance of qualifying and training factories to get the ISO certificates with a view to promoting exports to foreign markets in addition to chemical and bacteriological tests, developing test labs and producing healthy and safe foods for the consumer.
"I proposed this idea in an article entitled One Wife is not Enough' which was published in a magazine," said the association chairman, Mrs. Hoyam Derbek. "In this article I called on wives to allow their husbands to get married for many reasons such eliminating the singlehood problem which has been gravely aggravated in the Arab world. On the other hand, there is an increasing rate in the urfi (unofficial, unregistered and clandestine) marriage hitting 2.5 percent in Egypt; hence my call to establish a society calling for polygamy publicly rather than behind the wives' back."
I work 18 hours a day in the field of mass media, the press and organizing symposia and conferences. So, I'm very remiss at home. By the end of the day, I return home so exhausted that I have to take a rest. Therefore, I nominated a neighbor and relative girl to my husband.
Everybody, government and subjects alike, is of the opinion that political reform is a must for this country.
We must note here that the US Administration has made its stand on political reform in Saudi Arabia clear within the context of an American political project on the Middle East. The same view was reiterated later, and in plainer language this time, by the head of the Central Intelligence Agency.
- A domestic choice, divided into a popular choice and a governmental one.
These two pretexts gained more momentum in the 1990's in the midst of the collapse of the former Soviet Union and the emergence of religious radicalism in North Africa, particularly in Algeria, and even Egypt. They maintained their strength until the first suicidal airliner crashed into one of the World Trade Center Twin Towers. The collapse of the towers on 11 September marked the emergence of a new pretext, which insisted on uprooting the fundamentalist threat, but from its origins in Saudi Arabia this time.
The current responses to the calls of reformists in Saudi Arabia tend to trace the lines of the ongoing reform processes in neighbouring countries like Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar.
Therefore, the Saudi royal family has been trying very hard to absorb any local, or even international, pressures and make only the least possible concessions whatever the pressures.
Saudi Arabia, with its monarchic regime, imposes full control over the land and the people, forcefully resisting any local attempts at protest.
However, there does exist a problem that precludes the adoption of constitutional monarch in the kingdom: it is the struggle for power from within Saudi Arabia itself, not from outside.
Under this heading Saudi writer and researcher, Hamza al-Hassan, writes a lengthy article to say:
Over the last 12 years, it was clear that the Saudi Kingdom had no articulate policy towards Iraq. Excluding Kuwait from among other Arab neighbours, the Kingdom seldom had a margin of manoeuvering and alternatives that could spare it some of the expected perils.
The Saudi government 's opposition to the method of U.S. war makes one feel that it admits to the crime (of supporting terrorism), while the anti-Saudi lobby seeks to take the opportunity of events and prove the charge, giving an excuse to target the Kingdom as a state and government (the royal family) in the coming confrontations.
Over the last eight decades, apart from the period of war with Iran, relations with Iraq were only cool, dim and surrounded by fears and suspicions.
Only for comparison, cards owned by the Kingdom today to shun risks brought by Iraq whether for its current situation or possible occupation by U.S. soldiers, are less significant than their counterparts held by Syria and Iran, which, like the Kingdom, will be targeted if Iraq is occupied.
They thought that with a single low-ranking officer and unserious methods they can deal with party ministers, prime ministers, generals, officers and commanders.
Therefore, the Kingdom is fully far from the main trends in Iraq:
Such tensed relations with the key Iraqi opposition parties, along with the Kingdom's provocation against the Iraqi Intifada in 1991, portend a bad future in Saudi-Iraqi relations, and may even turn Iraq into a base for blatant hositility to Saudi Arabia as if all what will happen is just replacing one enemy with another.
It was natural for it, as usual, to attach significance to Iraqi Sunnis. It started to help long-awaited and neglected Iraqi opposition leaders become more active once more, prepared to hold a conference and made an extraordinary political discourse that may bring benefit on the one hand and bring harm on the other hand.
The Kingdom can not adopt a unilateral policy, nor can it stand against risks without coordination with other Arab countries and other countries concerned in the region.

The Egyptian diplomacy did well when it sought or rather hoped to affect the new American policy and preclude the outbreak of a war in the region.
Egyptian diplomacy, however, is acting in a way that raises question about the reasons for departing from such a rule of thumb which dealing with Iraq' s crisis especially as the problem is no longer one concerned with the Iraqi opposition but rather extended to outright rejection of any role in determining Iraq's future.
The majority of those who establish relations with America are not American agents but rather found in it the only resort.
The Egyptian diplomacy, through its weight and respectability, can influence some Iraqi opposition trends, which were driven by despair of any Arab help to just let itself fall into Washington's arms.
Naturally, any new regime acts towards other countries in accordance with the leaders concepts of each country and how close its relations with them are.
Should that happen, Iraq's getting over its trial and lifting the siege imposed on it would not be an asset in favour of the Arab order but rather a liability, which would, certainly, be a considerable loss because Iraq is not a small country.
This is what the Egyptian diplomacy ought to consider.

Hizbullah's strategic missile power made a number of Israeli command officers suggest re-occupying areas near to the borderline in order to thwart extension of any projectile shelling, the sources said, adding that the Israeli officers would be afraid in such case of the resistance operations, which would make them sustain heavy human losses.

Al Azhar Islamic Research Academy scholars opined that it was religiously impermissible to extend any kind of assistance to the American forces and their allies in the potential aggression on Iraq. They said, "It is religiously impermissible for any Arab or Islamic country to offer assistance to the American forces. Nor is it permissible to deploy any foreign forces in Muslim territories, as that would mean a kind of alienation of Islam and Muslim sovereignty and recognition of the enemy's right to occupy our lands."
It is noteworthy that some Arab countries have offered facilities to the American presence including setting up military bases, deploying military forces and offer intelligence information to help America in its war against Muslims in Iraq.

During the Egyptian bourse saw the year 2002 many developments and events, which directly and indirectly impacted on its performance, which was calm most of the time. Lights were shed on a number of issues pertaining to the rights of the minority mainly including the two deals of Alexandria Cement Company and the Egyptian-American Bank.

Both EFGI financial group and Hermes indicators reported the highest two points late July affected by the decision to end pricing limits of the activities of 12 companies after which the prices started to plummet to stand at low levels. The report showed that the total market capital rose by around 11% to report 123 billion pounds, or 27 billion dollars or about 32% of the GDP compared with the year 2001 when the overall market capital went down by some 7% to report 111 billion pounds in late 2001.
This reflects the calm performance of the market during the year and the control of the big applied operations and the operations carried out on bonds.
The most active twenty companies in 2002 controlled some 22% of the circulation value in comparison with around 46% of the total circulation value in 2001. This difference stems from the rise in the rates of bond circulation and the decline of the shares circulation activity.

The value of the deal reached LE92 million for 6 million shares which are the company total capital, i.e. 15.33 pounds per share.
PRIVATE BANKS MAINLY BLAMED FOR ECONOMIC DETERIORATION
The negative aspect may unfavourably affect the volume of investments in Egypt, especially as the Egyptian economy is still suffering. The positive aspect may help the country get back money smuggled outside the country, he added.
Yussef referred 3 points which were crucial to the negotiations as follows.
WARNINGS ABOUT UNEMPLOYMENT RATE EXCEEDING 8.8%
An overall reform programme should be adopted through increasing demand for work. This could be done by invigorating the economy, reforming training and education systems and guaranteeing labour's rights in an atmosphere convenient for work.
Economic growth in Egypt was marked by sluggishness over the past years which negatively impacted on the national economy's ability to assimilate new labour into the work market. Sharp slowdown in the economic activity's performance was a natural result of the government way of running the macroeconomics.
The State Security Prosecution decided to keep 14 Ikhwanite key figures in custody for 15 days pending investigations into the Group's activity in east Cairo. The prosecution decided an escapee be arrested.
Ikhwan lawyer, Abd Al-Mon'em Abd Al-Maksoud deemed such accusations untrue, saying that his clients had denied such accusations during investigations and confirmed their respect of law and the constitution.
If Saddam, on the other hand, said he had no mass destruction weapons, that credibility would be hard to attain.
The problem is simply that Washington wants to topple the Iraqi ruling regime which has built up out of its continuation and desire to survive as a sort of national cause that is worth fighting for, i.e for the regime rather than the country itself and consequently deserves that parts of the country be destroyed so that it might survive.
Now that the USA has certainly made up its mind, not many options have remained theoretically open.
However, the regime, through such sacrifice, may serve the country and population, so long as it can do so while still in power.
Such stepping down (on the part of the Iraqi elite) would certainly abort the military strike which the Pentagon hardliners are very anxious to launch but the departure of Saddam, his ministers and senior officials would not convince the Americans that their war goals have been achieved. They had after all gone to great lengths to fabricate such goals and find ethical pretexts for them and even entered into confrontations with so many countries to promote them.
Al-Azhar's Islamic Research Academy (IRA) made permissible the use of genetics in prevention and treatment of diseases on condition that the efforts exerted by scientists in the field of genetic treatment should be intended to remedy or prevent the diseases from which man suffers.
Second: If such tests on animals prove that the genetic treatment of a dangerous disease leads to a less harmful one, genetic treatment in this case is permissible according to the Islamic rule, "the more harmful thing is averted by a less harmful one." Genetic treatment is impermissible when it leads to a same dangerous disease according to the Islamic rule, "a harm should not be warded off by incurring another harm." Therefore, no treatment of a disease should be prescribed if it leads to a more harmful one, he said.
Q- It has been reported behind the Israeli and Egyptian scenes that the real aim of your visit to Egypt is to get acquainted with what is going on in the second round of Palestinian talks, hosted by Cairo late last month, is this true?
I confirm that the Palestinians have the right to have a political capital, namely Jerusalem, but without full control over the holy places. In my point of view, the best solution is that neither party should get full control over the holy places. These places should be set under international supervision whether by the UN or the Security Council or even a joint supervision by the Israeli and Palestinian parties.
Q- What about the issue of refugees whether in or even outside the Palestinian territories?
Q- What do you mean by "the position of Israel as a Jewish state"?
In this context, Arab-American talks have been held for discussing the economic situation in case of war. A number of Arab countries told Washington that the volume of transactions between the Arab countries and America, which stood at $55 billion last year, would go down to $30 billion. The American investments in the Arab world would also decline to $35 billion against $70 billion last year.
Minister of Manpower Ahmad Al-Amawi ruled out the possibility of the Egyptian labour in the region, 860 thousand in number, being largely dented as was the case in 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait as the rate of Egyptian labour in Iraq went down than before. Therefore, the impact may be possible on the Egyptian labour in some Gulf states that can terminate the foreign and Arab employment contracts to settle their labour instead.
Al-Ahram Al-Arabi learned that the list of the countries, which would be harmed, was given to the US Administration, which formed a specialised work team that included assistant US secretary of commerce, deputy assistant Secretary of State for economic affairs, the Commerce Department deputy for the Middle East and North African affairs, and deputy Secretary of State.
The most urgent question is: is this large strategic and military build-up intended only to face the current standoff or are there other aims behind it?
At the heart of the region, the second fact, namely the American attempts to build the major regional power, which it controls, namely Israel will be confirmed. The third fact is the American attempts to change the identity of new Iraq to advocate and implement the US policy in the Middle East. The fourth fact is the increase of the strategic and military imbalance tipping the balance of power in favour of Israel.
As far as the timing of the attack is concerned, the events indicate it will be around the end of February or during the first half of March 2003.
The defendants fully admitted to the terrorist schemes and those admissions emphasized that they had not direct relationship with Al-Qaeda Organization.
Some elements of that 43-member terrorist group have tried to infiltrate into the Israeli borders to take direct revenge on the Israelis, but they could not do so owing to the strict security measures taken by Egypt across its borders to prevent any infiltration attempt from or into the Israeli borders.
He also rented a building to serve as a factory for explosives and transferred some terrorist elements to it. Ismail also taught his elements how to manufacture explosives and bought them automatic rifles and pistols to be ready for the planned operations.

COURT RULING ENTITLES SHUKRI TO LEAD LABOUR PARTY
There is still a dispute between opponents in this respect, the court said, pointing out that the party is the only body that is competent to settle its internal disputes.
The Egyptian Foreign Ministry filed a lawsuit against the importing company for breaching laws and importation rules, the government said.
Meanwhile, reliable Palestinian sources were quoted as saying that disputes ran deeper within the central committee of the Palestinian mainstream Fatah, led by Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, over the continuity of dialogue between Fatah and the Palestinian Resistance Movement (Hamas) in Cairo, involving Egyptian Intelligence Agency Chief Omar Solyman as a facilitator.
In a recent meeting of the Fatah central committee to discuss the Cairo dialogue, differences cropped up among the members, with most of them objecting to the Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's economic advisor Mohamed Rashid's involvement in the dialogue as a member of the Fatah delegation. Preconditions set by Hamas Political Bureau Chief Khalid Mashal for attending the Cairo dialogue were also given the thumbs down by other central committee members.
The Turkish request came on the margin of the historic visit paid by Turkish Premier Abdulla Gul to AL headquarters in Cairo two days ago. The visit was the first to be paid by a Turkish official on that level since the AL was established in 1945.
The Turkish government has decided to fully develop its relations with Arab countries, said Gul, adding that there had been an agreement with the Arab League on many matters including collectively studying the region's problems in the next months.
The same source added that the Turkish request was only an initiative for public relations by which Turkey wanted to convey a message to the Arab countries that it was seriously eager to promote cooperation with them, in an attempt to remove the impression dominating the Arab world that Turkey was involved in American policies that are hostile to Arab interests especially after Turkey agreed to offer the American forces extensive competence in Incirlik Airbase used by the American forces to launch air raids in the no-fly zone in the north and south of Iraq.
The draft constitution will be viewed as the touchstone of the U.S. administration's willingness to abide by the official position on establishing an independent Palestinian statehood.
The Iraqi tribal card seems to be important as Saddam had done a lot for it, for its backing attitude towards him and as it represents a big population sector. Iraq contains 150 tribal gatherings that, in turn, consist of 2 thousand smaller tribal sub-gatherings. Big tribes can claim a population of a million souls, while the smaller ones may claim only thousands.
So far it is reported that tribe chieftains are waiting for the war when they would fight for the Iraqi President. One of the Northern tribes chieftains said he had asked the central government to provide his tribe with heavy weapons the moment war is declared on their country by the Americans. No weapons reached him so far, he commented.
The Iraqi regime structure relies on the tribal element. Tikrit to which the Iraqi president belonged represented an important element in the Iraqi government equation.
Israeli Television correspondent Odid Granoth said on air from Cairo that Egyptian key officials told him that Egyptian Intelligence Agency Chief Omar Solyman gave a strongly-worded warning to Hamas' leaders in Cairo, threatening that if Hamas pursued operations against the Hebrew state, then Egypt would announce soon that the organization is "anti-peace", and would sever all relations with it.

THE FUTURE OF ISLAMIC ACTION
Certainly, Islamic Organizations can no longer practise their activities in the way they did in the past, but handing them over "in toto" and unconditionally to Mr. Kofi Annan would be wishful thinking.
For the first time in the Egyptian history, Orthodox Copts celebrated the Christmas within an official public holiday as per a presidential edict last month. Christians were satisfied by the decision.
The Muslim Brotherhood had succeeded in concluding a deal to control Al-Liwaa Al-Arabi newspaper of limited distribution, after they have lost "Afaq Arabia" newspaper when Al-Ahrar party withdrew it, as some considered it as the mouthpiece of the Muslim Brotherhood.
And it sent to Cairo saying that if the American strike against Iraq occurred, Washington would grant additional aid to Egypt.
The Saudi justification is that in such case, the decision to hit Iraq would be an international one, making it imperative for United Nations members to cooperate for putting it into effect.
It may mean that Egypt has helped the United States in the issue of hitting Iraq or has promised to do something for which it must be rewarded with additional aid.
Therefore, what Egypt must do now is to adopt a clear and decisive stand on this possible war, and I believe that what has been announced in this respect so far is not enough.
We must also be aware, and make others aware too, of the grave dangers against the whole region, its present and its future, due to the attempts to bring two great peoples, the Iraqi and the Palestinian, to their knees simultaneously and disarm them with American and Israeli military force.
As a key party and a central country that can play a weighty and historic role, Egypt is interested in facilitating a dialogue between Palestinian factions, he said.
Yesterday, Future Centre for Studies and Researches, which sponsors the initiative for reconciliation between Islamists and Arab governments issued a statement wishing that those governments would respond to that initiative and try to activate it.
On the other hand, senior security official said that Egypt had managed to eliminate several violence and terrorism crimes. Assistant Minister of the Interior, Major General Mohamed Sha'rawi said, "The Egyptian security bodies managed to eliminate several violence and terrorism crimes while several countries of the world are still suffering from such a serious phenomenon. Such a serious security performance has been given credit by all regional and international security bodies."
In a sudden development, Eritrea has appointed a representative in the Arab League (AL) as "observer". The new representative, ambassador Hassan Kurdi, is likely to reach Cairo before the end of the instant month to discharge his new duties.

The shipment is expected to take at least one week from Haifa Seaport to European countries, the sources added.
Well-informed sources told Al-Ahram correspondent, Ahmed Moussa, that State Security Investigation forces had monitored the terrorist organization members led by a certain Ihab Ismail, who formed three groups in Mahalla Al-Kobra, Al-Beheira and Cairo. He used the Internet for contacting Jihad leaderships abroad and rented several flats to harbour the organization elements. He also bought some cars and two factories for manufacturing explosives in Al-Kulg and Al-Nubareya.
This is only a message to those who are setting the fire of terrorism and then leave us the whole responsibility of putting such a fire out.
They prepared a programme for holding study meetings inside houses, owned by them, where they were provided with publications containing the ideology of the extremist organization of Jihad. They also prepared the elements physically through tough exercises and taught them how to discover security follow-up techniques. They instructed them to shave their beards, use code names and carry forged IDs during their movements for the sake of camouflage. The leader, Ihab Ismail, also ordered his elements to abandon their houses and move to Cairo where they rented several flats for their residence.
The group planned to use the most intelligent carrier pigeons so that each pigeon would carry 200 grams of TNT explosives with one hundred grams fixed to each foot.
The defendants admitted that the Jenin massacres perpetrated by Israeli occupation authorities against the unarmed Palestinian people had aroused their emotions and desire for performing any Jihad act. They thought of traveling to Palestine for Jihad, but could not, and hence they started to plan for carrying out operations against foreign interests.
The Supreme Administrative Court made an important principle in the Egyptian political life when it decided in the ruling whereases that the Parties' Committee is not empowered to determine the destiny of parties or interfere in their affairs, through recognizing a party's leader or not.
In its reply to Port Said Ikhwanite MP, Akram Al Sha'ir, the Egyptian government pointed out that it had stymied an Egyptian company's attempt to import American hospitals' wastes and rubbish, store and smuggle them into the country in breach of previous government decision to re-export those rejected consignments.
BRITISH INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL FOLLOWS UP INTER-PALESTINIAN DIALOGUE IN CAIRO
The anti-Cairo dialogue Fatah trend calls for holding this dialogue in Al-Muqata building in Ramallah.
On January 6th, Turkey officially asked for joining the Arab League after the repeated futile attempts to join the European Union.
For his part, Gul emphasized that the Turkish government decided to forge its relations with Arab countries.
The draft constitution will be viewed as the touchstone of the U.S. administration's willingness to abide by the official position on establishing an independent Palestinian statehood.

5 MILLION EUROS FOR TRAINING PROGRAMMES AND DATABASES FOR ATTRACTING INVESTMENTS
1.7 BILLION DIRHAMS EMIRIAN INVESTMENTS IN EGYPT
The trade exchange between the two countries in 2001 reached about 767 million dirhams (209 million dollars) , of which 348 million dirhams (95 million dollars) in Egyptian exports, and some 422 million dirhams (115 million dollars) in Emirian exports, most of which were reexported, Fayed said.

Egyptian imports from Canada also increased to 150 million Canadian dollars during the corresponding period against 140 million Canadian dollars during the same period in 2001, an increase of 7%.
He added that there has been coordination between exporters and three major potato-importing companies to standardize packets. The weight of each packet that carries the Egyptian brand hit 1.25 ton.

But today, they have no mercy. They beat us while we are starving, " he added.

ISRAELI ADVANCED EQUIPMENT TO DETECT BORDERLINE TUNNELS
NEW TURKEY..AAND THE WAR
Nobody can imagine that the US would proceed towards its expected war without securing full Turkish cooperation.
It is true that its Atlantic side imposes obligations on it, but most of the Atlantic countries move at two paces towards the American war; a military pace trying to cope as much as it can with Washington's pressure and a political pace displaying slowness, objection and conditions.
Summing up the essence of the Turkish orientations, there is no exaggeration to say that Ankara does not seek a regional reconciliation strategy as much as it seems to be concerned with the war loots it could get.
Turkey's position is however lower than that of Israel and the evidence is that Israel started to get the price of its participation in the war on Iraq but Turkey would only get the minimum of its requests.
Israel has urgently voiced concern over the direct serious impacts of North Korea's decision to withdraw from Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) on the Middle East region. It claimed that the close relations between North Korea and each of Iran, Syria and Libya involve serious threats to the Hebrew State's security.
Furthermore, the report alleges that Syria has been bent for the last two years on developing a biological weapon containing the Ricin toxin, which damages the lungs and might cause death and which Israel has got no effective remedy for.
It claims that Damascus is practising a "dual" policy, while participating in the anti-terrorism war, to avoid being included in the axis of evil list, it regards terrorism a legitimate means to achieve political results.
On Sunday, Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) led by John Garang said that the new military agreement between Khartoum and Kampala signed by Sudanese Defence Minister Major General Bakri Hassan Saleh and his Ugandan counterpart regarding pursuing Ugandan rebels in South Sudan runs counter to the valid truce with the Sudanese government since last October.
AND WHY SHOULD SADDAM STEP DOWN!
This shift in American propaganda campaigns from insisting on the removal of Iraq's arsenal of mass destruction weapons to insisting on the removal of the regime headed by Saddam Hussein synchronizes with the emergency of the inspection operations results which gave the lie to American and British allegations, thus making it necessary to find another goal for the war.
Why don't the Americans have a liking for a ruler like Venezuela's President Chavez even though he had been elected by his people? Why do they now try to topple him?
Washington, which offered Amman an annual assistance to the value of $450 million in the past, has decided to increase its assistance to Jordan to hit about $1 billion in light of the losses the Jordanian economy would sustain in case of war outbreak, the sources said.
In a sit-in staged in the Red Cross headquarters in Gaza he said, "The prisoners in the Israeli occupation jails are waiting for being exchanged with (Israeli) hostages.
On the other hand, Sheikh Yassin wondered: Why does the U.S. want to solve its problem with North Korea peacefully and solve its problems with us through aircraft, tanks and missiles?
He also called on Arab countries and liberals of the world not to side with the aggression and the unfair war mobilized by America.
Lebanon's Interior Minister Ellias al-Mur, who was also the conference president, and CAIM Secretary-General Mohamed bin Ali Kuman, said a technical committee was formed of Arab interior and justice ministers to mull over including the crimes of instigating and commending terrorist acts, printing, publishing and distributing terror-related circulars, owning and using property in terrorist purposes in the list of terrorist crimes amerciable according to the anti-terror Arab agreement.
Krikar told Al-Hayat that his release revealed a scandalous conflict between the Dutch judiciary and politics.
After a decade of political rupture, Ankara and Damascus succeeded in signing a political cooperation and coordination protocol, which Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq Al Shar' regarded as a takeoff for serious bilateral cooperation.

Twenty per cent only supported the Iraqi opposition. The poll included 600 persons of different ages, religious and national categories.
Both visits were shrouded in secrecy and news about them leaked only on the last day.
He added that the visit would be "an important political step" to promote relations. He expected Sultanov to hold high level meetings.
The executive authorities have also been accustomed to charging international human rights organizations with collaboration with Western and Israeli intelligence agencies even though those organizations reports took care to take into account the points of view of both the government representatives and the victims.
In order that this step may lead to a better tackling of facts, it should be developed through seriously attempting to set up a ministry for human rights as is the case with some Arab Maghrib countries if we want to gain the support of international public opinion for our causes especially as the guilt of violating freedoms has extended to include, besides the government, categories that advocate despotism, alienation and opinion monopoly. These are categories that evade a confrontation with challenges of the age and is incapable of extending its vision towards the future.
The argument of the "axis of evil" has particularly fallen apart completely and entirely failed to stand the Korean test revealing both fragility and impetuosity.
Why is negotiation permissible with Pyongyang but a taboo with Baghdad? If, in both cases, no heed is paid by the USA to the interests of both peoples why, then, should a disaster crisis be avoided there, but courted here?
The first runs after the truth and the second pursues the truth-seekers.
Media is metaphorically called the fourth estate, but practically it has no power. The executive power is the true power.
It seems that control was not content with the press, so it extended to the Internet.
At a time when the industrial countries get one of their power sources from the spread of the Internet and the increasing number of users of its extensive services, the Arab world retreats to put it under official control under a decree from the Arab interior ministers.
USAID PRESENTS TRAINING GRANTS TO EGYPTIAN LAWYERS
They added that the new grants are considered a revival of an old project the State Department started 15 years ago to improve the judicial system in 5 Arab countries in the Middle East and North Africa. The programme prepared by the State Department provides that a number of judges and lawyers would obtain grants and training courses in cooperation with the Egyptian Judicial Studies Center affiliated to the Ministry of Justice.
PARALLEL WAR
What is going on, then, is some kind of moving in a vicious circle in a bid to blind the Arab peoples to and divert their attention from military preparations for hitting Iraq. If Tony Blair could possibly positively influence on Bush, Israel would constantly ruled out from the game.
Iraq fully responded to the UN resolutions and opened all its bases to the UN weapons inspectors and bore all their ribaldries and acts of provocation. It is only Iraq that has the right to say it is sick and tired as Iraq has not heard a good word from the US Administration or its British ally after all that cooperation.
The inspection period will end after two weeks at most. It is not expected that they would find the mass destruction weapons they are hunting for a very simple reason; the non-existence of such weapons, as the Iraqi officials affirm. This explains the state of nervous confusion President Bush is going through, which urged him to say he went out of patience.
Meanwhile, the respite for submitting such lists was extended till next 28th March. Head of Cairo and Alexandria Stock Exchanges, Sameh Al-Torgoman, emphasized that the Arab Stock Exchanges Federation is exerting efforts to set up a unified Arab Stock Exchange and energize cooperation and correlation among concerned Stock Exchanges.

The Saudi initiative adopts constructive points such as the rejection of any external aggression on any Arab country, implementation of internal reforms, enhancement of political participation, human resources development and creation of optimal conditions for a comprehensive Arab revival, all these and other points have remarkably been included in several Arab agreements and treaties like Arab Collective Defence and the Arab Common Market as well as most final statements issued by Arab summits since they started in the mid sixties of the previous century.
Talk about the enhancement of political participation is loose talk simply because it would practically mean the end of most current Arab regimes and we do not think that those regimes would step down and relinquish power of their own accord. Our contention can find solid evidence in the fact that the vast majority of Arab rulers, monarchs and presidents alike are planning to transfer power to their own sons.
Under this headline, chief editor of Al-Quds Al-Arabi, Abd Al-Bari Atwan writes an article, excerpts from which run to the following effect: Next week, Arab leaders and officials will head for Turkey in response to Turkey's invitation to seek a peaceful way out of the Iraqi crisis.
The regional countries that would participate in the coming Ankara summit can avoid the war if they take similar actions along the lines of those of North Korea's neighbours, i.e. refusing any kind of cooperation with the U.S. aggression, siding with Iraq in its confrontation and calling for lifting the ban imposed on it completely.
Having been doubtful that election overseers might not be judges, the Muslim Brotherhood member called for keeping ballot boxes, which are now at Damanhour Security Directorate, at the Judicial Inspection Department under the Ministry of Justice.
There is an articulate discrimination in treatment among party members, he said, noting that he and his colleague were "arbitrarily treated within the party, which cancelled their press capacity as journalists in the party mouthpiece of Al-Wafd."
A SAUDI INITIATIVE FOR SUMMIT: START OF NEW POLITICAL THOUGHT?
Criticism has been allowed provided that no specific Arab country is marked as a case of this reality.
After that, particularly after the 1991 Gulf war, the criticism of Arab reality became a mark of the Arab media.
It is special media as it enjoys a wider margin of freedom than that of the local official, or private media.
It is striking in this connection that the criticism leveled at the Arab reality in the parallel media is met with official silence, silence on commenting supported sometimes by winking at the acrimony of the criticism, but on condition of specifying no country being maintained.
It may be clear that this relationship is not governed by the fundamentals of law and rights. Rather, it is measured by the rules of a political game imposed by many developments that came over the Arab world in recent years. These developments urged the cultured or opinion-holders to be more modest towards stalemated reality and made the man of power, vis-à-vis the same reality, be more receptive to criticism as long as he is not the direct butt of criticism.
What happened last week is not totally irrelevant, but came at the end of a series of Arab movements and statements all intended to officially emphasize the Arab weakness whether in Palestine or Iraq or before the deterioration of the political and economic conditions inside each country separately.
The Arab world faces for the first time a real challenge related to its future".
The first main point is taking pledge before the peoples to secure the sovereignty of the Arab countries and the unity of their land and building Arab defense capabilities.
Therefore, the three main proposals of the initiative were related to the role of the governments in the issues of defense and political action inside every country and the restructuring of the Arab regional order to protect it from falling apart.
The two proposals related to the re-building of the Arab defense capabilities and the development of political participation inside the Arab countries should be noticed here.
The notable point in the other proposal is that it sees that the political participation comes within the self-reform program and that both represent a base for an Arab rebirth.
This is a new and positive development in the Saudi political scene.
However, these proposals need a key and complementary point; the point of freedom, freedom of thought and freedom of expression.
The political participation as a concept is not confined to the role of the official and legislative institutions, but even goes beyond this to the fields of research and media and all forms of expression.
But, on the other hand, those carry a big part of this responsibility simply because they are the men of power and decision.
Although the relationship between the two responsibilities is of controversial nature here, the beginning of reform must be from the men of power and nobody else.
We should not disregard here the local conditions and their interactions with the external conditions as a key factor also in this regard.
Al-Adli was speaking at the conclusion of the Arab Interior and Information ministers meeting in Tunisia. He pointed out that the members of the Muslim Brotherhood Group try in one way or another to appear with no link to terrorism and innocent of what is going on the arena. They try to appear as a religious organization that does not move to harm national security.
In a first reaction to the bill which has yet to be put up for discussion, Egyptian deputies said that the National Democratic Party (NDP) deputy (Fayka Al-Refa'i) had embarrassed the ruling party and its government because Egyptian Railways was excluded from privatization under clear-cut government pledges when the privatization programme started in 1991. This was meant to preserve the programme's social dimension and reject the government transfer of a utility used by almost one billion passengers annually to a private or investment sector.
Under the new bill, the authority will have a special budget to be prepared in the context of the unified auditing system without reference to laws and statutes regulating the authority budget.
U.S. Ambassador to Cairo, David Welch held 3 secret meetings with his officials and a number of U.S. nationals in Cairo last week in preparation for a possible U.S.-led war against Iraq.
Asharq Al-Awsat learnt that during his meetings, Welch answered questions raised by U.S. embassy officials which reflected fears of a reaction that "might be terrifying" if Baghdad is hit, in an allusion to potential attacks on U.S. interests in Egypt and the world in addition to the Iraqi army using weapons of mass destruction which the U.S. alleges Iraq is in possession of.
It might be mentioned that the American ambassador had held meetings with the U.S. employees and nationals in the American School in Maadi on January 13th and at the embassy headquarters on January 15th after amending the schedule, which was slated for January 14th for undisclosed reason. He also held a meeting at the USAID cafeteria on January 16th instant.
It also considered East Jerusalem capital of the Palestinian state.
The parliament will also enact personal status laws according to religions.
All Palestinian refugees and expatriates have the permanent and unconditional right to return, the constitutional proposal said.
It also banned sending any citizens into exile, denying them return to the country or extraditing them to a foreign country unless there is a relevant agreement between the Palestinian state and other countries concerned.
He added that the army had almost exterminated the terrorists.
He said he was ready to accept whatever results the elections might lead to even if the coming President was an Islamist.
Al-Amari praised the cooperation offered by French Intelligence in terrorism combating field, but in the meantime he criticized French political officials who applied a real embargo to the Algerian army regarding terrorism combatting means.
The protesters hoisted banners condemning U.S. policies which bias Israel against Arab peoples in general and the Palestinian people in particular.
"Palestinian martyrdom operations are a wonderful approach to deter and resist the Zionist invasion of our Palestinian land.
He termed martyrs as heroes and honorable men of this nation.
HIZBULLAH FREEZES ITS OPERATIONS IN SOUTH LEBANON DURING WAR ON IRAQ
Head of Hizbullah parliamentary bloc, MP Mohamed Ra'd denied to Al-Majalla any change in Hizbullah stand concerning launching operations against Israeli sites in Shebaa Farms which are still occupied by Israel.
"Resistance operations did not stop in the past and wouldn't come to an end today or during the war," Ra'd answered. However, Hizbullah sees no need to intensify such operations for field and regional considerations, even though such variables might change at any moment, he added.
UN General Commission for Refugees official statistics issued by its Cairo-based office emphasized that there are 10 thousand political refugees throughout Egypt.
The Egyptian government decided to set up a pentagonal committee to face the illegitimate emigration phenomenon into Egypt or of Egyptians to Europe, especially for some nationalities that use Egypt as a transit station to Europe.
There are 3 categories of political refugees in Egypt. Firstly, rulers, premiers or senior officials in their countries who were deposed through a political coup or a change in the government system or due to differences with the ruling regime, which forced them to come to Egypt and these are few in number.
An official in the Refugee Commission in Cairo says that Egypt is one of the leading countries with old traditions for granting political asylum without being biased to a certain individual or his affiliation even before the signature of the relevant international agreement.
The report pointed out that expenditure on hubble-bubble witnessed the biggest change in family average expenditure in the last four years, an increase of 143.5% in urban areas and 166.6% in rural areas. Expenditure on housing, fuel and house lighting came second with an increase of 125.7% in urban areas and 90.5% in rural areas.
Average family income in the last four years has ranged between LE9606 in governorate capital cities and LE6498 in Lower Egyptian cities and LE6944 in Upper Egyptian cities. Rural family average income averaged from LE7042 in border governorate rural areas to LE5160 in Lower Egypt and LE4953 in Upper Egypt.
INTERNATIONAL & ARAB GUARANTEES TO JORDAN AND PLEDGES TO PRESERVE ITS SECURITY DURING THE WAR
He added that Washington wants only humanitarian aid of Jordan which is expected to host potential refugees in the vicinity of its Eastern borders with Iraq.
Well-informed sources said that the possibility of evacuating European nationals from Amman ahead of February 15th was considered in anticipation of a war on Iraq late February next.
OPPOSITION AND INDEPENDENT MPs QUESTION GOVERNMENT OVER GROWING MENTAL

FOREIGN DIPLOMATS IN ISRAEL LEAVE FOR EILAT OR TABA FOR FEAR OF WAR
Israeli military commanders met on Tuesday to discuss a potential high alert during the Israeli general elections next Tuesday in anticipation of suicide bombing attacks. The military may remain on high alert until a potential war on Iraq is over, as requested by Israeli military sources.
In a lengthy interview with French political weekly newspaper Al-Amari said, "We have broken the backbone of the terrorists and only one thousand of them have been left."
Al-Amari's talk about accepting Islamists reminds those interested in the Algerian affairs of what happened in 1992 when the military, all of a sudden changed the game rules and stopped the elections when they sensed that the Islamic Salvation Front would certainly win and would soon form a government without the need of any others taking part.
He added, "We had difficulty getting even the ammunition used for shooting rifles for municipality guards."
Other banners called on the Arab nation from the Atlantic Ocean as far as the Arab Gulf to get united against the looming U.S.-led aggression on Iraq. The sitters-in also urged churches across the world to protest the potential U.S. aggression on the Arab country. They further commended Palestinian heroic martyrdom operations against Israeli targets, criticizing "Americanized and Zionist-ized persons" who consider such operations as "terrorist attacks".
From the Easter Church, we greet heroic martyrs and their families who should be catered for and supported since they are targeted by the occupation forces."
"Why do infamous western circles linked to Zionism want to describe resistance as terrorism, while winking at the fact that occupation is the real terrorism," he wondered. "It is our duty to resist for resistance is a patriotic action in the first place."
Hizbullah deputy in the Lebanese parliament, Abdullah Qusair made an announcement to the effect that all of Hizbullah operations against Israeli sites were but reactions to Israeli aggression on Lebanese civilians. This announcement raised questions whether Hizbullah intends to suspend its operations against Israeli sites at the time being.
He added that the timing of this announcement did not mean that Hizbullah refrained from launching operations against occupation.
Hizbullah will not intentionally open the South front during the U.S. war against Iraq, but it will be ready to square up to an Israeli move towards the Lebanese lands, he pointed out.
Double that number of refugees have also been monitored by unofficial statistics about whom the Commission is entirely in the dark.
The procedures of official bodies approval of granting political asylum confirms that the guidelines in that regard may be found in the July 1951 agreement and the January 1967 protocol on political refugees status as well as the items of international law.
Secondly, old refugees who came early last century and belong to different nationalities. This categories are mostly Armenians who lived in Cairo and Alexandria, merged with the community and worked in tobacco, jewellery, shoes and photography industries. They just like their counterparts in Lebanon, have become such an organized sect that they were allowed by local authorities to elect a sectarian council and set a constitution of their own.
Now Egypt is considered one of the least refugee hosting countries.
FAMILY INCOME INCREASED BY ONE THIRD IN FOUR YEARS, 167% FOR HUBBLE-BUBBLE AND 25% FOR FOOD
The report said that population of governorate metropolitan cities had the highest annual income, followed by city dwellers and then the rural population. It added that the gap between the lowest and the highest average incomes has widened in the last years, with the lowest reaching LE400 and the highest hitting over LE20 thousand. The citizen with over LE2000 income have constituted the widest base while the most disadvantaged constituted a tiny percentage as their number reached only 6 families out of 48 thousand families from all governorates.
Jordanian officials told Al-Hayat that Jordan's ability to absorb the consequences of the American strike to Iraq has improved after getting international and Arab guarantees to minimize the Kingdom's losses and pledges to preserve Jordan's security and stability during military operations especially regarding its Western borders with Israel.
Israel's entering the war on the USA side would double Jordan's fears of security disruptions in its street strongly sympathizing with Baghdad and would intensify confrontation with the political opposition especially the Islamic opposition which issued a fatwa (religious opinion) forbidding the extension of any form of support to Washington in its imminent war against Iraq.
The sources said that the evacuation decision would likely be left to the nationals' choice. Every EU embassy in Amman will send memos to its nationals in Jordan showing its willingness to help them if they want to leave Jordan and pay cash assistance to them if they have not enough money.
IKHWANITE MP PRESENTS DRAFT LAW BANNING TV COMPETITIONS
"There is a rapid growth in the economy of gambling such as what is so-called TV reward programmes," he said. Such programmes have become an important channel for spreading the "luck culture," which is contrary to work and production. Besides, they drain part of the incomes of those who participate in such programmes, he pointed out.
For Egypt, there is a set of circumstances that pushed it to facilitate this dialogue.
After all, the dialogue was an opportunity for Egypt to regain its part, and, at the same time, to keep intact Yasser Arafat's leadership, which appeared to be jeopardized unprecedentedly in recent months not only by the Hebrew country and its greater sponsor, but also by internal forces that seemed to be yearning to get engaged in the alternative leadership game.
We are not with those who said Cairo did want to suspend resistance.
Although opposition against him mounted in recent months, the message of dialogues will send matters back to normal, anticipating a different kind of shift, which is represented in attacking Iraq, a stage which was also heeded by Cairo so as to short-circuit any Palestinian bid to abate its referentiality.
In this context, to suspend resistance is a rejectable option to Fatah as it will undermine the popularity it won during the Al-Aqsa Intifada. The masses can not give anyone a "dud cheque" as the option of reversing can not be viable under Israeli suppression, killings and destruction in the fiercest, but greatest, battle, in the history of the Palestinians.
Neither Hamas nor Jihad went to Cairo to sign what may end their presence and influence represented by resistance for which martyrs sacrificed themselves so their line should be maintained. However, tactics should be reversed in a certain stage, just as what happened for weeks following the September 11 attacks on the U.S. or in 1998-2000.

Private commercial and investment banks also sold the dollar to their clients for prices similar to those of public banks.
Officials with these banks justified their stance refusing imposition of commission by lack of specified instructions issued by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) that stipulate imposition of currency procurement commission on opening credits on clients. These banks fear to face risks in case of selling the dollar for the black market prices, which swing from time to time.
Egyptian businessman, Rashed Mohamed Rashed has been appointed head of the first Egyptian-Dutch business council.
The Dutch commercial attaché laid it bare that the Dutch businessmen had requested the commercial department with the Dutch embassy to compile a study around Toshka for considering the possibility of transferring Toshka products to Europe through Abu-Simble and Marsa Alam airports as a springboard for Dutch companies to invest in Egypt.
He pointed out that the British companies seek to go into long-term partnership relationship with the Egyptian government and the private sector.
JAPANESE DELEGATION TO STUDY PROJECTS PROPOSED BY EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT
The visit came in response to the important visit paid by Minister of Foreign Affairs, Fayza Abul-Naga to Japan recently. During that visit, cooperation aspects were discussed and priorities were defined in 6 areas:
The Japanese ambassador said that the size of trade exchange between Egypt and Japan amounted to $580 million, out of which only $80 million as Egyptian exports to Japan. He added that they wanted to achieve balance, as Egypt would set up an organization for foreign trade on the model of the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO). It would aim at promoting and marketing Egyptian products on external markets.
STATISTICS: SERIOUS RETREAT IN DEMAND FOR CREDIT IN EGYPTIAN BANKS
It is noteworthy that the size of deposits in Egyptian banking system reached LE351.16 billion at the end October last and that total credits and facilities did not exceed about 80% of the deposits.
This, in consequence, affected the demand of serious or even faltering businessmen especially as the state of market recession is still on. Al-Barbari said that there was another important problem that affected bank profits. This problem popped up after intervention to cover the banks short positions in foreign exchange by using a part of the reserves while letting the banks secure their own resources. It is known that banks made profits from the differential in foreign exchange operations.

FINANCIAL EXPERT: POUND FLOTATION CONSOLIDATES COMPETITIVENESS OF EXPORTS AND TOURISM, HARMS INVESTORS AND DEPOSITORS

Therefore, financial positions of the companies that have foreign exchange resources would improve in contradiction to the companies that take out loans and import raw materials necessary for production in dollar. Such companies would incur losses owing to differentials in exchange rates of currency that are bigger than before.

Muslim Brotherhood, he added, are advocates of national unity and the necessity to put Arab and Islamic matters in order. They are doing their duty towards the Islamic call adopting dialogue as a civilized way.
He went on to say that if that war broke out, it would not end in a year or a couple of years as no military force would be able to defeat the Arabs who would fight the Americans using a technique similar to that used by the Palestinian intifada and the Lebanese resistance against Israeli occupation forces.

DEFENCE MINISTER: PERMANENT AND COMPREHENSIVE PEACE REQUIRES A MILITARY FORCE TO PROTECT AND KEEP IT
WHY RETURN TO DEMOCRACY MILITARIZATION?
What may come next drives us to anticipate prospective scenarios especially in light of the American call to teach the Arabs and Muslims the principles of democratic government, in accordance with the initiative of General Powell as well as other inflammatory initiatives!
We are being urged and pressurized by America, in the name of the necessity of democratic development and cultural, educational, religious and political reform as well as economic opening up and integration with the globalization market. Such demands comply with our peoples' long cherished aspirations and hopes, in quest for progress, liberation, development, social justice, wise government and rotation of power and sharing wealth whether in prosperity or adversity.
Thus the prerequisites of comprehensive and wise reform are put forward now and without delay lest we should fall prey to militarized democracy on the American model that had been previously proposed for Afghanistan and is now being proposed for Iraq and the rest later on in a row.

PALESTINIAN FACTIONS DECISION DOES NOT HELP MOVE PEACE PROCESS
NEW SAUDI MEMO OF ADVICE CALLING FOR REFORM AND FIGHTING CORRUPTION
The signatories tried to hand the memo to Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdel-Aziz but because his advisors and his office staff denied them access to his office. They resorted to sending it by the express mail. They also sent copies of it to all senior princes in the Saudi royal family.
Saudi sources said that such a project would be the main item on the agenda of the coming Arab League Summit, which would be held in Manama next March.
It might be mentioned that another memo of advice was issued ahead of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. It also called for similar reforms, but no practical implementation has been carried out. The signatories of this memo turned, then, into two Islamic opposition trends: the first was a London-based movement led by Dr. Saad Al-Faqeeh and Dr. Mohamed Al-Mas'ari, which was called An-Nasiha Wal-Islah (Advice and Reform Organization) while the second was more extremist, led by Sheikh Osama Bin Laden which has been calling for expelling the US forces from the Arabian Peninsula.

It is a war that claims the highest share of lies and has the slightest inkling of truth.
Those Europeans are not certainly as enthusiastic for the war as the British Premier, but they are eager to explore the end of the tunnel which the American Administration hard-liners entered and dragged them into too.
They simply ignored the fact that that monster was backed by another bigger American one which is now defying them now making light of the Western street, American and European alike? This might be a harbinger of the imminent war.
After a decade of non-policy, hesitation and confusion, Washington found the only way to cover its diplomatic failure was to unleash its military arsenal in a flexing of strength, the American audience is considered to be in permanent thirst for.
Everybody is trying to hide behind this lie as if the USA would fail to extract a security Council resolution or as if it did not frighten Russia, subordinate Britain, tame China threaten France and Germany to avenge itself on them! Or as if the other nine countries in the Council would object!
It does not want to destroy the infrastructure as if it were going to use mock bombs for intimidation rather than killing and devastating."
They have spent a lot of time trying to convince the world of the inevitability of this war and have used and will use a lot of lies in order to achieve that end so long as it has become imminent. It is not worthwhile to spend more time trying to find means to end the Iraqi people's suffering or shape its future.

Obviously, the government untimely decision has been urged by the fact that there is a critical retreat in the level of government owned foreign exchange reserves to $14.1 billion, thus making it impossible to use them for maintaining the rate of exchange policy. This was emphasized by the Egyptian president's instructions to his government to keep those reserves unprejudiced. Shock Treatment:

-The Supreme Council of Islamic Revolution in Iraq headed by Ayatollah Mohammad Baqer Al-Hakim. It has the biggest military Islamic Iraqi power, which is Badr Legion whose head is one of the preponderant Iraqi opposition figures.
-Kurdistan Democratic Party led by Masoud Barzani, which runs Duhuk province, most of Arbil and part of Mosul.
Fourth: The Liberal Trend, which was formed after 1991 and whose main organisations include:
Fifth: The Marxist Trend, which mainly represents the Iraqi communist party led by Hameid Majeed Al-Byati, the secretary general.
-Iraqi Tribes Gathering.
The second part is the liberal opposition, which would adopt a peaceful approach to oppose the Americans.
Due to the Sunni Islamic forces low percentage of population (around 20% of the Iraqi population) and their open or desert geographical areas, most of them would avoid armed confrontation with the US forces but would support Shiites in resistance operations.
Diplomatic sources pointed out that contacts are now underway between Arab and American parties on this issue particularly after the Gulf Cooperation Council GCC foreign ministers meeting. However, there is American opposition to the idea of forming the government of Iraqis in this stage. America prefers forming a transitional administration of American figures that would deliver power to Iraqi figures in the near future.
He said the objective of these projects and others is to change the Arab identity and try to get rid of it within a more comprehensive framework also including the separation of Islam from the Arabs so that it would not be the Arabs who speak in the name of Islam.
The KDP abided by the agreement so that its forces did not enter the city, he said, pointing out that what happened led to Kirkuk getting out of the Kurds' hands.
"We were actually ready for entering Mosul ahead of such uncontrollable situation and before the gangs start looting.
After the fall of the regime in Kirkuk and Mosul, we could almost enter easily, but we did not in order not to give an excuse and in order to have organized entrance.
- Do you hint to the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) entrance to the city?
What happened in Kirkuk allowed Turkey to interfere and send observers.
There should be accelerated steps to fill in this vacuum."
On 24th March, Jordan has signed an agreement with the US to reschedule $871 million of the American dues on Jordan.
Today (25th March) a donation campaign, organized by Mohamed Bin Rashed Al-Maktoum Charity Institution, will start at 2 pm in the state-owned Dubai TV to help the Iraqi people.
The Iraqis refrainment from resorting to the Jordanian border side represents one of the most outstanding anomalies of war against Iraq on the Jordanian arena. All indications and incidents have so far demonstrated that the big refugee camps set up on the Jordanian side to accommodate not less than 100 thousand Iraqi refugees have received no one yet. Though the war started five days ago, no single Iraqi refugee came, contrary to all expectations.
The Jordanian government had narrowly agreed to set two refugee camps inside Jordanian land on condition that the international organisations be financially in charge of them. Sources told Al-Quds Al-Arabi that the absence of refugee movement harmed international deals with some restaurants and food companies, which signed contracts of tens of thousands of dollars to provide food for hungry men supposed to be Iraqis.
Vis-à-vis this case, tens of media men who took hundreds of thousands of dollars from TV stations to be in Al-Rewaishid had to go back to Amman and impatiently wait for any story or event. From the Jordanian authorities' point of view, this state contributed to the leakage of untrue information and predictions about what is happening in the eastern area of Jordan.
The most outstanding anomaly circulated by Jordanians now through cellular phones is one that conveys a news item supposed to have been carried by CNN station to the effect that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein agreed to leave Baghdad with his family and top aides provided that they head for the White House.
The survey pointed out as well that the number of the viewers of the American CNN news channel has retreated to its lowest rate since the second Gulf War, during which this channel managed to attract a lot of viewers in the Arab world.
KUWAIT THREATENS LIBYA AND SYRIA
The new idea presented by the students via their website has proved a great success with their Egyptian relatives, who are searching for any means to support their brethren Iraqi people. They asked that that idea be generalized through electronic forums. This thought was adopted by many websites, which opened dialogue for it. The result was amazing.
The innovators of the idea said that it was discovered, through monitoring those who had called, that those calls made the Iraqis happy upon receiving calls. This had a great influence on raising the morale of the Iraqi people. They added that if each caller was keen on calling even for one minute and some 100,000 persons called, then they would boost the steadfastness of 100,000 Iraqi families.
Some other Egyptian youths made a proposal, via the websites that adopted the idea, to provide free international call cards to anyone who desires to call Iraq and has not enough money.
Another young lady called Mariam said that she succeeded in calling Baghdad after she had failed many times. She added, "I cannot describe to you the sincere feelings of the householder of the Iraqi family whom I talked to. He invoked blessing for me even more than I did for him. My tears betrayed me more than once when I was talking to him.
He quickly replied, "I'm an Egyptian and we here call random numbers to tell you that you are our brothers and we would never let you down. We will always pray for you and boycott your enemies.
"All of them expressed their happiness and surprise, emphasizing that their morale is high and asked us to sincerely and continuously pray for them. They told us they knew that our feelings were genuine and they were never angry about our stance," Akdar added.
Calling America as well On the other hand, Jihad through the internet forged ahead where some Muslim youths had innovated more thoughts for electronic Jihad, in reply to the call of many ladies through e-mail groups. The last of those calls was a message from a group of young people calling for escalating electronic Jihad. They said, "Dear members of Arab and Islamic e-mail groups it is necessary to coordinate efforts, unify powers and work together to uphold our poor brothers in Iraq and defeat the crusade criminal Anglo-American force." The new idea presents the following proposals:
This must be put in an easy, clear and brief English. Those who do not know English well, should read a text of a set of texts. We must ask them to watch a specific website or satellite channel in a bid to break the blackout of American disinformation offices."
This idea is not applicable for Iraq or its people because it was not defeated in World War II like Japan and because circumstances were totally different in both cases.
In a symposium at the Faculty of Economics and Political Science, Al-Fiqui rejected any criticism to be directed to the Iraqi regime now. He said that this would be "immoral" and would be considered in support of the aggression.
He set conditions for Israel to join that fresh regional system including reaching a just and comprehensive settlement for the Arab-Israeli conflict and subjecting all its nuclear establishments to international supervision and control.
He added that the present American Administration aimed at "crushing Muslims and seizing their fortunes and lands."
He added that Muslim Brotherhood expressed concern over the fate which has befallen everybody but regrettably no response was give by the governments to such sincere counseling. Instead they declared war on Muslim Brotherhood.
According to the reports received by the ruling party general secretariat, headed by Minister of Information, Safwat Al Sherif, the fact that the old cadres succeeded in retaining their positions points out their effectiveness with the masses.
Lots of the Israelis attacked the Egyptian pop singer, Shaaban Abdel-Rahim due to his new song "hitting Iraq". In his song he calls on the UN and the international community to necessarily look to Israel that possesses weapons of mass destruction, emphasizing that Iraq is void of such weapons.
In his article, the Israeli writer stressed the "naivety" of the Egyptian singer who, according to him, finds no difference between Sharon and Barak in his song "I hate Israel" of which he sold 15 million copies until now. however, he then described him as intelligent in dealing with some phrases that "tackles the fancy of the tense Arab street" when he described Bush as the leader of the Axis of Evil and Sharon as sitting in a Jacuzzi with Arabs blood dripping around him like rain.
The State represented by the Ministry of Finance has subscribed to the new markup that targeted reinforcing the financial positions of the four public banks, Barakat said.
The Authority is the main official buyer for wheat in Egypt, he said.
RETREAT OF LOCAL SAVING AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT
There are also the Egyptian marble, which competes with Italian; marble ceramics, whose industry has progressed in Egypt, in addition to natural gas of which the Egyptian fields produce good kinds, not to mention its huge reserves in Egypt, which is considered very near to Turkey, which can import it in the future, the minister said.
The new system will spare 40 million dollars, the company's head Eng. Atef Abdel-Hamid said. A delegation of bankers and representatives of EgyptAir headed by Delta International Bank chairman Ali Negm will fly to Paris and London on Tuesday to consider the finance of such planes with a number of European banks, he added.
Hotel occupancy rates reached 47% on average during the period from March 1st to March 19th and then declined to 38% in the remaining period of the month, Al-Beltagui explained. Cairo, South Sinai and the Red Sea governorates recorded the highest hotel occupancy rates, while Alexandria, Aswan and Luxor registered the lowest ones.
The General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAIFZ) started to prepare an in-depth feasibility study to have construction companies set up under the free zone system.
Minister of Foreign Trade, Dr. Youssef Botros Ghali said that Egypt's steel exports had achieved a considerable leap in the last period.
LE44 MILLION FROM JAPAN TO INCREASE WHEAT PRODUCTION
EGYPTIAN-RUSSIAN BUSINESS COUNCIL SHORTLY
EGYPTIAN ZONES TO STORE, SELL GOODS IN AFRICA
The permanent exhibits are considered the only guarantee to ensure getting sales proceeds through direct sale as a result of the weakness of the banking system in some African countries and failure to extend necessary guarantees on export risks, the official said.
A Russian delegation is expected to leave for Egypt soon to discuss the technical questions of the deal, the spokeswoman said.
The minister uncovered that there was close cooperation between Egypt and Holland in the fields of irrigation, as about 5 million feddans had been provided with subsurface drainage so far in cooperation with the Dutch side. The cooperation also covers besides recycling industrial and agricultural drainage water.
WALI: AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION UP 0.4% ANNUALLY
BANKING SECTOR NETS $1.1 BILLION SINCE JAN. 29
The governor pointed out the safety of foreign currency reserves, which hit more than $14.3 billion. Freedom of both entry and exit of foreign exchange inflows are ensured without any restriction.
Opponents of the committee's decision declared that the decision was against the Constitution.
Mousa, submitted an amended text requiring the Central Bank governor only to be born in Egypt and have Egyptian origins and Egyptian nationality, also said that his proposal allowed Egyptian nationals who had Egyptian mothers to assume that position, so as to treat them on equal footing with those Egyptians who assumed that position or other positions and were married to foreign women.
Following the committee's approval of the amended text, deputy Koota said that the controversy would be solved only after the bill was submitted in its entirety for discussion by the whole Assembly.
The rate of the dollar used for customs purposes surged up in the second month of the application of the monthly average system from 566 piasters to 575 piasters.
This agreement comes within the framework of diversifying sources of the imported wheat and not depending on a traditional market.
EGYPT, CHINA TO CONSIDER SETTING UP INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR MARBLE
It is noteworthy that China is the biggest importer of Egyptian marble blocks as the Egyptian marble exports to China in 2001 were estimated at about 50 million dollars.
Egypt was ranked ninth in terms of the most important countries that export husked or bleached rice with exports valued at 133.7 million dollars in 2001 and a market quota of 3.24% of the total exports worldwide for the same year. Egyptian husked and bleached rice exports hit 3.2% of the total Egyptian exports in 2001. Egypt exports to 53 markets.
EXCHANGE FIRMS SUE CBE
The defence emphasized that it is up to the prime minister, rather than the CBE governor, to make such closure decisions.
There is a big shortage in the revenues to the value of 21.9 billion pounds due to retreats in the proceeds of public tax, customs, sales tax, services and privatization, he said.
The economic authorities' budget has been illegally amended, something that led to a rise in their budget from 167 billion pounds to 176 billion pounds due to some authorities covering such an increase through decreasing the surplus of the government's quota and the remaining items of the current operations' surplus, he said.
EMIRIAN DONATION CAMPAIGN TO HELP IRAQI PEOPLE
FOREIGN REPORTERS BORED WITH NON-EMIGRATION OF IRAQI REFUGEES TO JORDAN
The circumstances point to the fact that since the war started, only one Iraqi six-member family has arrived to the Jordanian borders but refused to live in the refugee camps and preferred to return the day following. Up to Sunday, 474 comers mainly including Sudanese people had arrived and stayed for some days and hours in the refugee camps before their departure to their countries.
Due to the media and press boredom, some issues have been much explored and what is broadcast by TVs from the area is only words of praise by Sudanese comers about the services offered to them on the Jordanian side. The majority of media men there feel disappointed as they expected mass emigration by Iraqis that would help them prepare live testimonies to part of what is going on inside Iraqi land.
This is not the Jordanian anomaly on the sidelines of war as in the angry Jordanian milieus there is an outstanding tendency to circulate meaningful political jokes about war through tens of cellular phones to the extent that cellular phone operators complained about the heavy pressure on their lines.
In a related development, a lot of Cairo cafés posted placards on which they wrote the word "full up" due to the high turnout on the part of citizens to know about war news. Other cafés raised the price of watching Abu Dhabi TV channel and Al-Jazeera channel to three pounds, which is the same price paid by those who would like to watch the ciphered football matches which the Egyptian TV can not broadcast.
Within the framework of increasing Egyptian efforts to support the Iraqi people, whether through invocation in prayers or internet, Alexandria University students have devised a new method to support the Iraqi people. This step is part of a project entitled "Wipe the Tears of Baghdad" which comes within a series of "wrath panorama projects" to support the Iraqi people. The idea in a nutshell is to call any random Iraqi phone number and talk to its owner to encourage him to face his distress and tell him that all Muslims are bolstering him and all the Iraqi people.
They also noted how happy the Iraqis are due to this good step that shows inter-Arab and Muslims cooperation at the time of distress.
Some others volunteered to transfer the idea outside Egypt through inquiring about the way how to make international calls to Iraq from different Arab and foreign cities.
She explains her experience saying "God is Greater... my whole body was trembling" due to her attempt to wipe the tears of an Iraqi citizen.
Naser wondered, "Who is speaking and how did you know the number?".
The Egyptian young lady Akdar says that her four-member family and she called four Iraqi families.
The idea of calling the Iraqi people came to be the most modern method of Jihad via phone.
2- "Calling Iraq and its poor people in order to encourage them. This, however, must be done in a reverse way, in other words calling random phone numbers in the USA and calmly telling them that their sons are dying in the Iraqi desert in a free holocaust in order for the masters of the White House to enjoy Oil and for the sake of Israel.
Egyptian speaker Dr. Fatehi Sorour referred to Parliament's Education Committee an urgent statement tabled by Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) deputy Ali Laban regarding the Education Minister's attack on Katatib (Quran memorization schools) before Shoura Council holding them responsible for increasing illiteracy in Egypt. The committee will discuss and report the issue.
EGYPTIAN FM TURNS DOWN IDEA OF APPOINTING AMERICAN GENERAL TO RULE IRAQ
On the other hand, head of Foreign Affairs Committee in the parliament Mostafa Al-Fiqi said two days ago that the Anglo-American war on Iraq would continue for several weeks and the Iraqi people would not accept an American governor or occupation of its lands though it has earlier approved of the dictatorship of Saddam.
Al-Fiqi castigated the decrepitude of the present Arab regional system terming the Arab League as "paralyzed" and a sort of "useless folklore" that has failed to be effective."
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD GUIDE: AMERICA WANTS TO CRUSH MUSLIMS & SEIZE THEIR LAND
He emphasized that "the blatant aggression on the nation makes Jihad an obligation upon each and every Muslim man or woman.
RULING PARTY GRASSROOTS ELECTIONS IN EGYPT RESULT IN RETAINING OLD LEADERSHIPS
The reports said that such elections had been held with complete transparency and democracy on the part of the party, thus revealing the success of such an experiment regarded as the first of its kind in the party.
In an article entitled "in the face of mass wrath" published in Israeli Yediot Aharonot an Israeli journalist said that the song which made great sales, more than 4 million copies, in Beirut, Damascus and Amman in addition to its sales in Cairo. That song, he said, would never have been spread but for the report broadcast by a widely spread Arab satellite channel. He, further, pointed out that official TV channels in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and some Gulf countries ignored the song in accordance with what he described as "high level orders".
Boastfully, the Iraqis talk about a brigade of Arab volunteers including Sudanese and Jordanian nationals led by an Egyptian commando. The brigade inflicted heavy causalities in lives and machinery on American and British forces during clashes in the southern front under the command of Ali Hassan Al-Maguid.
A Russian newspaper points out that there are still Russian diplomats in Baghdad despite war dangers with the target of completing an important accomplishment carried out by some agents of the Russian intelligence with their Iraqi counterparts in Baghdad. This task is meant to obtain the secret documents of Saddam Hussein to protect and safeguard them so that his enemies could not get access to them in case the ruling regime in Iraq is endangered. The Russian intelligence men are keen on maintaining their relations with the Iraqi public and military intelligence alike.
* The Russian intelligence body getting access to the activities of the Iraqi agents and their activities in other countries.
Some make it likely that the Iraqi side will choose Russia if the situation worsens in order to safeguard such documents no matter the price would be especially as the Russian intelligence maintains close relations with Baghdad and because the Russian leadership defends Iraq and is opposed to the military campaign on it out of a Russian strategic perspective.
The next goal, which is considered the most serious to the Americans, may be Iran, as the U.S. seeks to solve the very strategic tasks given the fact that the oil reserve decreases worldwide, he pointed out.
China now is exerting growing pressure on Kirghizia where there is an American military base. Why, then, do the Americans need military bases in Kirghizia, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan? It seems that such a step means nothing after its control of Afghanistan.
Saudi firms are expected to win some reconstruction contracts and practically participate in reconstruction, an official with Jeddah Trade and Industry Chamber said.
There is a growing sense of unease haunting countries about US's trial to corner and control the Iraqi reconstruction market, he concluded.
WHOEVER SETS HIMSELF OFF AGAINST ENEMY-RANKS IS A MARTYR TANTAWI
There is a big difference between Jihad and terrorism, he said, as Jihad was legitimized in Islam to defend soul, homeland, abode, liberty, humanity and legal values. It was also legitimized to help the oppressed to get their rights.
All wise men should stand by the aggrieved party until it takes its rights.
EMIRIAN DONATION CAMPAIGN TO HELP IRAQI PEOPLE

Other cafés raised the price of watching Abu Dhabi TV channel and Al-Jazeera channel to three pounds, which is the same price paid by those who would like to watch the ciphered football matches which the Egyptian TV can not broadcast.
The idea is summarized that everyone would head to the nearest phone and calls a random phone number in Iraq and talk to the one who answers the call for one minute in order to encourage him. An Egyptian would call 00964 then Baghdad code (1) then any random number provided that it would start with 443, 818 or 527. This way he would ensure that he is randomly calling an Iraqi household.
Further, they called for not feeling disappointed if some attempts to call Iraq did not succeed owing to different circumstances and called on them to re-call before telephone lines are disconnected due to war.
Islamonline.net adopted the idea and presented it through dialogue channels in the website under the title "Alexandria University wipes Baghdad's tears". It started to receive the experiments of those who made phone calls with Iraqis to encourage others. The result was also amazing.
How come that he is more confident than me while he is going through such circumstances?
Just, dear brother, hold on and fight under the banner of "No God but Allah".
It is known that the Egyptian communication companies had devised many new methods for using the mobile phone in order to listen to certain songs, chat or listen to some Fatwas.
1- "Starting an intensified electronic Jihad through dealing media blows to the criminal American Administration by sending pictures of the criminal American build-up to the whole world and all American and British e-mail groups and dialogue groups. They also called for collecting the e-mails of as many American people as possible, including individuals, research centers, elites, magazines and websites. It is preferable to concentrate on the e-mail addresses of individuals, which are easy to be obtained.
3- Concentrating on electronic Jihad via a set of websites and develop these proposals by our computer professionals.
Consequently, Egypt categorically rejected that idea, he said.
"I don't defend that "blood-stained" regime due to all its bad record and the catastrophes it has caused for the region and its peoples," he said. "However, I'm against the brutality and genocide that our brotherly Iraqi people are being exposed to."
Talking about the Egyptian regional role in formulating the prospects of the region, Al-Fiqi called upon Egypt to formulate a new role that is based on educational, democratic and political reform model after Egypt lost its pioneering role in different fields especially education.
In a message he addressed to Muslim Brotherhood, Al-Hudhaibi hailed a fatwa (religious opinion) passed by Al-Azhar two weeks ago regarding Jihad (holy struggle) as an obligation upon Muslims in support of the Iraqi people and to repel aggression.
If those rulers had listened to Muslim Brotherhood's opinion and prepared their peoples for Jihad and brought them up on faith and sacrifice, the Jews would never have thought of sweeping Palestine nor would America have acted so preposterously nor would it have threatened the world, especially the Arab and Islamic worlds or tampered with its destiny and future, killing and capturing, detaining and torturing at will. It is America, after all, that now backs Zionism in Palestine and declares war on Iraq's Muslim unarmed people.
The elections were held in 6700 party units nationwide and ended yesterday after a span of 6 days to renew 25% of the members of those committees in accordance with the party's new constitution.
Lots of those writers think that the "troublemaker laundry worker' is striking the sensitive note for hundreds of millions of Arabs, i.e hating Israel.
DESTROYING IRAQ IS PRELUDE TO BESIEGING CHINA
The Russian newspaper sees that such documents are of a very importance to Russia in three aspects:
Some make it likely that such matters have been discussed between President Saddam Hussein and former Russian prime minister Yuvegeni Primakov when President Putin commissioned him a task last February ahead of the start of the American war on Iraq.
If the American and British intelligence bodies rely on their spies, the Russian one depends on the Iraqi-Russian cooperation as well as the previous and accumulated experience since the Soviet Union and its current inheritor: "the department of the Russian and international intelligence."
Here, we can reach a new issue emerged apparently. This issue envisages confrontations between the U.S. and China, which is the only power that can vie with the U.S. as the Chinese economy develops dynamically while the country suffers great oil energy shortage.
Of course, there is almost a need to such bases not to confront terrorism but to dominate the northwestern part of China. Surrounding China gradually depends on the American military bases in an indirect way.
Saudi businessman Abdullah bin Mahfouz told Al-Hayat that he was on standby to partake in Iraq reconstruction projects and compete for post-war commercial contracts and transactions.
The primary contracts would be exclusive to US companies, which would lead the reconstruction process, Saudi businessman Hussein Shobokshi said, pointing out that Saudi and other companies of different nationalities would come second to American ones.
Grand Sheikh of Al Azhar Muhammed Sayed Tantawi called for putting an end to the current war against the Iraqi people as soon as possible because they are a war-torn people.
To the contrary, he indicated, terrorism aimed at killing innocents, occupying lands and transgressing against freedoms and honour. There is a general legal rule terming as "terrorist" whoever transgresses, without a legitimate right, against others whether s/he be Muslim or Christian and Islam has clean hands of them.
Commenting on boycotting foreign goods, he said that fatwas must not be issued in that regard without reference to competent bodies to underline to what extent that boycotting is useful and whether it could harm individuals or the society.
Today (25th March) a donation campaign, organized by Mohamed Bin Rashed Al-Maktoum Charity Institution, will start at 2 pm in the state-owned Dubai TV to help the Iraqi people.
The Iraqis refrainment from resorting to the Jordanian border side represents one of the most outstanding anomalies of war against Iraq on the Jordanian arena.

The survey pointed out as well that the number of the viewers of the American CNN news channel has retreated to its lowest rate since the second Gulf War, during which this channel managed to attract a lot of viewers in the Arab world.
JIHAD VIA PHONE IN SOLIDARITY WITH IRAQI PEOPLE
Many Egyptians had called Iraqi people through haphazard numbers and talked to them and noticed that their morale is very high and that Iraqis insist on victory.
Calls made by some Egyptians uncovered a state of extraordinary solidarity. Some families started to call the Iraqis to boost their morale and pray for them.
Noura, for example, said that she had called the random number 0096414432642 in Iraq and a father of an Iraqi family replied to her.
Another one who calls himself "A Muslim who loves Islam very much" says that he succeeded in calling Iraq and an Iraqi youth called Naser answered him.
You must fight in faith not as to sacrifice for anyone."
Some Muslim youths had used that idea during Aqsa uprising in Palestine and started to direct young people to call certain numbers. The revenues of those calls are allocated to back the Iraqi people or to enhance other medical and social projects.
Ordinary mail addresses should be obtained as well in order to send them the pictures of rotten corpses of their sons so as not to think again of desecrating the Islamic world countries."

He, further, pointed out that official TV channels in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and some Gulf countries ignored the song in accordance with what he described as "high level orders".
Protecting the Russian interests in post-war Iraq, especially as President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov have articulately explained more than once that Russia has important interests in Iraq now and in the future.
However, Primakov explicitly told Saddam about this matter, even though it was not an easy one despite the friendly relations between Primakov and Saddam since the Soviet era when Primakov was former Soviet Union president Mikhail Gorbachev's envoy to Saddam Hussein to convince him of the military withdrawal from Kuwait and saving the Iraqi people, but the U.S.-led war machine imposed the withdrawal and sanctions for over ten years on Iraq.
Former chief of the national economic security body in the first main administration of the Russian intelligence spoke about the American aggression on Iraq. He said that what is going on now is not meant to promote democracy nor to make life go smoothly regardless of the U.S. efforts to promote such allegations. They speak about changing the regime in Baghdad. After such change, Iraq will be, then, ruled by a puppet government. Undoubtedly, it would be incapable of controlling the country without Western protection just as the case in Afghanistan.
Although the U.S. assault on Afghanistan was meant to eliminate Taliban, the real goal was its neighboring country - China. The Western military forces in Afghanistan seemed to have determined the borders on which China could extend its influence.
SAUDI BUSINESSMEN: READY TO COMPETE FOR RECONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS IN IRAQ
He added that British and US companies should not be let alone in that field, pointing out that Saudi businessmen should take well-studied and planned moves to win some of these contracts to "reconstruct a neighbour Arab country whose people would welcome us more than anybody else."
However, he said, US companies might depend on some Saudi businesses to provide their needs because of joint relations.
Al Azhar and Islamic Research Academy scholars' stance on that war goes in parallel with the Christian position declared by both Pope John Paul II and Pope Shenouda III, Tantawi said. Both stances are opposed to war and are calling for peace, tolerance and reconciliation, he added.
Jihad includes self-sacrifice, money-sacrifice and anything anybody can do to help what is right, Tantawi said in the conference.
When asked about the Palestinian cause, Tantawi said that the Palestinians should continue defending their rights by all available means and the UN should help them through subjecting Israel to its resolutions and forcing it to comply with them, otherwise, he went on, it could lose its powers as an international organization that has binding resolutions.
Deputy chairman of the institution, counsellor Ibrahim Bomelha told journalists yesterday that the aim behind the charity campaign was to help the Iraqi people in their distress and provide them, especially children, women and the old, with aid and basic needs.
It has been noticeable so far that big quantities of fresh meals have found no people to eat them near the Jordanian-Iraqi borders. Some of those who are there for whom the meals were not originally prepared get the meals free of charge now so that suppliers may not bear the cost of returning them to Amman.
It seems that foreign reporters know they have nothing to do in eastern Jordan for the Iraqis move in the opposite direction heading to Iraq and the people there are only truck drivers and customs and relief workers and there is no real way to know what happens outside the borderline.
Some local press expressions also entered the circle of fun. Arabs Today local newspaper carried on its front-page yesterday a word of advice to US President George W. Bush saying that he should receive lessons in geography due to his statements in which he said war would last longer because Iraq is a vast and "very rugged" country. The newspaper mentioned that Iraq is a plain and open country rather than mountainous and rugged, which requires that lessons in geography should be given to the ignorant president.
For his part, Dr Ahmed Mahmoud, the researcher at Cairo University and supervisor of the survey, said that excluding Maspero from the competition was not a surprise as there were former indications that confirmed that. At the last months, Maspero's following up of events was very poor.

They also noted how happy the Iraqis are due to this good step that shows inter-Arab and Muslims cooperation at the time of distress.
Some others volunteered to transfer the idea outside Egypt through inquiring about the way how to make international calls to Iraq from different Arab and foreign cities.
She explains her experience saying "God is Greater... my whole body was trembling" due to her attempt to wipe the tears of an Iraqi citizen.
Naser wondered, "Who is speaking and how did you know the number?".
The Egyptian young lady Akdar says that her four-member family and she called four Iraqi families.
The idea of calling the Iraqi people came to be the most modern method of Jihad via phone.
2- "Calling Iraq and its poor people in order to encourage them. This, however, must be done in a reverse way, in other words calling random phone numbers in the USA and calmly telling them that their sons are dying in the Iraqi desert in a free holocaust in order for the masters of the White House to enjoy Oil and for the sake of Israel.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher expressed his country's rejection of America appointing an American general to govern post-Saddam Iraq and repeating the post-World War II Japan example.
Al-Fiqi warned Saddam Hussein against using weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in his war against coalition forces because such an act would be naive that would make him lose wide international sympathy and make the war against him legitimate.
I call for a new regional system that brings Israel to account after we let it go monstrous for the last 50 years."
Muslim Brotherhood Guide in Egypt, Counsellor, Mamoun Al-Hudhaibi warned that America was seeking to "control the fortunes of the world and infiltrate into the centers of power and leadership in the world through crime, terrorism, deception, bribery and debauchery.
He said, "Everybody must understand that our defence and support of the Muslim people of Iraq should not mean the Iraqi regime but rather the Islamic people, land, nation and sanctities and mosques where Allah's name is often mentioned. He went on to say that "The unarmed people of Iraq are standing against America and its allies' tyranny and, through faith, stubbornness and steadfastness can, God Willing, repel the aggressors. This means that any faithful people who believe in their right and sacrifice for their freedom can face oppression and tyranny.
The elections of the ruling party units and grassroots in villages and districts resulted in most old leaderships retaining their positions.
ISRAEL ATTACKS SHAABAN ABDEL-REHIM
The song refers to the fact that disarming weapons of mass destruction in "something good" but not in Iraq as inspection teams did not prove that it has such weapons, rather in Israel which possesses such weapons and whose soldiers kill the old and the young in Palestine without any consideration to the international community. If, moreover, talks about the tragedy which the Arabs started to live since the September 11th incidents in New York and Washington and about the Arab leaders failure to unanimously agree on unified resolutions owing to the surrounding changes.
The harbingers of this world war are represented in the ongoing war behind the scenes undergone by the three intelligence bodies of America, Britain and Russia in order to get the archive of documents of the Iraqi State, the Iraqi intelligence documents in and outside the country, and the Baath Party's documents.
Determining to what extent Saddam's regime has financed Russian political movements and parties.
Anyway, it was announced that Primakov's visit to Iraq in February 2003 was meant to convince Saddam to cooperate with the UN. So, the visit was meagerly covered by the media amid different interpretations and speculations.
Following Iraq, the U.S. will try to change the ruling regime in Saudi Arabia. However, the events will likely develop and take another course of action peacefully.
Consequently, the U.S. exerted its efforts to install "the Western rule" in Afghanistan as if the matter was to draw geopolitical interests.
Many Saudi businessmen said they were ready to compete with American and British companies for juicy contracts of reconstructing Iraq once was over. Other Saudi economists, however, were of the view of the necessity of forming a Saudi bloc and not moving individually to win these contracts.
Moreover, Head of Saudi Export Development Center Dr. Abdul Rahman Zamil pointed out that the geographical location of the kingdom, adjacent to Iraq, nominated it to be a preferable supplier of construction materials, foodstuffs and Iraqi market needs. Thus, the kingdom has a good chance to participate and win some reconstruction contracts.
When Iraqi money comes back home from abroad in post-war stage, he expected, Saudi businesses could stand much better chances of signing contracts with Iraqi partners in the medium range because the Saudi market is very close to the Iraqi one.
Tantawi said in a press conference held yesterday (April 5th) and attended by a constellation of foreign and Arab correspondents and reporters that Al Azhar never opposed those willing to fly to Iraq to help the Iraqi people, noting that doors of Jihad were open.
Asked about "martyrdom" operations targeting American targets in Iraq, the Grand Imam said, "Whoever blows himself up against the aggressor is a martyr."
Tantawi pointed out that the Palestinian people should be confident of God's victory, pointing out that responsibility for the present goings-on is borne by the Islamic world including rulers and Muslim scholars, everybody within his role and competence.
The plan includes making the Palestinian security bodies undertake their works and extending international aid to them, which may include international field presence according to "an agreement between the two sides".
BASHIR GIVES FREE REIN TO ARMY TO PUT DOWN REBELLION IN DARFUR
WASHINGTON HANDS CAIRO LIST OF 500 EGYPTIANS FOUGHT IN IRAQ
The volunteers' issue is still fresh. The authorities seek to collect much more information about it, the diplomat said. "It's too early to speak about this issue and the list of volunteers while the war is not over yet," the diplomat said. He considered the linking between the two issues as mere confusion.
Some experts confirmed the possibilities of extending that pipeline in the near future and as soon as a relative stability is achieved in Iraq. They based their argument upon the ability of the Anglo-American administration to implement such a step especially as American military governor, who is a friend of Israeli Premier Sharon's and a Zionist symbol in the American lobby, would be heading Iraq.
He adds that if such a project was revived it would represent a golden opportunity for Egypt to be released, even though only in part, from the burdens of a reconciliation with Israel which might have forced it to pump Egyptian oil to it especially in light of the hazards involved in the American-Israeli scheme in Iraq and the region, which would hit the Arab interests including Egyptian interests in the heart.
Under this heading, chief editor Galal Deweidar wrote an article which ran to the following effect only in part:
We have to admit that such a disaster would never have taken place if it were not for the ignorance and madness of the Iraqi leadership that indulged in collaboration with the new American colonialism which aimed at liquidating and weakening the Arab nation in favour of international Zionism and Israel.
Now, everything is clear as the Arab countries are being exposed one after another to dangers and destruction due to the conspiracies of external forces that regrettably use internal forces- for instance the role played by the Iraqi regime which drove Gulf countries and all the Arab countries to the snare of American political and economic control and hegemony.
"The Jewish soldiers in the U.S. and British forces in Iraq should recite such prayers on the western bank of the Euphrates river," said Nehemiah Hehori, one of the rabbis who handed down this religious opinion. Every spot of this land is part of greater Israel, so prayers should be recited there to redeem and liberate this land, he said.
The remarks were made by the presidential advisor at a news briefing following an Egyptian-Jordanian summit on Monday. There is no comparison between Syria and Iraq under Saddam Hussein's regime.
CHARGE CAMPAIGN AGAINST SYRIA RUNS FIERCER
At a news briefing in Kuwait on Monday, he called on Damascus to mend its ways and provide full cooperation for picking up Iraqi leaders.
The list of alleged accusations included allowing Arab volunteers to enter Iraq via Syrian territories, sending anti-tank missiles to Iraq and providing safe shelter to Iraqi officials and scientists.
PARLIAMENTARY COMM. TO DISCUSS RELIGIOUS DISCOURSE SHORTCOMINGS
The committee, furthermore, proposed setting up a multilingual hi-tech Islamic satellite channel to be run by religious scholars who master foreign languages and capable of getting the right notions of religion across to people.
Shehab said that it usually took 3 years instead of 6 years on average to take out a patent.
Calling for scrapping the unanimity condition, he said AL resolutions should be adopted narrowly or by two thirds of AL members.
On the Iraqi situation, the president said nobody, whether governments or peoples, can approve of Iraq being ruled by non-Iraqis.
For the first time, debaters started to find the idea of economic liberalism appealing within the agreed upon principles of political liberalism, which constitutes a crucial upgrade in the ideas of the leftists who have refused for long to deal with the file of economic liberalism due to their bias towards a certain bracket of the society whose interests run counter to free market mechanisms. This could be a plausible explanation why the advocates of the new trend linked free market mechanisms to securing social rights for citizens.
However, the chairman of the conference Dr. Magdi Abdel Hamid talked about a broader vision of reform. Talking to Al-Hayat about that, he said that the latest developments require of us to formulate a new social contract. For his part, Mr. Farid Zahran, a prominent human rights activist, said, "The new proposal is based on the initiatives and proposals suggested a long time ago by several authorities to formulate a potential vision through dialogue with all popular authorities.
The constitution determines the country's government bases, political and religious identity as well as the basic components of its society, rights and duties and the organization of estates and their inter-relationships.
In a step, which will hopefully be put into effect without delay, the constitution ensures freedom of worship for all nationals and residents in accordance with the law and the requirements of protecting public order and morals.
Sorour pointed out that security has an integrated concept and that what is happening in Europe affects Egypt and vice versa, confirming that Egypt doesn't transgress against any neighbouring country. Saddam Hussein was playing a role in the region in favour of America which came to the point that it should play the role itself and end Saddam's role. Sorour considered that America in this stage sold Saddam down the river because it is in no need of his role as its forces came to the region.
Yesterday(13th April), the General Authority for Supply Commodities had concluded a loan agreement at a value of $25 million with Islamic Bank for Development (IBD) and it would also hammer out another loan agreement at the same value in the coming few days, said deputy chairman of the Authority Mahmoud Abdel-Hamid to Reuter's Agency.
Egypt topped the list of buyers of American wheat during the last five seasons but it descended to the 6th rank in 2002-2003 after it chose cheap imports from France and Eastern Europe. This step came as a result of the high increase in American prices which achieved its highest level in five years last September due to drought.
EGYPTIAN-TURKISH TRADE EXCHANGE UP TO ONE BILLION DOLLAR
It is a mistake to say that the production of the two countries are similar, the minister said, pointing out that Turkey, for instance, needs many commodities from Egypt including cotton of which Egypt produces many excellent kinds.
EgyptAir Holding Company decided to convert the purchase of 5 320-Airbuses to the financial lease system instead of direct loans.
He added that the period from January to March 2003 witnessed a rise of 12.3% compared to the same period last year as the number of tourists hit 1,184,000.
CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES TO BE GIVEN ACCESS TO FREE ZONES
GHALI: LEAP IN EGYPTIAN STEEL EXPORTS
He added that the fact that steel sheets factories in Suez started operation would increase such exports to one million tons annually as of this year. He went on saying that such factories were essential components in export development strategy to take exports of building and construction materials from $361 million in 2001 to about $1 billion in 2006, with steel exports claiming 25% annually.
According to the Egyptian government, 90000 hectares of agricultural land would benefit by that grant as wheat production is expected to rise in those lands by 15% from 570000 tons to 650000 tons.
He called on Egyptian companies to study the need of the Russian party to import several commodities like medicines, serums, vaccines and cosmetics. Russian businessmen should try to make use of Egypt's membership of the COMESA which have 300 million souls.
"Egypt seeks to make up for the retreat in exports to the Iraqi market following the collapse of the government," said an officer in foreign trade sector, confirming that African markets were the best to accommodate Egyptian commodities on condition that exporters comply with the specifications required by such markets.
Egypt and Russia have resumed bilateral talks on a 5-year deal that provides for giving Egypt one million tons of wheat on a yearly basis, said a spokeswoman for the Russian Ministry of Commerce.
The Egyptian-Dutch Consultant Council is currently holding a meeting in Aswan under the chairmanship of Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Dr. Mahmoud Abu Zaid.
Holland will also probe a project for developing the navigational course of the river Nile in cooperation with the ministries of transport and water resources. The cost of that project will be 600 million dollars, 40% of which will be financed by the Dutch side.
He explained that such a strategy relies on giant national projects in Toshka, South Valley, Sinai and West Nubariya in order to meet the needs of food and strategic stock on the national level.
Soon, he added, the first electronic system would be put in force in order to show on the spot the foreign currency selling and purchasing operations in banks and exchange firms on the CBE screens.
The debate, which started during the committee's discussion of the new banking law, triggered a heated argument.
"This was an unnecessary measure that denied access to this job to competent bankers and financiers who may be more worthy of this position," he pointed out.
The latter were just civil servants who could be fired or retired or replaced and were like any other occupants of senior positions in the civil service, they said, while membership of the People's Assembly required loyalty to only one origin and one fatherland for representation of an Egyptian constituency, so as to avoid suspicions of divided loyalty, particularly as the Assembly was discussing certain topics related to Egypt's relationship with the country whose nationality was borne by the deputy or deputies in question.
CUSTOMS DOLLAR UP TO 575 PIASTERS
The final formula of the trade agreement between Egypt and Russia was approved yesterday. This agreement will last five years as per which 1.5 million tons of Russian wheat per year will be exchanged annually for Egyptian commodities such as vaccines, rice, fruit, onion and garlic. It is worth mentioning that these products represent 50% of the deal value.
It was agreed on a financing mechanism at distinguished and preferential prices, he said.
It was agreed with the manager of the national bank in Shanghai to cooperate with the chamber so as to put it onto all information about the Chinese market as well as the means of cooperation with different marketing companies.

Over the last two months, the CBE shut down around 23 exchangers, 11 of which challenged the shutdown with the court, while the others are bracing for taking similar legal actions soon.
US BUSINESSES COMPLAIN ABOUT RECESSION IN EGYPTIAN MARKET
Uses hit 119.5 billion pounds against 85.3-billion-pound revenues, a thing that necessitates rationalizing expenditure, widening the taxpayers' slash, reviewing customs exemptions and combating tax and customs evasion.
The government's internal public debt is steadily increasing. It rose from 147 billion pounds in 1998 to 194.8 billion pounds in 2001, in addition to the net debt of the economic authorities, which accounts for 45 billion pounds. The National Investment Bank's debts are estimated at 54 billion pounds, he pointed out.
The CAA uncovered continuation of negative phenomena concerning the implementation of the budget's projects, foremost of which are the choosing of inappropriate projects, inadequate initial studies and putting such projects up without removing the existent obstacles, which led to sluggish implementation and aggravating burdens, he said. Al-Malt warned against amending the items of the budget's projects during the implementation process in violation of the law. The implementation parts of some projects, for instance, exceeded what was planned to a great extent, he said.
It is noteworthy that the last few weeks witnessed periods of negotiations and suspension between Bavaria Auto and AKFA owing to disagreement regarding the value of the deal. The new BMW agent tried to practice pressure to buy the company's assets at the lowest possible price. AKFA also tried to be strict in the negotiations especially that the establishment of a new factory is a tough task for the new agent that will take a long time before restoring the market.
The successive rises of the iron prices on the markets during this period led to the stoppage of a large number of contractors for fear of losses resulting from prices differentials and the rise of costs.
Nobody has interfered to rescue this industry from the current stalemate or to compel the two companies that produce the billet - one of which is State-owned- to distribute the billet under the quota system to local factories in order to decrease production costs instead of three factories monopolizing the whole Egypt's production of billet, he added.
Sharq (East) Delta for Electricity Generation Company has prepared all the studies of Talkha power station including preparation of the land on which it will be erected, Egypt Electricity Holding Company head Dr. Mohamed Awadh pointed out. He added that the electricity sector was cooperating with a number of Arab and international financial bodies to provide the required investments for the construction of such power stations.
An initial memo of understanding was even reportedly inked by the three parties last Thursday. It provided for scraping the third mobile phone network supposed to be under Telecom Egypt in exchange for 2 billion pounds to be paid by the only two mobile phone providers in Egypt, 1 billion pounds each. In return, they will be exclusively allowed to offer their communication services for another five years, ending in 2007.
Some were vexed that the two businesses might take the opportunity of the 5-year renewal to carry out the so-called "organized market monopoly" through coordinated service markupetc.
A working group of the ministry's experts and private sector representatives has been formed to conduct the studies of the first stage, which includes 140,000 feddans, Abu-Zaid told Al-Alam Al-Youm.
The ministry takes part in many national projects to provide irrigation water and develop irrigation policy with a view to supporting agricultural development operations with 37.35 billion pounds till 2017, he added.
Yesterday, two financial agreements were signed by the European commission with Egypt for vocational training and supporting exports at a total of 73 million euros, 33 million of which for the first agreement and 40 million euros for the second.
The second agreement allocates 36.6 million euros for directly supporting the budget of a facilitation programme of the structural reforms required for boosting exports during a period that reaches 30 months. It also earmarks 400 thousand euros for the programme's control and evaluation operation.
On Wednesday, Belorussian ambassador and commercial advisor in Egypt will visit the Chamber of Commerce in Alexandria with a view to boosting commercial and economic relations between the two countries. It is expected that during the meeting with the Chamber's members, the ambassador will speak about the available goods that will be exported to Belorussia.
Wali made these remarks during his meeting yesterday morning (April 29th) with the minister of agriculture and piscine wealth in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). "The Congolese President tasked me with boosting relations with Egypt in the field of agricultural cooperation," the Congolese minister said, noting that the Congolese president was keen on establishing a model farm in the DRC to transfer the applicable Egyptian agricultural experience to the Congo, as was the case with neighbouring Niger.
Within the framework of Egypt's keenness on activating COMESA agreement and making full use of its preferential advantages, an exhibition for the Egyptian products will be mounted in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi during the period from May 23rd to June 1st. This also comes within the context of choosing Kenya as a center for promoting and marketing Egyptian products in Kenya's neighbouring countries in light of an Egyptian trade strategy greenlit by Minister of Foreign Trade Dr. Youssef Botros Ghali for moving in Africa.
The volume of Kenya's trade with the world countries in 2001 hit about 5 billion dollars, of which 3.1 billion dollars stood for the value of its imports. Egypt's exports to Kenya in 2001 were estimated at 20 million dollars, while its imports from Kenya accounted for 95 million dollars. Egypt's imports from Kenya are mostly represented in the Kenyan tea, which is highly favoured by the Egyptian consumer because it is customs-exempted according to the COMESA agreement. This decreases its cost and it is, consequently, sold at competitive prices on the domestic market.
Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa are considered the biggest African economies. They also take part in major economic blocs in Africa, he added.
A decision was taken to set up common farms jointly by Egypt and Sudan to cultivate 60 thousand feddans, 50 thousand in Sudan and around 10 thousand in Egypt.
EGYPT CONTRACTS TO CONSTRUCTION, RUN OF RECYCLING WASTE IN LIBYA
Minister of State for Military Production Dr. Sayed Mashal said that the factories came within the framework of the Ministry's contribution to the state plan for economic development. He pointed out that the construction of factories for recycling garbage into organic fertilizers would achieve a return that might reach LE165 million distributed to most governorates of the republic.
The value of Egyptian exports to the Arab countries that signed free trade agreements with Egypt, namely Libya, Syria, Lebanon, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan and Iraq, went up to 381 million dollars, up 32% during the period January-November 2002. Meanwhile, imports decreased to 138 million dollars or 12%. Egypt achieved a trade surplus in its dealings with such countries at a value of 243 million dollars against 133 million dollars at the same period in 2001.
This month Egyptian electricity construction companies will start executing a project in Libya for extending 400 kilovolt super voltage electricity linkage lines. The tender of this project was awarded to a consortium of those companies in Libya after a severe competition with international companies. The lines extend for 750 kilometers and would cost about 95 million dollars. The project aims at connecting Libya with the Arab unified grid as well as providing new job opportunities and foreign currency.
Eng. Shahat added that the three Egyptian companies, namely Elegect, Highdilco and Kahromica, had vast international experience in executing giant projects of electricity lines in different Arab and African countries.
It is expected that the files of the ban imposed on Egyptian red meat, poultry, and potato exports on the one hand and the dumping cases filed against Saudi ethylene and polypropylene exports to Egypt will top the committee agenda on its part related to the commercial and economic cooperation between the two countries.
There are sincere intentions from both parties to overcome such hindrances through holding technical committees and exchanging visits on the levels of businessmen and specialized experts, he indicated.

Dr. Othman pointed out that the society is really desirous of supporting and encouraging foreign investment where Egypt needed about $3-4 billion to make up for the shortage of local savings. He, further, highlighted the importance of sustaining the structural reform processes and giving the private sector the chance to play its role in development and production processes.
After the end of the ongoing war, contacts and visits will be resumed between the two countries in order to boost cooperation not only within the bilateral relations of the two countries but also with the participation of other Arab, African and Central Asian parties, he said.
FINANCIAL LEASE FOR EGYPTAIR PLANES
Rates of tourist movement went down last March to 356,378 foreign tourists, a decline of 22.4% in comparison to the same month of the previous year, said Minister of Tourism Mamdouh Al-Beltagui.
The Ministry of Tourism tries to activate the tools of crisis management including charter flights programme and public relations campaigns abroad in order to assure the climates of stability in Egypt as well as its distance from the theatre of operations geographically.
Setting up construction companies under the free zone system will be conditional on directing the company's activities to work abroad whether in the free zones themselves or in foreign countries or in the special economic zones that are operative under the offshore system, he added.
Dr. Ghali pointed out that such a deal had led to a rise in Egyptian steel exports to the USA from 72 thousand tons in 2001 to 122 thousand tons in the period from January to September 2002, a 51% rise compared with the corresponding period of the previous year at a total value of $169 million to all markets.

The Dutch side will also participate in establishing an experimental farm in Toshka on Branch No. 3 on an area of one thousand feddans with a view to determining the best plants that are most appropriate to the area and the best water treatment ways that suit such plants.
The strategy is also meant to increase the cultivated area by some 3.4 million feddans over the coming twenty years by boosting intensive and extensive farming, exploiting resources, developing animal wealth and allotting fresh arable lands to organic plants with a view to increasing agricultural exports and achieving food security, Wali added.
During a symposium on comparing exchange rate experiments in Egypt and Pakistan, Abul Oyoun said that all the negative effects, which had been expected as a result of the Iraqi war on the exchange rate on Egyptian market disappeared. Abul-Oyoun added that the CBE abided by supply and demand mechanisms of the exchange rate in the banking system. Banks have the freedom to determine selling and purchasing prices without any intervention, he said.
Once again, the People's Assembly opened the file of dual-nationality citizens, following the approval by the Assembly's Economic Affairs Committee on 16 April of a motion authorizing citizens who carry dual nationality or have a dual-nationality Egyptian parent to assume the position of governor of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE).
On the other hand, the Chairman of the Parliament's Legislative Committee, Counselor Mohammad Mousa, declared that he had succeeded in the tedious job of getting the Minister of Finance and the Central Bank Governor to agree to the removal of a government-introduced text that required candidates for the governorship of the Central Bank to have Egyptian parents.
Proponents of Mousa's proposal include the Chairman of the Economic Committee, Said Al Alfi; Amr Al Hini; Dr Fayka Al Refa'ee, former deputy governor of the Central Bank; Munir Fakhri Abdel Nour, leader of the Wafd Party opposition in the Assembly; and Abdel Fattah Diab. They said that there was a big difference between allowing dual-nationality citizens to become members of the People's Assembly and allowing them to become governors of the Central Bank of Egypt.
It was also Mousa's Legislative Committee that led the campaign for ousting these dual-nationality members, acting on a report from the State Commissioners.
EGYPT-RUSSIA DISCUSS WHEAT FOR PRODUCTS DEALS
The discussions started last January in Moscow, the source pointed out.
On the other hand, the commercial bureau in Peking disclosed terrific opportunities for exporting Egyptian marble and granite to China, pointing out that the Chinese and Korean markets are nascent ones for Egyptian marble and granite.
About 75% of the U.S. and European consumers showed their favour for the logo that distinguishes the Egyptian cotton-made products, said a study conducted by a major international marketing agency, which included the markets of five countries last March.
For his part, Minister of Foreign Trade Dr. Youssef Botros Ghali emphasized that the research results confirm the success of the first stage of the plan of marketing the Egyptian cotton logo, raise the awareness of all consumers of the super quality of the Egyptian cotton. The awareness campaign will continue in parallel with the efforts exerted to create more export opportunities to the cotton producers in Egypt, he added.
There is a possibility to expand the current main markets of the Egyptian husked rice exports in addition to getting access to other promising ones through doubling marketing efforts. Foremost of such markets are Iran, France, Cameroon, Indonesia and Germany.
Next Saturday, it will also examine a similar case, while it adjourned six other cases until May 3.

The volume of the economic authorities' investments is estimated at 300 billion pounds, while the revenues do not exceed one billion pounds, he said, pointing out dangerous excesses and violations in the rewards of some personnel in such authorities.
Egyptian highly-placed economic sources told Asharq Al-Awsat that the U.S. imports of textile and ready-wear clothes would be controlled by China by 2005. By this date, there will be limited scope for a certain number of developing countries on the U.S. market especially Vietnam, India and Pakistan, in addition to the countries that enjoy export preferential advantages to the United States such as the countries that concluded free trade agreements with it, the sources pointed out.
Egyptian and Moroccan businessmen agreed upon implementing 6 joint projects at investments of over 105 million dollars in the fields of fishing, tourism and production of PVC and some other chemical substances, sports equipment, and medical supplies.
Reinforcing iron industry in Egypt is facing a crisis after the deregulation of the rate of exchange. The price per ton of the final product amounted to 1100 pounds in one month to hit 2100 pounds against 950 pounds before the liberalization of the rate of exchange.
Iron industry investors called for stopping monopoly acts by three major factories, which monopolized the local production of billet amounting to two million tons while other 19 factories depend on imported billet. They stressed the necessity of setting aside part of the billet for them in order to bring about some sort of balance in the iron cost and maintain appropriate prices.
Ministry of Electricity decided to set up 3 power stations in South Sinai, Safaga and Talkha at capacities amounting to 2200 megawatts to support the electricity network in Sinai, Canal, and Delta areas and pump the surplus to the unified grid at a total cost of one billion dollars.
COMMUNICATIONS SECTOR STUCK IN PREDICAMENT
Last week, Al-Alam Al-Youm exclusively carried the details of the deal which is still being negotiated by Cairo and European cities. News agencies and local and Arab press had aired the report quoting the paper. Under the deal, 1.975 billion pounds paid by Telecom Egypt to obtain a third mobile phone licence will be reimbursed for it, while the two companies will be given further relative privileges, including allowing them to offer their services for further five years to come, and lowering costs and sales taxes.

There is a program to renovate 1571 against pumping stations and setting up new ones at a cost amounting to 11 billion pounds. Some locks and barrages will also be set up on the two branches of the Nile and Al-Tawfiki main canal with costs over 5 billion pounds, he made it certain.
The first agreement is related to a total of 33 million euros, half of which will be contributed to by the European Commission over six years for supporting vocational education and training programmes in Egypt through expanding their bases and upgrading their systems in order to qualifying vocational centers and schools graduates to match their counterparts in developed countries.
Both agreements came within the framework of cooperation priorities between Egypt and the European Commission defined by the European Commission in December 2001 in the European Strategic Programme for Cooperation with Egypt in the period from 2002 till 2006 in order to support the Egyptian economy transitional phase and achieve sustainable economic and social development in Egypt through ensuring the conditions required for sustainable economic growth.
EGYPTIAN EXPERTS IN DRC TO PUT SCHEDULE FOR ESTABLISHING MODEL FARM
Discussions between the two officials touched upon the possibility of developing cooperation between the two African countries in the touristic field, growing aromatic plants, herbs and manufacturing medicine and petroleum products.
The exhibition will also include chemical and craftsmanship industries as well as leather products. The exhibition is considered a means through which the Ministry of Foreign Trade seeks to decrease trade balance deficit between the two countries through promoting Egyptian products needed by Kenyan markets.
Egypt has entered into negotiations with Nigeria and South Africa with a view to concluding free trade agreements whether with each country separately or or with both countries together, said Minister of Foreign Trade Dr. Youssef Botros Ghali, who expressed hope that the current year may witness the start of negotiations with the two countries.
Through a trade agreement with South Africa, which has different economic sources, commercial relations will benefit the Egyptian economy through competition, attracting investments and transferring technology. Besides, agricultural integration may be achieved between the two countries through the climactic differences in summer and winter between Egypt and South Africa, a thing that provides large opportunities to transfer sophisticated technology in the fields of agriculture and food processing.
He pointed out that every farmer would own 5-30 feddans. The first stage will be applied in Upper Egyptian governorates including Beni Suef, Assiut, and Sohag. The second phase will be executed in the Lower Egypt governorate of Kafr Al-Sheikh.
The arrangement of constructing another seven factories worth $35 million are now underway. The Ministry is conducting talks with the Sudan, Syria and Jordan to export such factories.
EGYPTIAN EXPORTS TO SAUDI ARABIA UP TO MAXIMUM
On the other hand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is considered the first Arab partner and the third foreign one after the European Union and the USA. The volume of trade exchange between both countries hit about $800 million in 2001. Saudi Arabia also ranks first among Arab and foreign countries as far as investments in Egypt are concerned, continued the report. The total of investment projects in which Saudi capital took part hit 575 projects in 2001, whose issued capital was LE17227.3 million at investment costs of LE26279.3 million.
As regards the trade exchange with the COMESA countries during the same period, exports dwindled by 10% to hit 58 million dollars while imports hiked by 34% to hit 283 million dollars, thus increasing the deficit of the balance of trade with such countries to 226 million dollars with a 147-million-dollar deficit in the reporting period of 2001.
On the sidelines of the ministerial bureau of Arab electricity minister meetings, Yunis had discussed with Secretary-General of the Libyan Public Committee for Energy Omran Abo Quraa ways and means to second cooperation and give the chance to electric construction companies in both countries, the minister pointed out.
EGYPTIAN-SAUDI CONSULTATION TO SETTLE DIFFERENCE OVER DUMPING
Attempts are underway between Cairo and Riyadh to settle the commercial differences between them, said First Undersecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Trade Sayed Abul-Qumsan. Removing the obstacles that limit the Egyptian-Saudi trade exchange of some commodities need painstaking technical measures that might take some time to be activated, he added.
The dumping duties imposed on some Saudi petrochemicals are still temporary, said Ministry of Foreign Trade-affiliated Anti-Subsidy and Dumping Body chief Abdurahman Fawzi. It is a technical and commercial matter that can be overcome through negotiation and understanding with Saudi complaining companies, he said.
In a study on the prospects of monetary policy in the country three months after the liberalization of exchange rates entitled, "Rationalization of the use of CBE monetary Policies," Al- Shafie pointed out that the operational goal of the monetary policy is to influence nominal interest rates orientations on the Egyptian capital market in the short term.
In order to achieve such a goal, the CBE started a comprehensive modernization process that took into account the technological development and the smooth flow of information.
The change in exchange rate led most of the companies that provide the ministry with supplies to withdraw their quotations and submit new ones that cope with the market prices.
Owing to that situation which is threatening the electricity sector, Yunis convened many meetings last week with a number of officials with the ministry to mull over the measures that might be taken to ensure collecting the dues of the ministry and government-owned companies as well as public and private sectors.
Dr. Yunis was lately exposed to many pressures from the ministry's officials and the head of People's Assembly Industry and Energy Committee as well as some MPs to examine the subsidy of household brackets, from which about 98% of the consumers benefit. They asked him to slightly increase some brackets, which would not be greatly affected, but the circumstances are reverse for that step. Asked by Asharq Al-Awsat about that question, the minister replied, "Increasing the price is currently out of the question."
The coming stage will see a big rise in the costs of water used in new water projects, the minister said.
The remarkable shortage of fertilizers led to a price rise as the exportation of fertilizers exceeded the allowed limits, hence the Prime Minister Dr. Atef Ebeid's decision to stop exportation of fertilizers, said General Association for Agricultural Credit head Abul-Abbas Othman.
EGYPTIAN COTTON PRICES UP DUE TO SARS
"Consequently, the Ministry of Agriculture is intent on encouraging farmers to boost their cotton production through increasing the price rate of buying cotton from farmers."
It, furthermore, sent its delegates to the Ministry of Supply and Domestic Trade while the delegation was in Cairo in order to inquire about anything that might be relevant to such negotiations.
FOREIGN POSSESSION OF EGYPTIAN BUSINESSES ON RISE: SURVEY
The new year's budget is one of the biggest budgets in Egypt's history as it hits 158.6 billion pounds, a rise of 15.6 billion pounds over the current budget. The new budget focuses on the social dimension through increasing the funds necessary for low-income categories' care, particularly in light of the advance in the prices of some commodities.
The third concern of the budget is rationalizing the government's expenditure and adopting expansive policies to reinforce the economy and put an end to the state of recession dominating the market.
This decline came at a time when Egypt's foreign exchange resources were witnessing a tangible improvement particularly at the level of tourism, expatriate remittances, and Suez Canal revenues.
Credit facilities extended by banks to their clients witnessed a rise after a one-month decline.
The cash reserve with the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) continued to decline, thus reaching 14 billion and 79 million dollars only late last January, a fall of 272 million dollars compared with last December.
With regard to credit facilities from banks, aside from the CBE, the report said the total lending and deduction balances reported late last January a rise of 12.1 billion pounds in 9 months as they hit 275 billion and 815 million pounds of which 14.7 billion were given to the government and around 261 billion pounds to non-government bodies.
British Petroleum (BP) is planning to dig three exploration wells in the Gulf of Suez this year. Now, one of these wells is being dug in the concession area L.L87, which the company has been granted recently.
The Ministry of Petroleum in Egypt has announced that a giant project for the production of pipes would be carried out with Kuwaiti contribution (60%) and investments of $95 million.
Board member of the General Exporters Division at the Federation of Chambers of Commerce Medhat Mustafa, who is also a major marble exporter and investor, said the Chinese who have quarries in Egypt started to undersell marble as a prelude to cornering the overseas market.
Marble exporters called for passing a decision preventing foreigners, especially the Chinese, from hiring or possessing quarries in order to preserve Egyptian exports.
Printing industry in Egypt is threatened with collapse due to the successive advances in paper prices following the decision on the exchange rate deregulation.
Paper prices jumped up last year to reach some 3325 pounds, but following liberalization of the rate of exchange they hit 5,000 pounds, which is unaffordable for big and small printing offices.
There are 15 thousand workers in printing offices threatened with dismissal because of such a crisis, said Baghdadi. 36% of the printeries, which concluded contracts with the government especially the Ministry of Education, are unable to fulfill their contracts. The remaining printeries, which still implement these contracts, will stop working once their paper and ink stock they got before the exchange rate liberalization run out. The deadline of implementing the contracts is very soon.
Continual care given by President Mubarak to agricultural producers is the reason behind the unprecedented achievements of the agricultural sector, he said.
Giza governorate earmarked 640,000 feddans for sugar beet cultivation in a bid to achieve self-sufficiency and stop importation.
NEW CANAL TO SOLVE GRADUATES' PROBLEMS IN NUBARIYA
EGYPTIAN-AMERICAN TALKS IN WASHINGTON TO EXPEDITE LOANS COLLATERAL AND FREE TRADE ZONE
On the other hand, a small delegation from the American Chamber of Commerce in Cairo headed by Mohamed Mansour will visit the USA on May 18th, to discuss cementing economic, trade and investment relations.
In press statements made yesterday (5th May), the European Union ambassador said that discussions also included the projects that had already been implemented, as well as those projects that would be agreed upon by the end of this year as part of the national programme like the two projects of the regional integration of South Sinai and the renovation of temples.
He added that it was difficult to predict the results The ambassador went on to say that the European commission in Brussels would send a delegation to discuss the new national programme and expected the issues would have been discussed by the end of this year.
In a memo submitted to the European Commissioner of Commerce, Cairo said that the volume and prices of Egyptian exports didn't pose any actual threat to the European steel industry if they were compared with the threats, if any, represented by the other exporting countries as the prices of other exporting countries which are included in the European dumping claim filed against Egyptian exports of steel. Moreover, Egyptian steel export prices exceed the prices of European steel industry.
Under this headline, Salama Ahmed Salama of Al-Ahram wrote a column which ran to the following effect: History books may well say that colonialist looting wars that ended in the Middle of the twentieth century have once again been resuscitated at the hands of the USA helped along by Britain in the twenty first century and incited by Israel.
At this historic decisive moment, the Arab regimes and governments should not just stand bewildered, amazed and arm-folded, marking the time or moving in vicious circles blaming what happened on the American-Zionist right who conspired to trigger such a war outside international legitimacy or blaming it on Saddam Hussein and his corrupt regime which courted its destruction.
On the other hand, the Turkish experiment proves that if the government is based on a democratic majority even if that majority was labeled religious, it would be better able to stand any pressure or stratagems of international domination of the uni-superpower of the world, and to ensure quite a space for maneuvering. The Arab order badly needs reconsidering.
While a high-ranking Israeli delegation was raising objection to the "Peace Plan" in the White House and the US administration spokespersons were declaring that President Bush would bring it into effect without amendment, the US ambassador in Tel Aviv stated that the "roadmap" was no longer fit.
You, journalist, cannot get how close the relations are between Israel and the US as well as President Bush and I." You forget that the "roadmap" stemmed from President Bush's speech delivered on last June 24th, which, in turn, emanated from the ideas I put forward before him at that time as we reached an agreement on the plan, Sharon added.
THE EGYPTIAN WHO ATTACKED AMERICANS IN KUWAIT: WHAT I DID WAS "JIHAD"
Barbari was working for a local company as an electrician in Al-Udira' Camp. He used a pick-up to run over a group of American soldiers who gathered in front of the camp cooperative society. Accordingly, fifteen soldiers were slightly injured and he was seriously injured in his shoulder and chest as he was shot by the soldiers. Barbari was taken to the intensive care of the camp hospital until the critical condition was over.
This, in turn, means that what has been happening in Iraq would, alas, represent a setback for the Arab peoples hopes and ambitions for democracy not the opposite as some expected and others imagined. Therefore, the invasion, metaphorically called war, represents a catastrophe to the region on more than one level despite the positive results on some levels such as the removal of the repressive regime in Baghdad and opening the door for inter-Arab reconciliation that would bury the impacts of the invasion of Kuwait.
The people were divided into groups, tribes and subdivisions, fighting in a country where there had been no differences in religion, race, or sect before. The collapse was total to the extent that neither America nor the UN could restore even the smallest characteristics of the state and its institutions in spite of the desperate attempts. What happens in Iraq heralds a similar danger if it is not quickly handled as the political vacuum left by the collapse of the state created room for kinds of polarization that makes it difficult to restore harmony and state authority.
LOVERS DREAM OF SUICIDE BOMBINGS IN IRAQ, AL HARAM NIGHTCLUBS CLOSE DOORS With the exception of downtown Qasr Nile Bridge, and Fish Park, Zamalek district, most nightclubs and cinema houses witness a state of recession due to the ongoing war on Iraqi villages and cities over the past fortnight.
Wages of belly dancers at hotels and touristic nightclubs decreased by about 70% in light of visitors' refrainment from frequenting such places because they are preoccupied with following the news of war, which has become the main concern of the Egyptians.
Two other students told Al-Quds Al-Arabi that war affected them, as they feel they have grown up over the past two weeks. They attributed their maturity to the sacrifices of mujahideen in Baghdad who sacrifice themselves for their honour and religion. Ihab Tawfiq, one of the two guys, student at the Faculty of Engineering, stated that he frequently dreamt of martyrdom and added that he would be happy if one day his dream came true.
Heba Metwali, a 3rd year student in the Faculty of Commerce, said that her mother was angry from her son because he wanted to travel to Iraq to join fighters defending land and honour and leave his classes.
The minister pointed to Israel's expansionist greed in Africa in order to obtain fresh water as it lacks every potable water source.
KUWAIT, AL AGREE TO STOP DETERIORATION OF THEIR RELATIONS
Yesterday (6th April), scores of Egyptian volunteers for jihad in Iraq demonstrated before the Bar Association headquarters in protest against the Bar Association failure to finish their procedures of traveling to Iraq. They carried anti-US banners and accused the Bar Association of procrastination.
This will be done in coordination with the Iraqi embassy and the costs of travel will be borne by the Bar Association, he said.
SYRIA AND JORDAN START BUILDING AL-WEHDA DAM
MINISTRY OF CULTURE LAUNCHES NEW SATELLITE CHANNEL IN DECEMBER
Eminent TV and mass media figure, Emadeddin Adeeb is one of the most outstanding candidates for chairing the channel. A Ministry of Culture leadership is currently in charge of supervising the implementation of the administrative steps of the preparation of the channel premises and selecting the administrative cadres that will run its financial and administrative affairs.
The channel's surprise will be its bulletins and news programmes. A network of correspondents is being prepared and both male and female announcers are being selected to cover such an important activity especially as the new channel will be headed by Emadeddin Adeeb.
Maher held a meeting with Welch two days ago to discuss on the situation in Iraq and the "Road Map" plan.
EGYPT DENIES EXPORTING MEALS TO COALITION FORCES
On his visit to the Fatwa House, Kasim said, "The visit I paid to the mufti comes within a batch of several meetings Hizbullah conducts to ponder on the latest developments in the region especially the American aggression on Iraq. Hizbullah's ideas and thoughts are identical with the mufti's as far as the region is concerned.
Commenting on the American warnings to Syria and Iran, Hizbullah's deputy noted that America was psychologically and morally pressurizing the two countries because they are very effective that hinder the Zionist project in the region.
The figures were uncovered at a recent symposium on the PNA's 2003 budget organized by a human rights center in Gaza. It was attended by Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) Budget Committee Chairman Saadi al-Karnaz, Salah Abdel-Shafi, an economist, and Ma'in Ragab, dean of the Al-Azhar University Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences.
This shows PNA's disinterest in farming which constitutes a main earner for many Palestinians. Palestinian farming is taking the brunt of the Zionist occupation policy.
CALL TO TEACH CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN EGYPTIAN SCHOOLS
In an urgent quest for notification to Prime Minister, Dr. Atef Ebeid, the deputy rejected the USA Department of State's accusation against Al Azhar of interfering in the political affairs and overstepping its religious competence because it lashed out at the US-British aggression on Iraq.
In a press briefing he held in Damascus on Saturday following his meeting with Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad, Lentos said he would personally suggest imposing sanctions on Syria if it did not meet such demands.
If Syria maintained such (Palestinian) offices in Damascus or continued military backing of Hizbullah we could easily guess what would happen and I would personally try to have a sanction law passed by the Congress against Syria."
YEMENI PRES.: HIGH TREASON IN BAGHDAD
On his part, Saleh enumerated his party's accomplishments including reunion, demarcation of borders with Saudi Arabia and Oman and settlement of Henish crisis with Eritrea.
The decision taken by the Muslim Brotherhood group two days ago to participate in the legislative elections due to be held in the kingdom on June 17th had been strongly urged by domestic and regional factors, especially the Iraqi and Palestinian causes and their political implications on Jordan.
Sources with the group told Al-Hayat that the Islamists had realized that they would better take a positive reaction to the first elections in the reign of King Abdullah the Second to emphasize their course of action advocating reform and abandoning violence and to forestall the attempts of an extensive trend in the state demanding to dissolve the group and follow in the footsteps of the Egyptian experiment in that concern.
Arabiyat also demanded that the judiciary be given the capacity of determining violations on the spot through the presence of judges in the polling stations, and not confining its role to mere supervision. He believed that the Islamic Movement initiative to participate needed similar measures from the government to cement confidence in the political climate in Jordan.
Chairman of the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMS) Ahab Olwi said that among this figure there were 2455 scientists working in medicine, nuclear medicine, radiology, nuclear engineering, astronautics, genetic engineering besides businessmen running sophisticated mega-projects all over the world.
Deputy chairman of the institution, counsellor Ibrahim Bomelha told journalists yesterday that the aim behind the charity campaign was to help the Iraqi people in their distress and provide them, especially children, women and the old, with aid and basic needs.
It has been noticeable so far that big quantities of fresh meals have found no people to eat them near the Jordanian-Iraqi borders. Some of those who are there for whom the meals were not originally prepared get the meals free of charge now so that suppliers may not bear the cost of returning them to Amman.
It seems that foreign reporters know they have nothing to do in eastern Jordan for the Iraqis move in the opposite direction heading to Iraq and the people there are only truck drivers and customs and relief workers and there is no real way to know what happens outside the borderline.
Some local press expressions also entered the circle of fun. Arabs Today local newspaper carried on its front-page yesterday a word of advice to US President George W. Bush saying that he should receive lessons in geography due to his statements in which he said war would last longer because Iraq is a vast and "very rugged" country. The newspaper mentioned that Iraq is a plain and open country rather than mountainous and rugged, which requires that lessons in geography should be given to the ignorant president.
For his part, Dr Ahmed Mahmoud, the researcher at Cairo University and supervisor of the survey, said that excluding Maspero from the competition was not a surprise as there were former indications that confirmed that. At the last months, Maspero's following up of events was very poor.
Palestinian Minister of Local Government, Sai'b Oraikat, said the British Premier Tony Blair told the Palestinian Prime Minister "Abu Mazen" in a phone conversation on Tuesday that both Britain and the USA tend to postpone implementation of the "Road Map" until the war in Iraq is over. However, the Palestinian Authority (PA) hastened to refuse such postponement.
The idea is summarized that everyone would head to the nearest phone and calls a random phone number in Iraq and talk to the one who answers the call for one minute in order to encourage him. An Egyptian would call 00964 then Baghdad code (1) then any random number provided that it would start with 443, 818 or 527. This way he would ensure that he is randomly calling an Iraqi household.
Further, they called for not feeling disappointed if some attempts to call Iraq did not succeed owing to different circumstances and called on them to re-call before telephone lines are disconnected due to war.
Islamonline.net adopted the idea and presented it through dialogue channels in the website under the title "Alexandria University wipes Baghdad's tears". It started to receive the experiments of those who made phone calls with Iraqis to encourage others. The result was also amazing.
How come that he is more confident than me while he is going through such circumstances?
Just, dear brother, hold on and fight under the banner of "No God but Allah".
It is known that the Egyptian communication companies had devised many new methods for using the mobile phone in order to listen to certain songs, chat or listen to some Fatwas.
1- "Starting an intensified electronic Jihad through dealing media blows to the criminal American Administration by sending pictures of the criminal American build-up to the whole world and all American and British e-mail groups and dialogue groups. They also called for collecting the e-mails of as many American people as possible, including individuals, research centers, elites, magazines and websites. It is preferable to concentrate on the e-mail addresses of individuals, which are easy to be obtained.
3- Concentrating on electronic Jihad via a set of websites and develop these proposals by our computer professionals.
He laid it bare that the minister, who attacks those schools for using the method of memorization in lieu of innovation and creation, is mixing between the method of learning natural sciences, which depend on innovation, and the method of studying the Holy Quran, which depends on memorization and dictation. The prophet (PBUH) had received the Holy Quran from the Angel Gabriel and recited it to his companions, who in turn handed it over to their descendants until today."
This idea is not applicable for Iraq or its people because it was not defeated in World War II like Japan and because circumstances were totally different in both cases.
In a symposium at the Faculty of Economics and Political Science, Al-Fiqui rejected any criticism to be directed to the Iraqi regime now. He said that this would be "immoral" and would be considered in support of the aggression.
He set conditions for Israel to join that fresh regional system including reaching a just and comprehensive settlement for the Arab-Israeli conflict and subjecting all its nuclear establishments to international supervision and control.
He added that the present American Administration aimed at "crushing Muslims and seizing their fortunes and lands."
He added that Muslim Brotherhood expressed concern over the fate which has befallen everybody but regrettably no response was give by the governments to such sincere counseling. Instead they declared war on Muslim Brotherhood.
According to the reports received by the ruling party general secretariat, headed by Minister of Information, Safwat Al Sherif, the fact that the old cadres succeeded in retaining their positions points out their effectiveness with the masses.
Lots of the Israelis attacked the Egyptian pop singer, Shaaban Abdel-Rahim due to his new song "hitting Iraq". In his song he calls on the UN and the international community to necessarily look to Israel that possesses weapons of mass destruction, emphasizing that Iraq is void of such weapons.
In his article, the Israeli writer stressed the "naivety" of the Egyptian singer who, according to him, finds no difference between Sharon and Barak in his song "I hate Israel" of which he sold 15 million copies until now. however, he then described him as intelligent in dealing with some phrases that "tackles the fancy of the tense Arab street" when he described Bush as the leader of the Axis of Evil and Sharon as sitting in a Jacuzzi with Arabs blood dripping around him like rain.
Nobody knows for certain whether the Son of the Nile has traveled to Iraq as a volunteer to defend its land a few months ago or is a resident who had been there before the crisis began. That was why the American forces administration in As-Saliyah had made contacts with a view to enquiring about his identity as well as the names of Egyptian, Sudanese and Jordanian nationals enlisted in his brigade.
* Protecting the Russian interests in post-war Iraq, especially as President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov have articulately explained more than once that Russia has important interests in Iraq now and in the future.
However, Primakov explicitly told Saddam about this matter, even though it was not an easy one despite the friendly relations between Primakov and Saddam since the Soviet era when Primakov was former Soviet Union president Mikhail Gorbachev's envoy to Saddam Hussein to convince him of the military withdrawal from Kuwait and saving the Iraqi people, but the U.S.-led war machine imposed the withdrawal and sanctions for over ten years on Iraq.
Former chief of the national economic security body in the first main administration of the Russian intelligence spoke about the American aggression on Iraq. He said that what is going on now is not meant to promote democracy nor to make life go smoothly regardless of the U.S. efforts to promote such allegations. They speak about changing the regime in Baghdad. After such change, Iraq will be, then, ruled by a puppet government. Undoubtedly, it would be incapable of controlling the country without Western protection just as the case in Afghanistan.
Although the U.S. assault on Afghanistan was meant to eliminate Taliban, the real goal was its neighboring country - China. The Western military forces in Afghanistan seemed to have determined the borders on which China could extend its influence.
SAUDI BUSINESSMEN: READY TO COMPETE FOR RECONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS IN IRAQ
He added that British and US companies should not be let alone in that field, pointing out that Saudi businessmen should take well-studied and planned moves to win some of these contracts to "reconstruct a neighbour Arab country whose people would welcome us more than anybody else."
However, he said, US companies might depend on some Saudi businesses to provide their needs because of joint relations.
Al Azhar and Islamic Research Academy scholars' stance on that war goes in parallel with the Christian position declared by both Pope John Paul II and Pope Shenouda III, Tantawi said. Both stances are opposed to war and are calling for peace, tolerance and reconciliation, he added.
Jihad includes self-sacrifice, money-sacrifice and anything anybody can do to help what is right, Tantawi said in the conference.
When asked about the Palestinian cause, Tantawi said that the Palestinians should continue defending their rights by all available means and the UN should help them through subjecting Israel to its resolutions and forcing it to comply with them, otherwise, he went on, it could lose its powers as an international organization that has binding resolutions.
In exclusives to Al-Alam Al-Youm, Barakat said that Misr Banque raised its authorized capital to LE5 billion from LE1.5 billion and issued and paid-up capital from LE1 billion to LE1.8 billion.
Yesterday(13th April), the General Authority for Supply Commodities had concluded a loan agreement at a value of $25 million with Islamic Bank for Development (IBD) and it would also hammer out another loan agreement at the same value in the coming few days, said deputy chairman of the Authority Mahmoud Abdel-Hamid to Reuter's Agency.
Egypt topped the list of buyers of American wheat during the last five seasons but it descended to the 6th rank in 2002-2003 after it chose cheap imports from France and Eastern Europe. This step came as a result of the high increase in American prices which achieved its highest level in five years last September due to drought.
EGYPTIAN-TURKISH TRADE EXCHANGE UP TO ONE BILLION DOLLAR
It is a mistake to say that the production of the two countries are similar, the minister said, pointing out that Turkey, for instance, needs many commodities from Egypt including cotton of which Egypt produces many excellent kinds.
EgyptAir Holding Company decided to convert the purchase of 5 320-Airbuses to the financial lease system instead of direct loans.
He added that the period from January to March 2003 witnessed a rise of 12.3% compared to the same period last year as the number of tourists hit 1,184,000.
CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES TO BE GIVEN ACCESS TO FREE ZONES
GHALI: LEAP IN EGYPTIAN STEEL EXPORTS
He added that the fact that steel sheets factories in Suez started operation would increase such exports to one million tons annually as of this year. He went on saying that such factories were essential components in export development strategy to take exports of building and construction materials from $361 million in 2001 to about $1 billion in 2006, with steel exports claiming 25% annually.
According to the Egyptian government, 90000 hectares of agricultural land would benefit by that grant as wheat production is expected to rise in those lands by 15% from 570000 tons to 650000 tons.
He called on Egyptian companies to study the need of the Russian party to import several commodities like medicines, serums, vaccines and cosmetics. Russian businessmen should try to make use of Egypt's membership of the COMESA which have 300 million souls.
"Egypt seeks to make up for the retreat in exports to the Iraqi market following the collapse of the government," said an officer in foreign trade sector, confirming that African markets were the best to accommodate Egyptian commodities on condition that exporters comply with the specifications required by such markets.
Egypt and Russia have resumed bilateral talks on a 5-year deal that provides for giving Egypt one million tons of wheat on a yearly basis, said a spokeswoman for the Russian Ministry of Commerce.
The Egyptian-Dutch Consultant Council is currently holding a meeting in Aswan under the chairmanship of Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Dr. Mahmoud Abu Zaid.
Holland will also probe a project for developing the navigational course of the river Nile in cooperation with the ministries of transport and water resources. The cost of that project will be 600 million dollars, 40% of which will be financed by the Dutch side.
He explained that such a strategy relies on giant national projects in Toshka, South Valley, Sinai and West Nubariya in order to meet the needs of food and strategic stock on the national level.
Soon, he added, the first electronic system would be put in force in order to show on the spot the foreign currency selling and purchasing operations in banks and exchange firms on the CBE screens.
The debate, which started during the committee's discussion of the new banking law, triggered a heated argument.
"This was an unnecessary measure that denied access to this job to competent bankers and financiers who may be more worthy of this position," he pointed out.
The latter were just civil servants who could be fired or retired or replaced and were like any other occupants of senior positions in the civil service, they said, while membership of the People's Assembly required loyalty to only one origin and one fatherland for representation of an Egyptian constituency, so as to avoid suspicions of divided loyalty, particularly as the Assembly was discussing certain topics related to Egypt's relationship with the country whose nationality was borne by the deputy or deputies in question.
CUSTOMS DOLLAR UP TO 575 PIASTERS
The final formula of the trade agreement between Egypt and Russia was approved yesterday. This agreement will last five years as per which 1.5 million tons of Russian wheat per year will be exchanged annually for Egyptian commodities such as vaccines, rice, fruit, onion and garlic. It is worth mentioning that these products represent 50% of the deal value.

THE PICTURE IS DIM, HOPE STILL THERE
In fact, I felt pity for Premier Atef Ebeid and Finance Minister Medhat Hassanein while they were talking about the economic conditions in Egypt during their meeting with chairpersons and chief-editors of press institutions to solve the issues related to publication of books and opening documentary credits for purchasing paper.

He pointed out that his country's move was motivated by its desire to ward off any economic harm done to Egypt as a friendly country which has strong relations with Greece.
High-ranking sources ruled out the possibility that the Egyptian relevant bodies would resort to liquidate some banking entities, which face problems in their financial positions.

On last March 8th, arguments were in full swing regarding the free trade zone with the USA after the discussions of a free trade zone with Egypt had been ruled out by the American commercial representative Robert Zoellick.
It seems, nevertheless, that the official attitude towards the war against Iraq was the main reason behind the launching of the initiative in light of the absence of effective Arab rejection and confrontation against America.

Under this headline, Dawoud Al Shyrian of Al-Hayat wrote a column, which runs to the following effect: Has Baghdad surrendered or has it been surrendered?
Such a rapid collapse of Iraq requires a response that pays no heed to submission or acceptance of the status quo or justification of occupation under the slogan of liberation from despotism. Nor should we deal with the issue with arrogance, intransigence, ignoring facts or the lust for revenge.
The unfinished U.S. onslaught on Iraq could extend to bring pressure to bear on neighbouring countries and safeguard Israel, said Mostafa al-Fiqi, head of the Egyptian parliamentary Committee of Foreign Affairs. He kept his fingers crossed that what has happened would be a shock that gives Arab mentality pause for thought. The regional situation will not be stable unless there is an Arab legitimacy for post-war stage in Iraq. This legitimacy can not be brought without Egypt. The remarks were made by the senior lawmaker in an interview with Al-Hayat daily.
Pressure does not mean a military action, but may include calls on the two countries to carry out reforms to be determined by the U.S. However, I believe that Lebanon's Hezbollah will be the next target. I predict that emboldened by the U.S. presence in the region, Israel will attack its adversary Hezbollah which, along with Hamas and Jihad, it wants to destroy. Hezbollah is its main target.
Israel lies behind the U.S. orientation towards the two countries. I see that Israel plays a central role in the war on Iraq. But, no one can bring it to book.
Q: What is the solution?
Many Arab countries have double-faced political characters.
We should deliberate on the region's future.
Fiqi: First and foremost, a domestic reform should be carried out, coinciding with an all-out regional role. State security trials should be scrapped.
Democratic systems have to be established in the region.
If Egypt wants to play a key role in the region, it should seek a common ground with America.
Fiqi: The die is cast.
Fiqi: There is no ambivalence.
Fiqi: Free movement is limited and leverages have not been useful any longer. For the Americans, the UN now means nothing to the extent that they do not pay their UN dues.
General Garner said he would head for Baghdad shortly. His first task will be to get acquainted with the local leaders, start the rehabilitation process and introduce an all-over drive to extend aid to Iraq, which he said it would return to be the "gem" of the Middle East.
The Israeli government hopes to achieve its water goals in Iraq after it has failed, so far, to obtain the Nile water.
Water Resources and Irrigation Ministry reports say that Egypt's per capita income of water has gone down to 900 cubic metres a year, which represents a critical stage.
So far it has refused to sign water agreements with Egypt contenting itself with being an observer in the Andego and TechnoNil.
It is a grave matter as it is related to the Egyptian's life. The current international circumstances are favourable to the implementation of Israel's ambition. Will the government just pause for a little and consider the wishes of the World Bank regarding water or will it just carry on with the deed and, for a few dollars, abide by all instructions just as it did with the rate of exchange issue. We should also say that the coming war between Egypt and Israel will be one caused by water.

Saudi government's keenness on mosques affairs is not new. It assumes the responsibility of building them and providing them with all services. During the last two decades more than $17 billion were spent on the expansion and renovation of the two holy shrines. Besides, such keenness extended to mosques all over the world.
A drive must be laid down with the aim of putting an end to the overlap between political and cultural discourse and religious one, determining the location and role of religious discourse in the social movement and creating a state of equilibrium in mass communication discourse in general. This case must be dealt with in a way that allows pluralism without exaggeration and allows the society to express itself in a way that fears no confiscation or exclusion.
Beshara ruled out that Washington might launch a war against Syria because the position in Syria, according to him, is different from the position in Iraq. The US can not launch any military operations against Syria before the coming US presidential elections.

As regards the homosexuals' case, which was included in the European decision, Sorour said, "The Egyptian Penal Code does not criminalize the special sexual relations between adults by mutual consent. The Egyptian law does not interfere in the private life of individuals by any means. The public practices that were connected with deriding religions and encouraging licence rather than the perversion acts were behind the criminalization in this case. So, we should respect the people's right to freely choose their legal system and protect their religious and cultural values."
According to the legal change, carried by Jordanian local press on Friday, the "attorney-general shall stop chasing a criminal involved in an embezzlement case if he returns the whole or even part of the misappropriated funds to the original owner. Such a decision should be okayed by a judicial panel.
CHANTS OF THE VOICELESS IN W.C.''S
Using a marker, a student wrote: " if Bush and Blair belonged to the species of "Ulouj" (infidels) the Arab rulers belonged to the species of "Taratir"(the inept)" in reference to Arab rulers' positions during Iraq's crisis quoting Al-Sahaf's words.
He them reiterated his conviction in Saddam "O people believe me Saddam is not a traitor.. he's just been sold down the river".
Another retorts "How come?
"O God Almighty degrade America and bestow victory on Saddam." The word God was crossed by another student who wrote, "Such divine word must not be written in the bathroom, silly blockhead!"
In the faculty of Agriculture another student wrote "the Americans and the British belonged to the species of Oloug with a "J" letter (infidels), our rulers would belong to the species of Olouq (with a "q" letter (sissies) as we have just failed to answer back."
Another student replies " Od boy, Baghdad fell because Verginia went to bed with Acre's viceroy once again," in reference to the incidents for Al-Nasser Saladdine movie.
Another female student wrote " Brilliant Widad. You are worth one hundred men," in reference to martyrdom operation carried out by an Iraqi woman who drove a booby-trapped car and stormed an American check point, causing over 5 deaths and injuries among the American Marines.
The quadruple committee A source closely connected with the Iranian decision-making circles told Al-Majalla that the strong tone of the supreme leader towards the US and his Arabic address to the Iraqi people come within the framework of the Islamic Republic's categorical refusal of America exclusively drawing the political future of Iraq. This is also meant to emphasize that Iran can influence the course of events after the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime.
The important question here is: will the US be able to exclusively draw the future of Iraq and distance regional parties particularly Iran?
Rather, the discussions now underway in the American media and political forums on the future of Iraq will urge that our reasonable and also constructive role should be enhanced.
TV broadcast Moreover, Iran set up a ground TV broadcast station intended for Iraqi population called (Righteousness TV) and the Iraqi Supreme Council of Islamic Revolution was entrusted with its management.
Shiite visions Tehran's bet is that its efforts will result in rendering the supreme council a principal and pivotal power in the political Iraqi life during the post-Saddam era.
Conflicts The trend of martyr al-Sadr is marked by its emphasis on the Arab privacy of the Shiite situation in Iraq and its rejection at the same time of any form of foreign influence whether it was western or Iranian. This trend extends into the Iraqi Sunni milieu unlike the other Shiite movements and trends.
It is too early to predict how the political features of the post-Saddam stage and the level of the international and regional influence on that score would be. However, it is certain that any external party would not ignore the fact of the multiplicity of the political, doctrinal, and traditional mosaic of the Iraqi people. Nor would it be able to exclusively draw the political future of this country.
"Our cooperation with the Iraqi people doesn't go beyond the media and popular support as we have no material potential to contribute. We also have duties to do in Palestine", he said. We hope that the Iraqi people may follow the suit of the Palestinian resistance and escalate their resistance to the American occupation, added Rantissi.

The voices calling for dissolving the Arab League, reformulating its charter and activating its role in order that it may fit in with the political developments and changes which are being witnessed by the Arab region are far from now. Besides, the performance of the AL is being exposed to criticism by its own officials especially the Secretary General himself.
He had reached that position well equipped by his rare political experience and political assets he had acquired from his previous position.
The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) issued a report about torture in Egyptian prisons and described it as a daily crime committed against prisoners, which should be stopped.
It demands the article 282 of the penal code be amended as it failed to discriminate between torture practiced by an individual or that exercised by the state, and article 129 of the penal code regarding using cruelty as the set penalty was too light to suit the wrong done.
In response to a question by Asharq Al-Awast about the U.S. threats to Hizbullah, head of Al-Wafaa resistance bloc (Hizbullah deputies in the Lebanese parliament) Mohamed Ra'd said Hizbullah did not intend to send any of its elements to Iraq.
There are Egyptian-Arab high-ranking political moves at present to abort any Israeli attempt to exploit the occupation of Iraq without ending the state of war with Arab countries, he noted. There is Arab consensus to exclude any joint ventures that will do harm to Arab projects such as Suez Canal and SUMED pipeline. Such a project primarily aims to put Israel among the region's economies without withdrawing from all Arab occupied territories, he pointed out.
Egyptian Mufti (religious opinion authority) Dr. Ahmed Al-Tayeb emphasized that since the mid-forties Western colonization has been seeking to partition the Islamic world countries from Pakistan in the East to Morocco in the West as such a step was thought by colonialists to be only guarantee of Israel's security.
He pointed out that Iraq would not be the last step in the Western scheme.
Those U.S. lawmakers had repeatedly failed to have such a bill okayed.
Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Sharaa said Syria had always longed to hold a dialogue with the U.S.
The U.S. official labeled the Lebanese resistance group as a key terrorist group.
Arabs and Muslims will become increasingly antagonistic to the U.S. due to its policies in the Middle East region.
However, it seemed obvious that all those groups and organizations have no influence or even presence in the street inside the capital.

President Arafat does his best to abort Abu Mazen's trial to form a government and Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon, who kills and ravages on a daily basis, helps him for personal reasons.
Israel stated that it wanted Mohamed Dahlan to be in charge of the security portfolio, thus driving Palestinians to think of the man as a collaborator. Dahlan has earlier announced, after Arafat objected to his assuming the post, that he would not stand as a stumbling block in the way of the new government.
Abu Mazen's duty is to side with his people's interest against the enemy's.
AL-FIQI: WASHINGTON LEAKS INFORMATION TO CAUSE BEDLAM

"RABAT HALL" FROM CLASSICAL MUSIC TO SAIRI'S HQ
Ten pictures of Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) leader Masud Barzani were hung on the pillars of the building that overlooks Al-Azamiya district in Baghdad.
Iraqis receive such parties in astonishment while some citizens head for some headquarters to propose new ideas of political, economic and media activities within the framework of reconstruction.
The outcome was that future wars would not depend heavily on armored corps.
Another conclusive reason was cited for this cut, which is ridding of Iraq as an Arab rival force from the Arab-Israeli conflict.
The privatization plan would include a number of army factories, opening competition for supplying logistics and other services such as tasking private companies with flying army generals with their helicopters instead of that of the army, thus laying off a lot of personnel.
GOING OUT OF TOMB
Didn't Plato write in his Republic "The Cave Myth" about what may happen to a human being if he suddenly moved from darkness to light and from the shackles to freedom?!

It said that the European Commission would have to closely monitor "any other developments in such cases!"
One axis of such a strategy relies on striking the Saudi regime, expelling the Saudi royal family from Mecca and Medina, striking Syria, isolating Egypt from the Arab World, setting up a Turkish-Hashemite-Israeli pact and besieging Iran.
According to the report, the Arabian Peninsula needs not to be Saudi or Wahabite.
Pursuing and trying anybody related to any terrorist groups including state bodies personnel such as the Intelligence Department.

Under this headline, Saudi professor of sociopolitics at King Abd Al-Aziz University, Saudi Arabia, Khalid Al-Dekhil wrote a lengthy article, excerpts of which run to the following effect: The political situation in Iraq now under occupation is open to all probabilities concerning the possible shape of rule.
The difference lies in the formula that such cooperation should reach.
Religious leaders seem to be the only ones that have typical indicators of how the coming rule in Iraq should be.
The U.S., however, was the only party that ousted the former regime by the force of arms.
Despite the American domination of the Iraqi scene, the situation in Iraq on the heels of the collapse of the political regime provides unprecedented opportunity.
The U.S. is a superpower: this is true.
This can, nevertheless, be supported, especially after the downfall of the Iraqi regime, by the Iraq openness to the idea of state secularization, which can be legitimate. In the past, such legitimacy was confined to the intellectual contexts of some political parties such as the Baath Party.
The two pillars almost agreed by the Iraqis nowadays are: a federal state and a separation between religion and politics.
Yet, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, a Shiite leader in Najaf, made an admonition that religious events should not be capitalized on to obtain political goals, pointing a call by the Supreme Assembly for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SAIRI) in Iraq on the Shiite community last week to flock to Kerbala to mark a Shiite event to show off its political sway and influence on Shiites.
For his part, Sheikh Ahmed al-Kobaisi, a Sunni leader, adopted a similar position by telling Al-Hayat daily that his group did not favour an Islamic system in Iraq, emphasizing that "an Islamic state is unfavourable for the time being.
In case this assumption proved to be right, it reflects the boldness of those sheiks in taking the wheel instead of succumbing to "grassroots' rule"; a wide-spread phenomenon among many leaders of "political Islam".
It is not clear whether there was coordination between different sects in Iraq about their declared stances regarding the rule in Iraq.
Religious convictions are generally speaking exclusive and private whether on the individual or sectarian levels and that is why they are characterized by introversion and exclusion of other religious and sectarian affiliations.
All Iraqis want national unity as a safety valve.
AGREEMENT FOR TRADE COOPERATION BETWEEN EGYPT, GULF STATES
Some other topics related to cooperation in the cultural, judicial, consular and administrative fields would also be dealt with.
Al-Ahrar got a report prepared by the Ministry of Finance including a plan for the development of economic organisations in the new fiscal year, which will start on 1st July next.
The report disclosed that most organisations affiliated to the State organisational structure, which are 59 in number, suffer sharp imbalances in their financial structures despite their economic nature.
The report underlined that the sharp imbalance in the budgets of public economic institutions requires the reformation of conditions and improvement of their operation economics with a view to achieving a suitable return for the Public Treasury that suits the investments spent by the State on them over the past years. The total cost of these investments amounted to 338.4 billion pounds including 6.1 billion pounds invested in the Suez Canal Authority and 37.1 billion pounds in the General Petroleum Corporation as well as 295.3 billion pounds invested in the other organisations.
However, Egypt is still ranking seventh for four months on end, as the GDP growth rate stopped at 3.1%. It was preceded by Turkey, China, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brazil which achieved GDP growth rates accounting for 11.4%, 8.1%, 6.1%, 5.6%, 3.8% and 3.4% respectively.
On the level of the balance of trade and external commodity dealings, the report registered a rise in the commodity exports only from 1.53 billion pounds in January 2002 to 2.63 billion pounds during the same period this year. However, imports went down from 5.08 billion pounds to 4.70 billion pounds. The volume of the balance of trade deficit nosedived from 3.55 billion pounds to 2.07 billion pounds during the same period.

Under this headline, Zuhair Qusaibati of Al-Hayat wrote an article running to the following effect: When the security of Israel becomes "the key to the world security" we can imagine to what extent could George Bush administration pressurize all of (Israel's) neighbours, forefront of which is Syria, with a view to securing what the Hebrew state needs in such an era of Arab history. The American-Israeli collaboration is unrepeatable.
Prior to Powell's visit to Syria, Damascus was informed of the American and Israeli demands, which it realizes as a reality even if it refuses such "dictations" which came in an intimidating formula through calling for dialogue.
This cannot be explained in U.S. domino game after the war on Iraq except through robbing all the regional roles of Damascus or even assigning Syria a role in implementing the game from Iraq to Lebanon and Palestine.
The question is: Are there any options before Damascus?
Nor should it be astonished when Powel deviates the etiquette of diplomacy in Damascus when he reminded it that the Iraqi oil pipeline was a bad experiment according to the American rules of conduct.
This is a mere start.
They also made it clear that head of the gathering Mohamed Othman Al-Mirghani felt "upset" due to the way he was treated during the visit of Sudan's People's Liberation Army (SPLA) leader John Garang to Cairo.

Mandour is one of the most prominent Islamic lawyers in Egypt and lawyer of Jama'a Islamiya leader Dr Omar Abdel-Rahman and Abboud Al-Zomor, former leader of Jihad organization. "The lawsuit against the Interior Ministry is due to the cancellation of religion blank in the issued personal documents which is an obliteration of Islamic identity and serves the Zionist and American interests against Muslims", Mandour said, adding "The situation complies with Kissinger's theory of emptying man of his content as a prelude to penetrating his identity".
Member of the political leadership of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) Abdel Aziz Al-Rantissi said his movement would not cause the Syrian government embarrassment in case it closed down Hamas' office in Damascus.
Powell's pressure on Syria at a time coordination is in full swing between Israel and Western intelligence services on the heels of the latest Tel Aviv operation only reflects apprehension of both America and Israel about a comprehensive Islamic rise not only in Palestine but also in the whole region, said Rantissi.
This means that the losers had once really betted on the victory and sustenance of the Iraqi regime to continue its bloody old methods.
It is the lesson of defeat for some and the lesson of victory for some others.
Did "religious fundamentalism", in the form of its various aspects up to Al Qaeda organization, manage to give an alternative to 'nationalism' or its like?
We have heard and seen the opinions and proposals of some "winners", even though some of them had advocated, until recently, an all-out support for the political trends they are now demanding to be demolished.
If the American victory still dreams about a breakthrough in peace just as it succeeded in war, it has so far constituted a victory for the American Administration's Likudists whose interest in the forthcoming stage missions is shaped only by how far such missions would succeed in achieving their goals, which are at variance with the goals of the Arab "winners" whether Iraqis or non-Iraqis!
SAUDI ARABIA DENIES ANY AGREEMENT ON AMERICAN MILITARY BASES
Saudi sources denied any Saudi role in the imposition of forces or trends in the next Iraqi government structure as that was an entirely Iraqi affair.
First: Critical circles of the Egyptian role claim that it was an "instigative role" that neither succumbed to pressure nor followed the required trend that always echo that terrorism could be an international phenomenon involving Muslim peoples, but the mind that lay behind it was an Egyptian one in view of the source, approach and culture.
It is Egypt which should lead the political and constitutional reform movement in the region, initiate a modern culture and put forward a wonderful model that can be followed by others.
Which would you prefer us or those bloody putschists and leftist extremists in revolutionary regimes who would do away with you?!"
This came after the revolutionary Nasserite threat to them ebbed away and the emergence of both official and popular Arab climate characterized by "realism" and tolerance towards the idea of gradual reform and more appreciative of the methodology of evolution than the concept of revolution after what repelling putschist experiments had been witnessed, thus clinging more to their evolutionary regimes in the hope that such "evolutionism" might prove to be genuine!
This is the inevitable historic rule which can never be manipulated or evaded!
Shiites have joined other Iraqi bodies in coordinating with Cairo with regard to the forthcoming stage. The meeting held between the Supreme Assembly for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SAIRI) and Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher on April 5th adds to the Egyptian efforts seeking to formulate the future of Iraq.

Osama's remarks were made in a massive conference during the Shiite delegation's visit to Egypt.

The easiness of the American war on Iraq and the access of the Marines into Baghdad with the least amount of human and material losses scared most Arab capitals whether allies or would-be allies, as there are "no enemies to Washington among the regimes." The Arab regimes, the overwhelming majority of which are illegitimate and un-elected, are doing their best to do as many concessions as they can to avoid the American wrath and keep safe and survive.
What issues will Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Al-Sharaa put up in the coming Arab summits? What denouncing or refusing statements will he make in his press conferences he usually makes following any Arab foreign ministers' meeting if any "Arab" and foreign ministers were to meet?
Unlike the Iraqi regime, Syria was not in a conflict with the United States. Rather, it was an ally with it in all its recent wars. In the first Gulf War, Syria sent forces to the Arab Peninsula, supported in expelling the Iraqi forces from Kuwait by force of arms and formed the Damascus Declaration countries.
"IRAQ LIBERATION FRONT", AN UMBRELLA FOR MILITARY ORGANIZATION SUPERVISED BY QUSAI
Those groups started their activity on 28th last month on the occasion of his birthday. They are making contacts with former security elements within the framework of monitoring and preparing for striking forthcoming targets. They act under the name of "Iraq's Liberation Front" which have been thought as one of the scores of opposition organizations that were spawned uncontrollably all over Iraq in the last few weeks but turned out later on to be a paramilitary organization, which had a special ideological programme.
The common quality of all of them was that they all, should have a fierce nature and very high physical fitness, according to the reports of some people who closely followed up the formation of such a secret organization whose supervising officers simply used the "Republican Palace" in Baghdad as a center and used an office known as the Arab Cultural Office which had no sign or notice at the portico indicating its identity.
According to sources, the organization is currently collecting information and monitoring targets inside Baghdad and all over Iraq. It makes use of its complete knowledge of the files of all security elements to ask them to collect information about public utilities and the dates of American and British forces movements, routes as well as other targets to be monitored.
This information synchronizes with American reports to the effect that some resistance are being launched by former regime's elements who are trying to retain their leadership positions, and impede any possible refurbishments to obstruct the work of the new administration and the American efforts at all levels.
The sources said that they did not know the number of those comprised by that "front" as, according to them, the three thousands account only for those selected in 1998, to the exclusion of any other additional numbers that might have been recruited after that.

There're also syndicates and professional and civil organizations, which are supposed to let people express their opinions.
I cite here, for instance, two incidents from two messages sent to me by two university professors:
I still remember when I was at my early youth over 40 years ago when I used to travel from my village, Belkas, to Cairo particularly to sit in the front seats at Abdin Square to listen to late president Gamal Abdel-Nasser's annual speech on July 23rd, a thing that formed my patriotic and nationalist feeling.
Since late the 1960s, travelling to attend such conferences have become conditional on an approval by the university president. This system lasted for a while until the university staff were surprised by a letter from the university asking them to send the required documents to attend conferences a long time ahead of traveling, as after the approval of the university president there should be an approval by the security office, which takes a full month.
The two examples need no further comment!

JICA CHIEF TO VISIT EGYPT
JICA contributes primarily in the economic and social development projects in Egypt, in addition to its contribution to major projects such as the Opera House, Infant Hospital and Mubarak Peace suspension bridge over the Suez Canal, he said. Besides, there are many other developmental projects that are now discussed by its experts at present.

The study inventoried the basic requirements of Egyptian commodities and products that might be approved by the Japanese consumer. It also evaluated the nature of the Japanese market as well as the consumers' taste there. The study indicated a clear-cut decline in the trade balance between the two countries hitting 498.1 million dollars in 2001.
The study called for abiding by some important rules for penetrating the Japanese market, which represent a prominent hindrance of exportation to this market. Foremost of these rules are the system of internal distribution in Japan, which doesn't allow importation except via Japanese companies so that these companies would be utterly responsible for distribution to wholesale companies and then retail companies until the goods reach the consumer, in addition to customs aid and importation laws imposed by the Japanese government such as the regulations imposed on importation of rice and agricultural products.
Egypt monopolizes certain food commodities on the Japanese market. For example, an Egyptian business monopolizes a large quota of the jam market in Japan, he said.
The economic axis is more important than other axes. Japan established Mubarak Peace Bridge over the Suez Canal, the longest bridge in the world which has a length of 9.5 kilometers and a height of 75 meters. It is regarded a symbol of the relation between the peoples of Asia and Africa, he added.
In a sitting presided over by Japan's former prime minister Hashimutu, Rozkana called for supporting water laws, urging Japanese parliamentarians to help develop Egypt's research potential and skill acquisition.
Q. What is your comment on the formation of the Palestinian government, headed by Mahmoud Abbas Abu Mazin?
Everybody says that there is one authority and that such an authority must protect its people from aggression and bring about security to them. But, if it tries to provide security to the occupying Israeli enemy, this means that it is not a single authority but an authority serving the Israeli enemy and the American interests. The Palestinian people also need their security, land and future. Therefore, we need one authority and one law to defend the people, homeland and the future of the Palestinian dispersed people.
A. As for us, we aren't ready to enter into inter-Palestinian fighting. Our arms, God willing, will remain pointed at the Israeli enemy. They will not be pointed at our people. And if the Authority men are concerned with implementing this matter, they will be responsible for this. It is unacceptable for us to enter into an inter-Palestinian bloody conflict.
A. Two matters should be mentioned in this respect: we fight in order to liberate our land and country so long as the Palestinian land and people are occupied, restricted and besieged. How could we, then, stop the Intifada?
We've been waiting for Oslo agreements for 10 years to solve our problem. Ten years ago, we started with Gaza and Jericho at first. Then, we waited for the establishment of the Palestinian state but to no avail. The U.S. was guaranteeing all such agreements, which were even signed in America, but nothing has been implemented so far. Only what Israel wants can be carried out.
Such initiatives died. What they speak about today is the realization of the security of the Zionist entity in Palestine.
HIZBULLAH AND THE POTENTIALITIES OF FRIENDS TREACHERY!
Nor was the Syrian government unaware of the American administration's demand to close those offices and it therefore lost no time in closing them down even before Colin Powell had turned up in Damascus!
The second option is to get rid of the Palestinian organizations which have offices in Syria, an option which has been clearly favoured by Syria!
Hassan Nasrallah, then, said, "Hizbullah is a political movement which is steadily growing inside the Lebanese society and has presence in the political street.
Hassan Nasrallah, then, laughed.
He, meanwhile, realized that he is dealing with a reality whose calculations, givens and vicissitudes vary on the momentary bases.
The question, as we see it, is based on mere speculation.
Following his visit to Syria, the American Secretary of State Colin Powell announced that the American Administration was waiting for actions not words or rather the Syrian government would have to prove by actions rather than words that it did not sponsor terrorism, of course from the American and the Israeli point of view.
The second is that the resistance would continue side by side with the political project, which would mean a conflict with the USA.
Yesterday, the details of the new American scheme to force the Arabs to fully normalize relations with Israel unraveled.

Coordinator of the Democracy Defending Committee Hussein Abdel-Razik told Al-Hayat that the party leaders who signed the call hoped for achieving political stability that might change Egypt into a parliamentary republic based on true multi-party system in which the people would be the source of estates and the rule would be rotated according to fair elections.
In a parallel event, some leading figures from the ruling National Democratic Party announced that actions would be taken shortly to develop the internal positions, such as establishing a national council for human rights and abrogating State Supreme Security Courtsd.

Exports of most Arab countries to the U.S. sharply declined, while the imports of some of them slightly retreated in the first month of 2003 due to some factors related to the September 11th incidents, such as the decline of oil prices and the rise in the cost of transportation and insurance. The only exception is represented in the exports of Iraq and Jordan, which have been doubled in the reporting period, the statistics added.

Under this headline, chief editor of Al-Akhbar, Galal Deweidar writes an article some excerpts of which run to the following effect: It is not enough that the USA should offer a project to settle the bloody conflict in the Middle East as the crux of the matter is that it should be serious in facing its pampered child Israel to give expansionist and militarism policies and become, therefore, ready to accept the requirements of the settlement of a just and comprehensive peace.
Its bias to and conspiring against the Arabs and their rights in favour of Zionism and Israel raise doubts regarding any arguments on its part for giving momentum to the peace efforts.
I wish the visit started by USA State Secretary, Colin Powell two days ago to the Arab-Israeli conflict region would not be just like its preceding visits which all ended in further American encouragement of the Israeli aggression and describing the terrorism which this rogue state commits as self defence and, furthermore dubbing killer Sharon as a man of peace!

The depth of the so-called Israel, if another state is established in the West Bank, will be 14km only, a thing that will be unacceptable by the Israelis.
Rather, they want an armed state that can defend and arm itself at the same level of armament of the neighbouring countries.
The radical historical solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict lies in establishing one state for the Palestinians and Israelis under the name "Isratine," he said. The success of this idea is conditional on the return of Palestinian refugees and deportees wherever they are if they wish so.

TOWARDS DEMOCRATIC IRAQI SYSTEM PROTECTED BY NEW MILITARY
The United States was surprised by the formidability and organizational capabilities of the Shiites of Iraq.
In order not to allow this apprehension, whose parallels exist in several Arab countries, to cause more wrongs to the Iraqi people, it may be useful to look into the possibility of building a viable democratic political system that could not be used to bring about the menace of a fundamentalist government.
As this is a problem whose scope is much wider than Iraq, perhaps finding a solution to it in that country now would help reinforce democratization in other countries if its elements are there.
However, two things would be required for this notion to see the light. First, the new constitution should be formulated in such a way as to turn the military establishment an observer that would protect this constitution and see to its proper application. Under such a constitution, the military would act as an arbitrator between political parties and forces should there be any dispute.
Because the general concept and some of the aspects of this solution are derived from the Turkish experiment, it is necessary to avoid the shortcomings of that very experiment, the most significant of which are the predominance of the military and the generals' crossing of the borders that separate the military and civilian domains.
This applies to all the principles of the political system that will be described by the new Iraqi constitution.
Second, The Turkish military was involved in three coups in 1960, 1971 and 1980, although its record looks relatively cleaner than that of its Iraqi counterpart.
Even if extremist Shiite forces do win the elections and form a government, they will have to uphold the existing constitution and hold the next elections on time, because if they try any tricks, the military will step in to depose them and install a provisional government to hold the elections.
If this experiment succeeds, it will put an end to fears in other countries that such forces may exploit the atmosphere of freedom to assume power, only to monopolize it and abort the democratic system.

The Japanese market is a huge promising market with its external trade volume reaching about $750 billion for both imports and exports. However, it is a market which is difficult to penetrate due to the heavy competition the Egyptian exports are likely to face from other countries, especially China and South East Asian countries whose export commodities not only have competitive prices but also suit the tastes and specifications of the Japanese consumer because of the common culture that combines those countries.
-Unsteady commitment to the specifications agreed upon for the Egyptian commodity, which drives the Japanese importer to stop dealing with the same exporter or other exporters in case non-commitment to the required specifications are repeated.
The Japanese market can accommodate several Egyptian export items, if they meet that market's technical and price specifications, especially as Japan is currently adopting policies that would increase its imports from various countries of the world. This can be shown by the fact that the role of the Japanese trade authority has been converted into the authority for the development of other countries' exports to Japan.
The volume of trade exchange between Egypt and Japan has declined from about $650 million in 2001 to $579 million last year as a result of the decline in the value of Egyptian exports from $76 million in 2001 to $69.6 million last year and the decline in the value of Egyptian imports from $574 million in 2001 to $509 million last year.

NATIONAL FRONT JUMPING-OFF FOR COUNTRY'S REAL SALVATION: GROUPING LEADER
Political parties and civil society establishments should be allowed to join the governmental discussions of public issues and crises, he said.
It is the people who should change the constitution.
The seventh annual report on human development has monitored many accomplishments achieved in economic growth in the past decade. However, it draws attention to the fact that these accomplishments have not been achieved at the same level nationwide, and that Egypt has a bracket of poor people who are still in need of special care from the State. The report also monitors discrepancy between the rural and urban areas, as well as Lower and Upper Egypt.
In ten years, more than 90% of Egyptians are getting potable and safe water.
Despite such remarkable progress in the domain of human development, monitored by the report that was prepared by a group of Egyptian elite, the report says there are moral discrepancies between the governorates of Egypt and even inside the same governorate.
This reflects transference of the wealth from the rural areas to the urban ones during the period of the past eleven years.
However, this rate is low in urban governorates, as it stood at 7.4% in Alexandria and 12.6% in Cairo. Civil Society: The report asks for the adoption of measures to enhance and develop civil society in Egypt, especially as it discovered the weak capabilities of the non-governmental organizations.

Egypt decided to form a national human rights council.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EGYPT & PALESTINIAN MOVEMENTS ON TRUCE
THERE IS NO CRISIS-MANAGEMENT MECHANISM: PREMIER'S ADVISOR
Blasting a paucity of information and scientific inefficiency in this respect, he called for a civil crisis-management center in Egypt.

Israeli Prime minister advisor dubbed the USA proposed roadmap in the Middle East as bloody!
ISRAEL EXPLOITS TERRORIST OPERATIONS TO INVITE MOROCCO'S JEWS TO EMIGRATE TO IT
It is noteworthy that the number of the Jews in Morocco is 3500-4000 while the number of Moroccan Jews in Israel amounts to about half a million souls.
Some of them wanted to restore social relations only.
Fadlallah announced his condemnation of such acts and called on those in charge of Islam and Muslims affairs to launch an awareness campaign against such practices that assume the cloak of religion but is completely innocent of it.
Head of Hizbullah's Political Council Sheikh Ibrahim Amin Al-Sayyed called for "preparing our institutions and generations for the political battle with America." "The USA can win a military battle anywhere but it cannot win the political, cultural, social and civilizational battle. We have little arms in comparison to the USA, but all of our mentality, culture, history, values and civilization run counter to those of the US and Israel."
This is actually what happening, as the Jordanian government has opened its borders before the Iraqi traders or the "whales" as they are called. This step is meant to react with an unconventional trade activity that started to sweep the Jordanian domestic markets for the interest of consumption or "storage" in Iraq.
Car traders particularly in Jordan live their golden age, as the whales of the Iraqi market import huge quantities of small or fabulous cars. The Iraqi traders pay in cash millions of dinars and then transport their consignments in a few hours. They imagine that the Iraqi market is in need of any four-wheeled things.
There is a highl demand, in particular, for tyres and car spare parts and exceptional interest in importing pharmaceuticals and medical supplies and related devices.
Over ten thousand Iraqis and Jordanians residing in Jordan are dealing in such a trade. They work as mediators and an executive body between the two parties. It is said that a great Iraqi trader has been seeking for Jordanian partners to clinch deals in the field of cosmetics, as the Iraqi market has been suffering from a sharp shortage of such materials for 12 years. It also seems that large quantities of plastic-made shoes made in Jordan are now on their way to Iraq in addition to herbal formulas, local and Arab newspapers, and cassette tapes.
It is noticeable that the leaderships of these Islamic movements are in their 40s except Sheikh Abdel-Salam Yassin who reached 70.
Some call it the Salafi Jihad Group. The movement is led by Sheikh Hassan Al-Kinani and Sheikh Abu-Hafs (Both under 30 years of age) who were arrested and are now in prison. It is the only Islamic trend that some of whose members adopt violence as they were accused of killing a policeman. The security agencies announced after this incident a list of the names of some Moroccan figures and accused this organisation of intending to kill them.
A Moroccan source says that the main danger is the emergence of a five-year-old modern Shiite trend, which admires Hezbollah and its leader Hassan Nasrullah, but, alas, is a Salafi trend that is totally away from the ideas of Hezbollah and whose reference is the old Shiite books. It believes in all idle talk about Islamic heritage and selects only the worst of it and seems to be dogmatic and fanatic.
Islamists never forget that King Hassan had put Sheikh Abdel-Salam Yassin, the spiritual leader of the Islamic trend, if the expression allows, under house arrest for years and that King Mohammad VI cancelled this decision. Although his release of one of the fanatic Jewish prisoners was accepted by the west and America, giving this person big privileges after his release such as putting him in charge of concluding oil exploration contracts raised the hackles of many people particularly Islamists.
However, such mass media fail to see that those perpetrators are Saudis who are by-products of the professed official creed, graduates of the regime's schools and its Islamic institution which used religion as a pretext for survival and freedoms confiscation.
In an address yesterday, the Saudi Monarch King Fahed bin Abdel Aziz admitted to the necessity to make reforms, enhance popular participation, but omitted to say where or how such participation would be. We wonder whether it was necessary for all those blasts to take place so that we might eventually hear such magic words about reform and popular participation.
The new conservatives in America hardly achieved anything by toppling the regime of the Talibans. They rather started to harvest trouble due to their occupation of Iraq. Afghanistan is still a hotbed for chaos and instability. Iraq is still without water, electricity or security!
Reformist politicians and media men and liberals in Iran urged that a lesson should be learnt from what happened in Iraq and Afghanistan, so that Islamic regime institutions in Tehran should undergo deep reforms.
The European Union is holding trade talks in parallel with a political dialogue to pressurize Iran in order to refrain from seeking to own mass destruction weapons and to stop supporting anti-Israel groups and improve its human rights record.
The signatories demanded a return to the people and referendum and called for "stopping detentions and illegal summons before the judiciary".

The complaint was filed by lawyer Nabih Al-Wahsh, who had formerly had a long judicial dispute with writer Nawal Al-Sa'dawi and her husband Sherif Hatata ending in his loss of the case.

He said that denial of women having to wear veil is considered denial of what is true in religion, which, consequently exposes culprits to punishment whether by the positive or divine law.
The story usually begins with some of the ambassador's entourage visiting the gallery to inform its organizer of an important personality intending to visit the gallery. The identity of that personality would not be revealed and is claimed to be any country's ambassador or minister. The usual procedures start and the ambassador's visit is done and only then would the gallery organizer discover the trick that made him receive Israel's ambassador cordially and see him off warmly in public regardless of the plastic artists' boycott decision.
Russian diplomatic sources said yesterday (29th May) the US had laid down a plan for launching a military attack on Iran.

The recent US threats to Iran deliver a clear message to Iraqi Shiites that their political and national ambitions have their limits and that America will not allow the Iraqi Shiites to get any support from Tehran by virtue of common interests or belonging to the same religious creed.

A main part of this violence will come from Jihad organisation rather than the Gamaa Islamia, he said.
He pointed out that the Iraqi and Palestinian events would be one of the main reasons for the resurgence of violence under the cloak of religion in Egypt and many other Arab countries and would principally be directed against western, American, and Israeli figures and institutions in the form of retaliation.
The situation has become wholly stable and violence no longer has any room.

Abdel-Wahab Al-Sharqawi.
"This, unfortunately, means that the remaining amount of cotton wool is 400 thousand kantars in more than two months and only 200 thousand kantars remained, which, I think, had been consumed," Al-Sharqawi said, pointing out that the production of the new season would be shown next October, of which the initial estimates stand at 4 or 5 million kantars.
EGYPTIAN-MALAYSIAN COOPERATION IN SMALL-SIZED PROJECTS
People's Assembly (PA) Economic Committee asked for considering the real reasons behind the retreat of private sector investments after the recent statistics showed that its participation in investments do not exceed 46%.
The committee warned also against failure to confine the domestic debt and decrease government borrowing from local savings. The expected government loans in 2003/2004 plan for the government and the companies and the authorities of the public sector are expected to hit 71% of total savings. This will provide private sector and public enterprise sector companies with only 4% and 3.7% respectively to finance their target investments in this plan.
Meanwhile, the dollar rate of exchange compared to the pound jumped from 340 piasters in 1998 to 538 a few months before the deregulation decision in 28 January last. Thus, the pound lost more than 36% of its value.
This necessitates that banks and exchange firms must deal with high responsibility and exert efforts to recognize the actual elements of power with respect to supply and demand.
In view of this, he pursued, it is expected to attract some foreign investments on the Egyptian market so as to easily recognize the price of the foreign currency and get it. The absence of that decision used to limit the influx of direct foreign investment.
Professor of economics at the Faculty of Economics and Political Science disagrees with these opinions. He opines that the decision did not achieve any of its declared goals. The decree timing was inappropriate as there are no production bases that can compete, not to mention the fiasco in importation and the escalating economic recession. The government neither prepared the market well nor handled the negative points to render the decision a success.
Although some ministries are justifying the sluggish repayment to those companies' failure to implement the items of the concluded contracts, thus making it necessary to delay payment of dues till handover in compliance with the specifications in the contracts concluded, it has been recently uncovered by the People's Assembly Committee on Housing that the contracting sector had been negatively affected by the hikes in the prices of building materials, as well as the rise in customs duties.
In spite of such a statement, contracting companies think that their dues on the government include not only the old outstanding debts but also the losses incurred by the companies as a result of the deregulation of the rate of exchange which created very high price differentials especially in building materials, which requires compensating contractors for price differentials for the contracts concluded before January, 2003 when the rate of exchange was deregulated.
They argued that the modernization funds were squandered by the government and that the officials in charge of that programme spent its funds on meetings and banquettes held in five-star hotels.
The total finance of the project hits 426 million euros including 250 million euros as contribution of the European Union, 103 million euros as contribution of the Egyptian government and 73 million euros as contribution of the Egyptian private sector.
Four years of the plan's schedule are remaining. However, let's forget about the past as it is clear that the project's start was not proper and was delayed for many years. Therefore, the Egyptian government and the EU decided to change the leadership.
What is more important and what everybody has to know is that the programme will not modernize the industry. * How come, while everybody pins his hopes on it?
High education outputs as well as infrastructure have influence on industry upgrade. The performance of the government and its institutions such as customs department has effect on industrial sector.
Modernization is a comprehensive and wide-range concept, which is not confined to industry only. Rather, modernization extends to all outputs of the society culture and education. What concerns and bothers me in the whole matter is that the manufacturer should understand the message.
Without such a vision, no upgrade or modernization would take place. It is the vision that would determine the working plan.
The programme term is 5 years because the term of the EU aid programme will come to an end following this period. Afterwards, there would be other programmes. But, today there is a commitment by the ministry and the government to forge ahead in this work. These five years were a starting point to execute the project, as the agreement with the EU is definite in terms of time and finance.
Article 80 has been applied to defendant, Hala Talat (43 years old) who was charged with assisting a businessman, the primary defendant in the case, Tariq Al-Sewisy and conniving with him in concealing the sources of his money and extending help and assistance to him.
The Interpol are currently making efforts to arrest the three defendants on the run in Switzerland including antiquities inspectors who managed to escape while participating in an exhibition for selling Egyptian artifacts there.
The Court's report said the election results, declared on November 15, 2000, are invalid because the two phases of voting and sorting out violated the second paragraph of Article 24 of the Law on Exercising Political Rights. This Paragraph states that the chairmanship of the main and sub-polling stations should be assigned to the members of the judicial authorities who settle disputes.
The Jamaa Islamia (Islamic Group) organization dispelled the fears of resumed violence operations in Egypt. The historical leaders of Jamaa Islamia said that the peaceful attitude adopted by the group since the peaceful initiative launched in 1997 would not be backtracked on. They strongly denied that Riyadh and Casablanca blasts might push the group's elements to backtrack on such a peaceful attitude.
The statement added, "In addition to the mistakes, there are also the blatant dangers that result in such operations as they put the whole nation in a state of antagonism towards the whole world, a thing whose repercussions are explicit, because no group is entitled to put the whole Islamic world in a confrontation that will not be in its favour by any means."
In his paper, Shafiq reviewed the problems the Christian citizen faces in the law and his exposition to systematized discrimination.
He also called on the Evangelical Church to hold a special conference to discuss the erosion caused to their national environment by the globalization of creeds. Shafia railed against the ten conditions for church construction issued in 1934.
ISRAEL BUILDS 2000 SETTLEMENT HOUSES SOON
Israeli Ministry of the Interior sources say that the number of settlers increased by 5000 this year.
Peace with Israel is not possible not because the Arabs reject it but because Israel itself does not want it.
That is, he who has the ability to go to war is the one who has the ability to make peace.
Dr. Ahmad Sidqi Al-Digani, a Palestinian thinker, said that the events witnessed by Palestine developed from a an uprising to a battle of Arabism for defending Jerusalem and Islamic and Christian sacred places. He pointed out that the Arab-Zionist conflict is an extensive social conflict, which requires resistance at the official and popular level and consolidation of Arab solidarity.
He said the American strategy is the greatest challenge that faced the Arab and Islamic nation since the Second World War at the external level because Washington adopted in its strategy the imperialist colonial Zionist entity.
He added that the plan acquires importance from the fact that it is aimed at establishing an independent Palestinian state by 2005 and comes within the framework of the new US policy on the Middle East and the American campaign on terrorism and with the shift in the US Administration stand on the Jerusalem issue after the US president approved a bill passed by the Congress considering Jerusalem a unified capital of Israel, which raises questions over the use and limits of this roadmap.
It also depends on the serious international pressure on Israel which should go beyond attention-drawing and statements to the boundaries of action and clear awareness of the necessity of correcting the current situation and finally the development of the internal Israeli climate to accept a negotiated solution and recognize the Palestinian people's right to State and liberation from occupation.
Rather, what can be understood from the Zionist thought is the movement towards Greater Israel, which would deal with the surrounding Arab countries just as the US deals with the Central and South American republics as it seeks to establish a tripartite alliance between the Jewish mind, the oil funds, and Arab workforce.
Al-Quds Al-Arabi Chief Editor Abdel-Bari Atwan writes an article on the future Palestinian state to say: Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon won a major diplomatic victory on Monday when he "snatched" a decision from his cabinet on okaying the roadmap, revealing to the entire world that he is really a "man of peace" and keen to offer painful concessions for a lasting political settlement.
The first stage includes a long list of requests or "orders" which the Palestinian prime minister ought to meet literally before Sharon just commences to have a look at the roadmap.
What is then the value of this deformed Palestinian state based on conceding the right of at least 4 million Palestinian refugees who have been suffering at Diaspora refugee camps for 50-odd years?
However, the Palestinian people will not be snared in such a new trick as Abu Mazen or anybody else was not elected to waive rights.
By extracting the government's approval of the road map, the bloodiest of all generals in the Hebrew state's history sent a group of messages to cover up for his categorical objection to any fair and comprehensive peace.
The general who daily assassinates peace opportunities is now launching a maneuver to let the Palestinians seem as enemies of peace.
He might have thought that the blatant imbalance of regional and international powers might allow Israel to positively deal with the road map after showing reservations, obtaining reassurances and combining the government approval on the road map with a decision rejecting the "right to return" to Israel.
With the return of Israeli-Palestinian contacts and the talk about a tripartite meeting with Bush's participation, Hamas and Jihad find themselves in a situation that requires either taking painful decisions or willingness to pay too high a price!
Syrian Oil Minister Ibrahim Haddad will sign together with the representatives of the two American oil companies the contract of exploring and developing oil production in the compound 26 Northeast Syria.
Syrian oil industry faced a crisis when the American forces stopped the supplies of the Iraqi oil to Syria during the war on Iraq, a thing that forces Syria to reduce their oil exports by 10%. Different international oil industry bodies had issued reports to the effect that the ensured oil reserves in Syria are sufficient only for ten years of production, however, officials with the Syrian Oil Ministry confirmed in prior statements that the ministry had studies that refer that Syrian oil production will continue until 2040.

Well-informed Arab sources have recently unveiled that the Libyan leadership was intent to change the current name into the "Libyan African Jamahiriya" to run in parallel with Colonel Gaddafi's new orientations aiming at "going" African at the expense of Arab nationalist attitudes.
The statement pointed out that such a decision came after appeals from several Arab leaders to Libyan leader Gaddafi to intervene in order to freeze Libya's withdrawal demand.
The figures were published amid charges by opposition deputies against the government to the effect that it had allocated millions of dinars to back its candidates. This was categorically denied by the government.
The small number of voters is mainly attributed to the special conditions stipulated by the constitution in 1962. A voter shall be a 21-year-old male who is not working in the security or military corps and no verdict was passed against him.
Some deputies argue that had the government approved of these proposals and franchised women the number of voters would have surged up to 350,000 approximately.
At Khartoum Airport, the forces met with the liaison officer based in Khartoum and who is assigned to lead such special forces in such a task in addition to making consultation with military officials in the Sudanese army.
GARANG'S WIFE SPEAKS FOR FIRST TIME IN AL
WILL MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD PARTICIPATE IN IRAQI GOVERNMENT FORMED BY AMERICA?
Al-Hudaibi confirmed that Muslim Brotherhood presence in Iraq dates back to the 1940s as the Iraqi Ikhwan had a representation in the Ikhwan constituent authority in Egypt. He added that the Iraqi Islamic Party is the representative of the Ikhwanite trend in Iraq currently and soon there will be contact with them. Direct contact did not take place due to the current conditions.
A: This is not true as there are Ikhwanite elements in Iraq, but the ousted Bath regime had practiced different kinds of terrorism against them, something that affected the propagation of their call. However, the demonstrations taking to the Iraqi streets currently chanting the Ikhwanite slogans and carrying their placards that shows the Ikhwanite presence in Iraq in addition to the fact that Iraqi Ikhwanite members are represented in the international organization and we had contacted them when Hasan Al-Banna (Muslim Brotherhood founder) was alive.
Q: Is there any initiative to contact the Iraqi Islamic Party?

Egyptian Minister of Public Enterprise Sector Mokhtar Khattab said the recent meeting of the governing council of the Preferential Trade Bank of the Common Market for East and South Africa (COMESA), which was held in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, discussed last year's bank activities. Profits made by the bank hiked up three times as many as the previous year, the minister said.
At the meeting, they also thrashed out a follow-up of an Egyptian plan to refurbish and rehabilitate Sudanese spinning and weaving plants, and to train several Sudanese spinning and weaving technicians in Egypt.
These negotiations are expected to touch on how to liberalize all Egyptian farming produce, processed agricultural products and industrial commodities in exchange for a gradual liberalization of Turkish exports to Egypt within seven years at least in the framework of Egypt's commitments to the 1995 Barcelona Declaration on a Euro-Mediterranean free trade zone, according to economic sources.
Egypt's main exports are mineral oils, petroleum, cotton, rice, coke, yarn, natural gas, quartz sand and copper.
The Suez Canal University deputy rector for the environment and community service affairs Dr. Ali Al-Zayat announced that Lake Balaton contributed 43% of the Hungarian national income though the sales of fish and sea organisms it fielded by using the state-of-art technology and modern media research.
The studies and researches will include water analyses, the lakes depths, dominant climatic and ecological conditions and how far they would affect the fish there.

According to figures of the Indian Ministry of Foreign Trade, Egypt's exports to India were on the rise while India's exports to Egypt were on the wane in 2002 compared to the previous year.
Egypt's conventional commodities including rock phosphate, cotton, metal scrap, coke, caraway, cumin and coriander were on the rise.
They emphasized that the sharp decline of the dollar against the pound sterling and the euro makes it necessary to adopt such an approach so that the Egyptian pound would not be exposed to further fluctuations.
It might be mentioned that Egypt's imports from Britain include equipment, machinery, communication devices, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, metal products, and specialized and scientific devices of control and quality.
Concerning the possibility of boosting Egyptian exports to the British market due to the depreciation of the pound, he wondered, "Where are the exports that can penetrate such a market?!"

EGYPTAIR TO RE-OPERATE FLIGHTS TO BAGHDAD THIS MONTH
Abdel Hamid expected a breakthrough soon, especially after opening Iraq's airspace mid-July instant and allowing the passage only through the airspace. This, he continued, would decrease the time and cost of airlines' flights heading for many areas, mainly including the Middle East and the Gulf region.
He said in his recent visit to the U.S., he opened Washington-based first office to promote Egypt's information and communications technology. The office is aimed to find opportunities for bilateral cooperation and participation among Egyptian and American businesses whether in the U.S. or Middle East countries, he said.

The PA Committee on Industry and Energy chaired by Dr. Amin Mubarak has warned against a steady collapse in the spinning and weaving industry as its losses amounted to LE9 billion.
The committee also urged the government to confront smuggling tycoons to avoid the harm done to textile producers in Mahala who exports their products to world countries while 1200 factories are facing the scourge of closure as a result of smugglers' activities.
The project, which will cost 175 million U.S. dollars, is predicted to produce 140,000 tons of resins, 42,000 tons of polyester and around 35,000 tons of plastics on a yearly basis.
The selection of Egypt as a new project site is due to several reasons, mainly the growing demand for polyester which hit around 200,000 tons in 2002, Egypt's high-quality cotton, exploitation of free trade agreements between Egypt and the EU, COMESA and other regional and international blocs, use of Egypt's strategic geographical position to export products and import raw materials, trade links with several countries like Turkey, Syria, as well as North African and European countries, Egypt's well-trained, skilled and cheap labour and available infrastructure, said Diwan Zia, the Pakistani group's president.
Egypt's cotton exports included traditional products like yarn and clothes in addition to cotton products of high value added such as tricot, attire, tailored clothes and hairy products.
Dr. Khidr uncovered that at the beginning of next July the ministers of agriculture, supply and domestic trade, foreign trade and Public and private sectors will issue the joint ministerial decree of marketing cotton.
The GAACT prepares training programs to graduates in the authority. At the end of the course they get authorized certificates which qualify them to work in the companies of the private sector, zoo in number, Khidr said.
$13.9 MILLION GRANT FROM EGYPT TO UGANDA
It is worth mentioning that the first stage of this project started three years ago and bore fruits which were praised by Ugandan political and popular leaderships. The development of Lake Kyoga exit was completed at a total length of 36 kilometers.

The statements made by the Minister of Foreign Trade Dr. Youssef Botrous Ghali last Friday during his visit to Washington had created a sensation in internal and external economic milieus and raised some questions regarding differences of positions between Egyptian Foreign Ministry and Foreign Trade Ministry over the issue of genetically engineered crops.
He said that there was too much confusing information regarding the real position adopted by the Egyptian government.
Burg said that officials from the European Commission had conducted discussions with various ministries concerned in order to determine the conditions under which the budget finance required amounting to 175 million euros will be offered.
It is noteworthy that the European Commission had initially agreed last May to expedite extending 175 million euros out of European assistance to support Egypt's public budget.
Japanese ambassador to Egypt Kazuyshi Urabe hailed the deep relations between the Japanese and Egyptian peoples, stressing that the Japanese Premier's visit to Cairo last May confirmed the cooperation relations between both countries and marked the beginning of a new stage of cooperation and Japan's support of Egypt.
EGYPTIAN-ROMANIAN COOPERATION OPPORTUNITIES
He talked about investment climate and incentives provided for by the Special Economic Zones Law. He added that the law makes Egypt among the best investment-attracting areas in the world.
The visit aims as well at courting Irish and British investments to Egypt, setting up joint projects in the commercial and industrial fields and considering the means of enhancing cooperation in the field of software and agricultural products.
He added that Dutch investments in Egypt reached 1.2 billion euros, i.e LE7.5 billion in the form of 82 projects in various fields like prospecting for oil by International Shell, as well as in the fields of chemical materials, medicine, assembling trucks and food industries.
AUSTRALIAN FACTORY FOR PHOTOCOPY PAPER
The demand grown by some 20% on the part of education and business sectors in Egypt Qasem added that 40% of paper is consumed by public sector and government institutions and 60% is used by the private sector. The volume of dealing in paper market reached 920 million dollars in 2002.
This attitude managed for the first time to increase the volume of investments in the industrial projects in free zones to 62% in comparison to the volume of investments in storage projects, he added.
Negotiations with Pakistan have been conducted through three channels. On the margin of World Trade Organization Trade Ministers' Conference held in Sharm El-Sheikh Dr. Yousef Botrous Ghali discussed the issue with his Pakistani counterpart.
It seems that the appeal sent to premier Atef Ebeid by 45 foreign airlines operate in Egypt at the beginning of March to convert foreign airlines revenues from the domestic currency into the currencies of the countries to which those airlines belong has not been given two hoots by the authorities concerned. Those airlines have, therefore, been suffering from a crisis that would bring the activity of some of them to an entire halt should it not be solved.
1- Financial remittances: According to the companies, during the period from December 2001, till that date, only insignificant sums representing only one month sales of the revenues of all airlines operate in Egypt whose annually revenues range from LE80 and 100 million have been remitted.
2-Regarding the taxes on the official uniform worn by the personnel of those airlines and the publications and gifts coming to them and carrying the logo of the airlines and the usage of which comes within consumption framework rather than trading, serving the purposes of work and is difficult to come by domestically because they carry the airline's logo which are made in the headquarters just as what happens with the national airline (EgyptAir) whose publications and official uniform are domestically produced.
The area was then changed into 9 square meters with a rent value of LE7425. Another point that contributes to airlines losses is the payment of the fees to the authority is estimated in the dollar rate of exchange but paid in the domestic currency i.e the fees rise by the same rate the domestic value declines. The airlines revenues, consequently, corrodes while being kept in banks as they could not be converted into other currencies and could not cope with payments of fees and charges to the authority.
They added that the law contained several items that had to be discussed as they would add considerable financial burdens which most operating airlines can hardly cope with especially in the future.
Regrettably, no.
In the second half of July, a delegation of Egyptian businessmen is visiting Belorussia.
During the visit, the mission is going to conduct market studies for a number of Egyptian products that have good chances for asserting themselves on Belorussian markets in a bid to boost those products exports.
Trade exchange between the two countries has always increased and decreased since they signed Camp David Peace Accord in 1979 even after the outbreak of Al-Aqsa Intifada on September 28th, 2000. Egypt's exports to Israel hit 20.3 million dollars last year against about 20 million dollars in 2001, an increase of 300,000 dollars. Egypt's imports from Israel sharply declined, as they hit some 26.2 million dollars in 2002 against 47.1 million dollars in 2001.

The project also aims at assisting youth in marketing and expansion through expositions.
International dealings in the first eight months of 2002/2003 resulted in striking the balance of current operations and remittances, thus achieving a surplus of 239 million dollars. The trade balance deficit went down by 4.3% to hit 4.9 billion dollars versus 5.1 billion dollars.
Surplus of the production revenues balance went down by 442.7 million dollars owing to a retreat in Egyptian expatriates' proceeds by 182.6 million pounds and the tourism returns by 258.7 million dollars due to the decline of international interest rates.
Manufacturing industries sector production hit 137 billion pounds, of which 120 billion pounds are achieved by the private sector and 17.7 billion pounds by the public sector.
A report by the Cabinet's Infromation and Decision Support Centre uncovered a decline in the sales of building materials last year.
Economists say that in case economic stagnation persists in a certain country for more than three years, this means that this ailing economy is impossible to recover and its collapse is a matter of time.
The social changes Egypt witnessed over the outgoing half century since the start of July 1952 Revolution failed to cancel the role of planning, said Dr Ibrahim Al-Essawi, advisor with the Egyptian National Planning Institute. Experiments, however, proved that planning is still economically necessary and that the state's role is important, he added. Markets don't work in a vacuum and practical experiments proved that the market is unable to create development in developing countries including Egypt as the market in these countries has nothing to do with the real market on which liberalism stands, Dr Essawi said.
He said the role of planning in bringing about social changes had been limited since the start of the sixties. Its limitedness increased with the open door policy.
Dr Ibtissam Al-Jaafarawi, expert with the Egyptian National Center for Sociological and Criminological Research said, "Lack of organized planning pushing forward the social change process affected the employment of labour as well. With the transfer to state administration, economic planning and the start of Egyptianizing foreigners' property and nationalization which targeted national capitalism, the state bureaucratic class was formed and the capitalist class and the private sector started wearing out and the state became the mastermind of everything in planning."
They are the collapse of the communist block and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait as well as the first Gulf war. A big percentage of Egyptian labour returned from Arab countries due to the shrinkage of the volume of foreign demand for Egyptian labour. The returnees started searching for jobs, thus affecting the agricultural labour sector as it is one of the workforce sectors that contribute to the absorption of about 17 million souls according to 1996 census.
The source pointed out that the next three months would witness the completion of talks about those issues.
An official source pointed out that the report included the most important indicators of ports performance, including a 9.4% rise in the volume of goods and the circulated containers in Egyptian ports.
EGYPT TO BE LIFTED FROM NEGATIVE LIST OF MONEY LAUNDERING EARLY 2004

Addressing a gathering organized by the Arab Agricultural Development Organization on Tuesday, the minister said Egypt supported farming development efforts and provided necessary know-how. Arab countries should exert concerted efforts to tap available resources.
SPECIAL ZONES INCENTIVES MAKE EGYPT BEST INVESTMENT ZONE IN THE WORLD
He pointed to the People's Assembly approval of Egyptian-European partnership agreement, adding that Romania joining the European Union (EU) will increase its cooperation with Egypt.
The value of new investments in addition to the expansion of the existing companies investments reached 6.3 billion dollars in 2002 against 6.4 billion dollars and 6.8 billion dollars in 2001and 2000 respectively, he declared. As for the Irish companies investing in Egypt, Al-Ghamrawi said that their investments hit about 36 million dollars or 11.5% out of their total issued capital, which hits 206 million dollars.
The latest report issued by the General Authority for Capital Market, headed by Abdel-Hamid Ibrahim, pointed out that the volume of funds, which entered the market during this year reached 1.971billion pounds. While the volume of funds which got out of the market due to the war on Iraq reached 1.271 billion pounds, a positive differential of 700 million pounds in favor of the funds which entered the market.
It is worth mentioning that foreign investments in the Egyptian pound on bourse, since the foreigners were allowed to enter bourse in first October 1996 up till now, have been estimated at of 39.2 billion pounds, buying 852.3 million shares and selling 725.6 million shares at a value of 28.4 billion pounds, a positive differential of 11 billion pounds.
A Cabinet statement said that Ebid will consider with the delegation currently visiting Egypt the final formula between Egypt and the World Bank before submitting it to the board of the bank in September next.
During the negotiations the bank asked for a thorough structural reform especially after the step of deregulating the Egyptian pound lately taken by the Egyptian government, something that implies adopting other measures in the fields of trade, financial sector and insuring social security.
BANK DEPOSITS RECORD 27 BILLION POUNDS RISE! Apart from the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), bank deposits surged up by around 27.473 billion pounds over the first three months of this year.

Current deposits in foreign currencies hit an equivalent of 11.429 billion pounds, and non-current deposits in foreign currencies totaled an equivalent of roughly 86.374 billion pounds, the sources added.
Al-Tikriti says that their party practised limited clandestine activity in Iraq alongside the other opposition forces after the invasion of Kuwait, but the main activity was outside Iraq though the organisation abroad was not in close and continuous contact with the members inside.
However, this does not rule out the fact that the Islamic party was present inside Iraq and there is evidence that they opened more than 80 headquarters for the party since the fall of Saddam Hussein regime, he pointed out. Also, they did not need to bring in many of the members abroad as the affairs of these headquarters are run by members inside Iraq.
Al-Tikriti admitted to the embarrassment of his party over dealing with the American Administration, which occupies Iraq. He said "We expect the US to honour the promises it made before the world that it went to Iraq to overthrow Saddam Hussein's regime and bring freedom and democracy to the Iraqi people.
Qualifications of new president The Iraqi Muslim Brotherhood Mentor objected to the accusations leveled against the Muslim Brotherhood of being an organisation seeking to achieve its aims through violence." He who reads the history of the Muslim Brotherhood correctly, will consider the conditions that generated some frustration that led to individual violence acts and the Muslim Brotherhood is not responsible for some incidents that took place in Egypt," he said.
Al-Tikriti also said they feel that the imposition of an Islamic state in Iraq was unacceptable. Although this was the aim of the party, the attempt to impose it by force would backfire, he noted.
Stressing commitment to this democratic approach, he said that his party did not mind the next president of Iraq being a Shiite provided that he would have the characteristics that qualify him for leading Iraq in a way that would not discriminate between one person and another. "We do not want him Shiite to protect the Shiite arena. What is the use of a Sunni president if he is like Saddam and what is the use of a Shiite president if he is like the Shiites who served the former regime?" he concluded.
He also called for the rotation of power between the northerners and southerners and for a secular capital.
The Sudanese parties are unanimous on the peaceful solution, expansion of participation in government and joint action towards the creation of a new Sudan.
The Central Bank of Sudan governor uncovered that SPLA had officially asked, in Machakos, Kenya, negotiations to set up a central bank and a special currency for it. He added that experts in banking organizations and international institutions as well as in the specialized committees had emphasized that the monetary authority, monetary policies and the central bank in any country are inseparable and that experts had based their decisive view on purely technical specialized grounds. It is hardly thinkable to have two different monetary authorities, central banks or currencies in the same country.
Al-Jazeera TV channel is always controversial on the Arab and international levels through its march that knows no limits. The departure of its director Mohamed Jassim Al-Ali from his position was also controversial. Many questions were raised especially as the news item of his "sacking", "resigning" or even "the end of his term as managing director" and his return to the General Authority for Radio and Television was not announced in a statement by Al-Jazeera but rather some sort of "leakage."
Some make it likely that the coming days will witness a transitional repositioning in Al-Jazeera until a new director assumes responsibility in a channel that should not have been succeeded without such a big margin of freedom that resulted from the atmosphere of this stage in Qatar. This means that the open-door policy adopted by Qatari Emir Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Than is the secret of success and the main guarantee to the channel of "the opinion and counter-opinion."
The tiring search for the "mass graves" of the former Iraqi regimes victims urged scores of Iraqis to offer their services in that unprecedented field, according to the rewards received if corpses were found in the scores of graves scattered all over Iraq. Some former officials in security and intelligence bodies who had taken part in execution operations now offer services either themselves or via brokers for their services.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guard forces stopped training pilots belonging to the Lebanese "Hizbullah", which indicates that Iran takes Washington's threats seriously, according to a source with the Guard Air Forces.
Sources said the Guard forces based in Lebanon withdrew last week the heavy weapons, foremost of which were "Raad" and "Sahin" rocket launchers and medium-range cannons, which had earlier been sent to Hizbullah and hidden in underground stores in Beqaa area.
The sources pointed out that the negotiations were run by a diplomat in the American embassy in Islamabad which was rejected by the Taliban who demanded that the American representation level be raised.
The sources indicated several outstanding positions that had recently emerged including a statement by American deputy Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs, Richard Armitage in Islamabad that the Afghan President, Hamid Karzai had failed to maintain security and stability in Afghanistan, a statement often made by other American officials in Washington, in addition to the losses inflicted on the American forces in the recent operations launched by the Taliban, Al-Qaeda and Afghan Islamic Party fighters, let alone their failure to establish a strong Afghan government in the whole Afghan territories.
It is the way of George W. Bush that includes reward and punishment and retentive memory.
A report in an American newspaper is enough to cause concern in and about a country.
The current US diplomacy has muscles and teeth and the American arm is long.
The Iranians could flock to the squares of Tehran and wave their fists against "The Archenemy", but the scene would seem old and sad.
The failure to respond means punishment, namely an amount of isolation and series of pressure to take the problems to the internal Iranian level.
Ruling National Democratic Party's (NDP) policies secretary Gamal Mubarak announced that the Policy Secretariat was considering the establishment of "a national authority" that would be concerned with "ensuring efficiency of higher education." "Raising the efficiency of education should not be confined to general education but would also include the technical and Azharite ones," he said.
Gamal Mubarak's talk came during the meeting of the Policy Committee with its members in Al-Gharbia governorate. They broached the issue of preparing for the NDP next annual congress slated for convention next September, which he described as a chance to appraise the party's activities in a year.
HAMAS SUSPENDS DIALOGUE WITH ABU MAZEN
The Palestinian Premier vowed at the summit to bring the armed Intifada to a halt and wipe out violence and terror against Israelis, leading to the creation of a Palestinian state.
The movement also enunciated its opposition to resolutions made at the Sharm El-Sheikh and Aqaba summits.
In the meantime, thousands of Palestinians gathered following Friday Prayers in compliance with a Hamas call to oppose the summit resolutions.
The U.S. military presence in the Middle East region will prevent countries in the region from possessing and selling weapons of mass destruction to terrorists, he claimed.
WHAT ABOUT DEMOCRACY?
If the incumbent U.S. administration (and even its predecessors) was involved in a conflict with countries established on the basis of religion, then its arguments following Bush's commitment have become weak, even if in form, in this conflict.
This Christian right-wing has become the staunchest supporter of Israel in the face of the Arabs, while the Israeli lobby feels comfortable as there is a lobby acting on its behalf in Washington.
Its sweeping triumph in Iraq enables it to justify whatever it does to the extent that it states openly that its military option in Iraq (compared to the diplomatic option in North Korea) came due to the fact that Iraq is an oil-rich country, as said by the U.S. deputy secretary of defense a couple of days ago, dropping Iraq's alleged WMD disarmament excuse.
However, we collected the mobiles and returned them to the candidate telling his men that the price per vote reached 3 thousand dinars!"
The case of one of those candidates, however, has made such a practice public when, according to all reports, he published a press advertisement inviting his neighbourhood population to work for him as personnel in his election campaign in return for 1500 dinars to be paid in advance so that a similar sum would be paid after winning the elections.
Deputy Ahmed Al-Sa'doun who has failed in the last four years vowed to force the government to uncover the secret funds withdrawn by government departments from the Central Bank of Kuwait during the 1999 election campaign, threatened to unravel the names of those who withdrew central bank money and uncover their identities.
A sharp criticism was launched on American policies by Muslim Brotherhood General Guide counsellor Ma'moun Al-Hudaibi just before the first visit to be paid by President George Bush to Egypt on Tuesday next to meet Arab leaders.
To conclude, Al-Hudaibi said, "The nation's rulers have failed to take even one single step on the road to redressing the house and putting things right.
Renowned thinker and intellectual Fahmi Huwaidi said the fall and occupation of Iraq indicated many loopholes in the Arab political map and exposed Arab regimes' impotence, which, he said, pushed Arab peoples to open the dossiers of those regimes.
The extended emergency law blocks democracy and hoped for reform.
Only fair and free elections and active civil society can lead to a genuine democracy.
Yesterday, People's Assembly (PA) headed by Dr. Ahmed Fatehi Sorour approved a bill to amend the money laundering act.
He said that he supported the government when it was right, but sharply criticized it when it erred, which is the opposition's role. Kalag described the amendments as in compliance with the international developments and reality.
Yesterday, the PA finally approved a bill to reorganize Eye Banks.
The banks get corneas from the eyes of persons who agree to have their corneas transplanted free of charge after their death, the eyes of accident victims or the dead in hospitals where three department heads unanimously agree to transplant their corneas, as well as the eyes of those condemned to death subject to their approval. The corneas of the eyes that had to be medically amputated are ruled out.
Zakeya is the first woman to become party leader in Egypt, which will lead to opening the file of woman's cause to probe her rights to lead parties.
The disease can easily be detected in the developed communities which have advanced medical services and qualified doctors who can identify the disease, they said.
Tens of male and female believers then hurry for prayers.
A roamer in the university yards would notice the numbers of head-covered female students on the one hand and the bearded student on the other hand, which brings the picture of the university close to the general scene of the Egyptian street now more than ever.
We will not get into argument over whether the veil was optional or obligatory.
"What is the relationship between the veil and security threat?
Therefore, the university administration, which showed noticeable flexibility in dealing with religious demands, took a decisive stance on the veil in what seems to be late awareness of the weak impregnability of the liberal education system, which was chanted by the AUC and its counterparts in the Arab world before the torrential religious trend, which extends all over the Arab World.
If we could go backward, we would say that the place of prayer is the house or the mosque outside the university, but the issue has become sensitive today due to the fact that many bodies easily, alas, accuse an edifice like the AUC of being hostile to Islam, which is of course untrue".
They are sold in mosques at dirt-cheap prices such as the tapes of Amr Khalid, Wagdi Ghunaim, Saad Al-Ghamidi and others".
The effect of the figures is not reduced by the fact that 60% of the university students whose number nears five thousands, get scholarships according to which 10-40 per cent of the tuition fees are deducted.
However, the university administration tries to contain these orientations through stressing the principles of diversity and multiplicity and drawing clear-cut lines for the movement of the religious groups.
However, the performance of prayer is something else, as the Constitution guarantees for Muslims in Egypt, the Islamic state, the freedom of performing prayer in all government circles and official institutions. The matter extends to include most of the private companies.
Hesham, 21, does not mind the university administration accepting the request submitted by a number of Christian colleagues to establish a chapel for them on the university campus.
There is neither chapels nor mosques in the design of a new university campus".
The sources indicated that the Egyptian authorities would probably not respond to any American attempts to have the Israeli spy released before his prison sentence is served.
IKHWAN ACCUSES HOUSING MINSTER OF SQUANDERING PUBLIC FUNDS
This was confirmed by the Central Auditing Agency in 2002 regarding housing sector. Some obtained 1920 feddans in the 6th October City to set up private projects with investment cost of LE5 billion. Others, further, obtained 351,000 square meters in Taba Gulf with LE78 million as investment costs.
According to the minister's statements highlighted by a national newspaper, the government had been allowed to dispose of a number of government-owned real estates the value of which ranged from LE4 to 5 billion.
In its statement before the People's Assembly, Dr. Ebeid's government had announced that it was planning to transfer the responsibility for insurance and pensions funds to its own control rather than the National Investment Bank control in a bid to use those funds for redressing public budget positions, which would pose an imminent threat to pensioners' rights.
ISRAEL HINTS AT ACCEPTING TRUCE WITH HAMAS, ISLAMIC JIHAD
Abu Mazen has been trying since his first day in office to persuade different Palestinian factions to fully give up armed action even if for a limited period.
Any Arab or Muslim man who takes up arms to liberate his land and resist Israeli oppression is a terrorist who should be stopped and uprooted according to Washington and its incumbent administration's views.
The first paragraph of the roadmap commands Palestinian security forces to disarm Hamas and Jihad members, nab all those whom Sharon wants to be collared, and finally provide absolute security to Jewish settlers.
Selected students are scheduled to arrive in London next October with the start of the academic year.
NAME OF "SADDAM HUSSEIN" TURNED DOWN IN ISRAEL
Zahaika attributed naming his son after the name of the president whose regime has collapsed at the hands of the American forces because Saddam is an Arab country leader who believes in the Palestinian cause.
There are three crossings linking Syria and Iraq, in addition to another informal approach connecting northernmost Syria with areas controlled by the Kurdistan Democratic Party, led by Masud Barazani.
"The Palestinian people, Lebanon and Syria faced that ferocious campaign with the logic of steadfastness, perseverance, resolve and persistence, and we weathered that stage.
He also attracted attention to a serious matter, namely the insistence that Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazin) and the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state.
"Those who regard Hamas, the Islamic Jihad, resitance factions and Hizbullah as mercenaries of this or that country are making a strategic mistake, for they wrongly think that tightening the screws on those countries and applying a little pressure here and there could end the resistance in Palestine or make the resistance in Lebanon lay its arms or relinquish its duty," he said.
Will the governments of Sharon and Bush, which have crossed the threshold of economic alliance that is based on shared interests into religious alliance, stop at these serious demands?"
Q: Are there possible impacts on the political climate in Morocco in light of Casablanca blasts?
Islamic movements in Morocco don't adopt violence as an ideology, which is assured by the public authorities that hold "Jihad Salafi" trend responsible for the latest bombings.
A: The Islamic trend has nothing to do with Casablanca attacks.
Those people tried to realize their Jihad Salafi ideology on the ground, i.e. they wanted to enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong from their own perspective. They founded so small organizations or groups, which don't come up to the level of organization, like Zakaria Al-Meloudi group dubbed "As-Serat Al-Mustaquim" (Right Path), which is not an organization by any means, or Jihad Salafi-oriented Youssef Fikry group, which has nothing to do with Heresy and Exodus group at all, as the latter is existent in Morocco as an ideology rather than an organization.
A: Such incidents usually bring contradictory calculations.
I think that some leaders of Al-Tawheed wal-Eslah (Monotheism and Reform) rather than Justice and Development have committed political mistakes. At a certain period, the opposition in the party was concerned with the Islamic points of referenciality of the movement.
This means that the exaggeration in promoting a discourse presenting the Justice and Development Party as an Islamic party was not in favour of the leaders of the Monotheism and Reform movement.
STRIKING AT MODERATE ISLAMISTS STRENGTHENS EXTREMISTS
It is no secret that striking at Islamic movements pleases the US Administration, now that those who are after elimination of undesired elements have gained much influence within its ranks, and now that it has come to regard fundamentalism in the Islamic World as its first enemy after the disappearance of the Iraqi regime.
But today the Americans are focusing on "reinforcing the Algeria's democratic development," in such a manner that excludes the Islamists, as much as possible, from future plans, as indicated by the recent statement of the American Ambassador to Algeria, Richard Erdman, before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Any fresh structure that draws on the lessons of Iraq will never rise without reconciliation processes that eliminate the sectarian, ethnic and cultural fragmentation and conflicts that have torn the Arab Maghreb region for so long and lay a foundation for participation by all, excluding no one and making everyone conform to the rules of the democracy game.
The Qatari News Agency indicated that the new law only "determined the goals and functions of the new body and how it would perform its duties."
He also asked that there should be rotation of power between the North and the South during the transitional period.
Garang indicated the possibility of international forces being deployed in the region between SPLA forces and the Sudanese army during the transitional period proposed in the Sudanese peace talks.
Garang asked that the South be given 40% of government offices.
During the press conference held on Tuesday by opposition Democratic National Gathering in central London, he said that the five issues are still pending and have not been reached so far between the two parties; Sudan government and SPLA - the issue of the two armies' prospects, the national capital regarding constitution and laws which govern it, the dispute over power, the resources, the three regions and their prospects: Nubia mountains, Abay and Ankasna.
Chirac's statements came after his meeting with US President George Bush in a closed-door meeting on the sidelines of Evian Summit.
Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir's Advisor for Strategic Planning Ahmed Ali al-Imam said the enforcement of Islamic Shari'a in North Sudan and Khartoum is irrevocable.
The bureau of Al-Ansar Sect Imam Al-Sadek Al-Mahdi, leader of opposition Sudanese Umma Party denied that Cairo declaration, issued following Al-Mahdi - Al-Mirghani - Garang meeting, containing any provision about the capital Khartoum secularism or the cancellation of Islamic Sharia regulations there in order that it might become a national capital.
JORDAN DENIES STATEMENTS OF ITS AMBASSADOR IN WASHINGTON ABOUT ASSISTING ABU MAZIN IN CONFRONTING ISLAMISTS

These remarks were made by Al-Saeedi while addressing the ceremony held on Tuesday evening and attended by Premier Atef Ebeid, marking Nissan's chief and executive manager's visit to Egypt.
"We would put plans to control that industry under less strict protectionist measures and export orientations together with covering the demands of the domestic market to serve the national interests of that country," Al-Saeedi concluded.
For his part, Ghosn stressed that his talks with Ebeid were constructive, pointing out his company's desire to expand its auto industry in Egypt with a view to serving local consumption and exporting to overseas markets.
The meeting will be attended by Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Ebeid, and the ministers of industry, public enterprise sector, finance, state for foreign affairs, military production, scientific research, housing, electricity, supply and domestic trade and foreign trade, together with a large number of members of the board of the Federation of Industries, chairman of chambers of industry, business organizations and new cities societies of businessmen and members of the Egyptian-Japanese Business Council.
Auto industry in Egypt is very important as Egypt, over the last ten years, attracted several multinationals who invested in or transferred their high-tech to the country. There are now 14 auto plants in Egypt with available combined capacity of over 250,000 cars, but the currently used capacity is no more than 30 percent, thus affecting product cost and output economics. Therefore, significant steps should be taken to spur and overhaul this industry, mainly including the proposed Egyptian-Japanese auto industrial cooperation program.
Those projects include setting factories for producing porcelain, China, cutlery, ceramics as well as the equipment required for swimming pools in cooperation with the Egyptian-British Company for Ceramics and Sanitary ware.
56% OF NET USERS CAIRENE
The report pointed out that Telecom Egypt is implementing a plan to expand telephone services in the country as the number of the villages, which have exchanges, increased from 775 in October 1999 to 1070 in last April.
The reports demanded that the diversification policy be adopted and that no particular county be increasingly relied upon to meet the needs of the Egyptian market of this strategic commodity, in light of the anticipated steady rise in wheat prices due to the rapid developments witnessed by American and Australian markets.
Experts said that the biggest challenge Egypt was facing was the provision of citizens' needs of wheat as Egypt annually consumes about 12.5 million tons of wheat and imports about 6.5 million tons to the value of $1.2 million.
Egyptian-Canadian Business Council chairman Mo'taz Raslan told Al-Alam Al-Youm that the Council tends to put a new strategy for coordination with the existing business organizations. He also said there are arrangements for a strategic partnership with the American chamber.
It is worth mentioning that the Egyptian-Canadian Business council chose Mo'taz Raslan to take over the council management in the coming period succeeding Mohsen Badawi who tendered his resignation to the council late last week.
Highlighting the possibility of producing genetically modified produce in different states worldwide, the report pointed out that Egypt did not commercially produce genetically modified produce till now. However, tests were made for many crops such as cotton, maize, wheat, lemon and tomato.
EGYPT SEEKS EUROPEAN EXPLANATION FOR ARRANGEMENTS FOR ENTRY OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED PRODUCTS INTO EU MARKETS
It is common knowledge that Egypt produces a set of agricultural products including oil seeds, vegetables, and some fruits through genetic engineering.
Ghali will also demand immediate consultation on the decision issued by the EU recently to deny the Egyptian potatoes access to the markets over a limited number of brown rot cases, which Egypt sees as an unjustified measure from the European Agricultural Quarantine authorities.
The discussions will also cover the steps taken recently by Europe to deregulate trade of agricultural commodities and what was agreed upon by the different parties taking part in Sharm El-Sheikh meeting in this respect.
EGYPT BROACHES ECONOMIC COOPERATION WITH EUROPE IN BALERMO MEETING
Egypt is trying to be acquainted with the reasons for the European Union admitting some genetically engineered products while rejecting others according to criteria that need explanation as such products could be produced and exported in big amounts.
Ghali is trying to finish the procedures required for Egypt's inclusion in the list of countries allowed to export to the European Union fish, poultry and dairy products.
The Egyptian-British Business Council will convene in the British capital of London on Monday (July 7th) to thrash out how to rope in more British investments to Egypt, especially small and medium-sized projects, a blueprint by the government and the private sector to remove investment impediments facing foreign investors, and an Egyptian-British business to fund and bail out insolvent companies, particularly travel agents.
At the meeting on Monday, the council's Egyptian and British members will mull over an Egyptian-British concern to resource and save faltering eneterprises, especially mega tourist projects on the Red Sea and South Sinai coasts, which stopped activities owing to lack of money, he said. The new business is to run and fund these insolvent projects through banks and national and foreign financial institutions.
OFFSET AGREEMENT WITH AUSTRALIA
It is worth mentioning that the Ministry of Supply seeks to organize trade offset with six countries, namely Russia, India, Ukraine, Pakistan, Australia and Sudan as the Sudanese meat will be exchanged for Egyptian goods such as medicines, medical products and rice.
As local output has shot down to 50,000 tons only, Egypt is predicted to export more beans, they said, forecasting that Egyptian importers would contract to bring in around 1 billion US dollars' worth of over 700,000 tons so as to answer the domestic market's needs.
This year's waning beans output is due to poor beans breeds and unfitness of beans farmland, he said.
Through entering the South African market, exporters could, consequently, get access to Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland, which are connected to South Africa with a customs union, it said, pointing out promising future to boost Egyptian exports if there is a serious intention to set up a free trade zone between the two countries.
AN AGREEMENT TO EXPORT EGYPTIAN PRODUCTS TO SUDAN IN RETURN FOR MEAT IMPORTS

A delegation of Iraqi businessmen held talks with 16 Egyptian businessmen on investment chances and reconstruction operations in Iraq.
The meeting between the Egyptian and Iraqi businessmen probed potential cooperation and the importance of opening the Iraqi market before the Egyptian investments and trade in light of Iraq's need to investment and trade in all fields, Bayyoumi said.
He pointed out that the fields tackled on a basis of the Iraqi investors' need included the sectors of oil, hotels, foodstuff industries, banking and mobile phone services, building materials, china ware, cars, feeding industries, transport equipment, tires, garments, textiles, construction, pharmaceutical and detergent industries, household appliances and air conditioners.
In construction sector, for example, the Arab building and construction institutions are capable of rendering competitive services let alone that several Arab institutions that produce building materials are nearer and more capable of reaching the Iraqi market. Some of these institutions exist there like Ceramica Cleopatra Group that can help immediately in Iraqi reconstruction operations.
A report recently submitted by the office to Al-Said Qassim, head of the Commercial Representation Office, said that that plan aims at informing Egyptian exporting companies of the opportunities available in Indian market.

Until 2001, Egypt-Africa trade exchange hit around 560 million U.S. dollars, including 345 million U.S. dollars' worth of Egyptian exports.
Egypt's Africa blueprint is based on penetration into the continent through three divergent geographical areas notably, west, east and south, and development of infrastructure for a greater presence in Africa.
ECONOMIC INDICES IMPROVE
Total Egyptian exports to foreign markets amounted to 8.9 billion pounds during last January and March against 5.3 billion pounds during the same period of 2002. Imports, however, went up to 15 billion pounds against 13.3 billion pounds during the same period last year, the IDSC report said. As for the credit facilities extended by banks other than the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), the report stated that until the end of last March they hiked to 281.6 billion pounds against 262.4 billion pounds in the previous month.
NEW WAVE OF HIGH PRICES
The price per ton hit 12,000 pounds against 9,000 pounds late last December, they added, emphasizing that that would have a negative effect that would lead to increasing the prices of cloth and ready-made garments to more than 60% by the end of the current year.
As regards consumer prices, the report pointed out that furniture, detergents and service prices recorded a 4.7% increase in cities and a 5.9% increase in villages in the same period, while cloth and garments increased by 1.2% in cities and 9% in villages.

LOANS, GRANTS TO EGYPT DURING 10 YEARS WORTH $20 BILLION
The report hailed the volume of American aid granted to Egypt in 2002 hitting 655 million dollars against 615 million dollars in 2003. There are three financing programs with European Union (EU), including the program of backing and developing the private sector at a value of 45 million euros and the program for modernizing industry, 250 million euros.

Cairo Far East Bank board chairman Mona Yassin said that a number of Arab investors were considering buying the bank whose paid capital amounted to LE76 million.

EGYPT'S OIL EXPORTS COME DOWN
It imports palm oil from Malaysia, Indonesia and Kenya, sunflower oil from Argentine, the USA, Ukraine and European countries and cotton oil from Brazil, Argentine, Spain and the USA.
Egypt's exports shot up to 35.2 million US dollars from 9.4 million US dollars. Non-oil exports surged up to 13.6 million US dollars from 9.3 million US dollars in the corresponding period of 2002, he said. Oil exports recorded 21.6 million US dollars.
Egypt was preceded by several developing countries in the development area, which included health, education and income levels, the report said.
Illiteracy is still high at 44 percent; over 56 percent among women, it said.
Efforts should be exerted in order to alleviate sufferings at the economic level. The present-day economic deflation has been triggered by the 1997 Luxor terrorist massacre, the September 11th events and lastly the Iraq war.
Both employees and workers get 157 days off every year after applying the weekly two-day holiday system.
The study conducted by a working team led by economic researcher Dr. Abdel-Khaleq Farouq showed some anomalies.
In the same period the government organizational structures were largely expanded and new organizations were created as the number of sectors hiked from less than 500 to over 2500 on the level of state administrative body, thus increasing the number of general and central administrations to more than 15500 and the sub-administrations to some 75 thousand.
The study uncovered for the first time the volume of the governmental body operation costs, which includes pay, salaries and commodity and service requirements as well as the government's investment uses.
Concerning in-kind resources, the governmental resources include:
Using microfilms also surged up during the 1980s and 1990s.
The costs of these cars hit about 4900 million pounds, while their operation costs exceeded 400 million pounds per annum.
This is so evident in women in particular.
In South Korea, for instance, the worker works for 50 hours a week.
Raising pay in the government is carried out apart from increasing productivity, he said, stressing that the pay increase rate should by no means exceed the rate of productivity increase in order to create a real rise in the standard of living.
Seven years elapsed after this famous summit, which was urged by major world powers to stop violence and terrorism in the Palestinian territories. Violence, however, did not stop in Palestine, but even increased and extended to include all the Palestinian territories and all factions after it was restricted to some areas and certain groups.
The Pentagon hawks, in turn, tried to justify the utter failure to counter terrorism, which reached the US itself, by putting the blame on the Arab allies.
This, in turn, confirmed the US accusations of previous negligence and remissness.
The Arab governments have not practised yet the Israeli methods of mass punishment, siege, and demolition of houses. However, Israel, in turn, does not muzzle opinions or suppress individual freedoms and freedom of organisation.
The number of the regime's victims including those who were killed and arrested is more than the total number of the victims of the Arab regimes put together.
The mother Muslim Brotherhood Movement in Egypt and its branches in Arab countries such as Syria have witnessed political violence incidents for long, but in the end it rejected such violence and focussed on peaceful political action though it was exposed to continuous violence from hostile political forces that took the State agencies as a shield and started to practise political terrorism through them.
The mixture between the political conflict with foes who have legitimate right to run in the political competition and the illegitimate rejection of terrorism is not a monopoly of our judicious Arab governments, but also echoes the tendencies of the large partner in the war on terror, which is the US.
However, there are still enclaves of this phenomenon that can not be eliminated.
What we are witnessing now is unfortunately serious measures to confront the phenomenon of terrorism or even the settlement of old scores under the cover of fighting terrorism.
This means that there are two factors that justified the launching of this project; the first is related to the national security strategy; the second is the war of liberating Iraq.
The main values that are consecrated by this project are market economy values where the interest will be the referentiality according to the U.S. pragmatic values, Torah's values and the partisan rightist extremism which dominates the Sharonite discourse in Israel where they bet on it while mocking the Arab culture and society whether in Palestine or in other Arab countries.
Optional projects However, the Arab countries that are included in the partnership project have plenty of time. President Bush set a ceiling of ten years to have the project implemented. Both of the U.S., the project sponsor, and Israel - the biggest beneficiary -, have two optional projects:
ISRAEL GRIPPED BY HORROR
Meanwhile, Ezz Eddin al-Qassam Brigades fired 12 Qassam 2 rockets at Jewish settlements and Israeli cities within the Green Line, sending Israelis into horror and panic.
Ismail Abu Shanab, a Hamas leader, said such statements would support Sharon in his war on the Palestinian resistance and lead to more escalation that could jeopardize the Middle East peace process.
The plan also provides for targeting Hamas leading figures to compel them to stop their "terrorist" activity or to hide in anticipation of being liquidated.
High-ranking political sources in Tel Aviv ruled out that the international quartet meeting, which would be held in the Jordanian capital of Amman late coming week, would manage to stop the bloodshed. They also cast doubt on the ability of the U.S. coordinators led by John Wolf who is expected to reach the region on Sunday to put the (roadmap) into effect.
JEWS RETURNING TO BAGHDAD FOR FIRST TIME IN HALF A CENTURY
The Jews bought real estate in Palestine Street in Baghdad at double the ordinary prices, which caused a rapid rise in real estate prices in Baghdad.
Gaddafi pointed out that the cancellation of the public sector included petroleum on which Libya's wealth is based. It should , therefore, be property of the society and should be run by companies which are not state-owned. However, those companies' owners will not have to run the companies themselves as they may task any foreign expert to run them to ensure the development of oil industry including prospecting, production and marketing operations.
Half the old members of the board failed to attend the meetings held yesterday (June 12th).
Ibrahim announced setting up an international advisory committee for Ibn Khaldon Center including outstanding international personalities, the majority of whom had adopted views in support of the movement during the trial he underwent in the last three years including representatives from Amnesty International; Human Rights, Watch and others.
6.2 POUNDS DAILY PER CAPITA QUOTA IN NEW BUDGET
Ebeid pinpointed that subsidy amounted to 12 billion pounds, serving 70 million citizens.
The indictment of the lawsuit filed by lawyer Nabih Al-Wahsh was based on the fact that Welch had become ambassador of two countries rather than one country, in contravention to international laws and conventions. He added that Welch's attitudes had made him seem to be Israel's ambassador to Egypt, besides being the head of the American diplomatic mission.
Egyptian companies turned down a U.S. Department of Defense recommendation that Egyptian and Jordanian businesses should join Israeli companies in their Iraq reconstruction tenders.
But, his company turned them down, and asked for an Egyptian-Arab partnership, keeping Israel away. A plan is underway to hammer out reconstruction subcontracts with Jordanian contractors, the unidentified contractor said.
He was supposed to serve an 8-year prison term.
In the meetings, he also emphasized that America's credibility would be undermined in the region as a result of the U.S. administration's double standard policy, and its failure to recognize the repercussions of issues like the Arab-Israeli conflict on democracy in the region, he said.
IKHWAN, HEZBOLLAH PROD PEOPLE INTO BACKING PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE
"The nation, peoples and leaders, should wake up and practically support the Palestinian right so that the enemy should feel that we, Arabs and Muslims, are serious about demanding our rights and land and are willing to make every sacrifice to attain this end," the statement said, concluding, "Come to jihad as a religious duty."
GAMAL MUBARAK IN WASHINGTON ON JUNE 26th
Gamal Mubarak's vistit to Washington this month is considered the second visit paid by the President's son to the American capital.
NDP POLICY SECRETARIAT TO STUDY PRIVATE SECTOR'S PARTICIPATION IN EDUCATION
ADDICTS SPENT 7 TIMES AS MUCH AS SUEZ CANAL REVENUES
According to the sources, the Islamic Group decided to cancel teaching the most important of its books and curricula which used to be the primary cause of incitement of armed orientation inside the community to face the state, its ruling regime and its security bodies. Such a step constitutes an ideological and organizational coup inside the group.
Ismail pointed out that everybody hoped that the successive attempts made by the Islamic Group to convince public opinion of the credibility of its political change would reach solid ground and would not find out that it had lost its entity and Islamic advocacy status.
Will a sectarian division (an imperialist game) work out or turn out to be like what happened in Lebanon which ensued from practices and a reality that relied on the sectarian structure? Has such a sectarian division worked out?
I don't think so because the Egyptians are one integrated mixture.
Let alone the Freedom House group who were granted its prize in return for forged reports about alleged persecution of Copts, not to mention either the so-called religious minorities rights activists who coordinate with the American High Commissioner in implementation of the law on religious persecution by the American Congress which is the current law maker not only in America but in the whole world as well.
Now what does Khalil, the Americanized sectarian say?
More strangely even, he wanted to confine the Coptic history to the Orthodox Christian whether inside or outside Egypt as if that history was a preserve for one category of the Egyptian people to the exclusion of all other categories!
I'd like here to cite an argument by Dr. Ne'mat Ahmed Fouad, a Muslim Egyptian female, "We're Egyptians before and after religions and will remain Egyptians for ever." Magdy Khalil then deals with historical eras when Copts were subjected to persecution trying to project that on the present reality.
The evidence is quite clear when we know that 30% of Egypt's economy is possessed by Copts some of whom are consequently in control of sovereign decisions.
He argues that due to that nationalist feeling, the Christians in America did not join the Intelligence bodies in return for abandoning the Egyptian nationality branding only Muslim immigrants of that charge for which we feel obliged to thank him as he clearly showed American racist democracy that recruit American citizens in return for their relinquishing their original nationalities. However, he failed to mention the real reason which lies in America's treatment of all Muslims after the September incidents.
What would then be the reactions of the Egyptians to such intervention? Whether through the Muslims feeling of American tyranny and repression against them and in favour of the Copts or the Christians' feeling of aggrandizement and acceptance of American intervention?
Egyptian Wafdite MP Mohamed Abdel Alim asked the Ministry of Petroleum to immediately square up to Israeli attempts to prospect for oil in " Umm Rishrash" city, the Egyptian name for the Israeli port of Ielat, on the Egyptian-Palestinian frontiers and compel Israel to back off.
The Muslim Brotherhood group escalated its media drive against the Egyptian government and chose this time the US-Egyptian official relations as the topic of criticism.
However, he launched a diatribe against Sharm El-Sheikh and Aqaba peace summits, calling on peoples to intensify pressure on rulers to push them into reform.
He also called for reordering the collective Arab order through adopting an Arab-Muslim policy and rendering effective common defense agreements and economic unity, saying, "If peoples have declared on more than one occasion their bias towards the Iraqi and Palestinian causes and all Islamic issues and contributed a lot to these causes, they should exercise great pressure on rulers to push them into reform of policies".
In fact, if we review the influence of this chamber, we will find out that Mohamed Mansour or Mansour Chevrolet, his nickname in trade circles, did not mention that a big number of this chamber's members are concentrated in the NDP Policy Committee headed by Gamal Mubarak.
To show the influence of the chamber, Mansour said that the chamber members met a number of senior officials in Egypt prior to visiting Washington - Premier Dr. Atef Ebeid, Presidential Political Advisor, Osama Al-Baz, Minsiter of the Interior, Habib Al-Adli.
PALESTINIANS VISIT AUSCHWITZ TO UNDERSTAND JEWRY'S PAINS!
On the timing of the visit, the father Emile Shovani from Nasserah told Al-Majalla weekly "We started to plan for this visit last fall following the release of my French book 'Waiting for Peace'.

Such failure and embarrassment on the part of the American policy in running Iraq have become apparent in the failure to make progress at the level of filling in administrative and security vacuum following unseating the regime. Hardly had the temporary transitional administration appointed by Washington completed a month when the new administration took over after Garner failed to secure an Iraqi cover for the American occupation even though he had held two opposition conferences in Nassiryah and Baghdad.

This may give an impression that such a change is an exceptional one that deserves a so much contemplation, which is the reverse of common practice in other countries to the contrary of the nature of changes that should be introduced to bodies other than the banking system.

A few days ago, he visited Beni Hassan clans, Arab Shiite clans spreading in Central Euphrates district from Al Hillah to Babylon and Najaf.
The reply to such an offer did surprise him, however. The clan chief told him politely and diplomatically that his demand was rather difficult to meet!
He went on saying, "The only chance left to you in order to meet your demand is to let us marry girls or women from your family."
Protests against the state of lawlessness and absence of stability and order are also a kind of resistance.
Regarded as a precedent in international relations, war was waged against Iraq without UN Security Council's consent, thus making the case liable to power politics.
The question is now: what then?
However, an end to that tragedy is not likely in the foreseeable future.
Forefront among the countries to be subverted is Pakistan as it is a nuclear country, Iran, then Indonesia and Malaysia, which are all countries targeted by Israel on a daily basis taking advantage in that of its long honeymoon with the USA. How may Israel contain Pakistan? Many of such containment aspects are quite obvious.
Israel has five goals in Pakistan: firstly; destabilizing the Islamic world backing the Palestinian cause after Israel managed to neutralize the Arab world. Secondly; setting up a Pakistani-Israeli,-Indian,-American alliance on a common base in the service of an enormous margin of new interests which are mostly American, Israeli and then Indian, which is containing the Kashmiri cause, taming and developing the Pakistani society just like the plans set for developing the Arab world.
Israel has done very well in that regard, while Iran has become alone in the field, which is very much unlike its experience during the Iranian-Iraqi war when it held ground and repelled the Iraqi aggression for 8 years.
Targeting Pakistan is part of a big scheme to target the Islamic and Arab worlds, resolve the Pakistani cause in the way most satisfactory to Israel.
Some people may agree: does Israel need such diplomatic relations to implement its scheme given the tools of action in Pakistan through the USA?

Egypt thinks that what Israel has done so far regarding the implementation of the "road map" cannot be sufficient and cannot prove that Ariel Sharon's government responds adequately to the big turn in the Palestinian position.
The Egyptian source showed great indignation about the Israeli stance, regarding it as prejudicing the Egyptian leadership which made great efforts to achieve the truce agreement and persuade the Palestinians of all groups to abide by it.

AN EGYPTIAN CLAIMS TO KNOW SADDAM'S WHEREABOUTS!
NEW CRISIS BETWEEN AL-AZHAR AND MINISTRY OF CULTURE
Deputy head of the Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs Dr Abdel-Sabbour Marzouq held several consultations with Islamic Research Academy members and a number of thinkers, including Dr Mohamed Omara, Dr Ahmed Kamal Abul-Magd, Dr Mostafa Al-Shak'ah and counselor Tarek Al-Beshri, with the aim of forming a front reply to the lies of the participants forefront of whom are Ahmed Abdel-Mo'ti Hegazi, Gamal Al-Banaa, Syrian poet Adonis, Dr Hassan Hanafi and Dr Haider Ibrahim, professor of philosophy in Khartoum University.
"The focus will be on the traditional crafts that can be exported. This requires developing the final product to be able to compete and considering availing ourselves of foreign grants to help finance the establishment of the proposed city," he said.
Egyptian economy has been stagnant for more than three years. Both internal and external circumstances have been biased against it and are about to throttle it to death.
The market in Egypt is backward and suffers from countless weak points as active capitalists don't really exist. Businessmen on the Egyptian market are completely different from businessmen in capitalist countries.
He said the role of planning in bringing about social changes had been limited since the start of the sixties. Its limitedness increased with the open door policy.
Dr Ibtissam Al-Jaafarawi, expert with the Egyptian National Center for Sociological and Criminological Research said, "Lack of organized planning pushing forward the social change process affected the employment of labour as well. With the transfer to state administration, economic planning and the start of Egyptianizing foreigners' property and nationalization which targeted national capitalism, the state bureaucratic class was formed and the capitalist class and the private sector started wearing out and the state became the mastermind of everything in planning."
They are the collapse of the communist block and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait as well as the first Gulf war. A big percentage of Egyptian labour returned from Arab countries due to the shrinkage of the volume of foreign demand for Egyptian labour. The returnees started searching for jobs, thus affecting the agricultural labour sector as it is one of the workforce sectors that contribute to the absorption of about 17 million souls according to 1996 census.
Both employees and workers get 157 days off every year after applying the weekly two-day holiday system.
The study conducted by a working team led by economic researcher Dr. Abdel-Khaleq Farouq showed some anomalies.
In the same period the government organizational structures were largely expanded and new organizations were created as the number of sectors hiked from less than 500 to over 2500 on the level of state administrative body, thus increasing the number of general and central administrations to more than 15500 and the sub-administrations to some 75 thousand.
The study uncovered for the first time the volume of the governmental body operation costs, which includes pay, salaries and commodity and service requirements as well as the government's investment uses.
Concerning in-kind resources, the governmental resources include:
Using microfilms also surged up during the 1980s and 1990s.
The costs of these cars hit about 4900 million pounds, while their operation costs exceeded 400 million pounds per annum.
This is so evident in women in particular.
In South Korea, for instance, the worker works for 50 hours a week.
Raising pay in the government is carried out apart from increasing productivity, he said, stressing that the pay increase rate should by no means exceed the rate of productivity increase in order to create a real rise in the standard of living.
Hudhaibi launched sharp criticism against the "Roadmap" plan as it, according to him, carried only illusion to the Palestinian people.
The cause of extremism and terrorism has hung like a sword of Damocles over anybody who tries to unite Muslims and make them return to God Almighty, does well or advocate resisting injustice and oppression. No wonder, then, that the charge of Islamic extremism and terrorism has become a common brand against Islam and Muslims everywhere. Anything that would displease the Zionists or the American Administration would also be hung on the peg of terrorism and extremism.
"The Jamaa Islamia's peaceful shift was based on Islamic principles and approved by all the group's leaders and elements including Dr. Omar Abdel-Rahman who is serving a life sentence in an American prison," said Mahmoud Sho'aib who was released last year after he was detained for years in Egypt.
President Hosni Mubarak is expected to make a decree within a few days' time on forming the first national human rights council in the country pursuant to a recent law passed by the parliament before its session came to a close last month, Egyptian sources were quoted as saying.
The presidency has already received lists of nominations from several departments, with around 150 candidates, among whom only 27 figures are to be chosen, having been nominated so far, an well-informed source told Asharq Al-Awsat.
Yesterday, in a meeting with Al-Ahram editorial staff, chief of Press syndicate Ibrahim Nafi'e who doubles as board chairman and editor-in-chief of Al-Ahram newspaper, announced the nomination of Salah Montaser as chief of journalists in the Press Syndicate coming election. This nomination is considered a clear governmental nomination.
"It is expected that the list of nominees for the membership of the syndicate board will be reviewed on the grounds that Nafi'e will not contest the coming election, taking into consideration the presence of an influential lobby inside the council, something which may make some members withdraw from nominating themselves after opening the door for nomination after the judicial committee supervising election have finished reviewing the candidature roll, the sources added.
The deal is intended to qualify women to have a political role, boost the NCW's capabilities and buttress the NCW's technical secretariat through training and promoting the management program and stepping up women's political participation activities.
EGYPTIAN ENGINEERS DEMAND RECEIVERSHIP ON THEIR SYNDICATE BE LIFTED
However, no decision was issued so far, he said, adding, "We are ready to accept any council apart from any political trend, but it seems that there is fear from bringing to book members of the general assembly of the receivership committee, which took over the syndicate management during the last 8 years."
EGYPT HAS 14 MILLION POOR PEOPLE
Norway came first in the report, followed by Iceland, Sweden, Australia, the Netherlands, Belgium and the USA, while Sierra Leone, Niger and Burkina Faso were at the bottom.
Egypt has between 13 and 14 million poor people, reaching 20 percent of the country's population. There are notable imbalances in development levels between north and south Egypt, and even between townships and villages in the same governorate, the report showed.
The Egyptian delegation attending Paris meetings of the UNESCO's International Heritage Committee foiled an attempt by the Israeli government to pass the " Great Ridge" project submitted by the Israeli delegate to these meetings. The new project, as propagated by Israel, aims at setting up archeological partnership with the countries located in East Africa and the Red Sea.
ISRAEL MAY RELEASE LARGER NUMBER OF DETAINEES IF USA, EGYPT RELEASED ISRAELI SPIES
Cairo informed Tel Aviv secretly of its intention to nominate a new ambassador in Israel on the heels of the "revival" of the political march between Israel and the Palestinians on condition that this march should forge ahead, Israeli Maariv newspaper reported on Tuesday. For its part, Jordan intends to take a similar step provided that the two countries (Egypt and Jordan) should set a date for returning their ambassadors to Tel Aviv after they had been recalled over two years before in protest against the Israeli war on the Palestinians, the paper added.
Interestingly, more than one international envoy who visited Lebanon recently broached the water issue, and unexpectedly so.
Sources close to Prime Minister Hariri believe that the head of the Lebanese Government also told Issa that Lebanon wanted to get back some of its expatriates living abroad, which would mean that future water utilization plans should take into consideration the distribution of water to eight million Lebanese, not just the four million who lived on Lebanese soil at present.
During the Basel Conference, Theodor Herzl described the Litani River as Israel's spirit that dwelt in the north.
Israel is seeking these days to transport the Tigris and the Euphrates water to it. It is holding consultation with the Jordanian party to let the water pass across Jordanian territories in a bid to find a way out of its water dearth crisis from which it has been suffering for years.
He went on to say, "We would not let a single drop of water be transported outside the Nile basin or outside Iraq as that is a definitely resolved matter that can not be subject to any negotiations.
Sheikh Yassin affirmed that Hamas leaders probed with the Egyptian delegation the Israeli violations and aggression as well as Israel's stance towards the issue of POWs.

GAZA: CAMPAIGN FOR REMOVING GRAFFITI
Painting operations, which are expected to include cities in the West Bank later on, signal the end of the uprising at least on part of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
U.S. AMBASSADOR IN RIYADH: "WE'VE DECIDED TO APPOINT PRINCE ABDULLAH AS KING"
At that time, Gordon exploded another thunderous "bomb" when he said, "The crown prince will not be from the first generation of the royal family but rather from the second one.
The same source added that when Prince Abdullah was informed by one of his close friends of Gordon's words he said, "Nonsense," as if the whole matter does not concern him altogether.
It is noteworthy that many sons of late King Abdel-Aziz, such as princes Nayef, Minister of the Interior; Salman, Riyadh Governor and Nawwaf, Chief of the Intelligence, vie for this position, i.e. the third man.
In the Saudi forums, another theory is being circulated to the effect that in case of excluding Prince Sultan from being crown prince, one of his sons may be nominated for this position.
The list of candidates is still open. The urgent question now is whether the U.S. ambassador's "bombs" are slips of the tongue or they are meant to test reactions or they are intended leakage for the expected American changes in Abdel-Aziz's kingdom.
On the other hand, Reading For All supervisor and head of General Egyptian Book Organization (GEBO) Dr. Samir Sarhan termed this accusation as silly and untrue.
In an urgent inquiry to Premier Atef Ebeid, Qoaita said, "The US is planning to create a new generation to discharge the responsibility of managing and ruling Egypt in the coming stage in the American style." As a proof for that he mentioned the class of administrative leaders who graduated mid-last month from Management Development Center for Industry (MDCI) affiliated to the Public Enterprise Sector Ministry. Dr. Ebeid declared that those graduates will occupy the positions of deputy ministers, each in his respective sector and that the US had supervised their training.
He went on to say that the USAID only financed the programme for training 60,000 Egyptians since 1997 through workshops or advanced scientific degrees in business, economic and educational development, environment and public health. The USAID also allocated 190 million dollars for training till the end of this year.
Minister of Information Safwat Al-Sherif talked about the subject of political reform, confirming that Egypt has made progress in it. He pointed out the establishment of a national council for human rights, noting that the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) is open up to everyone and it believes in democracy and political plurality.
In statements aired by the official TV, Presidential political advisor Osama Al-Baz tackled the nature of the tour made by an Egyptian high-level delegation to Europe and US last weak. The delegation included Gamal Mubarak and a number of officials, public figures, businessmen and intellectuals.
Al-Baz opined that the participation of politicians, parliamentarians, journalists and businessmen in the Egyptian delegation that visited the US lately copes with the nature of the multi-sided American society.
Salama Ahmad Salama wrote: American pressure has recently succeeded in making Egypt sign a bilateral agreement by which Americans will be exempted from trial by the International Criminal Court.
Egypts pussyfooting attitude became apparent when the Government failed to submit the agreement to the Peoples Assembly. The reasons for the Egyptian silence defied comprehension, but only until the US State Department recently announced that Egypt had joined 42 countries in signing the bilateral agreement that protects Americans against prosecution.
But the issue here is not what American soldiers may or may not commit on Egypts soil; what we have here is a system of international justice that Egypt was one of the first countries to advocate and seek to realize, particularly in light of the Israeli crimes against humanity, particularly Arab peoples.
Nobody knows, and nobody is saying!
In spite of the retreat of the poverty rate, economic sluggishness, which prevailed in Egypt after 2000, returned many Egyptians to the poverty circle again.
INVESTIGATION INTO A WHITE CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE FOUND IN AMERICAN CULTURAL CENTER
Spokesman for the American embassy in Cairo said that the American Cultural Center in Alexandria was evacuated two days ago (1st July) following suspicions of the existence of a chemical substance.

Such efforts are in their first stage, they said, pointing out that the Egyptian authorities are reviewing their names to verify their real identities and compare information about them with the files of the fundamentalists who are on the run abroad.
EGYPTIAN CAMPAIGN TO CORRECT YOUTH'S FAULTY CONCEPTS!
STOCK EXCHANGE FOR FOOTBALLERS!
This was due to the emergence of the fabulous rise in footballers prices as a result of clubs struggle and speculations and to put an end to some players practices in manipulating clubs in a bid to raise their prices. This is also meant to put an end to vying for contracting with foreign coaches, which drains enormous sums of foreign exchange.
They unveiled that Barzani, the strongest leader of the Kurds, has asked for Israels assistance against the former regime. They added that he asked Israel to let its officers remain in North Iraq although the war against the former Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein came to an end.
Meanwhile, he added, delegations are currently paying intensive visits to Baghdad and North Iraq to meet with oppositionists of the former president Saddam Hussein and with Kurdish factions at North Iraq.
Al-Aqsa Mosque Director Sheikh, Mohamed Hussein described the recent secret visits as rejected piracy, defiance of Islamic Wakfs and prejudicing Muslims feelings.
Hamas called on the Palestinian people especially in Jerusalem to abort such a Zionist step and to practically prevent it.
Adnan Ahmed Asfour, a Palestinian who holds an Iraqi travel document and has resided in the camp since last April 7, was quoted as saying, The American embassy offered the camp's residents, 1050 in number, a proposal to return to Iraq, pointing out that the Kuwaiti and Qatari governments showed their willingness to build houses for the Palestinians in Iraq and compensate them in return for their return.
Giovanni noted that the number of Catholics in Saudi Arabia hits 700,000, mostly Filipinos. The number of Catholics in the Gulf Region exceeds one million.
YEMENI ISLAH SECRETARY GENERAL: DISCORD WITH OTHER PARTIES ON MEANS NOT ENDS
The interview runs as follows: Q: Is Islah a party for fundamentalists in Yemen?
We preceded the GPC in the political arena and, moreover, contributed to its formation and participated in the formulation of its political program or the document that has been known later as the National Charter.
A: There is no doubt that 11 September is one of the historic turning points in our modern life as it turned the relations between the Islamic world and the West into a crystal clear state of deadlock.
A: The problem of some Islamic movements is that they dont live their reality and their ambitions dont match their potential.
A: On the contrary, we dont hide these ambitions, but we say that they are existent in our community under the constitution and the laws.
The constitutional and legal position in our country made all people live in one frame disagreeing with each other on means rather than ends.
For instance, the US dollar in 1995 equaled 13 Yemeni riyals but now it equals about 183.5 riyals.
In return, there are three acknowledged resources in Yemen, the first of which is oil, which is sold for 10 dollars per barrel. The government budget is presented to the parliament at this price, but the real price declared in overseas markets ranges between 28 and 30 dollars per barrel, i.e. a differential of 18 dollars which can achieve something.
How can we return the zakat funds into a means that enriches the poor so that they could give zakat instead of receiving it?
Our brethren in Turkey rule their country according to the positivist law of the country rather than the Islamic Sharia. However, by reaching such an echelon they would accomplish their aims through peaceful struggle, patience, wisdom and taking the line of call for Allah the Almighty and without any speculation.
Secondly, when Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) immigrated to Medina he assigned his son-in-law Ali bin Abi-Talib a certain task, namely returning deposits to their owners.
We also have constant relations with a lot of democratic organizations and bodies in the United States, foremost of which is the US Democratic Party. We maintain our ties with American politicians visiting Yemen.
Yemen is not a haven for terrorism. Actually there are some extremist elements, but only on the individual level, whereas the Yemeni people and political forces despise terrorism thanks to their formation, nature, history and belief.
Therefore, it is not confined to certain bodies. We should also confess that shura (advice) disappeared for hundreds of years in the Islamic rule, thus allowing the emergence of despotism and totalitarianism in the Islamic world.
Shura in our party has always been binding even in the stage of our clandestine activity. This is applicable to our internal institutions like the General Congress, Shura Council and General Secretariat.
The second aspect of the statement is that it pulled the rug from under the feet of the American accusations out of jurisprudential position.
To obtain a comment on Minister Kharazi's stand of prohibiting the possession of nuclear weapons, Al-Majalla made the following interview with Ayatollah Abbas Al-Kaabi, member of the Iranian Command Experts Council and professor of international law at Tehran University and Qom's hauzas (seminaries in Shiite law college):
A- If a Muslim country signed such a treaty, it would by no means be permissible to resort to such weapons out of fulfillment of covenants, which is a holy thing in Islam.
Q- Why does your country, then, refuse to sign the additional protocol of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) treaty?
Actually, we don't seek to possess weapons of mass destruction. Our defensive strategy is not based on such kind of armament.
Despite the official assurances made by the Pakistani government concerning the continuation of its nuclear project, which is considered the strategic weapon to face India, which possesses a nuclear weapon and threatens Pakistan with it.
However, the Pakistani nuclear weapon is considered a means of deterrence to forestall others from using it against our country," he said. He pointed out his Group's stand, which calls for disarming the weapons of mass destruction all over the world although India and the U.S. disagree, let alone Israel that possesses more than two hundreds nuclear warheads. "All countries should relinquish such destructive weapons. But, it is not justice for a powerful country such as the U.S. to possess nuclear weapons and deny other countries the right to possess them," he indicated.
SHEIKH ABDULLAH BIN BEYYAH: ACQUISITION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IMPERMISSIBLE IF LEADS TO HARM
Rulers should ponder on that matter according to the balance of interest and evil because they need to strike a balance with the other who is not always trusted.
Sheikh Beyyah pointed out that the nuclear weapon is destructive and has, undoubtedly, illegal aspects.
The Islamic point of view concerning the issue of acquiring a nuclear bomb is currently discussed. Some Islamic scholars rendered it permissible, while others considered it a religious duty in case the enemy possesses the same weapon. In statements to Al-Majalla, Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar Dr. Mohamed Sayed Tantawi warned Islamic countries against the acquisition of nuclear weapons at present due to the international circumstances, which are not in favour of Arab peoples or regimes.
KUWAITI BUDGET: $9-BILLION DEFICIT
KUWAIT TO CLOSE SEA BORDERS FILE WITH IRAN
SALAFI MOVEMENT IN KUWAIT DEMANDS TO DRIVE OUT FOREIGN FORCES
The movement called for separating the crown prince position from the premiership and the adoption of the principle of political plurality and the Kuwaiti people's right to participate in choosing its government through tasking the majority bloc in the National Assembly to form the government.
They also uncovered the Syrian political leadership's intention to choose the best and the most qualified among citizens and on equal bases regardless of their political orientations.
We hope that our production will hike by 100,000 barrels daily," he told Asharq Al-Awsat.
The reason for the confrontation, this time, was neither anti-terrorism or anti-Taliban remnants war in Afghanistan nor the relations with Washington, but rather Musharraf's insistence on considering the recognition of Israel.
This coincided with an opinion poll held by the station where pros and cons equally regarding reconsidering the Pakistani policy towards the Hebrew state.
A few days ago, Pakistani mass media quoted reports by high-ranking sources to the effect that Islamabad might establish political relations with Israel whose ambassador to the European Union said that, "Pakistan is a keynote player in the Islamic world and therefore a hostile policy towards it would be out of place".
They added that it is not feasible to compete with Arab news channels such as Al-Jazeera, Al-Arabia and Abu Dhabi, which attract a large category of Arab viewers.
INTELLIGENCE CHIEF IN RAMALLAH TO SETTLE ROW BETWEEN ARAFAT AND ABU-MAZEN
Sulaiman will also meet with Abu-Mazen to persuade him to backtrack on his resignation from the Central Committee of Fatah.
Well-informed sources said Washington seeks to get Egypt's approval of the council as a prelude to persuading other countries to accredit ambassadors representing Iraq. Washington also aims to alleviate the Egyptian official tone, which insists that dealing with Baghdad will be only through the elected government.
Reuters noted that UN envoy to Iraq would pay a visit on Saturday to Saudi Arabia and would meet with Saudi Crown Prince and Deputy Premier Prince Abdullah bin Abdel-Aziz to mull over Iraq's political future. Reuters quoted UN sources as saying that the UN envoy would visit other neighbouring countries for the same purpose. This international move comes at a time when the US administration of Iraq gets ready to announce the "governing council", which is expected to enjoy some executive competence.
In urgent interpellations, 10 deputies asked not to allow Israel to search for its MIAs' corpses in Egypt's Sinai and to officially inform Israel of that rejection as a practical reply to Israeli refusal to settle the file of the Egyptian POW's who had been killed by its soldiers and the Israeli failure to abide by financial compensation demands and to apologize to the Egyptian people.

The outcome of the meeting will be referred to the Cabinet for approval.
As there has been much talk about the future of ruling in Egypt, especially under the onslaught by the Al-Arabi newspaper, mouthpiece of the opposition Nasserite party against what it called "grooming Gamal Mubarak (President Mubarak's son) to take his father's place," political circles in Cairo were taken aback by an unprecedented lawsuit against President Mubarak's reluctance to appoint a vice-president since he took over in 1981. The case is expected to be heard on July 29.
The legal action was lodged with the vice-chairman of the State Council and president of the Administrative Judiciary Court. Asked if the lawsuit can be accepted, he said, "I expect it to be turned down, as it is filed by a person of no capacity or interest. But, such an argument can be rebutted by saying that I am an Egyptian citizen and I want to live safely in my country, and defend its stability.
The fresh parliamentary election bill is being prepared, well-informed sources in the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) said.
The newspaper devotes a big number of its articles to criticizing Gamal Mubarak's visit to Washington. For instance, under the abovementioned headline, it published a feature on page 9, which ran to the following effect only in part:
Al-Sawi wondered how a person who advocated the reduction of free education ceiling could possibly express the ambitions of youth or new generations who were deprived of job opportunities. Gamal Mubarak may well represent a particular bracket in society or might represent himself, but nobody can confirm that he represents an entire generation.
He added that even though Gamal Mubarak's orientations were liberal they belong to that old liberalism rather than the new one that would enhance the social role of the state.
His experience in public career was confined to his work in Bank of America (in London), which was not a political action, which makes us apparently before a case of preparation for bequeathing power. Those who have been talking in the name of reform and the new generation took more interest in the USA demands.
None of such options have taken place in Gamal Mubarak's case and therefore any such allegation would be groundless.
Dr. Al-Eryan, however, does not think too much of anybody's statements or orientations as he believes that it is necessary to continue demanding an all-out reform in all spheres. This can only be achieved through releasing freedoms that would place Egypt in its pioneering status.
There are also other new ideas, in the forefront of which are solving the problems of youth such as housing.
Ambassador Amin Yusri conveyed a message to Gamal Mubarak excerpts of which run to the following effect:
Not every citizen has your advantages being the son of the current President of the Republic.
This is particularly a violation of article 138 of the Constitution, which authorizes the President alone or together with the cabinet to draw up the general policy of the state.
Thirdly: One more thing remains, namely, your visit to Washington twice in less than 6 months.
We wished and still wish that you would give the internal and Arab dimensions a bigger emphasis than the external dimension.
We all hope as citizens that we will not see as head of our state an Egyptian Bremer like the American Bremer sent by Washington to rule an Arab country whose Arabism is well established and deeply rooted!
Western diplomatic sources closely related to Israeli ambassador in Cairo Gadoun Bin Ami said that the Egyptian authorities would allow a doctor to be delegated by the Israeli government by the end of this week to subject Azzam to urgent medical check-ups after he had some health problems recently.
On the other hand, an Egyptian Foreign Ministry official told Asharq Al-Awsat that his country was not likely to respond to a mediation offer to return the recalled Egyptian ambassador to Israel as such a return was linked to the Egyptian people's supreme interests and had nothing whatsoever to do with any foreign body no matter how close their relations or friendship with Egypt were.
Believe it or not, Egyptians spend annually LE10 billion on fortune-telling, undoing charms and treatment from jinn! The sum is double the American aid annually received from the USA, bigger than the Suez Canal revenues and higher than Egyptian tourism returns, more than double the volume of Egyptian exports but much less than the value of drug trafficking.
Beans-producing and importing countries are reflecting on a fresh beans quotation for Egyptian importers.

The contract was formulated to achieve the strategic aims of Hermes and the CIIC. It also led Hermes to come to the fore in running assets and added to it further assets exceeding 350 million dollars distributed to a lot of investments in Egypt and the Middle East. Thus, Hermes will become one of the biggest direct investment companies in the Arab world and the Middle East.
Talks between the government and the World Bank (WB) failed to reach an agreement on the one-billion-dollar loan the government seeks to obtain from the WB.
The government asserted that privatizing banks' administrations, changing their leaderships and achieving their independence are enough measures to square up to any corruption cases and empower the new administrations to be flexible and make decisions.
A new list of prices has been set by broad beans producing and exporting countries to Egypt. Broad beans exporters in China, France, England, Australia and Canada agreed to re-price broad beans exported to Egypt.
A report issued by the Economic Researches Center at the Chambers of Commerce declared that the most important problems that face the timber market are the decline of international timber supply and imported quantities, the rise in international prices of timber, something which leads to increase of imports and freight cost in addition to the rise in import costs which reflected on prices on the local market.
The Swedish timber topped the list of imports as it represented 62% of wood imports last year against 56% in 1999. Beech ranked second in the list of wood imports as its imports reached 15.7% in 2002 versus 11.5% in 1999.

Amid this controversy the chronic crisis of exportation has been forgotten in spite of consecutive government's confirmations of increasing exports since the 1980s. These confirmations, unfortunately, were to no avail as exports and imports have remained stable at 5.7 billion dollars and 17.5 billion dollars respectively.
Experts and bankers unanimously agreed that trade balance has been affected by the decree of exchange rate deregulation on 29th January last, which led to the devaluation of the Egyptian pound before the dollar (the currency of trade exchange) by 86 piasters at one go.

A gynaecologist at Al-Azhar University, Dr. Gamal Abul-Sorour ascribes the high rate of twins cases to three reasons, first is the increase in the rate of pregnancy in later years due to delay of marriage because of economic conditions.

CITIZENS NOT SUBJECTS!
Such a prevaricating political discourse that draws an analogy between despotism and both patriotism and stability simply mixes cards and turns the country from a project formulated by various groups and categories into a field exclusively owned by the NDP, its dignitaries and ministers!

Interference, by any means, will have negative impacts because such mechanisms are only temporary solutions to a big problem that cannot be overcome unless there is a dollar surplus that can restore rates of exchange to the aspired after balance, economist Dr. Mohsen Al-Khodairi said.
The interference of the CBE to rectify the track of the exchange market and monitor the activities of banks and exchange firms is not an invented method nor can it be considered backtracking on the liberalization of the rate of exchange system, especially as this interference forestalls speculations by some banks in the dollar surpluses they achieve and contributes to an increase in covering the documentary credits of importers.

The sources regarded the Ministry of Foreign Trade task to restore confidence in Egyptian meat as difficult as it would need enormous efforts to persuade importing countries that Egypt was free of epidemics in case of international certificates being issued to that effect.

The companies board chairman criticized the government inability to protect the enterprise sector or provide the hard currency required for supplying raw materials to several companies which export their products.
Minister of Foreign Trade, Dr. Youssef Botros Ghali decreed that dumping duties be imposed on Egypt's imports of Turkish reinforcing iron bars.

The Egyptian Foreign Trade Ministry expressed reservations about the Saudi decision of imposing a temporary ban on sheep and deer exports from Egypt. It affirmed that the international organizations specialized in that field didn't issue any epidemic reports on the Rift Valley fever including Egypt and that the Egyptian sheep and deer are completely free of any epidemics and don't suffer the Rift Valley fever.
Abul-Qumsan pointed out that contacts are underway with the Saudi authorities to explain the situation and get acquainted with the reasons why it took such a decision, particularly as the international organization specialized in that field in Paris didn't issue any report on the Rift Valley fever in Egypt. He explained that such a decision would not affect the distinguished economic and commercial ties between the two countries. He considered that decision as a temporary one that the Saudi side would backtrack on once it is assured of the soundness of Egyptian exports of red meat, sheep and deer.
A number of businessmen working in the sectors of industry, construction and tourism expressed their optimism regarding the economic activity in the second half of the current year.

They, further, called for focusing on increasing exports and attracting direct foreign investments through taking many measures such as allowing the pound to move more freely and decreasing the amount of customs protection as well as achieving tangible progress in privatization programme.
The slight increase in production is attributed to the increase of exports and return of tourism to its normal rates after the war on Iraq. They also attributed the fall of local sales and employment to many reasons including the obstacles that face companies and banks, interest rate influence and low level of confidence.

We, frankly, are Sami's group. We came here to take part in parties for the soldiers and spend the night here. In the morning, Sami comes to give us our dues in full, but he is late today. He is head of a ring of women who procure beautiful girls from markets or the universities secretly rather than the way we have been brought here."

JORDAN'S PREMIER SHRUGS OFF ISLAMISTS' DEMANDS IN HIS CABINET MAKEUP
Abul-Ragheb, who will also act as Minister of Defence, has selected two deputy premiers; Former minister of Justice Faris al-Nabulsi and former Minister of Economy Mohamed al-Halayka, a key architect of economic reform who is on good terms with the World Bank. Minister of Finance Michael Martu, Minister of Planning Basem Awadullah, Minister of Energy Mohamed al-Batayna, State Minister Marwan Al-Maashar and Minister of Foreign Affairs Shaher Bac have retained their portfolios in the shakeup.
With the 17-member opposition Islamic bloc in the parliament insisting on denying the new cabinet a vote of confidence, Abul-Ragheb has kept Minister of Municipal Affairs Abdel-Razek Tobaishat in his position, turning a deaf ear to Islamists' call to give him the axe as he was the main person to blame for the enactment of the temporary municipality law, which gives the government the right to appoint 50 percent of municipality members.
The committee will raise the issue of the Jordanian detainees in Israel in the parliament in an effort to make the government take strict positions against Israel to release them especially as they include detainees who have been in confinement for long years, a thing that would make them suffer from chronic diseases, said deputy Abu-Sokkar who is also the first assistant of the parliament speaker.
He pointed out anticipations of transporting negotiations from Kenya to the USA.
Such a capital would not be regarded one of the 26 Sudanese provinces and would be subjected to the National Assembly's (parliament) administration. A special police force would be formed there to hold the responsibility for the enforcement of the law there.
The government, on the other hand, rejects the whole idea and regards the capital issue as already dealt with within the framework of Machacos protocol signed by both parties one year ago.
A number of Arab officials from both the public and the private sectors held a workshop in Amman a few days ago over the deregulation of the railway transport services trade in the Arab World. They discussed the mechanisms of linking the Arab World with an integrated railway network.
The network also covers Iraq, the east of the Mediterranean, the center of Syria, the west of Iraq and Jordan and the southern Coast of the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile Delta across Moan, Al-Ferdan, Safaga, Al-Kharga, Al-Gubail, Jeddah and Doha and finally the axis of the south of the Arabian Peninsula.
The crucial point of this issue, which pushed security bodies to interfere and send this memo is that the governor's external relations have gone to extremes to the detriment of the state's security.
The second story is being publicly circulated by the regime's newspapers and mass media by day and at night. They say that the authorities have arrested 39 civil servants working in the Agricultural Directorate in Idlib Governorate on charges of corruption, receiving bribes, issuing forged invoices, distributing expired agricultural products and being negligent in their work duties, according to official Teshrin newspaper.
Both secret and public stories sum up the Syrian question in the third anniversary of Bashar Al-Assad reign after artificial rigged elections, preceded by the farce of amending the constitution (which was laid down by Hafez Al-Assad himself) in a way that seems suitable for the illegal age of the son who will succeed his father and in a way that turned the Syrian regime into a hereditary republic or dictatorship.
The killer went unpunished. Corruption the mafia way coloured the last two years of Bashar Al-Assad's reign and it seems likely to colour the coming era.
The second reason is that the young president is lacking in the human experience which urged most world countries constitutions to stipulate that the candidate for the presidency should be over forty years old.
The catastrophe is that if Bashar Al-Assad wanted to rule with a new team and different approach, he would have to practically form counter-networks that outweigh the other networks. This will put him in an expected confrontation - may be permanently - with the old guards who have not died yet.
The fourth and most important reason, "the mother of reasons," is that the regime is structurally unable to make a reform or an essential change because its structure is too solid and inflexible to bear the shock of changes. It repeats itself and stems the causes of survival from the same causes that are totally contrary to the concepts of democracy, partisan multiplicity, respect of freedoms and human rights.
The farce reached its climax when it was said that the decree implied the release of Riyadh Al-Turk (who was released more than eight months ago).
Yesterday (21st July), American Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfwitz and Iraqi Kurdish officials said that the USA sought to conclude a common defense treaty with the coming Iraqi government.
He did not rule out the possibility of Arab countries sending forces to Iraq under a Security Council resolution.
JORDAN TO SET UP FIRST AIRCRAFT PLANT IN THE REGION
All the privileges that could be obtained by the investor in case the plant area is considered a free economic zone were explained. Indeed, the area near Queen Aliaa Airport was allocated for the new airport. Approval of the Civil Aviation Authority as well as permission of the Free Zones Authority was obtained.
The rest of the story says that the young president remained silent for a short time and said that this governor in particular was favoured by "his father's will" and that he would not offend that will by any means.
Tens of similar stories are circulated among Syrian citizens from time to time. They are meant to draw the citizens' attention away from other secret stories.
In Syria nowadays, there is a handful of gangs, who personify the "will of the father" according to Al-Assad junior, who are less than ten in number. Their number, together with their sons, may reach thirty at most. They are simply the army of the Syrian mafia.
Forefront of such reasons is "the entourage" around the president or the higher hierarchy of power where the final resolution can be taken. In 1973, or even immediately after October War, Hafez Al-Assad organized his ranks and forces and excluded the politicians and officers who stood with him and there was no need to them any more, or they became an obstacle in one way or another. He kept those whose services he needed or whom he could not oust for reasons related to security, military or sectarian balances after imposing an authority over anybody who had an authority.
It might be mentioned here that Hafez Al-Assad continued for three decades to establish a dictatorial, security, military regime as accurate as a spiderweb, whose threads are connected with the center where the heart of the web is making final decisions and drawing up policies.
So, some political Syrian forces, including secular and Islamic oppositionists alike, were deceived by the illusion of the "national reconciliation" with the regime on the grounds that the country is exposed to external dangers threatening its independence, sovereignty and security.
Recently, Bashar issued a decree to have a large number of criminal prisoners released. However, he did not take the next necessary step of releasing the prisoners of conscience (or the ten persons who became nine after releasing Riyadh Al-Turk) although their "crimes" can by no means be compared with currency and smuggling crimes or drug trafficking.
The disaster is that this single step forward can imply some other sorts of development such as importing the worst traditions of the familial mafia.
For that end, an agreement was signed on Sunday between the Company and the Middle East Aviation Academy. The agreement stipulated providing the Academy with the first production of the factory, which will be opened on 15th September next.
HALF ARAB AGRICULTURAL LANDS THREATENED WITH DESERTIFICATION
The report pointed out that the Arab world is rich in water resources although it is located in a semi-dry area in the world and its renewable water resources are less than 1 percent of the world's renewable water. The Arab per capita quota of water amounts to 1477 cubic meters annually whereas the world per capita share is 112.9 thousand cubic meters.
Israel also carried out a lot of policies aiming to control water resources in the West Bank and Gaza as most of these resources are linked with the Israeli water system.
This announcement coincided with American and Israeli intensive pressure on Iran to force it to unveil its nuclear programme.
The American Administration feels that the gravest danger to its forces in Iraq and the Gulf region in general comes from two countries Syria; and Iran, as their borders with Iraq are both long and of difficult terrain and are therefore so difficult to control.
Israel has panicked at such missiles just as it had panicked at Al-Hussein Iraqi missiles. It would never feel safe unless such missiles were destroyed or unless the regime in Tehran was changed just as it had done to Iraq.

AFTER LATE MARRIAGE IN EGYPT, GIRLS ESCAPE SPINSTERHOOD BY DOING POST GRADUATE STUDIES
Mona, a 37-year old woman admitted that post graduate studies were the real reason. It was a sort of escape from the pathetically long wait for the suitable bridegroom. I was the incessant subject of my family's talk which made me think I was a problem. They imagined that it was much to late for me to get married at this age while I do not think so as I still feel young and marriage is a matter of luck!
The involvement in such rivalry made me reject several proposals of marriage at that time and I did not, then, realize that I was unconsciously growing older!

Dr. Makeya said, "The relation between the American consultants and the Education Ministry is important and the Ministry is in charge of education where serious cooperation is necessary. This should be carried out in a way that spares this file any negative educational repercussions.
The educational "battle" is regarded part of the development battle where Iraq will have to face in the coming stage.
We want to increase the time allocated to its learning and to raise the criteria of its mastery, in a bid to help the Iraqis contribute to international economy. That is why we should give due care to English not because there is an Anglo-American occupation.

Foreign Minister Farouq Al-Sharaa said recently that endorsement of the "Syria Accountability Act", which would be probed in the US Congress on 16th September next, would harm American companies operative in Syria, taking into account that the American "Conoco" along with the French "Fina Elf" won the biggest gas investment project at a cost of 420 million dollars.

As for the private sector, Israeli companies are vying for operating their investment works in Iraq in the field of energy, infrastructure and real estate.
"The company is making ready to buy crude oil from Iraq via Turkey. In the first stage, it is expected to cover about 10 percent of Israel's total oil imports, but the quantity will increase in the future," Bazan General Director Yeshar bin Mordkhai told Al-Majalla.
Oil and dreams In the energy field in particular, there are some contradictory statements made by the Iraqi minister of oil, who told the aforementioned editor, "We have no interest in making Israel participate or cooperating with it in the field of oil pumping or reviving Kirkuk-Haifa oil pipeline, and you shouldn't dream of that, either."
Yadiot Aharonot emphasized this fact, as its economic editor said, "Pentagon sources advised Israel to seek the participation of Egyptian and Jordanian companies in bids, as this will contribute, from the political point of view, to involving Israel in Iraq's reconstruction projects which are estimated at billions of dollars.
It seems that when Israeli newspapers published news about the companies' current arrangements they were embarrassed or officially brought into account.
In an interview with Yadiot Aharonot, Prof. John Tailor, an influential economic figure in the White House said, "I call on Israeli companies to participate in the efforts of reconstructing Iraq and I hope such companies can exploit such a big opportunity."
They can also sell Israeli products in Iraq whether individually or through participation with other bodies."

In his customary way, Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh Dr. Mohamed Sayyed Tantawi has solved the problem triggered by a fatwa (religious opinion) passed by Al-Azhar Fatwa Committee member Al-Nabawi Mohamed Al-Esh where he banned the recognition of the Transitional Governing Council in Iraq.
Tantawi, nevertheless, preferred to trigger other issues in his statements reported by semi official Middle East News Agency when he talked about Al-Azhar's role outside Egypt. He said, "I'm Al-Azhar's Sheikh for Egypt and cannot interfere into Iraq's scholars by passing religious opinions on their behalf."

It is noteworthy that the decree has been endorsed by the Supreme Judiciary Council.
It also witnessed division of opinion over the party's attitude towards the presidential candidature system.
Differences cropped up in Al-Azhar due to a fatwa (religious opinion) issued by Fatwa Committee in Al-Azhar and signed by the committee member Sheikh Nabawi Mohmed Al-Esh. The fatwa forbids recognizing the interim Governing Council in Iraq considering it as "illegitimate".
Tantawi described the relation between all these Iraqi sects as "more sensitive than the Americans can imagine," pointing out that "the American Administration should persuade the Iraqis that they have come neither to loot the Iraqi oil nor to occupy Iraq and that they came only to liberate them from oppression and to enable them to regain stability".
Al-Hayat learnt that Sheikh Nabawi Al-Esh was expected to be referred to an investigation committee to listen to his reasons for issuing that fatwa without referral to his bosses, especially that he is not well versed in fatwa.
The second aspect is Arab and Islamic countries' dealing with that council, which is religiously impermissible, as it is recognition of an illegitimate condition. Anything that leads to consolidating occupation is religiously and legally impermissible. Therefore, any means that recognizes occupation must be totally boycotted."

Cairo currently considers setting up a storage space for the Egyptian commodities on an area of 3815 square meters in the free zone of Az-zarqa' city, Jordon, to facilitate transporting Egyptian goods to the Iraqi market to be integrated with the efforts exerted by Cairo with a view to exploiting the free zone in Ash-Shuwaykh harbour, Kuwait, for storing Egyptian goods that could be exported to the Southern areas of Iraq.
Hefni disclosed that the Egyptian Commercial Representation Office in Jordon set a comprehensive plan for the potential cooperation in the field of electric linkage with Jordan and Syria in the framework of the new Egyptian strategy aiming at moving towards the Iraqi market in the coming period. Egypt's new strategy is based on activating the Egyptian participation in the exhibitions mounted in Iraq and making use of the available potentialities of Iraq's neighbouring countries as well as bolstering the chances of the Egyptian companies to benefit from the projects of Iraq reconstruction.
Head of Egyptian-Russian Businessmen Council Dr Ahmed Sheha said that preparations are being made now for setting up two centers, one in Cairo and the other in Russia, aiming at assisting businessmen in both countries in the field of activating bilateral trade exchange relations.
Entry Visa For his part, head of Exporters Division at the General Federation of Chambers of Commerce and member of the Egyptian-Russian Business Council, Ali Eisa said that among the main problems that obstructed the activation of trade between Egypt and Russia was the difficulty in getting an entry visa, not to mention the lack of cooperation between the Egyptian and the Russian banks where dealings used to be consummated through German or other banks.

On the sidelines of such exhibitions, seminars for promotion of investment should be held. Monthly bulletins in the name of the Egyptian-Russian Business Council should also be published in Arabic and Russian in cooperation with the Egyptian embassy in Moscow and the Russian embassy in Cairo.
He added that most obstacles that face investors in both countries would be removed especially bank dealings and entry visas and taking advantages of the changes that took place in both markets through the exportation of available potentialities and offering assistance to businessmen and facilitating the consummation of trade deals. The proposed trade center would be responsible for repayment and bank guarantees operations.
The mini-cabinet meeting to be headed by Premier Atef Ebeid this week will discuss the situation on the market and field follow-up reports compiled by governorates regarding the prices of stable commodities on the market.
The mini-cabinet will also review the outcome of the decision that was taken by the government regarding exempting Supply Authority's imports of stable commodities including wheat, sugar and oil from customs duties.

The ministry also decided to expand the system of renting housing units affiliated to the General Authority for Urban Communities in return for a monthly rent set by the committees concerned according to the area of every unit in the new cities.
For its part, the Housing Ministry declared its plan which is extended till 2017. The plan includes remapping and planning governorates and suburbs in order to determine the areas that can be exploited in building housing units, which would accommodate the rise in population in every governorate. Controls would be laid down to ensure that these areas would not be used for irrelevant purposes.

US Ambassador in Egypt David Welch a few days ago sent days ago a message to governor of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) Mahmoud Abul-Oyoun calling on him to freeze Osama bin Laden and his family's balances in Egyptian banks. The same message was sent to banks branches, including National Bank of Egypt, Banque Misr, Bank of Alexandria and Suez Canal Bank.

EGYPTIAN HUMAN RIGHTISTS PROBE INTO LEGISLATIVE SHORTCOMINGS AGAINST TORTURE CRIMES
He added, "We are also trying to stop the implementation of the emergency law."
Participants in a recent symposium on "Small-sized Parties in the Egyptian Political System" in Cairo said all political factions in Egypt, including the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP), are small-sized. The NDP, the major party in the country, gets its survival and position as a major faction out of the existence of the president of the republic as its leader.
Such factions have made no achievements in the political system and the role of the NDP and opposition parties is still weak.
According to Ahmed Abdel-Hafiz, a cassation lawyer, although the firm constitutional foundation can create a major multiparty basis in such democratic countries as France and Germany, the political party law in Egypt imposes strict restrictions on the formation, policies and existence of new factions. Such constraints have even increased with successive legal amendments.
The first scenario includes the amalgamation of small-sized parties into major ones, based on the fact that the current situation shows that some main parities' parliamentary representation is shrinking, and that existing small factions seceded from major parties and have no weighty political activities.
According to Abdel-Mona'em Said, in spite of problems caused by the party system in Egypt to small parties, the Egyptian elite themselves are to blame for what is happening to such parties as they should move to run a dialogue with the political system and take the society from backwardness to advancement.
Misr 2000 Party leader Fawzi Ghazal ascribed the smallness of parties in Egypt to their lack of grassroots, as well as restrictions on their movement.
EGYPTIAN ELITE'S CLUBS MARKED BY DISTINCTION AND SINGULARITY
According to old members, such an about-face was triggered by several reasons, including an early 1970s decision to open club membership for all societal categories, including institution managers who were former army members and their families. This has unfavourably affected the structure and position of such clubs.
The list of the elites' clubs includes the Royal Car Club at central Cairo Qasr Al-Nile St. This club, though founded in 1924, still keeps its splendor and uniqueness.
The building houses several restaurants and bars.
It also includes Tagamo'h Party leader Refa't al-Said, many ambassadors and university professors, famous actress Faten Hamama (associate member), Central Bank of Egypt Governor Mahmoud Abul-Oyoun and businessmen.
Honourable memberships are granted to many public figures and ministers for one year.

Movie actors and actresses are denied access, except for a few being regarded as businessmen, including Nour al-Sharief, Omar al-Sharief and Samira Ahmed.
The Royal Muhammad Ali Club is situated along the Nile in south Egypt Hawamdia Town, and covers 10 feddans. It is a sports social club built in the royal style. Its entrance includes canons, chariots and a statute of Muhammad Ali.
Like aforementioned clubs, its membership dues are not high, amounting to 15,000 pounds for an individual, and 25,000 pounds for a family. It also enjoys much peculiarity thanks to the small number of its members and daily frequenters, making it a congenial and comfortable place for movie arts, artists, writers, intellectuals and researchers.
It includes heights, plateaus and hills where villas priced at 32 million pounds and rented for 6,000 U.S. dollars per month were constructed.
The club houses many globally styled swimming pools tiled with marble and granite, golf courses sprouting through slopes and plateaus, in addition to conventional halls and business centers.
IRAQI GOVERNING COUNCIL LACKING IN RELIGIOUS AND MUNDANE LEGITIMACY: AL-AZHAR
The fatwa also cited a verse from the Holy Qur'an as calling on believers not to take unbelievers as friends or helpers.
Meanwhile, the Jordanian Islamic Labour Party, the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) in Jordan, made a similar fatwa in this spirit on August 11, barring Muslims from joining the IGC.
Health Committee with the Egyptian Parliament sharply blasted the government accusing it of imposing media blackout and avoiding transparency as far as combating the spread of the Rift Valley fever is concerned. It is noteworthy that the Rift Valley fever is a disease that attacks animals.
It uncovered as well that this disease appeared in Egypt in 1978 and 1997 and appeared in Saudi Arabia and Yemen in August 2000 to attack thousands of people and kill more than 1500 persons. The committee asked for imposing strict measures in vaccinating animals in order to ban the spread of the disease in other governorates, along with strict measures for combating mosquitoes in animal folds, open bogs and drains, and to discover and quarantine the persons who contracted the disease.
It is well known that the Rift Valley disease spread in the governorate two weeks ago.

In its latest monthly report issued on 26th August, the US Department of Commerce said the gross value of goods and commodity exchange between Saudi Arabia and the United States totaled $12 billion roughly in the first half of 2003, up 54% or more than $4 billion in comparison to the same period last year. It is to be noted that the Saudi-US as well as international trade reported a sharp decline during the first quarter of 2002.
Analysts with the US commercial representative office noted that Saudi Arabia became, for the first time, America's biggest trade partner in the Middle East in five years thanks to the big increase in the total value of bilateral trade exchange during the first months of this year.
The date when this new mechanism would be launched is still ambiguous. Meanwhile, the cabinet declared last Wednesday that the mechanism would start operation early next November. Others asserted that the mechanism could not be launched without the approval of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) board of directors, which has not been formed yet. It is difficult to launch the dollar interbank on the date determined by the cabinet, accordingly.
- Non-Availability of foreign exchange liquidity in banks that would enable them to actively participate in the dollar interbank. All banks suffer from severe shortage in foreign exchange resources.
EGYPT'S FOREIGN CURRENCY EARNERS OUTWEIGH SPENDING
Foreign exchange earners belong to neither exporters nor travel agents, he said, referring to some exporters' objection to supplying 75 percent of their foreign currency resources to banks pursuant to a governmental order aimed to resolve the foreign monetary crisis.
Said Al Alfi, head of the parliamentary economic committee said that the CBE would have an active role in the issuance of decrees regarding the market in the coming period and in light of the new government decrees. It would also minimize the circulation of foreign exchange cash outside the banking system, thus preventing foreign currency infiltrating into the black market. Moreover, dealing in the pound in Egypt would also ease pressure on the dollar which would then reach a real rate of exchange, which would also help the Egyptians pound reach its real and actual value.
He pointed out that the delegation of the World Bank and the Economic Cooperation Organization for Development which visited Cairo recently had emphasized Egypt's abidance by the application of 28% of international "governance" principles, which is an unprecedented achievement. Egyptian Capital Market Authority chairman was, therefore, nominated as official spokesman on "governance" principles on behalf of the Arab world and the Middle East region in an international conference to be held in Paris next month.
Such a bill is expected to be referred to the Egyptian parliament for endorsement in its next session.
Total loans hit 285.2 billion pounds late last July, up 0.5 billion pounds over June 2003.
Banks were currently studying increasing interest rates on deposits, investment certificates and saving coffers in the Egyptian pound, banking sources announced.
Al-Wafd newspaper learnt that a strong trend inside the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) was trying to pump extra amounts of dollar on the banking market.

What about its successes and failures?
Unsuccessful deals To follow up the privatization program one can find that up till now the government failed to fully apply this program to 30 companies that were put up for sale, including Egypt for Car Trade, Mokhtar Ibrahim for Constructions, Febro, Helnan Hotel, Omar Effendi, Sednaoui, Rakta, Benzion, Transport and Engineering company, Al-Nasr for Tanning Hides, General Egyptian Company for Buildings and Electrical Projects, and Red Sea for Constructions.
The privatization program also could attract direct investments from 6 foreign companies, namely, France, America, England, Greece, Mexico and Portugal. Most of these countries' investors bought cement companies. Generally, 29 companies have been sold to an anchor investor at a value of LE6.796 billion.
High debts The privatization program sluggishness was ascribed by a lot of experts to the increase in debts due on Public Enterprise Sector companies, which hit, according to Public Enterprise Sector Minister's report, around LE29 billion with annual interest rate to the tune of LE1.5 billion, let alone non-banking debts of creditors including suppliers, Insurance and Electricity ministries.
LOCAL DEBTS SURGING UP: CBE

Khaldoun Kutaishat expected that Gulf investors would contribute to financing the remaining 40% of Al-Fajr Company which is registered in Jordan and would execute the second stage of the Egyptian gas project in Jordanian territories at an estimated cost of 235 million dollars.
Hussein told Asharq Al-Awsat that the Egypt-based AOI primarily aims at developing the Iraqi industry sector. The visit of AOI delegation to Iraq was positive in spite of the fact that no contracts have been signed during the visit, Hssein said, pointing out that the beginning of next year will witness the conclusion of agreements and signature of contracts.
Regarding the current and the expected competitions, Hussein said, "We went to Iraq bearing in mind that there are several companies who seek to undertake Iraq reconstruction projects particularly the American, French and German companies.

The Arab free trade zone would secure an expansion opportunity for markets, accommodation of modern technologies, orientation for increasing production, improvement of products and services quality, attraction of foreign funds, increase of inter-Arab trade and easy access to international markets.
DAMASCUS CALLS ON WASHINGTON TO OPEN AMERICAN UNIVERSITY
It is worth mentioning that JBIGP American delegation met with the Syrian president Bashar Assad yesterday. In the meeting, Assad called on Washington to better understand the region civilization and its peoples interests.
The scientists considered also the reports presented by Egypt and other Arab countries warning of radioactive contamination in the region.
Discussed too in the functions of the conference was Israeli occupation forces' use of depleted uranium and uranium-238 contained munitions against Palestinian civilians and their negative effects on Palestinian posterity, development and economy in the Palestinian occupied territories.
In the meantime, Ahmed bin Heli, AL Secretary-General Assistant for Political Affairs, said, "It is Iran and not the USA which asked to attend the official meetings of the Arab Foreign Ministers as an observer. The Legal Administration at the AL is currently preparing a regulation including rights and duties of new observers and their right to attend AL open meetings, not closed-door meetings and the inability to vote for draft resolutions".
The ten Nile basin countries are now seeing tangible progress and prosperity. There is an agreement among these countries on exploiting the annual surplus of water estimated at around 92 percent of waterfall on an annual basis, he said.
No more will boat berths be established along the Nile and Lake Nasser, and factories will be prevented from throwing their waste into the Nile, the minister said.
Israeli press sources pointed out that the decision of the rabbis at settlements runs counter to decisions of most of rabbis in Israel, who believe, according to Jewish religious teachings, that entering the Al-Quds at present is "illegal pursuant to Jewish teachings".
Under this headline, Abdel-Wahab Badrakhan of Al-Hayat wrote an article on page 9, which ran to the following effect only in part: This time Donald Rumsfeld did not come to Iraq to boast of victory, but rather to check how bad conditions are and to raise the morale of the American forces and the civil administration.
Rumsfeld could not promise to increase the build-up simply because there are no more forces on hand.
Therefore, Rumsfeld did not mind using this sudden visit to Iraq for poisoning regional climates the Rumsfeld's known way.
Anyhow, if there were any foreign interventions in Iraq, it would simply be the result of American behaviour and arrogance during their preparations for the war and which characterized their bearing in the first days in Baghdad after its fall.
Any country of real weight cannot just send forces to support American occupation. Nor is it likely that any legitimacy can be given in advance to American harboured regional scheme. Neither can financial aid be extended just to enable American companies to grab all investments in Iraq.
Asharq Al-Awsat learnt that the local popular councils general secretariat in 26 Egyptian govenorates started to review their members' conscription status in light of complaints about some of their members being draft dodgers.
Anybody who will be proven to be draft dodgers will have his membership dropped. All members were notified of that decision and the popular local councils started to receive any papers or documents that prove the conscription status of their members in a bid to take the legal procedures after ensuring the seriousness of the complaints and warned against any attempts to offer false documents as that would be legally punishable.
Al Arabi learnt from well-informed American sources that the American Administration and some diplomats in the Middle East are entirely convinced that Al Azhar Fatwa (religious opinion) Committee constituted a threat to the American interests not only in Egypt and the Middle East but also in the Islamic world in toto.
The sources said that the Grand Sheikh promised to take the necessary measures with the committee members and bring to book those who are responsible for such religious opinions and change the system of selecting the committee members and even cancel it altogether if necessary and try to do with Dar Al Ifta of (Religious Opinions Headquarters) and consider the latter the only body concerned with the issuance of religious opinions in Egypt.
ISLAMIC SCHOLARS : THE FATWA IS LEGAL AND IGC GROUP OF OCCUPATION STOOGES
His reverence replied that no Egyptian scholar was entitled to talk about the affairs of another country. The legitimacy of the Iraqi Governing Council (IGC) is an Iraqi affair and it is up to them to decide whether it is legitimate or illegitimate. "As Al Azhar Grand Sheikh in Egypt, I have no right to meddle with Iraq's scholars as such matters lie in their terms of reference.
I personally told his excellency the American ambassador that the Americans had better hand over government to the Iraqis.
A: Who said that? You are Egyptians and therefore have nothing to do with such matter.
Q: Yes, they are Iraqis, but they are also American stooges, are not they?
Mass media hide many things, otherwise why aren't we told the number of the Americans killed by the Iraqi resistance?
Dr. Abdel Sabour Marzouk emphasizes that Jihad against the American presence by all possible means like supporting the Iraqi resistance, which is the least we can do is an individual duty. It is really disgraceful to see the Arab region, for all its wealth and capabilities, just onlookers who content themselves with wishful thinking due to the gravity of the current situation. They would just continue their passive looking on even when the worst comes to the worst and when all the Arab region finds itself swept and overrun by the American Zionist flood!
Firstly the increase in anti-America resistance operations in Iraq no matter at what cost in terms of souls and money. Resistance of occupation, is natural and not all resistance in Iraq is carried out by Saddam's commandos.
Dean of Sharia Faculty, Dr. Salah Zeidan asks America if the IGC for which America came to Iraq really achieved democracy for the establishment of which it came to the region.
Dr. Abdel Sabour adds: Regarding the argument that such a council pays allegiance and is loyal to the Americans, which Arab ruler now is not subservient to American wishes? When it comes to the Iraqi people choice of the council and the implementation of the Shura (consultation) principle, I wonder where is that principle of consultation being adopted in any Arab country?
Youssef, adds that history abounds in examples of Al Azhar scholars who had their resignation ready in their pockets, to quote them in literally. They were ready to tell the truth to the face of everybody at whatever costs, a talent which we lack today. Al Azhar Grand Sheikh should at least have kept quiet and not referred the man to investigation. We are supposed to be living in a democratic stage as is often said so this Sheikh should have given the chance to express himself freely.
"The return to right is a favourable thing, and the presence of the Islamic trend on the political arena can by no means be ignored. Advocates of the freedom and right of political leaders to express themselves cannot ignore the presence of the Islamic trend."
Egypt's former ambassador to Israel Mohamed Bassiouni said Tel Aviv had earlier declined to work with Cairo to stop illegal activities and tunnels across their borders. He told the Asharq Al-Awsat daily that over the last years and since Egypt restored its Sinai territories, the Israeli government has been refusing to cooperate with Egypt to close border tunnels and curb activities of Israeli mafias who used such tunnels in drug trafficking and other illegal activities. Such topics were discussed during the regular meetings held between both countries' military liaison committees since the peace accord was signed.
GARBAGE TON IN CAIRO EQUIV. TO LE6000
The Supreme Constitutional Court's explanation, which declared as null and void the membership of those deputies who failed to join the army or were legally exempted (through setting the status of draft dodgers), has created several surprises in the Egyptian People's Assembly and civil society milieus. Dr. Hermes Radwan, a draft dodger MP, said there are around 9 million Egyptian young men who were exempted from military service or who exceeded the legal conscription age and paid a fine to obtain a relevant exemption certificate.
Parliamentary sources suspected that draft dodgers' memberships might be dropped, noting that only five members were threatened. Therefore, the constitutional and consultative committees will examine each case separately and compile relevant detailed reports in a bid to slim the number of outgoing deputies. In the meantime, some MPs said they would present a new draft law to fend off the fallout of the court interpretation, possibly allowing those draft dodgers to run for legislative elections under specific conditions and cases.
3 COOPERATIVE ARRANGEMENTS SIGNED WITH SUDAN Yesterday, three co-operation agreements were signed between Egypt and Sudan.
Minister of Supply and Domestic Trade, Dr. Hassan Khidr pointed out that the Sudanese meat would be put on the markets at the co-operatives affiliated to the Supply Commodities Authority at LE16 per kilogram.
The paper added that the value of the deal would amount to two billion dollars to partially cover the needs of the Israeli Electricity Company for 15 years.
The paper noted that Sharon justified his refusal by saying that the Palestinian National Authority should be deprived of its share in any deal to deny the alleged terrorist organizations access to such funds.
The group plans to export cars to COMESA members and Egypt's neighboring countries.

EGYPTIAN SOURCES OFFICIALLY DENY COMMERCIAL COOPERATION WITH ISRAEL
They added that the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Businessmen Association had set a negative list of the members who dealt with Israel in the name of the Federation and the Association as members were free to deal with any market in their names only and, therefore, nobody could have anything to do with that dealing.

The mini-cabinet under Prime Minister Atef Ebeid on Tuesday discussed a governmental plan to control commodity prices at markets and keep the customs U.S. dollar at LE5.35 in a bid to support basic commodities imported by the private sector.
Markets are now being followed up through emergency cells at cabinet ministries concerned.
Export suspension decrees recently taken by Premier Dr. Atef Ebeid have uncovered confusion in government performance.
These decrees have also uncovered the lack of any specific strategy for boosting Egyptian exports.
Deposits with Egyptian banks increased to about 410 billion pounds till late July 2003 against 402.4 billion pounds in June 2003 and 335.3 billion pounds in May 2003. A recent report by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) pointed out that governmental deposits hit 68.3 billion pounds during the same period, of which the equivalent of 19.8 billion pounds are in foreign currencies and 48.5 billion pounds are in domestic currency.
Governor of the Central Bank of Egypt Dr. Mahmoud Abul-Oyoon admitted to the depreciation of the pound by 81% during the period from 2000 to 2003.
"We will step in and pump foreign exchange into the market to strike a balance and meet all demands when the necessity arises," he said.
Abul-Oyoon accused exchange firms of malpractices and manipulation, saying that such firms should have been closed down during the last period due to such practices.
While the CBE governor Mahmoud Aboul-Oyoun blamed some exchange companies for the rise in the dollar rate of exchange and asked that such companies' role should be reconsidered. Exchange Division Chairman Mohamed Hassan Al-Abyadh defended exchange companies and said, "We would stop this activity at once if this were in the interest of national economy.
He added that the current price of the dollar was exaggerated and far from reflecting the reality of the economy. He said that it was a "speculative" price which would soon disappear.
The governor said, "The rate of exchange has fluctuated several times since it was deregulated till it settled in banks at the 616 piasters level. This, nevertheless, does not mean that that was the rate at which the dollar stopped.

What is happening in auto market and what is the cause behind this continuous rise?
The price of 1300-class cars imported from Japan such as Lancer and Toyota exceeds 130,000 to near 140,000 pounds. It is worth mentioning that the price of such cars ranged between 80 and 90 thousand pounds. This indicates the devaluation of pound, something which necessitates fixing the customs dollar rate so that customs will decline by the same rate and then balance be achieved on market.
Deputy chairman of the United Company for Marketing and Cars Ahmed al-Basioni said that the rise in car prices is equal to the rise in dollar rate.

All that should constitute an alarm sounded for three parties - those who live on the theatre of events and the people of the area, which is affected by the Iraqi role. The third party is the USA, which struck off Saddam Hussein's regime and opened the Iraqi theatre to the unknown.
The Iraqis face two urgent tasks; shortening the occupation period and closing the Iraqi arena to those who seek chances for engagement with the Americans.
The Iraqi tumult that is still in the offing augurs the exportation of fire as the character of the conflicts triggered by it cannot be controlled at international borders.
The less costly option is certainly this: shortening the occupation period and closing the arena through granting the UN a real role in expediting the transfer of power to the Iraqis.

SUDAN ASKS AMERICA FOR COMPENSATING VICTIMS OF KHARTOUM MEDICINE FACTORY
ISRAELI FIRMS CONTRACTED WITH US ARMY IN IRAQ
Israeli Tami Arb'a for water refinement started moving its equipment to Iraq in the recent months to launch many infrastructure projects there together with another Israeli company for producing armoured "multi-lock" doors.
The decision was taken last month after Israeli businessmen's meeting with Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

IRAQ'S NEW MINISTERS: TECHNOCRATS, POLITICIANS FROM IRAQ'S NATIONALITIES AND SECTS
His presence in the Ministry of Planning will prove crucial for the form, which will be taken by the Iraqi economy, which inherited the burdens of the public sector and the state of militarization.
Some people think that the Minister of Youth and Sports, Ali Faik Al Ghaban ( candidate of Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq) and Minister of Higher Education. Zeyad Abdel Raziq Aswad (Muslim Brotherhood) represent an orientation that would lend an Islamic trait to the building of the youths' character, which secularist parties look at with some suspicion. There is a strong presence for the technocrats in the cabinet.
Some old Iraqi ministries disappeared in the new formation such as the ministries of Defence and Information (dissolved under a decree of the American top civil administrator in Iraq Paul Bremer). Nor is there a Ministry of Waqfs ( religious endowments) as the Governing Council assumied the Premier's role tended to form an authority supervised by personalities who would run Sunnite Waqfs, others who would run Shiite Waqfs and others who would run Christian Waqfs.
He expected that Major General Naguib Al-Salhi, the movement's Secretary General, would assume the leadership of that apparatus which would include professional security forces reflecting the new Iraq picture. Its personnel are respectable and would be obeyed by the Iraqi people, according to a memo on setting up the apparatus issued by the American Civil Administration in Iraq.
Those observers think that the American Administration had made two errors; the first when it dissolved the Iraqi army, thus causing collapse of Iraq's international border checkpoints and the second error was monopolizing the security file and directly supervising it without the participation of any other party.
It can also contend that the transitional Iraqi Governing Council (IGC) was born under the umbrella of occupation and carries the American administrator's fingerprints on that Arab country.
Syria can take a hardline position that may seal all doors. Such a position, nonetheless, would deprive Syria itself of having any effect on Iraq.
Nor does it have any interest in placing Iraq on the road to partitioning or in the eruption in Iraq of a long conflict that would detract attention from the Palestinian cause so that priority would be given to fending off the Iraqi danger instead of involvement in terminating the Israeli occupation.
If we take into account the assets of relations and friendships Syria has with political forces affiliated to various Iraqi players in the arena, we can safely say that the Syrian new position qualifies Damascus for a bigger role in the encouragement of Iraqis to dialogue and consensus, a role in crystallizing an Arab position that would encourage the tendency to give the UN a bigger role in Iraq to ensure a quick transfer of power to the Iraqis together with ensuring the country's indignity.

Egyptian authorities picked up seven leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan), including former member of parliament Gamal Hishmat, while they were meeting together in Hismat's house in Damanhour City in Beheira Governorate in Delta.
What is happening is the continuation of a policy we hope that it will come to a halt especially at this crucial time in the country.

ISRAELI FORGERY!
Under this headline, Zuhair Qusaibati of Al-Hayat wrote an article, which ran to the following effect: With Ahmed Qureia at the head of the new Palestinian government, Sharon government's goals of burying the Roadmap and interring the resistance and its factions symbols will never alter. This, however, may not prevent some amendments in the Israeli plans in order to exploit the almost complete identification in America and Europe with its attitudes towards the resistance and branding it of terrorism as in the case with Hamas.
Naturally, Qureia's government will find itself surrounded by such a conflagration, Israeli assassinations and raids as well as retaliatory reactions. It, therefore, will not be in a better position than the hundred-day experience, which Abu Mazen had while heading the government.
Europe, which presented Israel with the gift of placing Hamas on the terrorism list, may unconsciously encourage the plans of physical liquidation of the movement leaders and slip into the American concepts that lump armed resistance factions together with criminals and drug rings.
Isn't his war and Sharon's the same?
According to a Palestinian official close to Abu Mazen, the expected scenarios are as follows:
He is given credit by Arafat, the Palestinian street and Tel Aviv.
Abu Mazen's resignation is attributed to a number of reasons at the forefront of which are accumulated differences between him and President Arafat the last of which was the issue of controlling security apparatuses, which was the straw that broke the camel's back, as US-backed Abu Mazen insisted on putting such bodies under the control of Ministry of the Interior headed by Minister of State for Security Affairs Mohamed Dahlan who is totally rejected by Arafat.
The number of officials who demanded a vote of no confidence increased to 55 out of 84 members. It is noteworthy that the number of the council's deputies is 88.
This was also emphasized by Minister of Information Nabil Amr, who is close to Abu Mazen, when he said, "There were some incidents at the opening session of the Legislative Council that strongly did harm to Prime Minister Abu Mazen."
Under this headline, Abdul Wahab Badrakhan, Al-Hayat deputy chief editor wrote an article, which ran to the following effect: Mahmoud Abbas quite obviously defined three reasons for his resignation: the failure of the USA to support his government, lack of Israeli cooperation with his concept of treating the security issue and the failure of the Palestinian President to hand over all his powers to the government!
The USA has contented itself with vague reactions in spite of the gravity of the situation which needed responsible positions on its part. It even did not care, during the last couple of days, to deny Israeli reports of an American approval of expelling Arafat!
He was ready to risk unpopular options in the hope of achieving national interests, as that would be the only possible equation!
What process and what peace?
Sharon and his gang wish that a suicidal operation would, at any moment, take place claiming the lives of scores of Israelis as that would serve as the green light to forge ahead with their plan to occupy Gaza Strip and liquidate Arafat and consequently try to run the chaos emanating from the new position without Oslo, without the PNA, without a government or a Legislative Council.

This advice, coinciding with the meeting of Arab foreign ministers in Cairo, was conveyed by the French ambassador in Beirut to Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, who met with him on Monday on the latest regional and international developments.

SYRIAN FM: READY FOR COOPERATION WITH WASHINGTON
BAGHDAD: FIRST CULTURAL- ARTISTIC FESTIVAL SINCE SADDAM DEPOSITION
SAUDI ARABIAN DEPLOYMENT OF FIGHTERS IN TABOUK COMES WITHIN ITS NATIONAL INTERESTS
The Hebrew state almost resorts to such an approach to banish any, even limited, threat that can face its hostile air force, which violates the international law in the region. When an Arab country such as Kuwait and the UAE, no matter how distant it is from Israel, asks for a weapon from the USA, heated debate is always raised by the Jewish lobby and sympathizers with the Hebrew state to influence the demand, try to delimit some of its systems and details of its armament, or even determine its usage and deployment.
The Israeli air force also includes very sophisticated systems of electronic support and antiaircraft ammunition, in addition to some other offensive kinds to attack targets of different fortifications and sizes using different systems and ranges.
In the Gulf War II, the Saudi air forces fought courageously and gained good experience during carrying out their joint operations with the coalition forces, especially the Americans. AWACS planes together with tanker aircraft and F-16 fighters constituted an effective team that covered distant spaces within their zone of operations.
Saudi Arabia has vital interests in deploying such types of aircraft in any of its airbases in order to protect its sovereignty, facilities and vital centers with a view to not letting Israel - or others - to carry out penetrations to implement surveillance or offensive tasks.
Politically, Israel accuses Saudi Arabia of supporting the Palestinians and of being opposed to the establishment of relations with it. Concurrently, it influences other countries within its vital political environment to coordinate common stands in this respect.

Al-Ahram Al-Arabi interviewed General Director of Toyota-Egypt, Ra'fat Masrouga who attributed this phenomenon to lack of confidence in the Egyptian pound, as people turned into considering the car as an investment commodity and a coffer of value. "This, however, reflects the market's confusion and contradicts with the economic concepts that point out the devaluation of the car after sale," he said. The following is the interview:
A: We believed that the liberalization of the dollar rate of exchange would decrease sales by at least 15% because we expected price hikes. Prices have actually risen to unexpected levels due to instability of the rate of exchange. The dollar rose from 5.35 pounds to 7.25 pounds, while the prices of some kinds of cars have doubled to the extent that a car black market has emerged because people lost their confidence in the pound and all other currencies. Instead, they are investing their funds in buying what they believe to be assets.
Q: How high have passenger cars' sales risen?
Q: What is the reality of the auto-industry?
Q: Why isn't the car assembling industry unpromising?
He probably means this agreement) Q: Even if customs and duties are cancelled?
A: Never was the car a coffer of value. But, it turned to be so due to a state of despair on the market. It is illogical to say that the car is a coffer of value because its price decreases in the course of time. I feel compassion for those who buy a car to store it.
A: If I've money, I'll buy it now because the cost and rate of exchange are on the rise, like the dollar, for instance, which has never retreated against the pound even when it (the dollar) is in its weakest conditions against other currencies.

Addressing the conference, he said the government, in cooperation with the WB, is seeking to improve the management of monetary and financial policies and raising labour efficiency in government departments so as to help complete all investment measures in addition to improving the governmental services provided for citizens.

Those whose hopes for a start of a reform stage were dashed after having betted on an era of serious shift to permanent rather than seasonal democracy, see in the retention of martial laws an introduction to "regulating" participation so that flexibility in implementation may be the resource whenever the authorities' interests are at logger heads with the orientations of a party, trend or syndicate.
