Although Egypt is ranked third in terms of broad beans productivity following France, Germany but preceding Turkey, Italy, China, Ethiopia, Spain, Mexico and Tunisia, the great increase in population and the dependence primarily on broad beans does not enable Egypt to have a surplus for exportation or even self-sufficiency. Besides, there are other factors related to broad beans being cultivated in an agricultural round concurrently with the basic crop for citizens, i.e. wheat, and for animals, i.e. clover, thus making it very difficult to expand its cultivated area.
The misbehavior of many Egyptians led to such a state of price rise, as 80 percent of Egyptians' purchases is thrown at dustbins as leftovers, he pointed out.
The main problem of broad beans is that it is cultivated simultaneously with the basic crop, i.e. wheat, and with the basic animal food, i.e. clover, which spares no strong opportunity to expand its cultivation. The second problem is that the government does not interfere to allocate certain areas for broad beans cultivation, he indicated.

NATIONAL BANK OF PAKISTAN TO WITHDRAW FROM EGYPT SOON

Secondly, they fall short to meet international specifications and the relative rise of prices of Egyptian exports in comparison with the competitive prices on overseas markets.

In order to achieve a leap in the Egyptian commodity exports in the medium or in the long run, the committee highlighted that it is urgent to raise the quality of the Egyptian products to cope with the concept of "comprehensive quality" taking into consideration the degree of materials quality, means of packaging as well as man health.

The President's power should be limited, and the article 74 of the constitution which gives the President of the republic the right to make laws in absence of the People's Assembly ought to be scrapped.

The GAIFZ, in its turn, will distribute the charges investors have paid to different bodies entitled to these charges.

The contract grants Egypt 3 and a half years as a grace period, said Al-Okda, adding that it would be used in restructuring the economy, improving the growth rates, enhancing the monetary policy, developing the banking system and boosting the budget. The contract would be also used in boosting Egypt's trade with other countries.
Prime Minister Atef Ebeid recognized that local debts have reached an alarming rate.
Public domestic debts are being rescheduled through a fresh package, including unconventional solutions, mainly listing and valuating state property in all sectors, separating cash assets from other ones and exploiting them in paying off public debts and cutting the budget deficit.
The report demanded that the Authority should work for activating its revenues so as to reduce the deficit value. It should act to rationalize costs and cut down on some exemptions and discounts granted to some individuals and agencies. It should also try to raise the efficiency level of the transport service by optimal use of the available capacities, whether in the field of passenger or cargo transport. It should also try to continue developing such services so as to meet economic and social goals.
The government began this year with what economists of all intellectual affiliations called the "original sin" - the decision to float the Egyptian pound at the end of January 2003 which cost the pound over 40% of its value against the dollar and other foreign currencies.
Growth rates stood at 2.5% according to government figures issued in June 2003.
"Another bad indicator this year is the exacerbation of domestic debt, which I have been warning against since 1998 describing it sometimes as a hidden iceberg before the Egyptian economy ship. It has recently hit LE371 billion according to Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) data, Dr. Gouda said.
Dr. Ibrahim Al Isawi, an expert with National Planning Institute, emphasizes that the pound floatation decision was the worst economic decision issued this year due to considerable price rises, the increase in debt service burdens on the Egyptian economy, the loss of confidence in the pound and the return of the dollarization phenomenon and its ramifications such as the conversion of pound savings into dollars and the tendency to retain the dollar as a value coffer in light of the collapse in the Egyptian pound value.
Ahmed Al Naggar also agrees that the flotation decision was the worst of all economic decisions this year as it was untimely. Egypt was not prepared for it as there were augurs of the war on Iraq while Egypt had not yet recovered from the September 11th incidents impacts. It also preceded the last pilgrimage season. Egypt was, furthermore, suffering from a deficit in foreign balances like the trade balance which suffered a deficit of $8 billion.
Ebeid will discuss with businessmen the resumption of exports to Iraq and coordination with the government in this respect, especially as Egypt had signed a number of contracts with the Iraqi side ahead of the American invasion of Iraq in order to export Egyptian commodities valued at over 1.5 billion dollars.
According to Abbas al-Gawhri, vice-chairman of Banque Misr, a major national bank, the bank has received no information on potential privatization. He denied any governmental plan at present to spur the sale of these banks. "We are not ready for such a step at a time when we are seeking to restructure banks and boost their efficiency through technological and human development in preparation for international competitions under the challenges facing the banking system with the introduction of Basel international criteria." Al-Gawahri said no pressure is exerted on the Egyptian government to privatize the public banks.
To start with the privatization of a public bank may be raised now so that the experiment may be examined and evaluated to be followed by programs for privatizing the other banks.
President of Delta International Bank and former Central Bank of Egypt governor, Ali Negm, stressed the necessity of privatizing industrial companies indebted to the public sector first and improving the financial portfolios of the public banks then before putting them up for sale or privatization. The possibility that the deposits of public banks clients would be affected is ruled out. All banks adopt one system in preserving deposits, particularly as public banks have deposits and loans equivalent to those of other Egyptian banks.
COTTON EXPORTS HIT LE1.1 BILLION
Prices of Central-Asia cotton edged up by one cent for every pound in comparison with last week's figure, while the prices of Barakat (Sudanese excellent long-staple cotton) remained the same since last week.
40 INTERPELLATIONS, 21 QUESTS FOR NOTIFICATION IN PA OVER ECONOMIC ISSUES

CONFRONTATION BETWEEN NTA AND MOBILE SERVICE PROVIDERS
Fahmi said that such alternatives aim at ensuring the continuation of the advantages of prepaid cards services provided by the two companies as a new system will be adopted to charge 75 piasters for half a minute rather than calculating minute fractions a whole minute.
According to Fahmi, NTA protects the rights of users and clients of telecommunications services including mobile phone service. At the same time, he pursued, NTA works to strike a balance between the interests of all parties including clients and service providers.
"The NTA mulled over the new tariff and found merits including amending the charging unit to half a minute rather than one minute and canceling the administrative expenses on cards, Fahmi said, noting that it also has demerits including decreasing the card validity term. It is noteworthy that the offers declared by the two mobile companies have caused objections by prepaid cards subscribers due to the reduction of the validity period from four to two months and amending the charge unit to half a minute rather than one minute.
The gap in grain products reached 32%; oils, 68%; sugar, 31%, the Institute said, confirming the necessity of increasing agriculture investments, curbing the losses arable lands and rationalizing water resources use.
Q: What are the gross defects in the Foreign Ministry which you referred to in your resignation?
Ridiculously, the primary defendant in such a crime had his case shelved and was even appointed ambassador to one of the key countries. More ridiculously even, I myself was frozen and neglected. In my office, there are incidents of so many corruption cases corroborated by documents. I could even help investigation authorities should the ministry feel like investigating these cases.
A: Yes, I have. I was frozen and was never delegated by Amr Mousa's ministry to represent Egypt, but Mousa used to cover my freeze with his allegation that he always wanted me by his side because he needed my experience. I, therefore, got from him just lip service, so to speak and was, therefore, never satisfied. However, his manner managed to prevent my explosion which occurred later on when Maher took over.
A: He admitted to all corruption incidents, but he told me that corruption existed in the ministry even before he took over and he, therefore, did not cause it. When I asked him why he didn't eliminate corruption if he was aware of it, he simply kept silent and did not reply to my question. Then I offered to help him uncover all corruption incidents and symbols, but he said, "The meeting is over".
A: It is true and I acquainted him with them, which brought about the clash between us. I can safely say that if I published them, he would stand trial soon of course after his deposition.
I did not tender my resignation voluntarily but I was forced to do so. I have a letter from the foreign minister asking me to do so and I'll show it to you, which was one of the secrets of the clash.

IKHWAN GENERAL GUIDE WARNS AGAINST AMERICAN INTERFERING IN CHANGING CURRICULA
Education curricula in Arab countries do not reflect the nation's identity, or the Islamic call or our civilization and ethics, he said.
"In this respect, we are worried about attempts to spoil the morals of our youths and students. When those who brought political doctrines failed to attract supporters and advocates they desperately intended to cause a doctrinal and psychological vacuum in our youths. The most dangerous of such attempts was spreading immorality at a time when there are neither a political alternative nor freedom. By so doing, they commit their biggest mistake, as betting on the nation's youths means betting on half the present and all the future," he pointed out.
It is normal for bookshops and shoes, bags and school attire shops to display their products with the beginning of the school year, but it is abnormal that cinemas intensify their ads in such a season, as newspapers recently published their usual cinema ads accompanied by a special offer - discount for students in 10:00 am and 1:00 pm shows.
"EGYPTIAN COLOMBIA": POLICE LONGING TO STORM IT FOR 3 YEARS, BUT WRINGING HANDS OVER EXPECTED 100 CASUALTIES
A single kilogram of opium there does not exceed 25,000 pounds (around 3,500 U.S. dollars).
An informed source was quoted as saying that if security forces tried to storm the island, there would be over 100 casualties involving security men and residents due to expected fierce resistance by criminal gunmen who have an arsenal of machineguns and automatics.
The conflict started between both families three years ago, claiming three lives from Ali Hanafis and seven others from Sabbans, in addition to injuries.
The season of desert tourism in Egypt attracts Arab tourists who come to Egyptian deserts in search of hunting and adventure amid environmental objections by some Non-Governmental Organizations in Sinai.
He pointed out that the season of desert tourism is usually connected with the season of overhunting in Egypt which urged us to deploy observers affiliated to the society all over North Sinai to monitor any excesses committed by hunters during the season to prevent hunting deer and wild rabbits threatened with extinction in North Sinai. Desert tourism comes to Sinai in caravans, each of which consists of 12 cars each one equipped with communication means, food and fridges.
On the other hand, an official with Al Zaraniq preserve said that the preserve had prepared for the desert tourism season through three platforms for lovers of watching and photographing birds without disturbing them. Suitable places for camping are provided inside the preserve. Investment activities like entertainment areas are also provided so that swimming can be practiced. Environmental products which are in high demand as well as bird-watching equipment and souvenirs are also made available.
Earlier this week, the Israeli Premier defended aggression on the Palestinians and Syria saying, " We will hit our enemies everywhere with all our strength."
Israeli sources said the air strike was prearranged on Aug. 19th last.
Moreover, Palestinian Minister of Communications and Information Technology in the former government denied that Arafat has had a heart attack saying, "I reiterate nothing of the sort has happened.
AFP quoted sources close to Arafat on Wednesday as saying that an Egyptian medical team left for Ramallah to examine the Palestinian leader.
Qurie emphasized, "We would not wage a civil war."
Although the emergency government is not bound, according to Palestinian jurists, to refer its platform to the Legislative Council especially as its life span is just one month which can be extended for another month, the Legislative Council will be held tomorrow (Thursday ) to listen to and discuss its political programme.
He added, "I won't listen to the Americans as my primary concern is with our national rights.
They also became the only means to overstep the Israeli blocks around Palestinian cities and villages, and even houses towards the wide world.
The cafe, inaugurated in 1998, was a risk, said Al-Hassan, explaining that the cafe guests were a few journalists and foreign residents in Palestine. However, their number increased as time went by till they became numerous, especially after the Intifada outbreak, he noted.
Internet in Palestine It is to be mentioned that Palestine used the Internet for the first time in 1994, in spite of the hard political and security conditions it underwent during occupation. Israel insists on not providing the Palestinians with this service and forces them to subscribe to the Israeli satellite.
Statistics showed that 37.9% of those persons use the Internet in their works and schools and that 56.1% of them use this service as it helps them with their work or to gain knowledge.
The newly established information technology sector has become one of the most important economic sectors. In spite of the economic conditions the Palestinian people undergo under occupation, this sector did not retreat and its various bodies managed to achieve a big growth. The Internet provider companies in Palestine, 12 in numbers, achieved growth rate that hit 40% during the first ten months of the Intifada, Abu-Dakka added, noting that the number of Internet subscribers and users exceeded 219 thousand persons.
We can safely say that what happened would only add to vehemence and effectiveness of the Syrian role, contrary to the wishes of that government."
Al-Assad added that dialogue with Washington was on and should under no circumstances be halted.
A key Iraqi oil source announced during his meeting late last week in a London-based hotel with CEOs' of Western oil companies, that the US opposes using the Syrian oil pipelines to increase Iraqi oil exports on international markets.
In spite of the severe criticism leveled by France against Israel following the latter's air raid on Syrian territories, which France denounced as unacceptable violation of sovereignty, the French side was not taken aback by the Israeli strike as it realized that the American pressure on Syria was not mere words, but rather a de facto policy adopted by the American administration which shared roles with Israel in this respect.
The predominant view in the French milieus runs to the effect that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon seeks to convince the Syrians that any action on their part would be confronted with strong strikes.
France wants Syria to change its policy towards Lebanon and that change should be initially effectuated by not amending the Lebanese constitution with a view to renewing the term of office of the incumbent President Emil Lahud.
However, if Syria were not willing to do so, then French-Syrian ties would not continue.
Furthermore, the role played by Syria in the war on terrorism and contributing to saving souls of Americans from terrorist operations, which Al-Qaeda network planned to execute, contributed to enhancing the trend of the advocates of a dialogue with Syria and made US Secretary of State Colin Powell and his assistant for Middle East Affairs William Burns send official messages to the Congress and Damascus to the same effect.
Firstly, a political-media axis including talk about resuming the political dialogue among diplomats, businessmen and mediamen after holding two sessions last winter on the margin of the visit paid by the consulting group concerned with public diplomacy.
Thirdly, US companies' interests: Late last May, it was declared that the two US companies, namely Ocean Energy and Gulf Sands, signed an agreement to prospect for, develop and produce oil in an area on the borders with Iraq.
The biggest contract for gas investment hits 420 million dollars. The contract was signed with the American Conoco and French Fina-Elf. It is noteworthy that there are 250 US companies operative in Syria.
US trade sources told Al-Hayat that the total trade exchange accounted for some 422 million dollars last year. The value of US exports to Syria was 274 million dollars, foremost of which were grains ($49 million, machinery ($37 million) and cigarettes ($14 million).
The novelty will be in the political side of sanctions provided for in the draft act, if it was passed in the Congress and the Senate (with unanimity).

Two days ago, the retired Israeli ambassador met with Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher to pay him farewell. It is worth mentioning that Bin Ami had partaken in the Inter-Cultural dialogue lately organized by the European Union in Alexandria, which was the last meeting for him to attend in his diplomatic capacity in Egypt.

Al-Beiraq, owned by its chief editor, head of Lebanese Editors' Syndicate Melhem Karam, quoting diplomatic sources, said, "There is American pressure on Syria including preparations to set up an American base in Lebanon."

The contracts included several conditions to facilitate assigning the projects feasibility studies to a number of big firms owned by ministers.
They added that such firms had exercised intensive pressure on the government to pass a decree restoring the operation of that system.
They uncovered that the committee did not abide by the rules of transparency in laying down the controls of work under the BOT system, thus ignoring the demands of experts to violate the monopoly of some companies and consulting firms in that field and granting the opportunities to all economic entities in the market to take part in the competition and offer the best possible conditions for executing the projects.
Noticeably, the directives given by Mubarak to the government had no indication whatsoever to the possibility of changing the President's choice system- as opposition wants- from referendum on the name of just one candidate nominated by parliament or direct elections among a number of names.
However, recent indicators showed that the fourth term in office would not be the last one for President Mubarak, and that a fifth term might be the most likely option now. National newspapers, which celebrated the 22nd anniversary of Mubarak's stepping to power, did not fail to indicate that "the march would have to be completed", which meant a new term in office for Mubarak to complete his achievements, according to them.

Such a rapid backtracking indicated how strong the pressure exercised by the pros of the cancellation of the military edict was, which forced Premier Dr. Atef Ebeid to refuse to include the agricultural land ban military edict among the national security-related military edicts. This week, Premier Ebeid, in a cabinet meeting, decided to forestall attempts to retain the military edict and decided to cancel it infavour of the old law which did not mind building or scraping operations before they started. The building fine under the law did not exceed LE10 thousand while ruling out the possibility of demolition under the pretext of avoiding wasting public property.

"The committee will consider all possible means to alleviate the negative impacts of the drop of the dollar rate of exchange against the euro on the foreign exchange reserve," CBE board member Dr. Mahmoud Mohieddin said. "There is no study that may remedy such a situation. It is too early to regard the decision of forming such a committee as a start for stopping the pound to the dollar," he pointed out.
The CBE decision to stop pegging the pound to the dollar and raise monetary decision-makers' awareness of the importance of setting up a basket of currencies to protect the foreign monetary reserve against fluctuations in international exchange markets, as the steady collapse of the dollar, for instance, against the euro and the pound sterling since last year negatively impacted on the value of the monetary reserve. It also increased, together with the deregulation of exchange rate decision, Egypt's imports costs and prices in general, said Banque Misr's Research and Studies Department director Kamal Mahgoub.

Later, Dr. Mahmoud Abul-Oyoun, former CBE governor, covered another part. Then, overdrafts positions have emerged once again during the last period.
Huge sums of this currency, moreover, were smuggled into the Egyptian exchange market, they said. The decision reflects the bank's desire to protect its clients against incurring heavy losses in exchange differentials due to secret speculations and dealers' will to make quick returns.

It is expected that the project development act, which will come to light soon, will bring about progress and solutions to several problems facing projects.

Simplifying measures A study compiled by Cairo University's Faculty of Economics and Political Science showed that foreign investment in Egypt occupied high position in terms of government performance, technology and administration, while they occupied a low position in respect with infrastructure, labor market. It also pointed out the government main concentration on industry sector which attracts investments.
He revealed that the decrease of investments in Egypt might be attributed to the following factors:
Among the obstacles that impede the increase of foreign investments to Egypt is obliging companies to export 50% of its imports, which is illegal and contravenes competition on international markets and obstructs the investment march.

While Israeli Premier Ariel Sharon accused Libya yesterday (14th October) of developing nukes, director of Media Center for Atlantic Security in Berlin warned the German government against selling Israel new "Dolphin" submarines and urged it to turn down any Israeli request in this regard after it was discovered that Israel had modified the three submarines it bought two years ago in order to launch missiles that carry nuclear heads.
The director slammed Germany for delivering Israel three Dolphin submarines in 1999 and 2000, which Israel asked for following the First Gulf War. Israeli engineers installed 650 mm in lieu of 523 mm wide muzzles while they were being built in Germany so as to be able to launch the amended US Harpoon missiles that are able to carry small nuclear heads.
Director of Media Center for Atlantic Security commented saying, "The responsibility of the issue could not be politically afforded and approving that deal would ignite the conflict in the Middle East, especially as the Arab countries had criticized Germany's delivering the three submarines to Israel.
Perl, a strong supporter of the Israeli Likud Party in the U.S. and one of architects of the U.S.-led war on Iraq, was addressing a symposium of senior American right conservatives in the occupied Jerusalem on Tuesday. Perl who calls for scrapping the "land-for-peace" principle so that the Arab-Israeli conflict can be resolved, said that U.S. President George W. Bush had reversed the American way of addressing terrorism following the September 11th events when he said that he would no longer separate between terrorists and the countries that harbour them.
BUSH-SHARON AXIS!
Regardless of several American indications to embarking on a sort of reconsideration and evaluation of the military and political plans set and supervised by the Administration hawks, such complaints had no bearing on the plan's goals, but were rather connected to erroneous application.
Sharon's government had threatened to launch attacks any time and anywhere and then reiterated its threats. Bush, too, reiterated his argument that what Israel was doing was "self-defence", thus granting it free hand to act in the region.
To the contrary of possible expectations, the lessons of the goings on in Iraq show no evidence that Bush-Sharon axis has been deterred, but rather show that axis practically trying to aggravate tension in the region and to set it on fire while single-mindedly trying to prove ability to stereotype and change the Arab world to become a pliable dough in the hands of Israel.
This comes within the framework of preparations for what would take place especially as the news concentrated on the possibility of hitting Iranian nuclear sites.
Meanwhile, the Arab World is hiding or withdrawing like an alarmed goat, thus confirming the belief that it is already the sick old man of this age.

"During the era of the ousted president Saddam Hussein, there have been interests whose value is estimated at some 3 billion dollars on annual basis representing the total size of commercial exchange between Cairo and Baghdad.

Although he dismissed as baseless reports that the educational revamp aims to undermine Islam, he said Islam is clearly under a fierce attack designed to replace one civilization with another and impose certain views on a particular civilization that opposes them. The role of Al-Azhar is quite a serious one in this battle.

The number of Egyptian programmers amounted to 22 thousand and that of software companies exceeded 700. The infrastructure of communication lines are available, computer has been introduced into many domains and hacking is on the wane. All this allows the software sector to go ahead once obstacles of customs duties and taxes are removed and proper government support is provided for exports.

HIZBULLAH WARNS ISRAEL AGAINST ANY BETS ON "SINGLING OUT" SYRIA
Sheikh Qawooq went on to say,"Any aggression on Syria is aggression on Lebanon, Palestine, and the nation". He underlined that any bet on singling out Syria would abort all the conspiracies by America and Israel. He added that American and Israeli threats and intimidations to Syria and Iran targetted what are left of the nation's impregnable and capable strongholds.
With regard to the deterioration of political and security relations between Israel and the Paelstinians, Goon urged Israeli businessmen to take the initiative of effecting a turning point in relations through investing their funds in the Palestinian Authority lands.
In order to boost that peace, the American Administration has set up 7 free trade zones in Jordan (since 1998) where international investing companies were given privileges so that their goods would be marketed in the USA without customs.
Such a balance, however, has been upset since 1996 so much so that imports from Israel exceeded exports to it.
Israel emphasized that it regarded the Jordanian attitude as a reflection of the political and security conditions between Israel land the Palestinians."
Every degree of escalation by Israel will be retaliated in kind by Syria.
After Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Al-Shar' had delivered his speech before the UN in which he said that his country would not fall short of finding the deterrent resistant balance that could make Israel reconsider its calculations, Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad said in Malaysia two days ago that the Israelis should be aware that no matter how powerful their military forces might be, they would neither achieve their goals nor terrify the Syrians. This coincided with Syrian Chief of Staff Gen. Hassan Torkmain's call on the armed forces to be on full alert to repulse any potential Israeli attack.
The most serious point, in case of Syrian abstention or opposition is that it would have helped the efforts exerted by the "hawks" of the American Administration and pro-Israeli Congressmen to "isolate" Syria internationally, provide "a UN cover" for any potential offensive and "involve" Syria further in "the axis of evil" according to the American classification.
The Syrian position regarding such issues is based on the fact that "the currently American policy and the adoption of Syria Accountability act do not encourage stability but rather escalate animosity to the USA and that a just and comprehensive peace is a strategic option but it is ranked 100th in the American priorities.
Syria Accountability act endorsement may mean, in some way or another, a desire to pressurize Damascus, weaken its position in the Middle East and reduce its demands in the two files of Iraq and the peace process.
The firm's headquarter is located in a chamber in Palestine Hotel in the Iraqi capital in a beautiful location that overlooks the Tigris.

For his part, Qatari Interior Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem Al-Than, who headed the meeting of GCC interior ministers in Doha yesterday said, "The counter-terror unified agreement has been postponed as it still needs more study".

KHARTOUM ABANDONS SHARIA IN FAVOUR OF PEACE Some political observers think that the peace deal in Sudan has been clinched in its general framework during the meetings that lasted for three weeks on end in Naivasha, Kenya, between Sudanese Vice-president Dr Ali Othman Taha and Dr John Garang leader of Sudan's People Liberation Army (SPLA). Observers are also of the opinion that the two sides kept the whole agreement hushed up uncovering only the part related to the security measures till they declare the details of the agreement and paving the way for accepting it.
So what are the reasons behind that?

The merger also comes within the implementation of Premier Dr. Atef Ebeid's decision stipulating that the capital of any bank in Egypt shall not be less than 500 million Egyptian pounds (84 million dollars). The negotiations between the CBE and Banque Misr came to an end when Banque Misr agreed that the CBE would finance the deal of purchasing Misr Exterior.

Al-Qarnshawi said the past period, which saw successive rises in the dollar exchange rate, was a temporary transitional stage. He pointed out that the stability of the dollar rate of exchange at banks and its current decline on the unofficial exchange market underlines that the US currency is on its way to its fair balance rate that reflects the reality of interaction between supply and demand without the intervention of any external factors with the intention of spreading the rumour of the existence of an unreal demand and reviving speculation operations.
He went on to say that the government promise to apply decree 506 on the payment of 75% of exports proceeds in foreign cash to banks when the exchange rate is stable would put the current exchange system to a new test to prove its ability to resist.
Total treasury bills value registered in October last increased 3.307 billion ($520 million) compared to September last, a recent Central Bank of Egypt report said.

Cairo Far East bank plans to issue fresh saving coffers in the Egyptian pound for long terms and at distinguished interest rates in a bid to draw more dealers, raise dollar supplies and stimulate savings in the national currency, sources of the bank said.
CBE's former governor Ismail Hassan is in the belief that interest rates should be moved up according to carefully considered standards with the goal of averting any unfavourable impacts especially on investment which has dramatically fallen over the last two years.

Most of them, however, agreed to pay on the spot and a considerable number of them asked to be allowed to pay the sum by installments.
Meanwhile, bank leaders rebutted allegations that banks partly lay behind the crisis haunting the steel sector, and that they were reluctant to bankroll mega projects.

Asked about the extent of change in banks' vision of loans and facilities to the sector, and whether allocations will be formed to deal with relevant risks, he said this was contingent upon every dealer individually, especially as around 80 percent of the sector's borrowers settle their loans to banks on a regular basis.
Tarek Helmi, CEO of the Banking Corporation-Egypt, one of the banks that reduced the interest rate on deposits, said that that tendency was meant to cut the cost of funds with banks as there were no available investment projects to inject such huge deposits. Banks avoid lending these deposits at present, he added.
He expected that such a step would increase the dollarization rates. He explained that the interest rates at banks ranged between 6.5% and 8.5% and what ws over that limit - dependent upon the need of each bank of pound resources. He said that banks have abundant pound deposits, which led them to reduce interest rate.
The interest rates in Egypt are higher than those in other countries in the world because this is linked to the inflation rate in the country, he noted.
Former senior advisor with the CBE Mohamed Al-Barbari said the increase of interest rate had been the reason behind the success of the government's economic policy in 1991 when Egypt experienced a similar economic crisis and the interest rate were then increased to control dollarization. Interest rate is not the main control of investment increase, as there is an imbalance and mistrust in the investment atmosphere not to mention shortcomings in financial policies that should be implemented to increase investment.
BANKERS WARN AGAINST PUTTING UP DOLLAR SAVING COFFERS WITH HIGH INTEREST RATES
For his part president of the Delta International Bank Ali Negm said putting up that dollar saving coffers with an interest rate of 2.5% would lead to negative consequences that would establish the state of instability on foreign exchange market and would also push people to hoard up dollar instead of exchanging it for pound. That coffer, moreover, would add a further burden to the government in procuring the new increase in the dollar interest rate not to mention the increase of demand for dollar and its high rate of exchange against the pound. It is better now to increase the interest rate of the pound in order to encourage dollar holders to exchange their deposits to the pound, said Negm, adding that the current dollar interest rate is quite suitable and should not be reduced or increased. He called for introducing a balance into market through the interbank system, controlling monetary inflows, meeting import needs and restoring confidence in the Egyptian pound.
Hashad doubted that such a measure would drain the unofficial exchange market of the dollar. He warned that this would encourage dollar holders to save rather than buy their dollar deposits them, thus leading to a shortage in the dollar supply and helping unofficial market revive.
It to be mentioned that the US administration had refused previously to discuss the free trade zone due to its reservations on some economic and legislative policies in Egypt.
"If there were any problems, we would not continue trials to launch negotiations on the free trade zone between Egypt and the US," the source revealed, confirming that there is progress as well as strategic relations between Egypt and the US due to long years of understanding and coordination. Egypt and America enjoy lasting good relations.

When the French Expedition came to Egypt, Ramadan banquets started to take an official form through the participation of Al-Azhar scholars.
Over one thousand citizens used to frequent that banquet daily, but, according to Hilal Sheta, such a banquet has disappeared this year which Sheta ascribes to two reasons: first the sharp rise in prices, thus making the cost of these banquets exorbitantly high and secondly the unsuitable economic conditions this year of some of those businessmen who used to offer banquets.
The students had refused to obey the orders of the university administration banning celebrations of Ramadan, arranging a football tournament as well as some other sporting and recreational activities.
This upsurge increased pound devaluation and decreased its purchasing power, thus increasing prices unprecedentedly.

Under this heading, Dr. Ibrahim al-Bahrawi, professor of Hebrew studies with Ain Shams University, writes a lengthy article to say: Observers can note that Egypt and Israel have been engaged in growing tension since October 6th, the 30th anniversary of the Middle East October 6th, 1973 War.
The Israeli chief of staff said on October 14th that Israel would defeat the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) just as it routed Egypt in October 1973, adding that when Israeli forces crossed the western bank of the Suez Canal, Egypt, the major Arab country, had to conclude that the only way out of the 1973 Arab quagmire was to hold negotiations based on the recognition of Israel.
Such statements came to press an indirect accusation against Egyptian authorities regarding the smuggling of arms.
The commentary said Israeli Minister of Defence Sha'ol Movaz yesterday warned against military armaments made by Egypt in recent months, especially U.S.-made weapons.
On the same topic, the Israeli paper directly brandished a threat against Egypt at the military level when it said following Movaz's remarks that it learnt that in the recent couple of years Israeli military formations involving diverse combat units carried out war games with mock battles with Egyptian forces on combat plans and models of Sinai Peninsula.
It is no wonder that the Egyptian Al-Ahram daily carried a series of articles written by its editor under a single headline "Is the Middle East on the Verge of a New Explosion?"
What should be noted in the topic carried by Maariv, the most circulated paper in Israel, is that the daily failed to highlight relevant statements made by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in its report, which gave answers to the Israeli escalation and tension onslaught.
But, the paper deliberately obtained statements from the Israeli minister of defence to put them in the preface of the report.
If the campaign is restricted to this aim, then a fiercer military escalation against Palestinians is expected to take place within weeks or months to come, in which Egypt should not be allowed to interfere through any political effort.
The main questions raised by observers come as follows: What is Washington's position on this Israeli effort to strain relations with Egypt?
The chief of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) said the U.S. would stop funding infrastructure projects in Egypt soon. Instead, it will focus on programs for developing small and medium-sized projects and education, he said.
The U.S. always makes consultations with the Egyptian government on Egypt's needed projects and development programs.

In their complaint, hotels managers said that belly dance items are presented in Ramadan mostly to foreign tourists. Their absolute banning would negatively impact on the tourism movement and would do extreme harm to tourism activity. For his part, Dr. Thabet defending his decree, told Asharq Al-Awsat that that decree aimed at preventing fraud operations perpetrated every Ramadan season by some entertainment places which present dancing shows in Ramadan relying on the work permits they had. This decree to stop such permits, therefore, was meant to sanctify the holy month, stop that fraud and consider the feelings of the vast majority of the masses.
The Mossad particularly warned the Israeli businessmen who have trade interests with those countries especially those who had ended their military service with high ranks.
The Transport and Communications Committee in the People's Assembly held a meeting yesterday headed by Hamdi Al-Tahhan to discuss a quest for notification from MP Al-Badri Farghali in which he warned of the deterioration of Port Said and Damietta harbours in the field of container handling after the operation of East Port Said and Ain Sokhna Ports, which enjoy several privileges stipulated in the investment law, and the danger of these privileges to the container companies affiliated to the State where around ten thousand workers are threatened with layoff. Engineer Muhammad Abdel-Reheem Nour Eddin, the representative of the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones, told the committee that Damietta Port would be the second station for executing the same system within the framework of the tendency towards equality between the old ports and new ports that work in the same activity.
Al-Badri wondered how Port Said and Damietta ports can attract ships at a time when the value of discharging a container in Port Said and Damietta ports reaches 90 dollars and in the neighbouring ports such as Ain Sokhna and East Port Said is 50 dollars.
The countdown to a huge achievement in Damietta Port started. It comes in the framework of the total development witnessed by the maritime sector in Egypt.
The superstructure included the construction of the electronic management and open services building. This included the development of the service complex building through adding a fourth floor of an area of (2200) square meters and services needed for using it as a building for electronic management that would accommodate the necessary bodies and trained cadres to take up the responsibility of work around-the-clock. This would lead to a five-fold increase in the number of containers to be handled compared with the design capacity.
There would also be an internal wireless system to link the observers in sensitive sites and the observers of the screens.
In order to serve the electronic system, buildings were constructed, each of which consists of two storeys and houses four offices and is used for the following bodies; the port authority, the export and import control organization, the customs, and the storehouses. The upper floor of this building is used as accommodation for the areas observers.

In an interview with Al Alam Al Youm, Eng Fahmi said that his ministry's plan for the future envisaged the establishment of strong and specialized entities in the petroleum and petrochemical industry with active participation from the private sector.
Oil prices have made successive leaps that took them beyond the $40 per barrel mark. What are the real reasons for this soaring of oil prices?
Third, there are political reasons related to the motivations of some countries that want crude prices to remain high for long periods, as the talk about high oil prices will distract people from other events in the world.
First, our exports have gone up in the past period, rising from 16.5 million tons worth $3.2 billion in FY 2002/03 to 19 million tons worth $4 billion in FY 2003/04. The rise of our dollar revenues is not a result of the increase in crude prices and exports alone; the increase in our exports also includes the exportation of other petroproducts, plus natural gas and petrochemicals.
The most important thing is production. The published figures are not announced by just one person, even if that person is the minister himself: they come from the Higher Committee for Petroleum Wealth, and each and every figure is documented with paperwork.
Gas-producing countries admire the Egyptian experiment. Among these countries is Canada. Although their gas industry is now 84 years old, the Canadians describe what we have done in Egypt in 20 years as a miracle.
Besides, developing the gas industry is done only through mechanisms. If we look back at the period from 1990 to 2000, we will find that Egypt signed several protocols with other countries for exporting Egyptian natural gas to them, but none of these protocols has been put into effect so far. But when we established the holding company, we did not wait for anybody: we just laid the pipeline from Arish to Taba, and we found Jordan ordering our natural gas afterwards, and it was not long before Syria and Lebanon did the same. We have succeeded in exporting gas through the Arab pipeline, and the Syrians are now going to build the third stage of the line through their territories, after we have finished laying the second stage in cooperation with Jordan.
No investor can go into any country and not abide by the rules of its banks. This was what happened in Egypt, for there were no large amounts of money pumped into the country without going through the graduated stages of the process, until we reached the current stage in which billions of dollars are being pumped into the country.
I would like to point out here the rumors that went around some time ago about the decrease of investments of certain companies in Egypt. In fact, these same companies came to us to express their surprise at the rumors and tell us of their plans for future investments that will cover many years, and they strongly denied the rumors.
Is that true?
These projects include a propylene plant with an annual capacity of 350,000 tons whose output will go to meeting local demand in addition to exportation.
Why has the role of the private sector shrunk in the petroleum sector?
I want private businessmen to come to us and spend money to reap profits.
Suffice it to say that the model of Tharwa Company is now desirable to a number of Arab States, such as Qatar, which has expressed a desire to establish an entity like Tharwa.
Are not there any fears of losses that Tharwa may not be able to take in the same manner as foreign companies, which set aside large amounts for risk?
From what you have announced about offering the shares of some companies for public subscription on the Stock Exchange - seven companies, to be precise, when will this be done?
What are the future plans of your ministry?
On the other hand, the petroleum sector has many workers who are qualified in such a manner that makes every one of them capable of doing his work without waiting for instructions from the minister's office.
These savings came about as a result of setting a maximum price for gas at $2.65 per million thermal units. This is a fixed price that will not change however high world oil prices may rise. We have also set a minimum price for gas at $1.5 per million thermal units, which has enabled us to buy the shares of foreign partners in the gas produced here at prices that are 50% less than the prices we used to pay when the price of natural gas was dependent on the price of Brent crude.
Why do not you establish an oil refinery in Sinai to develop the peninsula?
Agiba said in its indictment that it concluded an agreement on February 3rd with Al-Chark Insurance. The agreement stipulated that Al-Chark Insurance should pay two thirds of the value of the policy, whose total value hit 270,000 dollars when, if the platform is exposed to any sea accident. A lawsuit on the accident was filed before a London-based court. The law firm in charge of the case demanded 35115 pound sterling as its fees, which Agiba reduced to 10,000 pound sterling only.
It is to be mentioned that Agiba's offshore platform drowned after it had been hit by the huge tanker "Jelly B".
ENTERPRISE SECTOR MINISTER: ALL DEBTS TO BANKS SETTLED
He added that there were 59 loss-making companies, but 53 profit-making ones whose profits do not exceed LE78 million annually, which are poor figures compared with the number of the companies. He pointed out that there were 66 companies that are faring well with net profits of LE2390 million a year.
He went on to say that the development inside the companies leadership was on. The Ministry chooses the most efficient leaderships to take up the responsibility. Such leaderships have proved to be successful and could turn the companies into profit-makers.
In radio statements, the Imam underlined that the Palestinian people was determined to defend its sanctities regardless of occupation schemes aiming at controlling the holy city, Sheikh Mohamed Hussein described the visit paid by Israeli Public Security Minister Tzachi Hanegbi to Al Aqsa Mosque campus as "sinful," adding that it came within the framework of aborted attempts to control the ancient Islamic and Arab symbols.
From the east alone, the wall swallows third of the West Bank area and adds Jericho city on the borders with the Jordan River to the list of Palestinian cities which would turn into separate cantons.
It will enclose about 25 Jewish settlements, as well as tourism sites and industrial settlements along the Jordan valley.
Israel's announcement of the remaining part of its scheme to besiege Palestinian cities coincided with Palestinian attempts to contain the repercussion of building the wall in the Western part of the bank, which converted entire villages and residential areas into "cantons" between the new wall and the separating borders.
ISRAEL ATTACKS SYRIAN SERIAL EXPOSING ZIONISM
The serial produced by Syrian Line Company deals with the lives of historical figures who initiated the Zionist movement and objectives.
Within this framework, France is worried that Syria may be targeted, especially after Iran had responded to the European diplomacy and showed its desire to deal transparently with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Fench well-informed sources told Al-Hayat that France sent several messages to Syria calling upon it to "surprise the world with initiatives that may be regional," in an implication to Syria's policy in Lebanon.
In response to a question by Asharq Al-Awsat about the measures that Iran can take in case of American sanctions imposed on Syria, he said, "If the American law against Syria is put into effect, Iran can help sisterly Syria in different fields."
LEBANON'S MUFTI: JIHAD IN FACE OF AMERICAN OCCUPATION
Qabbani called on those foreigners to return to their homelands, stressing the necessity of preserving the security and safety of Lebanon through unity and siding with the State. "Arab countries should also preserve their security and safety, especially in such a critical stage because when foreign occupiers threaten and brandish terrorism at our country they bet on our dissension and insecurity," he said.
He added that the five regions are: Kurdistan, Greater Baghdad, the Northwest, the Central Euphrates and the South. He pointed out that such regions had common attributes and characteristics that could make a basis for a strong federal state.
ISRAEL SELLS IRAQIS BAD FOOD IN RAMADAN
The inhabitants of North Iraq suffer from polluted air due to constant fires in pipelines and the lack of sanitation, which threatens a spread of Cholera and water pollution.
COMMANDS TO AMERICAN TROOPS IN IRAQ TO RESPECT RAMADAN'S SANCTITY
In a message to mass media the council urged them to pay heed to the holy month of Ramadan programmes so that their contents might suit the occasion's spiritual status.
According to a Ministry's statement, police patrols would arrest any person breakfasting in public, putting him in custody for 3 days, besides the legal procedures taken against him, so that that would deter him and others.
Saudi Minister of the Interior, Prince Nayef bin Abdel-Aziz described those who tried to stage demonstrations in Saudi Arabia recently as "violators of the established regime in the country and proponents of other regimes who would, accordingly, be faced because they tried to foment sedition in the country."
Under this headline, Rashid Khashana of Al-Hayat writes an article on page 9, which runs to the following effect: Turkey and Iran are vying to reinforce their positions in Iraq and to affect the process of remapping regional affairs, together with attempts to reach an understanding with America regarding sharing out roles in the new Iraq through exploiting the chaos running rampant in the post-war stage.
The two parties are betting on an American cover for their regional influence. Ankara knows that the Americans are for the establishment of a pro-Ankara government in Baghdad. Tehran is now trying to bring about a disengagement with Washington regarding the nuclear programme in a bid to reach a regional understanding, which arouses Turkish fears especially in light of the hardships undergone by American forces which might force it to be in accord with the Iranians.
Like the Iranians, some of the ruling elite in Turkey are trying to pick from worn-out books stories of the Arab treachery during the first World War in order to justify alliance with Israel and avenging itself on the Arabs!
However, should we blame the Iranians and the Turks for placing their own interests above other considerations while the Arabs have neither clear vision for the future of Iraq nor a will to impose their role in remapping it?
"We appeal to all ministries and official and governmental bodies as well as local and international organizations to necessarily compensate those victims both psychologically and financially and cooperate with those oppressed people to provide them with job opportunities and end their grievances," he continued.
AMERICAN COURSES TO TRAIN GULFIDES IN DEMOCRACY
Campbell pointed out that Iraq's participation for the first time was very important as it stressed the fact that Iraq should (geographically and politically) be part of the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf.
AL EMERGENCY MEETING PUT OFF SINE DIE
IRAN PUSHES AHEAD WITH URANIUM ENRICHMENT
LIZ CHENEY TO VISIT EGYPT LATE THIS YEAR TO THRASH OUT WOMEN'S PROGRAMS
In a new initiative, the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) received pledges from opposition parties not to nominate candidates for their parties to contest by-elections in the constituencies which will fall vacant as a result of the 15 draft deputies deposition as well as the death of another two deputies and another deputy who received a judicial sentence causing him to lose confidence which is one of the conditions that should be constitutionally met by parliament deputies. All such seats that fell vacant belong to the ruling NDP in Egypt. They will be declared vacant next Wednesday, which would confine competition in the constituencies in the by-elections which would be held in December to the ruling party candidates exclusively in light of expectations that over 80% of these constituencies would announce the NDP candidates as non-opposed winners due to the lack of any opponents unless surprises erupted from unexpected parties that could enter for competition for those seats.
On the other hand, the representatives of the parties which participated in the dialogue whose parties' relation with Muslim Brotherhood was targeted by the government, mockingly talked about the dialogue and voiced surprise at the attempts to exclude Muslim Brotherhood.
He also voiced disappointment at excluding Muslim Brotherhood from the dialogue and the continued crackdowns on the group's activists.
He added that the diversity of trends represented by the guests who attended the banquet was regarded as a testimonial for the group. He wished that representatives of the officialdom had attended the banquet to see for themselves and to have mercy on the country when they listen to the speeches delivered if they wanted reform. He added that the banquet was an elegy rather than a festival as the speeches delivered were more of a requiem for the nation that was being suffocated.
Marking the 47th anniversary of the Tripartite Invasion (carried out by Israel, Britain and France), Farghali said he would refer the case to the People's Assembly and ask the government to support it.
The paper added that the value of the deal would amount to two billion dollars to partially cover the needs of the Israeli Electricity Company for 15 years.
The paper noted that Sharon justified his refusal by saying that the Palestinian National Authority should be deprived of its share in any deal to deny the alleged terrorist organizations access to such funds.
Well-informed sources said that Welch emphasized that Washington was seeking to push the peace process forward and prepare the climate for the Iraqis to get into power.
This controversial issue, in particular, concentrates on the impact of the American pressure that emerged on the heels of the September 11th incidents and then escalated or even crystallized apparently in the war on Iraq.
This does not, however, mean that every tendency to reform or change is the outcome of such interference exclusively; as by so doing we will see things from a historically false perspective deeming the September 11th 2001 not only a turning point but also the start of history.
The change that started from within the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) in response to negative results appeared in its performance in the legislative elections of 2000 and put up a new way of thinking in its annual congress last September.
The most important outcome resulting from the NDP's change process was the emergence of a new wing willing to carry out a gradual yet genuine reform in the political system for two reasons. Firstly; it is aware that its role will not be possible without activating the political life. Secondly; the reform required for such activation has become necessary to face big internal problems and consolidate the society's interactions with rather than against the outside element.
The expected amendment in the Law on Parties will result in the formation of new parties that can vitalize to the dormant political life.
There are more than one Nasserite party, forefront of which is Al-Karama (Dignity) Party led by MP Hamdin Sabbahi, which is expected to be the best embodiment of the nationalist trend.
This map will be more vital and competitive because the rising reformist trend in the ruling party is aware of the danger of going on controlling the partisan system.
Although some cast doubt on the seriousness of the Jamaa Islamia's reconsideration, there are some signs confirming that it undergoes a strategic turning point. Some see that it is a tactical step it resorted to due to its weakness after it had failed to change the regime by force.
The change of the political map is likely to be deeper and more comprehensive if it contained the change that is taking place in the map of the fundamentalist movements through licensing Al-Wasat Party allowing the reformation of the Jamaa Islamia.
NDP'S SECRET AGENDA OF INTER-PARTY DIALOGUE
At the top of those differences is the NDP decision to confine dialogue discussions about the political reform to the paper prepared and presented by the NDP in its first annual congress held during the period from September 26th to 28th.
It talks for instance, about non-discrimination against women and the necessity of activating the civil society and producing a new social contract between the citizen and the state. So long as the citizen demands his rights, he has also some duties to perform in the first place.
They demand basic things which they see as the means of achieving radical political reform such as the amendment of the constitution, the cancellation of the emergency law, the amendment of the president's election system and limiting his powers, setting up an independent judiciary body to supervise the elections from A to Z. Such demands, however, according to the aforementioned preparatory meetings and to NDP warnings would have to be forgotten by the opposition parties otherwise the dialogue might be undermined while just in the offing. The NDP also asked opposition parties to grope for a compromise with it through the agreement on amending laws like practicing political rights, parties and professional syndicates under the pretext that if you do not have the best, make the best of what you have.
Numan Goma's latest article where he vehemently launched a broadside at Muslim Brotherhood was entirely in the NDP's interest.
Opposition leftist Tagamo'h (Grouping) Party started on Saturday the first step to change its political facade after 27 years of establishment in 1976 by changingtorical leader and founder Khalid Moheyeddin, who will assume an honourable post. Candidature will be opened to central leading positions' elections.
It might be mentioned that the Tagamo'h party held an emergency meeting late last year during which it endorsed the final amendments of its new statute which included an article confining the period of leadership in his office to only two terms (8 years). This article will result in comprehensive changes in the party ranks including the posts of the party leader and his deputy and 13 party secretaries in the governorates. It is noteworthy that Moheyeddin refused efforts made by some of his supporters to revoke the article so that he would be the party leader for good. He emphasized that others should be given room for posts.
The students called for revoking the results of these elections and holding new ones based on law as well as transparency rules.
In response, the grand sheikh told them that the Islamic uniform they put on is obligatory for Muslim women and that well-educated and intellectual women should appear in this way so as to avoid extremist ideologies.
AL-AZHAR CALLS FOR CLOSING FIRST BELLY-DANCE SCHOOL IN EGYPT
A total of one hundred students, male and female, have so far joined it, while it was planned to receive 120 students. Only students who hold Thanawya Amma (general secondary education certificate) are allowed to join the school which acquires a tuition of 1,000 pounds for the first year, and 1,500 pounds for the second and third years. Graduates will get accredited certificates that allow them to work with diverse troupes.
According to Sheikh Farahat al-Said, former general supervisor of Islamic Mission Cities at Al-Azhar, dancing runs counter to the principles of all religions.
Sheikh Sayed al-Iraki, a member of the Al-Azhar Islamic Research Academy, said the belly-dance school and its likes such as ballet schools, where girls appear nude, are un-Islamic for spreading profligacy.
AL-AZHAR SHEIKH: HUMAN CLONING RELIGIOUSLY IMPERMISSIBLE
"It is a heresy that has been medically, religiously and socially encountered," Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar added.
In contrast to the absence of Ramadan breakfast (Iftar) banquets held by political forces at the beginning of Ramadan, Christians in Egypt started to organize several public breakfast banquets for Muslims under the slogan of national unity, thus following the suit of St Mark Episcopate Patriarch Pope Shenuda who organizes a huge breakfast banquet to which he will invite a galaxy of political and religious figures on the top of whom is Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh, Dr. Sayyed Tantawi. This year, the banquet will be held on November 13th.
RAMADAN IN EGYPT: DISAPPEARANCE OF MEAT
Hussein Mabrouk, 41, who is a stockist in Lazoghly, Cairo, says, "We have been selling nuts, dried apricots and fruits for a quarter of a century in this store and I have never seen such a recession as we are witnessing these days. This shop used to yield proceeds that amounted to several thousands of pounds daily. Now the day when we earn LE300 is regarded as a lucky day.
This also reflected on breakfast meals in houses as pastries and carbohydrates dominated the meals while animal proteins of red or white meat retreated after the price of one kilo of meat in some areas hit LE35. Meat, therefore, vanished, and so did fast breaking banquets which big companies and factories used to give to their personnel, workers and guests. Instead of scores of invitations which used to be addressed, only one or two guests are invited at best.
In spite of the high tempo of the periodic meetings held by Egyptian and Iranian foreign ministers and the messages exchanged to exchange points of view regarding relations in addition to consultations on the regional and international issues, it is still too early, according to identical Egyptian and Iranian sources, to talk about the possibility of the restoration of diplomatic relations severed between Cairo and Tehran in 1979.
He pointed out that Cairo and Tehran were almost agreed on the necessity of handing power over to the Iraqi people and setting a schedule for the American and British forces withdrawal from Iraq. He added that the two parties emphasized their keenness on Iraq's stability and regional safety.
Statistics issued by the Israeli Exportation Institute uncovered that Egypt had imported goods and products from Israel during the first ten months of the current year worth 20 million dollars or the equivalent of 184 million pounds.
Egyptian MPs received clear government assurances that no Egyptian youths working in Israel or married to Israeli wives have so far applied for getting the Israeli nationality or abandoning the Egyptian one. In the meantime, relevant Egyptian authorities still insist on turning down any applications to grant the offspring of Egyptian young men married to Israelis, 13 thousands in number, the Egyptian nationality.
The Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA) and other Egyptian bodies studied the offer presented by French Jews, Egyptians in origin, and declined to reply.
This controversial issue, in particular, concentrates on the impact of the American pressure that emerged on the heels of the September 11th incidents and then escalated or even crystallized apparently in the war on Iraq.
This does not, however, mean that every tendency to reform or change is the outcome of such interference exclusively; as by so doing we will see things from a historically false perspective deeming the September 11th 2001 not only a turning point but also the start of history.
The change that started from within the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) in response to negative results appeared in its performance in the legislative elections of 2000 and put up a new way of thinking in its annual congress last September.

Secondly; the reform required for such activation has become necessary to face big internal problems and consolidate the society's interactions with rather than against the outside element.
The expected amendment in the Law on Parties will result in the formation of new parties that can vitalize to the dormant political life.
Besides, there are many a liberal party, foremost of which are Al-Ghad (Future) Party led by MP Ayman Nour and Misr Al-Omm (Mother Egypt), which is being founded by Mohsen Lotfi Al-Sayed, grandson of Ahmed Lotfi Al-Sayed who was a leading liberal figure in Egypt.
The new parties, which were suspended for a long time, are more enthusiastic to prove their presence and ability, especially as most of them depend on generations that did not take their political opportunities including, particularly, those who were students in the seventies, which, together with the forties, is considered the most vital decade in the history of the student movement.
The tactical stand, however, does not produce all such self-criticism that is based on unprecedented in-depth jurisprudential reconsideration.
In this case, change will be comprehensive.
With the meeting expected to be held this week between the National Democratic Party (NDP) represented in its Secretary General Safwat Al-Sherif and his assistant Kamal El-Shazli on one side and Nasserite Party Leader Dia Eddin Dawoud on the other side, the first round of the national dialogue which President Mubarak had called for will have ended. Such a round has witnessed, so far, two meetings, the first on October 22nd with Tagamo'h (Grouping) Party represented in its leader Khalid Mohieddin and its secretary Refaat Al-Said, and the second on October 27th with Al-Wafd Party leader Nomaan Guma. The NDP meeting with Tagamo'h and Al-Wafd Parties ended up by the issuance of extremely short statements about their agreement on giving priority to political reform.
This paper entitled the "Rights of Citizenship and Democracy" had been prepared by the policies Secretariat headed by Gamal Mubarak who also chairs what is called Supreme Council of Policies. Both Safwat Al-Sherif and Gamal Mubarak have already unfolded the paper content on September 27th.
All such items content seems very close to the initiative announced by the American Secretary of State Colin Powell in December 2002, which was called the initiative of partnership with the Middle East.
Opposition parties voiced fears that the "covenant of honour" demanded by President Mubark was meant to set new restrictions for opposition parties under the pretext of the necessity of transporting in funding parties and their organs.
There is, therefore, unanimity that the secret agenda of the national dialogue will try to increase the isolation of Muslim Brotherhood which Washington tried to court as a political force that would compete with the NDP. Furthermore, rescuing Atef Ebeid's government from its current economic cul-de-sac through lending some sort of popularity to the NDP and its government through feigning to seek dialogue and reject monopolizing public action, giving preference to solutions that would lead to the good of the country and finally introducing a set of political reforms that allow wider participation of opposition parties in the parliament seats without threatening to cancel the NDP monopoly.
The door of candidacy will be shut on November 24th instant provided that challenges could be submitted during the period 3-10 December next. This will be prior to the party's general congress on 17-18 December to hold the party's elections. The all-out change process witnessed by the Tagamo'h - one of the oldest parties in Egypt - will include four main positions: the party leader, his two deputies, and Secretary General and four assistant secretaries general for political, organizational, public action, and preparation of leaders affairs.

Maha Medhat, a veiled announcer, told Al-Majalla weekly that she and her workmates insisted on wearing the Islamic uniform in spite of difficulties and pressure they came under. "We also insist on our jobs as announcers at the Egyptian TV even if some TV officials argued that their contracts stipulate that they cannot appear on the screen while putting on Islamic veil."
Al-Azhar scholars categorically opposed the governmental approval of a belly-dance school in Egypt as un-Islamic and unconstitutional, noting that Islam is the state's official religion and the Islamic Shari'a is the main source of legislation.
Walid Awni, master of the new belly-dance school, said students from the faculties of medicine, engineering, law and dentistry have joined the school.
It is un-Islamic for women to appear naked and excite people's carnal desires. He condemned the belly-dance school as a serious sin. Rapping all those who helped the establishment of the school, he called on parents not to allow their daughters to join it since dancing is against morality, religions and norms.
A school that spreads science and benefits people is welcome, she said, wondering "How can we allow women to appear naked and dance to entertain people?
Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh Mohamed Sayed Tantawi rejected carrying out any human cloning experiments, stressing that such experiments were religiously impermissible absurdities.
For his part, the Vatican's ambassador pointed out that he was tasked by the Vatican Pope John Paul II to invite the Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar to attend the ceremony that would be given by the Vatican to mark the 25th anniversary of Pope John Paul II's ascending to the Apostolic See.
However, other banquets were also organized by Christians especially the banquet which was organized by the Evangelical Sect in Egypt, headed by Dr. Safwat Al-Bayad two days ago (Thursday) and was attended by some Muslim Egyptian political figures headed by Egypt's Mufti (Religious Opinion Authority) Dr. Ali Gomm'a, Minsiter of Wakfs (Religious Endowments) Dr. Mahmoud Zakzouk and Minister of Environment, Dr. Mamdouh Riyadh.
Egyptian Minister of Health Dr. Mohamed Awadh Tageddin has recently entered the Ramadan fatwas (religious opnions) arena. He called on Muslims to regard blood donations as part of Zakat (alms giving).
The prices fixed for the different items may well explain Mabrouk's low proceeds. One kilogram of nuts costs LE60 while it used to be sold for only LE42 last year. Dried fruits like Mishmeshya and Qarasia (dried apricot and plum) are now displayed but almost with a placard which says "not for sale"!
Although the devaluation of the dollar on the black market indicates, by no means, improvements in the living conditions. However, conditions have improved this month on the criminal level.

It seemed, according to the sources, that Egyptian and Iranian officials were agreed on the importance of the restoration of bilateral relations to its state about a quarter of a century ago.

He went on to say that the company badly needed financial support to meet the needs of rapid development and avoid lagging behind operating airlines and meet the needs of its expanding fleet. The company has recently obtained a loan to the value of $220 million from international banks to finance its recent 5-planes deal (Airbus320). It also seeks to conclude a new loan of $720 to finance a deal for the displacement of the seven 600-300 Airbus planes to buy new planes of the A-330 model through reliance on self-initiated funds rather than any government support.
He added that the company would raise the number of flights to 7 to Jedda and Kuwait, but remap its policies in Saudi Arabia in a bid to enhance its share in air transport market between the two countries.
Some 75 bank heads, who wound up their meeting in Sharm El-Sheikh two days ago, said the estimates they prepared expect that the GDP in the Middle East and North Africa would not exceed 3%, one of lowest rates in the world, while the economic growth rate in China would hit 5-7%; in India, 8%; Europe and the US, 4.5% annually.

The first list of that agreement includes commodities such as raw materials, equipment and machinery. The customs duties imposed on such commodities ranged between 5-10%. They would receive a customs cut of 25% when putting the agreement into effect, then 25% every year till the third year.
INTEREST RATE ON POUND DEPOSITS CUT

ISRAELI JEWISH SETTLER DIRECTS WORLD INVESTMENTS IN IRAQ
According to information of the Israeli Export Institute, the Jewish settler is a lawyer identified as Marc Zal who lives at Alon - Shabot Jewish settlement in the occupied Palestinian territories on the road between Bethlehem and Hebron.
An American paper reported last September that trade deals between overseas businesses and Iraq were made through a company established by a group of Iraqi lawyers.
However, Zal is not the only Israeli who is active in Iraq as Israeli industrialists have been flocking to Iraq since Israeli Minister of Finance Benjamin Netanyahu said early this summer that Israeli businesses were now allowed to deal with Iraq, which was not a hostile country anymore, and since the Israeli ministers of trade and industry, and infrastructure enunciated their support for this step.

He is of Iraqi origin and his company is mainly active in energy.
Here is a synopsis of some excerpts from the dialogue held by Al Ahram Al Arabi magazine:
Q: Which type of monarchy do you mean; Spanish monarchy or Jordanian monarchy?
A: It started to return after the invasion of Kuwait. We set out cherishing one basic hope, namely to serve the country, liberate Iraq and its people which lost freedom for long years.
We have already organized a conference which lasted for two days running and was attended by over 600 key Iraqi figures who included intellectuals, union leaders, businessmen, military personalities as well as representatives of all sects and races in Iraq.
A: The Kurds are faithful citizens in the Iraqi state. They underwent terrible injustice in the previous eras. They, therefore, have a right to ask for guarantees to avoid facing injustices or repression similar to what they had experienced before. They, therefore, consider a federation a guarantee to avoid the recurrence of such conditions. I, however, emphasize that democracy is the only guarantee to avoid such recurrence.
A: Yes, I have. They came to Iraq thinking that we have no institutions or history, as if we just came from the desert and as if it were they who would teach us how to run our country's affairs.
A: We are for peaceful resistance to put an end to the American occupation of Iraq as the Americans use the armed resistance as a pretext for extending the period of occupation to allegedly combat terrorism. They use the same pretext to cancel the state's institutions.
They certainly remember their life in Iraq quite well. Even while in Israel they still adhere to their Arabic language and Iraqi culture. On the other hand, regarding the relation with Israel, we entirely support the Palestinian people and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state under its legitimate leadership. We also support the establishment of permanent and just peace in the region. However, I would like to emphasize that Iraq is not a neighbouring country of Israel and the Palestinian issue had better be left to Israel and the countries neighbouring it as such countries have special circumstances through which they may deal with Israel.

SAUDI ARABIA CLOSES DOWN GAS INITIATIVE FILE WITH SIGNING WITH FOUR RUSSIAN, CHINESE, SPANISH AND ITALIAN COMPANIES
However, he did not uncover the value of the banking collateral. In a press conference held yesterday (March 7), the Saudi Oil Minister said his country's government is taking time in putting up the other areas for bid. These areas - the Red Sea and North Saudi Arabia - are expected to have abundant quantities of natural gas, he said, adding that studies indicate that there might be large quantities of natural gas in these areas. However, he said it is wise to take time in putting these areas up for bid till the results of Rub' Al-Khali projects come to light.
Studies, made by the Oil Ministry up to 2025, asserted that consumption quantities that should be available by that time should range between 12 billion and 14 billion cubic feet daily, said the Minister. Current gas capacity amounts to seven billion cubic feet and gas production in the areas, over which agreements were signed yesterday, will provide about seven billion cubic feet. One of the motives of attracting foreign companies is the discovery of the remaining quantity. Russian Company:

The help of international expertise will be sought, in addition to the expertise owned by Sinopec, considered to be one of the biggest gas-producing companies in China.
Five, out of 22, companies were qualified for contesting the bid and contracts. Lukoil won the contract of Zone (A), the Chinese Sinopec won the Zone (B) and Enni and Repsol won Zone (C). In the meantime, they got a contract to sell gas, as they were afraid of ARAMCO competition with them.

OPEC HEAD: "OPEC WILL GUARANTEE OIL SUPPLIES ON INTERNATIONAL MARKETS"
Addressing reporters during a visit to this oilfield, situated at the Saudi Rub'Al-Khali, the source said, "We have received an order to decrease production by 30,000 barrels per day as of March 1. No official reason was mentioned, but we thought that it is attributed to OPEC decision." It is to be mentioned that before the latest decision, Al-Shaiba oilfield had been producing about 600,000 barrels per day of the excellent light Arab crude oil.
The project is an Egyptian shareholding company. It is erected on an area of 1.2 million square meters at Damietta Harbour. It includes a quay to export gas and a terminal to treat and liquefy gas.

MINISTERS OF GAS-EXPORTING COUNTRIES STRESS IMPORTANCE OF PUMPING NEW INVESTMENTS TO MEET RISE IN INTERNATIONAL DEMAND
Sameh Fahmi delivered a speech in which he said Egypt is committed to linking the Arab Gas pipeline to the European gas network via Turkey to Rumania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Austria, and via Turkey to Greece and Italy. This comes within the framework of two agreements of intent, signed with these seven countries during the Euro-Mediterranean conference last year. It is to be mentioned that Egypt started to export natural gas to Jordan last July through the first stage of the Arab Gas pipeline, being extended between the two cities of Al-Aqaba (Jordan) and Al-Rihab (along the Syrian borders) during the second stage. Then, the pipeline from Syria to Lebanon and Turkey will be completed.
In the gas conference, being held in Cairo, Edmond Dawkoro, Nigeria's Oil Adviser, said to reporters: "We have witnessed a new balance on the market during the past few months...therefore, we should increase the targeted oil price."
According to OPEC rules, the Organization should amend production by 500,000 barrels per day up or down, compared to the production ceiling, if the basket price deviated from the targeted price range ($22-28 per barrel) for 20 working days on end.
In this context, Libyan Foreign Minister Abdel Rahman Shalgam met yesterday (14th March) with the president of the US Occidental Oil Company and with the attendance of a number of the Company's board of directors members.
He added, "When the Americans return to Libya our oil production would be improved and prices would be better".

For his part, Kuwaiti Energy Minister Ahmed Fahd Al-Sabah said yesterday that "Kuwait is ready to consider delaying the application of the decision to reduce production as of 1st April if the OPEC member states found there was a shortage of supplies and a rise in prices".
However, the OPEC ministers agreed last month to reduce the official production ceiling by one million barrels daily as of next April and stop the excesses in production estimated at around 1.5 million barrels daily.
The sources said that Norway, an agency member, proposed that OPEC be allowed to have a seat of observer in the periodic meetings of the agency.
This way, the OPEC crude price has remained over the targeted price range of $22-28 per barrel for four months in a row, except for one day only.
Meanwhile, Petrologistics, which monitors tanker traffic, said that despite their pledges to stop quota violations, it was likely that OPEC members had cut their production by only 150,000 barrels per day.
On 11th March, the Senate passed a resolution urging the Administration to stop buying oil, which the Administration has been doing to raise strategic reserves by 53 million barrels during the next one and a half years.
He said that the Administration was quite reluctant at that time to suspend oil purchases for beefing up the strategic reserves. "The Administration has criticized the move of the Senate.
President George W. Bush had announced in November 2001 following the 11 September attacks that he intended to increase the strategic reserves to their maximum of 700 million barrels. Only the Administration has the authority to use these strategic reserves should a serious stop of oil supplies occur.
The President of British Petroleum-Kuwait responded to questions from reporters following a symposium hosted by the Kuwait Economy Society on the evening of 16 March by saying that British Petroleum had been a partner of the Kuwaiti Government for 70 years and had been the first company to return to Kuwait after the liberation and sign a contract with Kuwait Petroleum Company.
As to his company's conviction of the need to invest some $7 billion in the northern oilfields and whether BP considered that expenditure economically feasible, he said, "The project's term is twenty years, which means that it is a long-term project. The company will use the capabilities at its disposal and will examine all the plans and program proposed to it within the context of its bid for the project. This project is a giant endeavor that requires such large funding.
Dealers said that the decline in crude oil and petrol stocks under the normal levels would be a factor that would support prices.
OPEC ministers agreed last month to reduce the official production ceiling by one million barrels a day as of 1st April to reach 23.5 million barrels a day in order to prevent a strong growth of stocks in the second quarter, which would push prices down.
"This was already decided", he said.

Undoubtedly, the Arab world and its peoples are in need of democracy, which has become an urgent issue in the life of Arab peoples not only because democracy is the shortest way to wise rule capable of making progress and involving the peoples in bearing the responsibility, but because the world's perspective of the problems of development and conflict in this region has become connected to how much political and economic maturity has been achieved so that it may be better able to defend its interests in the face of the ambitions and inclinations of foreign domination.
I, however, disagree with President Bush on a point which has passed over his head so far in spite of the arguments and discussion raised about it a few months ago - democracy is a system that cannot b e imposed from without, but only emanates from within through an accumulative process of political practice.
It is true that Egypt has taken the lead among the Arabs in the peace process, but it turned out that Egypt's concept of peace was at variance with what America meant by peace.
Prime Minister Atef Ebeid opened Wednesday the International Qur'an competition saying that Egypt will remain the guardian of the Holy Qur'an and will use all means to spread it.
IRANIAN OFFICIAL CONSIDERS IRAN'S NUCLEAR FILE IN CAIRO
AL-AZHAR SHEIKH LEADS PRAYER IN COPTIC CATHEDRAL
Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh led Muslim attendants in the Maghreb (sunset) prayer inside the Cathedral.
In his speech, Shenouda said, "We, Muslims and Copts alike, have been living in love and affection since the Arab conquest of Egypt. We haved lived together side by side throughout all ages enjoying welfare and struggling against difficulties. "Out of his love and appreciation to Copts conqueror Saladin presented them a monastery that was named after him as 'Sultan' in appreciation for him, although monasteries usually carry names of saints."
Asharq Al-Awsat learnt that Shekid failed to court 3 intellectuals whom he invited for acquaintance.
The annual per capita quota of foodstuffs amounted to 730 kg from 591 kg in 1991, an official report issued by the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAMS) said.
A message sent by a youth from Muslim Brotherhood group to its General Guide, Ma'moun Al-Hudhaibi triggered a controversy about how powerful the group in Egypt really is, how effective it is on the political arena and the possibility of it returning one day to the use of violence to achieve its goals.
When will Muslim Brotherhood call to Jihad?
Al Hudhaibi said that the state of affairs now present in Egypt and other Arab and Islamic countries required concerted efforts, unity of ranks and mastery of civilizational dialogue as well as forbearance and fortitude so that the march may proceed. All this requires good faith and good intentions besides strong will and toughness as the road is far from smooth or covered with flowers. Once you seek to attain such a level of faith, understanding and action as individuals, families as units of the society and on the level of the community as a people that have a message and a goal, the nation's power will come to the surface and its voice will rise proclaiming its say.
A study compiled jointly by the National Council for Population, Cairo University and the American University in Cairo (AUC) uncovered 400 thousand urfi marriages (unofficial clandestine marriage) among Egyptian youth in the 18-30 age bracket, noting that the total number of that age group hit 10 million young men and women who have never married before.
The study highlighted, for the first time, the role played by lawyers and doctors in facilitating urfi marriages. Lawyers agree to write the contracts of that clandestine marriage and doctors agree to carry out surgeries necessary to prove that young women, married secretly, are still virgins.
That scheme would have been implemented if Egypt had not rejected and confronted it warning forces preparing for that scheme that it would not stand helpless towards any foreign intervention in Sudan, Sulaiman added.
The sources also said that the US Administration would second the plan with some 25 billion dollars with a view to achieving economic and political goals and energizing free trade exchange between the merger countries.
Some analysts see that the US now thinks that depending on the so-called "regionally major countries" so as to be the guards who defend the US political interests in the Middle East is a fiasco.
Within this perspective, the creation of this "new Mideastern vacuum" that focuses on "occupied Iraq," Israel and Turkey, in which Jordan and occupied Palestine will be forcibly merged, will help expand and fix the US "global, military" existence in the region. This is meant to alleviate pressure of competition, be it doctrinal, strategic or commercial, that comes from Europe and Asia (China and Japan) or Federal Russia.
These plans aim at marginalizing and besieging the European role in any future construction operation in the Middle East. Therefore, everybody has to take care.
These restrictions are obligatory to all shipping companies, ports, and oil harbours. However, sources said that several OPEC countries including Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Kuwait, and Indonesia still have a long way to go before announcing their commitment to these restrictions.
The new law stipulates that the security officers aboard be trained. The law also provides for measures in emergency cases aimed at facing a terrorist attack and another set of measures for tightening security at ports and coastal harbours.
The UAE is about to prepare plans for the security of ports.
AL-NAIMI: SPECULATORS AND TIGHT STOCKPILES OF U.S. GASOLINE BEHIND OIL PRICES RISE
"I am convinced there are two reasons for such a high price -- the reduced quantity of petrol in America and speculators who are convinced there is going to be a lack of crude."
While OPEC President Purnomo Yusgiantoro has said the cartel would not back track on its decision to curb supplies. "I do not know if they have changed idea," Naimi said. "We have to think why prices are so high based on the realities of the market and not on things that have nothing to do with real demand."
The establishment of this company is a very important stage to participate in developing oil and gas industry in Qatar to support the domestic economy and provide job openings for Qatari youths to get them engaged in the field of running operations of internationally authorized drilling companies.
Oil prices have sharply increased since OPEC agreed last month on reducing the official production quotas at 4% as of 1st April in a bid to stop the accumulation of stocks in the second quarter, a period witnesses low consumption due to seasonal reasons.
He added that on date has set for the expected postponement. He commented, "This idea will be discussed among other issues in the coming OPEC ministerial meeting which will be held in Vienna next week".
I have not heard this suggestion before from any member and I do not back it".
He said, "Of course, we are worry.
The more-than-350-page report, issued by the Washington-based Strategic and International Studies Center under the title "energy development in the Middle East" and authored by the well-known researcher Anthony Cordesman, indicated how the developments in the Middle East affect international oil supplies.
The report reviewed the security issues that might affect the region, including the problems that are caused by arms race and terrorism.
Importance of Middle East Oil: The report said unless tremendous technical development takes place or other alternatives to oil are developed, dependence on the Middle East oil will increase with the lapse of time.
These stocks rose anew in 1998, hitting 1.052.9 billion barrels of crude oil, and the share of the Middle East and North Africa went up again, reaching 716.2 billion barrels of crude oil (the equivalent of 68% of the total world stock).
The report also asserts that the Middle East and North Africa will play a vital role in meeting the increasing needs in the field of oil owing to clear and simple reasons, foremost among which are the fact that they harbor the biggest reserve in the world and that their oil is cheaper. Besides, the infrastructure of exportation is abundantly available at competing prices. Production cost, in addition, is relatively cheap compared to most of the other world regions. Domestic and future production will not constitute a big rate of total production.
Prices were determined by 10 factors, the least of which was supply, he added, pointing out that the current price was less than $32 per barrel for the OPEC crude basket.
"The new mining system in Saudi Arabia is about to be passed by the Cabinet," he explained. "Once it is passed, a mining strategy will be made.
SPANISH "SIPSA" FIRST WESTERN COMPANY CARRYING IRAQI OIL FROM KHOR AL-AMIYA
Indian refineries have been the sole agencies that took oil shipments from Khor Al-Amiya so far. In the meantime, European and American companies said they were still making sure of the security conditions at the harbor.
It is to be mentioned that Khor Al-Amiya has not been used for tens of years, except for a short period of time before the war last year, during which it was exploited in smuggling.
An official at a major oil company said: "It seems that they lack some equipment."
Oil from this region has become needed, especially from Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, which have oil reserves threefold that of the US.
US increasing need to oil The United States is considered among the biggest oil exporting and importing countries. It is the third oil producer in the world. However, its confirmed oil reserve stands only at 2 percent of the world's. It is also the biggest oil consuming country.
This pipeline is 1090 miles long (1700 km) and its pipes' diameter is 42 inches. It is extended from Russia's borders cross Azerbaijan and Georgia till Turkish Ceyhan Port on the Mediterranean Sea.
Last January, the Gulf countries produced more than 14 million barrels daily over half of which came from Saudi Arabia. OPEC produced more than 32 million barrels daily in the reporting period. OPEC's current production will be tenfold that of the Caspian Sea region in 2010. As for the reserves, the region has confirmed reserves ranging between 17 and 33 billion barrels, in addition to more than 180 billion barrels as hypothetical reserves.
British companies set foot in Libya to conclude energy and aviation deals thanks to improvement of relations. However, the best advantages of this oil-rich country are likely to go to American companies.
Last month, the US said the companies that were compelled to leave oilfields in 1986 when Regan's Administration imposed sanctions on Libya can hold talks to return as a first step towards softening sanctions.
US President Bush extended sanctions imposed on Libya last January for a further year. It is not expected that he might raise them before November next.
EGYPTIAN PETROJET SIGNS LABOR MOU WITH JORDAN FOR BUILDING PIPELINE BETWEEN EGYPT & JORDAN
The two parties also agreed that Petrojet would be allowed to bring its own specialized labor at 50% of the labor of the project, while the Jordanian Ministry of Labor would be fully responsible for all the administrative work related to the employment of Jordanian workers on the project.
Sources at sea transportation industry said yesterday (April 5) that the pumping of oil through the pipeline that extends from Kirkuk, north Iraq to the Turkish Ceyhan Port on the Mediterranean Sea was resumed on April 3, 2004 following a two-week stop approximately.
The Oil Ministry announced mid last month that it had pumped six million barrels from the pipeline of Kirkuk as it managed to repair it following sabotage done to it in August 2003. It was said that the pumping operation was meant to test it, although the pumped quantity was put up in an auction and was bought by American and European firms through six offers.
STUDY SAYS OPEC MEMBERS SHOULD INVEST $160 BILLION TO BOOST CAPACITY TO 44 MILLION BPD BY 2010
It also pointed out the continuation of the vital and essential roles of both OPEC and OAPEC on the international oil market in the presence of indications that demand on their petroleum for filling the increasing world demand in the medium and long terms, as well as the fluctuation of oil prices, made it imperative for both organizations to have high flexibility and economic managements with unconventional ways of thinking, so as to effect a active role for petroleum that would extend over the next two or three decades in such a manner that would be beneficial to member countries while also allowing the flow in new investments into that vital industry.
SAUDI ADVISER: "WEAK CAPACITY OF AMERICAN REFINERIES STANDS BEHIND PETROL PRICE RISES.
In an interview with the CNN, he said: "In fact, there is a slight surplus and this is the reason for OPEC's reduction of production."
"It is difficult for foreign oil companies and domestic suppliers to sell petrol on the American market because the federal environmental laws require that different kinds of fuel should be sold in the US to combat pollution," Al-Jubair said.
An oil source in Syria said yesterday (April 5) that a three-company consortium had been selected for developing the gas sector in Syria at a value of about $700 million. These companies are Petro-Canada (Canada), Occidental (US) and Petrovac (Britain).
An official at a foreign company said in July 2003 that international oil companies, including Total of France and Occidental, tabled offers to develop gas fields in the Central Zone in Syria.
On the other hand, Syrian Minister of Oil and Mineral Resources Dr. Ibrahim Al-Hadid inaugurated the Syrian fourth exhibition of oil and gas. He said: "This exhibition is a point at which national and foreign companies meet and a chance for benefiting from the foreign companies' experience in the domain of oil and gas."
Special concentration will be given to the latest contemporary technologies in the oil and gas industry. The exposition includes new national pavilions, representing Iraq, Egypt and Polonia in a distinctive participation by all companies operating in the oil and gas sector.
Ineluctable war: Does Israel really plan to launch large-scale air raids on Damascus itself, rather than on its outskirts as it did recently when it hit a target at Ein al-Saheb?
Articulately enough, Israel wants to wage war in order to overcome the fallout of heated dossiers in the Middle East under the umbrella of the U.S. position which some Israeli experts see will not recur so Israel should seize this American backup, emboldening a French journalist to say that it has turned U.S. President George W. Bush to be a spokesman for the Israeli government.
-The fallout of the goings-on in Iraq spurred Israel to consecrate a standing supremacy of its military capabilities at the regional level, making it easy for Israel to use this supremacy to trigger off fresh equations at the Palestinian issue level and impose its conditions and terms for a Palestinian state in a form to be set by Tel Aviv, rather than the Palestinians and some Arabs.
Many observers see that south Lebanon is the natural entrance to any clash that may lead to a Middle Eastern war under several excuses. The recent shelling, by unidentified gunmen, which mistakenly targeted a Lebanese town is a relevant example. The Israeli Mossad is likely to enlist a group to launch missiles at any Israeli settlement to hit civilians just to serve Israeli goals later on by blaming Syria and Hizbollah for the shelling just as Israel, along with Washington has been doing for several months.
Syrian response: How will Syria and the Arabs respond?
Middle East war harbingers have already started to show up with American insistence on adopting the Syria accountability act and with the continued American escalation, shrugging off provocative facts for all the Arabs.
The Iraqi-US relations are expected to witness more controversy in the coming period over how to run those two files.
Al-Khayyat sees that the sum earmarked for the industry sector ($777 million) out of the total sums allocated by the last donor countries meeting in Madrid is not enough to develop that sector.
The foreign investments suggested to flow into Iraq are delayed now due to the current security situation, he said.
Although the Egyptian constitution defines the mechanisms of power transition in the case of the President's death or disability, the absence of an appointed deputy President has raised questions and some concern.
They specially indicate the control role played by the military establishment in the Egyptian political system.
In spite of the reservations some people have regarding the role of the military establishment or differences between Egypt and other countries, Gamal Mubarak managed, in the last period, to win the support of a broad sector of youth.
Soliman, however, remained out of the limelight for long years and so far his voice was not heard by the Egyptians who started to see his pictures only in the last few years. He is a graduate of the Military Academy, the same class of Tantawi's which means that both of them reached sixty, thus making the appointment of either unlikely.
During the 45-minute absence due to sudden illness, Al-Sherif was the dynamo of events and more prominent than the rest.
CAIRO UNIV. PROFESSORS ASK FOR GAMAL MUBARAK'S INTERVENTION
Signatories to the letter addressed to the university president stressed that should the university allocate a certain building for an NGO, this NGO should not be the FGF in specific.

"The Islamic trend not only includes Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) Group but also other Islamic groups that have their own political perspectives and presence," Ismail added.
The conversion to Islam by Cole, who attracts many AUC female students to study the subjects he teaches at the AUC, came as a surprise to all his students and acquaintances. However, close friends of his did not raise their eyebrows at Cole's move, with a female friend of his having wondered, "Really?
However, life in his U.S. hometown Berkley, where he returned to stay for some time, is totally different. "Islam is a beautiful religion," was the first phrase he uttered in a lecture he delivered when he returned. But, he soon came back to the Muslim world, notably the AUC which was a purely secular place in the 1970s. He commented by saying that even the Arabic language was rarely used at the AUC where Islam was nothing but history, art, architecture and field tours in museums and old mosques.
They toured oceans and continents and so did I. They followed Gospel, but they did no know the Holy Quran. For me, I know it and my task is to disseminate it."
Mubarak seemed tired and sweated heavily to the extent that he used a handkerchief eight times to dry his sweat. While delivering his speech, Mubarak stammered and then faltered. His bodyguards immediately helped him exit from the hall to a nearby room in the Parliament where nobody was allowed to enter except for his chamberlain, Zakarai Azmi and Defence Minister, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi.
The sources pointed out that the President would also reduce the number of hours allocated daily for receiving senior Arab and foreign officials who visit Cairo.
This took place during Gamal Mubarak's meeting with National Democratic Party (NDP) youth at the end of the indoctrination training course organized by the youth secretariat headed by Hossam Awadh, and attended by 300 of youth secretaries and young women of NDP centres and sectors nationwide.

Mofaz presented American officials with the new Israeli policy regarding Iran, which is based on the fact that Israel can by no means allow Iran to possess nuclear weapons. He informed the Americans that the USA and the world had a few months to deny Iran access to a nuclear bomb and that Iran would reach the point of no return by 2004 when it would be impossible to stop its nuclear programme.
Following the visit paid by Israeli Defence Minister Shaoul Mofaz and Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Washington, their entourage were convinced that the American Administration understand the Israeli policy at all fronts including the Palestinian cause, dealing with new Palestinian Premier Ahmed Qurie (Abu Alaa), and even Israeli military threats to Syria, Iran and Lebanon.
Rather, they lauded Mofaz's "steadfast and persistent" policy, which reflects his principles. The Americans, especially Congressmen, dealt with Netanyahu as if he were an international movie star. They even lauded his abilities to carry out his economic plan (which was laid down in the American Department of Treasury and presented to Israel as an indispensable condition for Washington to issue guarantees worth 9 billion dollars and additional aid of one billion dollars).
The Iranian-Syrian-Lebanese issue was the most prominent topic in Mofaz's agenda during his talks in the White House and the Pentagon.
He also showed a picture of an Iranian rocket on which there was a Persian sentence saying; "This rocket was prepared for destroying the state of Israel."
Israel may also deal a more powerful strike to terrorist targets in Syria," said Mofaz who was convinced that the American Administration understood and supported his claims.
Mofaz's talks also broached the issue of Hizbullah and its activity and stand towards the exchange of POWs together with its threats to kidnap Israeli soldiers.
The girl, 15, said she was told to give up Islam if she wanted to stay at school. But, she held fast to Islam, wearing veil and fasting during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, noting that she would insist on Islam even if she was punished by being dismissed from her school.

The board will be presented a report by Al Baradi over his latest visit to Tehran and his meeting with Iranian officials.
ISRAEL MANUFACTURES NEW ESPIONAGE DRONE WITH SATELLITE PREPARATIONS
HIZBULLAH: IRAQIS DON'T NEED OUR HELP
FEARS OF ADOPTING FEDERALISM IN IRAQI CONSTITUTION
Observers in the Iraqi capital see that Kurdish political organizations, which advocate federalism, pay much attention to the demands of some political organizations concerning federalism because this will provide the required cover for adopting federalism at a large scale.

EGYPTIAN-EAST AFRICAN BUSINESS COUNCIL TO CONVENE
Minister of Foreign Trade Youssef Botros Ghali will head a business delegation to start on Saturday a 4-day visit to South Africa to boost commercial, economic and investment relations.

Al-Wafd exclusively publishes the secrets of Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) Governor Mahmoud Abul-Oyoun's removal on Monday evening, replacing him with Faruk al-Okda.
Informed sources told Al-Wafd that the dismissal came due to deepening disputes between the former governor and the government, the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) and its committees.

The report underlined that the shrine of the rabbi Jacob Abu Hasira is nothing but a tomb of an ordinary person who does not represent any civilizational, cultural, or religious value for the Egyptian people.
Therefore, it is not allowed to describe these tombs as Islamic or Coptic monuments because this is a big error.

The Egyptian government is exerting strenuous efforts to attract foreign investments anew as this source is the least expensive.
This choice, as viewed by former economy minister Hassan Abbas Zaki, is an alternative to borrowing from abroad, as the public budget is being financed by the state's sovereign resources. If these sovereign resources were not sufficient, the state has to resort to local loans, and then resort to borrowing from abroad, if necessary which is more expensive than financing the budget deficits and requirements of periodical investment expenditure from direct foreign investments. Indicators augur that the government might succeed.
The government is expected to push ahead with attracting foreign investments in order not to be forced to borrow from abroad, especially as the government's plan to restructure the public debt does not have many supporters and will not bring about a real increase in the volume of resources, but it will reduce some of the government burdens regarding the domestic public debt. Restructuring domestic public debt may also help the government to borrow locally again after swapping part of state's assets for part of the domestic debts.

This would reduce their exports, especially in light of expectations of a general reduction in export prices as a result of prospective competition.

While Some Palestinians are busy crystallizing "initiatives", "agreements" and "seminars" with the Israelis, Israeli Premier Ariel Sharon is making the best of every minute to impose further realities on the ground. Yesterday (28th November), Israeli sources uncovered a new settlement scheme in the southeast and west of the occupied Jerusalem under which thousands of settlement units are to be built on the land of villages affiliated to Bethlehem to prevent dividing the city of Jerusalem or returning any part of it to the Palestinians.
Regarding the new settlement scheme, a Hebrew weekly newspaper pointed out that Jerusalem's Israeli municipality as well as the Ministry of Construction and Housing had prepared the structural plan for building about 5 thousand settlement units on lands whose owners mostly live in Beit Sahour.
It includes intensive building of 3 to 4-storey housing units.
Under this headline, Al Ahram Al Arabi magazine published the following report:
He now wants the land free of its population and, therefore, tasks the Minister of the Interior Avraham Boras to implement a plan to combat the Bedouins' natural reproduction in Negev. He points out an act he will pass advocating a discount of the rise granted for having babies in a bid to minimize reproduction. The group targeted by such arbitrariness were obviously the Negev Bedouins as he openly declared that he could not possibly grant allowances to a Bedouin family that has 40 children from 3 wives married by the father!
Then, the Jewish National Fund Director openly described the future traits delineated by Zionism for Negev Bedouins saying, "The Negev Bedouins' issue has got political dimensions. However, we have only to implement the law which orders that all the population of Negev, whether Jews or Arabs be removed as such lands belonged to the state." Isaac Moshe explained the National Fund's aim behind the forestation of certain areas in Negev by saying that the National Fund thinks that forestation is the best way to prevent Bedouins from using the land.
Observers were surprised at the contradictory behaviour of Zionist Adovcates while they confiscated the Negev Bedouins' lands, they want to recruit them for the army to protect their own persecutors and usurpers of their own rights in spite of all claims blatantly aired by Zionist advocates that they are keen on the establishment of a democratic entity and respect human rights.
Arnez, like other exploiters of drudgery to defend their suppressive system, little thought of what would become of those victims when they return to their relatives and find them packed in camps after their lands and ranges are confiscated.
In reply to a question raised by Nablus deputy Mu'awiya Al-Masri about the oil derivatives' revenues of the Oil Authority, Fayadh said, "The documents related to the sums reported in the Authority are unavailable."
In reply to another question by Al-Masri, Fayadh said he could not promise the PLC to provide such information and documents in one or two days' time although he admitted to many manipulation and forgery cases.

When she was asked where she would place the Palestinian-Israeli conflict within the framework of that initiative, she said that such a conflict was just a myth used by the region's regimes as a pretext for refraining from national reforms. If such regimes, she added, had attached any importance to resolving that conflict, they would have lent a hand to the Palestinians. She, then, gave examples of some Arab countries that have for long stopped assisting the Palestinians through the Arab League.

AMERICAN INVESTMENT IN IRAQ
The US aid for Iraq is seven times as much as that extended to Israel annually. It is also twenty times bigger than that set aside for Russia's reconstruction.
Does this mean that Iraq will be the first US ally in the Middle East in lieu of Israel?
A new Iraq allied with Washington will be more able to push forward the US political agenda in the Middle East whether concerning anti-terrorism or embarking upon the large democracy project, something which can hardly be done by an ally like Israel which still constitutes the heaviest burden on the US foreign policy in the region. Although officials in America are not prepared to confess that, voices started to rise in America, especially in academic milieus, holding, directly or indirectly, the Israeli policies responsible for the growth of terrorism and the deep hostility towards America worldwide.

DOLLAR RETREAT ON BLACK MARKET

Understanding over certain steps to restructure these debts has already been reached, as they will be paid off according to schedule.
This sum, they said, represents 20% of the State's budget. In response, the Egyptian government decided to review the data available at government storehouses to refurbish the stored furniture and reuse it.
Experts said that the structure of the Egyptian imports changed greatly last year in favor of the European Union countries, Britain, and China. All these countries witnessed an increase in their currencies before the dollar, which reflected on the final total value of Egyptian imports.
Deputy head of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce Mohamed Al-Masry suggested searching for other alternatives to materials, intermediary products, production requirements and European capital equipment whose prices jumped against the dollar as well as other currencies related to the American currency including the Egyptian pound.
Two Egyptian companies managed to win contracts for delivering Egyptian marble for the biggest national project in Korea.
The Korean government set up a committee of advisors to visit the international companies nominated for that project in the six countries to check the degree of commitment to quality and delivery standards. It, eventually, chose the two Egyptian companies due to the high quality of Egyptian marble and its manufacture.
Rashid emphasized that the delivery period had already passed successfully and without any problems. The installation operation was also admirably carried out in the Korean National Museum.
Exports of chemical substances, medicines and medical requirements increased by 21% to hit 299 million dollars as a result of the rise in exports of artificial plastics and resins and organic and inorganic chemical products.
PETROLEUM EXPORTS UP BY 52%
With regard to trade under special customs systems, the report pointed out that their exports hit 106 million dollars during the reporting period, 57 million dollars of which are under admission system and the rest under drawback system. While imports of these systems reached 1.72 billion dollars, of which 28 million dollars are under the temporary admission system and the rest are under the drawback system, said the report.
"This agreement is meant to introduce Egyptian input into French goods that are exported to West African countries so that Egyptian products could get access to African countries through the export deals concluded by French companies in that region," EFBA Chairman Mahmoud Al-Qaisi said.
A high-level bank source with Banque du Caire, on anonymity, said negotiations are still on and relevant procedures are being completed. The Central Auditing Agency (CAA) voiced remarks on the price of the deal.

It is to be noted that the two companies carried out a share exchange operation in 2001by virtue of which the CIBI owned 36% of Hermes group (dwindled after that to 20% as Hermes increased its capital early this year) at a value of 265 million pounds (LE100 million were used for buying Fleming CIIC, and LE165 were used for increasing Hermes capital).
In his exclusives to Al-Alam Al-Youm Al-Mallawani revealed that share re-exchange will maximize the document value of CIBI's shareholders by 25%, which will yield better revenues and more cash liquidity for those shareholders.
For his part, Hermes Group managing director Hassan Heikal said that the share re-exchange process is in favor of Hermes Group as well as the CIBI. Hermes will come out of this merger as the biggest investment bank in the region with revenues that hit 115 million pounds last year. During the first exchange of shares Hermes drew upon CIBI's human cadres and increased its capital. It is to be noted that Hermes group focuses on its work as an investment bank, not a contributor, he added.
The draft resolution presented by Republican Senator Arlen Spector says that President Bush will have to certify that Saudi Arabia is combating terrorism and co-operating with the USA in its war against hardliners, otherwise the kingdom would face a number of American sanctions."
ISLAMIC PARTIES IN IRAQ SEEK TO GET SECURITY DOSSIER INSTEAD OF INTERIOR MINISTRY
The American administration in Iraq believes that a powerful Iraqi security agency will play a vital role in preserving its interests and fixing a timetable for pulling its troops out of Iraq provided that a security agency of pro-America Iraqis should be formed, he said.
To marginalize the role of Islamic parties in view of the security issue will make most of their members reluctant to cooperate with the Interior Ministry, and may create a field conflict between both sides.
The timing of Powell's visit to Tunisia next Tuesday, which comes one day ahead of French President Jaques Chirac' visit to Tunisia next Wednesday and three days ahead of West Mediterranean countries summit (5 + 5) in Tunisia emphasizes that it is intended and that the U.S. is dissatisfied with the growing relations between Western European countries and Arab Maghreb countries, the same source who demanded to be unidentified added.
They are small underground organizations including cells that practise militant violence in their conflict with the secularist government in Turkey. They aim at undermining secularism and introducing an Islamic order antagonizing the West.
Moreover, there are also the Islamic Liberation Party, which is described as a radical movement that does not practise violence, and the Islamic Movement Organization.
Therefore, those movements are characterized by their intellectual and social activities and religious and educational institutions.
3- Political Islam movements:
However, the toppling of Erbakan's government in June 1997 pushed political Islam into a new stage of pressure. The Refah Party was banned in the early 1998 and most of its leaders were imprisoned or banned from practising politics including Erbakan himself.
The Justice and Development Party made a sweeping victory in the legislative elections that were held on November 3rd, 2002 when it obtained 34.5 percent of votes which made it control the parliament and form a new government alone. As for the Saadet Party, it won only 3.5 percent of votes and had, consequently, left the parliament.
The paper quoted high-placed political Israeli sources as saying, "Egypt has reconsidered its policy with Israel and decided to make a rapprochement with the Hebrew state and change its policies towards it."
However, Egyptian Foreign Ministry sources declined on Friday to comment on the Israeli newspaper's news item.
The new service will be headed at first by Iraqi Minister of the Interior, Nouri Badran who is an activist in the Iraqi National Reconciliation Movement, which includes a number of former military and intelligence officials in Baath Party.
200 Iraqis including tribal chiefs and religious scholars started to attend intensive classes in democracy in Islamic University in Al-Hillah City under the supervision of the alliance authority.
According to a report prepared by a galaxy of former Israeli intelligence bodies, President Yasser Arafat's absence would open the door before Hamas to control the Palestinian Authority and make it difficult to hold any negotiations with the Palestinians so that if Israel tried to do so, such negotiations would be "futile and ineffective".
The report pointed out that the deportation of the Palestinian President would "bolster his influence, but if he died a natural death or just stepped down due to senility or illness, the Authority as well as Fatah movement which he led would be weakened.
JERUSALEM MUFTI LASHES OUT AT "GENEVA PEACE INITIATIVE"
"Who on earth had given those who signed this damned document the right to hand the Al-Boraq Wall over to the occupation authorities? The fait accompli, however, will not change the provisions of the Sharia, as Al-Boraq Wall is part of Al-Aqsa Mosque and is also an Islamic endowment from the Sharia point of view."
The Palestinians will always be loyal to their homeland no matter how long the occupation forces will stay," Sheikh Sabri laid it bare.
A high ranking military source said, "Israeli security bodies are considering the possibility of launching a military operation inside Syria if matters took a certain course regardless of any possible consequences, in an indication to a previous Israeli threat to launch an attack on Syria.
In a serious development, tone of animosity and exchange of accusations escalated between Egypt and Israel recently. Israeli newspapers leveled broadside against President Hosni Mubarak's statements about peace in the Arab region in which he held Israel responsible for the frozen peace process.
"Israeli threats and provocation to Egypt and Syria have escalated since the resumption of political settlement negotiations according to the roadmap plan came to an end in the early autumn instant," said advisor to the Egyptian National Center for Middle East Studies Maj. Gen. Salah Selim. "Israel opted for direct aggression on Syrian territories, in a blatant challenge for the Arab Ring countries, which gave priority to negotiations and political settlement as strategic options whether in the short or long run.
Israel violated this text mentioned in the second article of the Peace Accord, particularly when it started its aggression on south Gaza Strip and swept Rafah. Egypt pointed out that Sharon's government was aggressive, irresponsible and could not respect peace commitments. Meanwhile, it confirmed its ability to defend all of its soil and punish whoever dares to violate Egypt's sovereignty.
Expert Dr. Abdel-Aleem Mohamed with Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies and former chief editor of Israeli Selections magazine expects that Israel may launch a war on Egypt in case Egypt sided with Syria against any Israeli aggression. However, Israel is currently preoccupied with making Egypt have no sympathy for Syria.
Egypt's defensive capabilities Concerning the Egyptian position and the ability of rulers to respond at any moment in case Egypt is exposed to any Israeli attacks, Dr. Mohamed says that the Egyptian leadership always emphasizes that Egypt has a defensive army capable of defending it and that without that big army there will not be a balance of power or, consequently, peace. However, if it is Israel which starts the war, Egypt will be in a defensive position to repulse this aggression. Nor will Egypt start such a war. This will take place if there is an explicit justification such as crossing existent borders or reneging on the articles of the Peace Accord. Moreover, Egypt does not consider peace with Israel a final conclusion and, therefore, it should be ready for any offensive, he pointed out.
Meanwhile, Egypt is committed to the Camp David Peace Accord and its consequences in addition to its close relations with the United States, which extends military and economic aid in the neighbourhood of two billion dollars annually.
The Israeli threats in this regard include threats to strike the High Dam with nuclear bombs and overflow the Delta and the Nile Valley. There are some other kinds of escalation such as the following threats:
* Alleging that the balance of conventional arms tilts in favour of Egypt in the recent period and instigating the American Administration to take a move in the face of such an allegation.
THE DIALOGUE IS NOT A FIASCO!
The matter is as simple as this: the Palestinians who had once the experience of the last June truce (that lasted 51 days), not a single day of which witnessed any commitment on the part of killer, Sharon, have the right to know, first of all, what Israeli and American guarantees are there to ensure the success of such a truce.
Here comes the issue of 13 Palestinian organizations delegating the National Authority to discuss such guarantees with other parties and to take political action and negotiate.
Will any talk about an immediate declaration of a Palestinian truce have any sense when the Israeli Maariv newspaper uncovers (on Friday) the details of Sharon's project for unilateral settlement with the Palestinians under which the Palestinians will be granted 57% of the West Bank lands and 86 large settlements (with 367 thousand settlers) will be annexed to the Israeli state?
Nor is it expected that, in the case of the Palestinian Authority being granted that delegation, it would be able to extort anything from the Israeli government.
GOVERNMENT BUYS UNNECESSARY FIXED ASSETS WORTH LE300 BILLION
During the inauguration of the conference, Hassanein pointed out lack of accurate inventory of contents in public warehouses.
The government denied intervening to determine the Egyptian pound rate of exchange since it was left to move according to the supply and demand mechanism last January. Analysts, however, argue that the Egyptian currency is not totally free and pointed out the official rate of exchange which has been almost fixed in spite of the increasing demand on hard currencies.
Analysts hailed Mohyi Eddin's statements, but they said such reformist opinions have often been voiced but so far the powers enjoyed by the new CBE board and governor were still unclear regarding the policies setting issue.
Industrial loan's high interest rate is also an obstacle to repayment in light of abrupt price rises of imported materials, they added.
Regarding disinclination of investment banks to finance long-range industrial projects, Abd Al-Qader pointed out two kinds of finance: firstly, funding capital commodities such as buildings, machinery and equipment, which need medium and long-range loans; secondly, funding working capital, which needs short-range credit facilities. Banks should, therefore, finance either of them, he said.
Arab Investment Bank's Loan Management Department head Ahmed Abd Al-Maguid agree with the previous opinion.
Bankrolling industrial activities should not be confined to certain banks, as such a role should be carried out by all banks so long as they have enough cash liquidity to finance any number of industrial projects, he pointed out.
Dr Hatem Al Qaranshawi, adviser to the Prime Minister and director of the Central Bank, said that the new regulation was primarily aimed at reinforcing the independence of the Central Bank in making its own decisions and defining its terms of reference to avoid overlapping jurisdictions with other quarters.
An official source in the Central Bank said that the new executive regulation of the Central Bank law further stressed the independence of the Central Bank and made the bank more effective through monetary tools and policies, including those related to interest rates and monetary issues alike.
The source also said that the market reaction to the formation of the new board of directors for the Central Bank was positive, indicating that the new law had given more clarity to the foreign exchange system and better definition to foreign exchange policies.
BANKS GET READY FOR SUPPORTING EGYPTIAN PROJECTS IN SUDAN
This coincides with an Arab League decision to operate a working group for holding the Second Arab Conference for Development and Investment in South Sudan after the signature of the final peace agreement between the Sudanese government and the Sudan's People Liberation Army (SPLA).
20-YEAR ALL-OUT PLAN FOR DEVELOPING EGYPTIAN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
More heed will be paid to small and medium-sized industries, creating new job opportunities for youth, localizing modern technology, creating potential of development locally, courting and increasing investments, and setting up local industries through depending on Egyptian raw materials with a view to increasing the value added to the mineral wealth, he said.
THREE IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTS IN INTEREST RATE FILE
Another key development witnessed by the market is the continual retreat of the exchange rate of the dollar circulated on the unofficial market to hit 660 piasters last Thursday amid strong expectations of a continual slide, especially with the increase of supply and decrease of demand and dollar holders; rush to sell their foreign exchange lest they should sustain future losses.
The CBE, went on raising interest rates on bank deposits with it, as the last two deposits were accepted on 27th and 28th February last at an average interest rate of 8.80% versus 8.594% on the deposit it accepted on 15th February, i.e. up 206 point. The highest interest rate on these deposits early last week hit 9% but it declined late last week by 15 points to hit 8.85%. It is to be noted that last week CBE went on withdrawing banks' surplus cash liquidity.
The Egyptian government announced that it would establish a bourse for small businesses to be independent of the current bourse.
75% INCREASE IN DUTIES ON TOURISM SIGHTS
Such a step, however, infuriated Egyptian tourism companies owners as they had not been notified by the council in advance in order to take precautions and contact tourist agents abroad to modify tourism programmes rates according to the increase imposed by the council.
It fell to LE6.50 against LE7.30 late last year, while it stood at LE6.20 on average at banks.
Furthermore, the CBE has adopted a policy to cut cash liquidity and combat speculations in U.S. dollars, as well as a governmental plan to decrease the dollar at the parallel market, he said.
Economists, therefore, take their economic measures in accordance with it.
In addition to the military expenditure on military bases and the American presence in Iraq and Afghanistan, there are economic assistance whether in the form of grants or loans, which are extended for political purposes.
We, in Egypt, have a chronic problem which lies in the fact that the dollar supply is lower than the demand for it.
She thinks that clients are now in a state of wait.
Some expect the dollar to continue its nosedive till it reaches 1.35 euros, but I don't believe that expectation will come true.
The changes in banks and the formation of a CBE board of directors have led to a resurgence of confidence in the Egyptian market.
For their part, construction companies demanded that their arrears be paid quickly to avoid the negative impacts these companies suffered from owing to delay in payment on one hand and banks reluctance to give these companies further loans on the other hand.
There are more than 20 commercial agreements and protocols between Egypt and the three countries to ban double taxation, facilitate land and air transportation operations, boost industrial and technological cooperation and protect investment, in addition to the comprehensive trade agreement with Europe.
Al Okda emphasized that the rate of exchange was on course according to market supply and demand mechanisms. In a press conference yesterday, he pointed out that stability in exchange rates would urge further investment inflows into the country.
Seyam denied any negative impacts of the anti-money laundering law on the accounts confidentiality as that aspect is legally ensured.
Such a relative decline came after the bank revenues went down from 16.9% to 31.29 million pounds. This coincided with a similar decline in commissions and banking services fees to 21.2 million pounds, while revenues of other operations dwindled to 1.85 million pounds last year.
Concerning the financial position of the NBE, its total assets went up from 105 billion pounds in the middle of 2002 to some 123 billion pounds after the net loans to customers jumped by 6.2%. The Misr Banque net profits went down by 10% during the FY2002/2003, as they hit 120 million pounds against 139 million pounds in the previous year.
Auditors with the bank disclosed some remarks in their report. Such remarks included the fact that the bank did not support the allocations of loans, the deficit in which hits 1.4 billion pounds. This would affect, to a great extent, the evaluation of the loans portfolio in December 2002 as well as the results of the bank performance. The report added that in 2002 the bank excluded some 53 million pounds from the item of financial investments in affiliates.
CIB TARGETS 3 FOREIGN MARKETS
Through regional and international expansion, the CIB seeks to attract foreign investors to the Egyptian market, maximize a share's revenue, and create an Egyptian share to attract investors from world markets, he indicated.
On the other hand, experts warned that the rise of the euro and the pound sterling is due to the American balance of payments' deficit and that the dollar's rate of exchange drop on the international market would have negative repercussions on the Egyptian balance of trade with the EU countries and Britain which import 46 percent of Egypt's external trade. The rise of the euro and the pound sterling also threatens the book value of Egypt's reserve of foreign exchange, which has retreated by 104 million dollars according to the latest report by the CBE.
"Contrary to the fluctuating euro and pound sterling rates of exchange, other main foreign currencies such as the American dollar and Saudi riyal are almost unchanged. This doesn't, nonetheless, mean stability," said former CBE governor Ismail Hassan.
The activation of the dollar inter-bank mechanism will not achieve the required success unless supply is provided through accurate implementation of the decree 506, which provides for depositing 75% of export and tourism revenues with the banks, he said.
The second report uncovered the collapse of exports of any Egyptian products as the state solely relied on exporting petroleum products while exports of other developing countries increased many times over in 2001 compared with what used to happen in 1990.
The retreat in investments in Egypt was attributed to businessmen as the government investments ratio to total domestic investment went down from 17.3% in 1989/1990 to 7.1% in 2000/2001. Dr. Mohamed Hassan, professor of investment in the Faculty of Commerce, Ain Shams University says that the government had sunk into the private sector bog as it offered it as an alternative in possessing means of production, pumping investments, and providing the needs of the domestic market and exports in a bid to maintain trade and the balance of payments.
The state wanted to raise the domestic saving rate from 17.5% of the GDP to 25%, which required a 7% growth rate annually, but this had not been achieved and the retreat went on unimpeded.
Despite all such incentives, Arab and foreign investments have retreated, according to the report, from $5.6 billion, 14.2% to 3.7% of total investments and 6.0% of GDP.
Although exports included petroleum products worth $2.173 billion, they accounted for almost 50% of total exports.
The report points out that the poor position of exports against the increasing imports had led to the corrosion of foreign exchange reserve, thus declining from $21 billion to $14 billion in a few months.
Although the report mentioned the problems facing the policy of turning to an export economy regarding the export infrastructure in efficiency including the financial institutions, maritime routes and administrative expertise, it revealed the successive governments' failure to protect the Egyptian economy, which is heading for a disaster.
He said he discussed with Rumanian officials bilateral agricultural cooperation through growing wheat in Rumania for Egypt or allowing Egyptians to hire farmland to grow wheat there or swap it for fruits and vegetables needed by Rumania.
We need somebody to tell us how much such operations will cost and whether Rumanian wheat will be given to Egypt at a preferential price compared to Australian, French and American wheat.
This integration area - bearing all chances of success - will help create demographic, agricultural and productive communities at the areas where there is a population vacuum.
MUBARAK: RESUMING PALESTINIAN-ISRAELI DIALOGUE WITHOUT PRECONDITIONS NECESSARY
He added that he had put forward during his closed-door meeting with President Mubarak the issue of Israeli spy Azzam Azzam who is now serving time in Egypt. "I felt that President Mubarak understood the critical situation undergone by Azzam's family," Shalom said, crossing his fingers that the case might be solved properly as soon as possible. He, furthermore, considered Egypt's positive response in this regard a "harbinger of good intent" like that which the Israelis want the Palestinians to show so as to improve "living conditions."
EOHR secretary general Hafez Abu Se'da held a press conference yesterday (10th December) that was attended by Hamdi Hassan, Nasserite deputy Hamdeen Sapahi and liberal independent Ayman Nour. Abu Se'da declared the new bill details saying, "The draft act provisions are identical to the international anti-torture declaration.
10% percent of the population in Jordan and Tunisia suffer from poverty; 20% in Egypt and Algeria; 40% in Yemen and 46% in Mauritania, the report declared under sponsorship of AL chief Amr Moussa said, warned that foreign debts represent a key obstacle to development in Arab countries.
BIBLIOTHECA ALEXANDRINA WITHDRAWS "PROTOCOLS OF THE ELDERS OF ZION"
The Bibliotheca Alexandrina's Information Department said the book was withdrawn from the book show as an unsuccessful selection that hurts others' feelings.
A state of anger prevails in the ruling milieus because some businessmen abused their positions to get private advantages. This happened after they could infiltrate to decision-making centers through the National Democratic Party (NDP) and its key committees.
Most of them ran financial and consumer investment projects in the field of food industries and clothes for instance and some others abused their (political) positions for making profits through monopolizing some industrial and strategic products and real estate projects.
On the other hand, an interpellation submitted by Tagamo'h deputy, Aboul-Ezz Al-Hariri to the Premier Dr. Atef Ebeid about the role played by businessman Ahmed Ezz in Alexandria National Company for Iron and Steel led to a state of embarrassment in the parliamentary body of the NDP and the party leaderships. Ahmed Ezz is in charge of the membership secretary in the party and head of the Plan and Budget Committee in the People's Assembly. He is also member of the Egyptian-American Presidents' Council.
It seems that popular singer Shaaban Abdel Rahim is sure that the continuity of his popular success is linked to political songs in which he attacks the US and Israel, especially as he is distinguished by using simple words repeated by ordinary people and, at the same time, express the Arab street's hatred of the US and Israel.
In another stanza of the lyric, the writer says, "The US and Israel are two sides of one coin, as they turned the world into a jungle."
Khaleel said the album included 10 songs that criticize the social conditions in Egypt. For example, it includes a song entitled "I will turn off light" that does a hatchet job on the high phone and electricity bills, from which citizens are suffering.
The report of which, Al-Hayat got a copy, was issued within of a campaign launched by intellectuals and men of letters against Al-Azhar's intervention in creative works.
He refused to reply to the Al-Azhar's recommendation and even took part in protests against Al-Azhar's decision.
Moreover, it used metaphors in a flagrant way, the report noted. The report wondered if the book propagated any values or virtues, and whether such publications befitted the nation and protected its youth against perils, or opened the door to fornication and adultery before youth who can hardly establish a family.
We won't be exaggerating if we say that chief of Egyptian Intelligence, Omar Solaiman had been assigned a difficult or even strenuous task.
Some other participants do not basically believe in the negotiation process and see it as bordering on capitulations or rather the outcome of an abortive vision that leads up to bets that are fiascos.
The administration of President George Bush can not inspire the Palestinians that there were hopes for a peaceful solution.
Omar Solaiman knows that the ceiling of what can be obtained from Sharon thanks to Bush's pressure, is much less than what would satisfy Ahmed Yassin, Khaled Meshaal, Ramadan Abdullah Shallah, Ahmed Gabriel and others. He, nonetheless, knows of that the post-September 11th world knows no mercy and that the American President now preoccupied with Iraq is about to be overwhelmed by the presidential campaign so much so that any escalation of the conflict in that period would be fraught with risks not only for the Palestinians but for neighbouring Arab countries as well.
Not a single step, nevertheless, has been taken forward, William Burns says but the American Administration does not act and the Israeli left signs dreamy documents but is not in a position to move a single item of such documents from the bond of textual preambles into the freedom of implementation on the ground, not only because the left is out of power and away from the decision-making circles but because even when it is in power it stops short of acting and even though it might build castles on the opposition air in the Knesset, becomes the first to tread on them with its heavy boots once it steps to power and is visited by security misgivings!
Negotiators in Cairo should not, therefore, be too delighted as if the dialogue per se were a target. Nor should they expatiate an excess of positive phrases to describe the dialogue if it only ended up by them agreeing on the same points about which they had been in concord or differing about other points about which they had always been in discord.
Recently, banks noticeably backtracked on backing industrial activities.
"Bankrolling industrial projects is given due attention by banks in general," Development and Housing Bank's bad debts advisor Emad Abd Al-Qader said. "The banking finance granted to the industry sector till the end of last June hit 36% of total credit facilities granted to the remaining economic sectors which is a reasonable percentage when we take into account the necessity of funding different economic activities," he added.
Regarding the possibility of confining industrial activities to the specialized banks, Abdel-Mon'im says there is only one specialized bank in Egypt, which can not boost industry. Therefore, commercial banks direct their financial surpluses to such kind of activity, that often needs long-range loans, which does not cope with the strategies of such banks, he added.
This is attributed to the high cost of industrial projects in general, as the cost of a medium-sized industrial project is not less than 10 million pounds. Therefore, the volume of finance is not available to a large number of industrialists, while an industrial project used to cost 3-4 million pounds in the eighties, he said.
Banking experts affirmed that the executive regulation of the Central Bank law that was signed by President Hosni Mubarak would result in better coordination among all the concerned parties, including the Government, the Central Bank itself and all the banks operating in Egypt.
He also said that the new regulation combined several of the points of the old law and gave them more clarity, so as to enable the Central Bank to make policies that would be easier to implement and harder to confuse.
The Central Bank source pointed out that the recent period had witnessed a remarkable stability on the Egyptian foreign exchange market and that the fluctuations that had occurred had taken place within certain expectations or as a result of absence of clear policies.
The increase of the Central Bank's capital to LE1 billion ($160 million plus) in the new regulation is aimed at expanding the bank's financial base, particularly in an environment where all banks are increasing their capital. And although the Central Bank is not a profit-making organization, the presence of a strong capital gives the bank more confidence."
Businessman Mu'taz Raslan who is head of Egyptian Canadian Business Council said that two Egyptian banks were preparing for work in South Sudan. He regarded the chance as feasible, adding that the Egyptian investors role would be supported by banks, which would provide them with the funds required for their new investments.
It has been decided that Commerce and Industry Chambers Union and Arab Investors Federation would undertake to arrange for visits by the Arab private sector to the various sites to be invested in South Sudan in cooperation with Sudanese Employers Union and Sudanese chambers.
Al-Sa'edi stressed that creating an Egyptian integrated industrial policy is a must, indicating that this requires setting clear, definite bases and mechanisms including the schedule and necessary costs as well as benefiting from previous studies and measures.
Technological centres the ministry has set up play a significant role in upgrading different industrial sectors through conducting studies and researches for developing factories.
Foremost of these developments is a kind of coordination between the financial and monetary policies towards raising interest rates as the monetary authority represented by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) went on for the third week in a row raising interest rates on bank deposits, while the financial authority represented by the Ministry of Finance raised interest rates on short-term treasury bills which have been put up for subscription to institutions and individuals through the CBE. The interest rate of the last treasury bills put up for sale last Monday hit 7.49%.
Al-Ganaini added that the talk about raising interest rate on deposits and the end of the two seasons of pilgrimage (Haj) and minor pilgrimage (Umra) also led to the devaluation of the dollar on the black market.
Meanwhile, the CBE withdrew the rest of the sum, which hit 5.502 billion pounds, through four deposits put forward to banks.
Following his meeting with the new capital market board of directors yesterday, he added that the features of such a bourse are being defined and its rules are being arranged. He pointed out that a business owner who wishes to have it put up on that bourse should be ready to join an open system and have a simple follow-up system. This bourse participants should know that it has its own risks.
It is noteworthy that the council has announced recently an increase in the duties on tourism sights by 100%.
8 REASONS FOR DOLLAR DEPRECIATION ON BLACK MARKET
Ibrahim al-Mazlawi, a member of the National Specialized Councils, said it is the first time in several years for the U.S. dollar to drop at the black market.
EGYPT'S GREENBACK RESERVES IN JEOPARDY!
Will this effect extend to include the dollar reserve in the CBE?
On the other hand, Dr. Hamdi Abdel Azim thinks that the devaluation of the dollar increases the burdens of debts or installments and interest, thus having a negative effect on American companies profits.
There are four different rates for the dollar on the Egyptian market - the black market rate, the exchange companies' rate, the banks rates and the customs dollar rate.
Banking expert, Mahmoud Ozalib thinks that such a decline of the dollar against the ero and other international currencies is unjustified.
However, there has been a remarkable stability in the Egyptian market in the last 3 months.
LE6.4 BILLION ARREARS FOR BIGGEST TWO CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES
EXPORTS TO BRITAIN, FRANCE, ITALY HIT 1.7 BILLION EUROS
CBE GOVERNOR: EXCHANGE RATE IS ON COURSE
Al Okda added that he was currently considering encouraging citizens to shift from using cash to using electronic cards while dealing with banks.
The annual performance results of some Egyptian banks last year (2003) disclosed a contradiction in profit making. As the profits of the Commercial International Bank-Egypt went up by 8% last year. In spite of the currency losses, it achieved net profits valued at 412 million pounds (68 million dollars) against 380 million pounds (63 million dollars) in 2002.
Concerning the financial position of the Industrial Development Bank, the total assets with the bank went up mid last year to 2.613 billion pounds against 2.186 billion pounds in 2002.
As for the financial position of the bank, its total assets increased from 70 billion pounds to 84 billion pounds over the last year.
On the other hand, National Societe Generale achieved a quantum leap in its net profits which soared by 22% to hit 201 million pounds against 165 million pounds in 2002.
This step aims at activating demand for the bank's stocks by American investment funds, which cannot be attracted at present, as they are registered only with London stock exchange, he added.
A state of lull mixed with anticipation and extreme caution dominated the dealings of the foreign exchange market in Egypt over the last days in anticipation of any changes or decisions following the appointment of a new governor for the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) and reforming its board of directors, which have not held a meeting for 4 months.
Saving coffers in the euro are also expected to increase in the coming period due to expectations of a constant rise of the euro against the American dollar, which has recorded its lowest rate against the European currency for 4 years, as the dollar rate of exchange rose to 7.45 pounds for buying and 7.56 pounds for selling.
"The monetary policy alone can't achieve economic reform. The matter needs controlling the inflow of foreign exchange allocated for importation and coordination with the state's monetary policy to control rates of demand for foreign exchange that are aimed at speculation or hoarding," said Advisor to the Premier and CBE board member Dr. Hatem Al-Qarnashawi.
GOVERNMENT ADMITS: $90 BILLION ESCAPED EGYPT
Economists described investment and exports as heading for a disaster. The traits carried by the report emphasize that the data announced by the government since 1980s so far are all false and untrue and that the achievements announced were mere propaganda and "fabricated" figures to serve as a makeup beautifying the ugly image of successive governments.
In spite of all the state's attempts to prop and back up the private sector through offering it the state's resources, the citizens' deposits as well as public sector companies sold to some businessmen dirt cheap, the ratio of private investment to the GDP retreated from 12.4% in 1989/1990 to 9.1% in 2001/2002 regardless of the rise in sums from LE9.7 billion to LE34.6 billion for the same period.
After the government failed, according to the report, it started to head for direct Arab and foreign investment to fill up the gap. Through an arsenal of laws, it made it possible for the Arabs and the foreigners to own any assets in Egypt without any controls under the big slogan of investment encouragement.
In its policy of reliance on the private sector, the government also failed to attract any Arab funds out of a total of $1200 billion invested in Europe and America.
The report says that the growth rate of Egyptian exports for that period did not exceed 2.7% against 11% as average growth rate in developing countries.
The scandal uncovered by the report lies in the government policy of deregulating the rates of exchange and the ensuing devaluation of the Egyptian pound under the allegation that such a step would sharpen the competitive edge of Egyptian products and, consequently, improve Egyptian exports performance.
In his back-page daily column "Egyptian Concerns", Abbass al-Tarabili, Al-Wafd's deputy board chairman and chief editor, writes an article to say: Let's capitalize on Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Ebeid's receptivity, a good quality we should thank God that the head of our government has, to comment on remarks he made during his recent visit to Rumania.
How much will this cost?
Now that wheat is a strategic commodity, how can we guarantee the arrival of Rumanian wheat in Egypt at times of international crises?
However, both countries can create demographic communities who can produce more than they consume at this stupendous demographic vacuum. It is so easy for the Egyptians to move to the south and for the Sudanese to move to the north, and for both to meet at this integration area so as to grow wheat for both Egypt and Sudan.
Addressing the Hebrew Radio, Shalom said, "Egypt is of the view that the Palestinian-Israeli dialogue should be resumed without preconditions and this is acceptable to us". He also said that preparations are underway to hold a meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his Palestinian opposite number Ahmed Qurei.
Egyptian MPs adopted an anti-torture draft act that had been prepared by the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR).
Some 10 million Arab children are dropouts; more than half of the Arab women are illiterate; 40% of the adults are illiterate, and more than half a million people have been affiliated with AIDS since the 1980s, 55% of which are women, said the Developmental Objectives of the Arab World report, which was declared yesterday (10th December) in Cairo. The report was compiled by the UN Development Pogramme in cooperation with the Arab League (AL).
The report recommended that it was necessary to exert more efforts in the Arab countries to reduce mortality rate among mothers and children under 5, control epidemic viruses and protect the environment.
The library also withdrew another five books authored by Egyptian writers tackling the Arabic translation of the book, whose preface was written by late great writer and man of letters Abbas Mahmoud Al-Akkad.
However, Bibliotheca Alexandrina's information official Ayman Al-Amir informed Asharq Al-Awsat that the book would be removed from the library's website, too.
Al-Ahali learnt that the positions of some company owners are being reviewed (mostly foreign company agents and contractors). They joined the NDP before the General Congress held in September in 2000 and played a role after that in directing the bills proposed by the NDP on behalf of the private sector especially the cancellation of subsidies for commodities, transport, waster, sanitary drainage, telephones and other projects under the BOT system. The People's Assembly Speaker, Dr. Fatehi Sorour had warned against the call of some businessmen for the cancellation of subsidy adding that it would lead to the disruption of public security and social stability.
He said, "Some of them could develop closer relationships with certain leaderships in the party recently and did harm to the stage of reform and renovation which the party has embarked upon in the last years.
It is noteworthy that Ahmed Ezz is an advocate the idea of depletion of subsidy and the privatization of the (service) economic bodies, as well as other demands of businessmen in the People's Assembly, the ruling party and some foreign chambers of commerce.
Lyricist Islam Khaleel, who wrote the album, told Al-Hayat that the song lyric reads: "I made the road map for my brethren and children. And I formed a quartet to take care of my business.
Lyricist Islam Khaleel slammed the intimidation policy adopted by George W. Bush towards the Muslim countries, while he feels afraid of North Korea. "Sometimes he says Iran and sometimes he says Syria, but when it comes to North Korea he swallow his pride," the song says.
Al-Azhar severely castigated state-owned institutions conducing to the spread of dissoluteness and debauchery among youth who can not make both ends meet or get married.
Al-Shahawi's book included recommendations directed to women calling on them to give themselves up without reservation or even modesty, the report said. Last month Book Organization head Dr. Samir Sarhan decreed the book from markets be withdrawn and confiscated. Ikhwan MP Mustafa Mohamed had submitted a quest for notification to the Prime Minister citing quotations from the book considering them as profaning religion.
The author, it added, used God's attributes in describing the beloved, which is almost explicit atheism.
OMAR SOLAIMAN'S MISSION
Omar Solaiman knows that the participants' demands are radically different and that their definitions of settlement and peace are as different as chalk and cheese.
He also knows that some others do not believe in such a state and see it, should it exist, as just a stop to continue liberating what is left of Palestine. In a nutshell, some participants dream about a state that co-exists with the state of Israel, while others adopt a programme that aim at the extermination of the latter, an aim which is by no means denied by such a programme advocates.
He well knows that such an administration would be satisfied with nothing less than the dismantlement of terrorism structures. This means that Omar Solaiman is practically urging Hamas and Jihad to pay the price for the Road Map.
PALESTINIANS IN CAIRO: DON'T BE OPTIMISTIC!
Doubts are, therefore, paramount everywhere so of what use are any reassurances, documents or dialogues if the consequences cannot dare to extend geographically behind the halls of meetings and dialogues where documents are signed.
If we don't want the Palestinian dialogue to have such an end, the twelve factions have only to think of a reply to one sole question: how to translate letters of final statement texts into genuine acts on the ground.
Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) deputy, Mostafa Mohamed Mostafa emphasized that Arab unanimity issue has become a problem stressing the importance of focusing on economic cooperation. "Unless there are joint Arab economic interests there will not be political relations, hence the importance of inter-Arab trade through public and private sectors." Deputy Mohamed Al-Badrashini called for moving and developing diplomatic mechanisms to serve joint Arab action and its targets and optimize Arab satellite channels in highlighting an Arab public opinion to achieve such a system.
Israeli sources said that Israelis bought oil-rich plots in Mosul from Kurds.
Turkish media means have published in the last weeks reports about Israeli activities in Northern Iraq.
It added that both Kuwait and Qatar were also allowed to buy lands in Southern Iraq.
Since that interview, officials in the Israeli embassy in Ankara have been trying to find out the source of the Turkish government's concern, but in vain.
According to these sources, if there is an activity like this, it would, undoubtedly, be of private companies that don't need the Israeli government's approval.
"Gold is decoration and a coffer of value," ladies always say on different occasions.
"The jewellery profession in the post-Saddam era started to recover, as golden objects have become more and more in demand due to improvement of working women's salaries," Ali As'ad, 45, a jeweller in Al-Nahr Street said.
"Ahead of the war, five grams of 21-karat gold were ranging between 80,000 and 85,000 Iraqi dinars, which now range between 110,000 and 115,000 dinars due to the high demand for it," Al-Ameli added.
The population of 22 Arab countries is now 287 million against 76 million in the middle of last century and 144 million in 1975, said the statistics mentioned in a report reviewed during the meeting of the fourth session of Arab countries' representatives in charge of population and development, held in Rabat, Morocco, last week.
According to population distribution, Egypt, which accounted for 28.5 percent of the Arab population in 1950, will constitute 20 percent in 2025 and 17.4 percent in 2050, Yemen, which saw the highest population growth rate in recent decades, will move from 5.6 percent to 15.7 percent, Saudi Arabia, 9 percent, Iraq, 8.2 percent and Morocco and Algeria, 8 percent.
The forced exodus of Palestinians has led to an increase in Jordanian population, while the emigration and natural growth of population have resulted in demographic growth in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Kuwait and Oman.
National dailies, unprecentedly, highlighted the issue of power bequeathal yesterday (January 2nd).
Strikingly, this is the first time for Mubarak to speak about patrimonial power to local media.
Al-Ashaal thought that Mubarak will carry out real political reforms before the end of his current term in office in October 2005. These reforms will cancel holding a referendum on one name as a sole candidate for the presidency and will allow having more than one candidate, "so that such a political reform might not be a renovation of the current regime but a real change," Al-Ashaal added.
According to circles in Cairo, such announcement prejudiced the Egyptian people's reputation. They wondered why a quiz should include only Kuwaiti aid to Egypt despite the multiplicity of purposes the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED) is supposed to serve.
When did KFAED offer loan for financing the construction of schools in Egypt?
How many Egyptian martyrs lost their lives in the Kuwait liberation war?
He added that by so doing, it seemed as if Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh wanted to tell non-Islamic countries or even Islamic ones which do not abide by Islamic rules to deprive Muslims from choice to give them pretexts for abandoning their religious obligations.
ECONOMISTS CAUTION AGAINST MONETARY VALUATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND BORROWING UNDER THEIR GUARANTY
They also warned the government against borrowing under the guarantee of such assets without interest as this could lead to monetary expansion and growing inflation.
IKHWAN LEADING FIGURE ESTABLISHES LIBERAL SOCIETY FOR LAWYERS
"The constitution of the society is based on many axes foremost of which are commitment to the principles and traditions of the legal profession, the necessity of accepting the 'other', and rotating responsibility," he added, emphasizing that the society is a liberal one including all political forces.
Grand Sheikf of Al-Azhar Mohamed Sayed Tantawi said France has the right to adopt anti-veil law.
EGYPTIAN MUFTI WORRIED ABOUT HITTING ISLAMIC PRESENCE IN EUROPE
They emphasized that Tantawi's statements reflected his own opinion rather than Al-Azhar's. The difference between the two parties was apparent during a meeting attended by French Minister of the Interior Nicholas Sarkozy, Tantawi and a number of Muslim scholars on Tuesday to discuss the recent French law on banning religious insignia in state schools.
After his meeting with French Minister of the Interior, Nichola Sarkozy, Tantawi said, "If a Muslim woman is in a non-Muslim country like France for instance and that country's authorities wanted to pass laws that run counter to Muslim Women's Hijab such authorities have the right to do so.
The Hijab issue still raises sharp arguments in France.
He added that Tantawi represents Al Azhar University, no more no less. The Hijab question does not constitute an issue for Arab diplomacy in relation with France as each community has its own tradition and approach to the question.
"Egypt has managed to surpass the crisis flared up by Western media during the convention of the Nile Basin Ministerial Conference, held in Cairo recently, and All-Africa Water Ministers Conference," he said.
Orascom Telecom, an Egyptian mobile phone operator, was short-listed for winning the license for operating the second mobile phone network in Tehran.
VOLUME OF RAILWAY DEFICIT AMOUNTS TO LE8.6 BILLION
It also demanded that the phenomenon of passengers offences be minimized and that follow up be increased in a bid to put an end to wasting any of the Authority's revenues. It demanded that control be tightened regarding the train timetables of departure and arrival, minimizing delay cases and raising the efficiency of operating the Metro regarding the time consumed, intervals between trains and the number of passengers.
"Christ advocate noble principles including modesty, honour, virtue, mercy and forgiveness.
Official and civil efforts are being exerted in Egypt to transcend the barrier set before sex issues that concern the minds of teenagers in a bid to avoid ignorance and lack of information that lead to ethical farces.
NCMC secretary general ambassador Moshira Khattab said that teachers would be trained in how to deal with teenagers regarding those issues, raise awareness among female students, bridge the gap between parents and children and resist the tendency of the schools' role to dwindle
Observers added that Tel Aviv realized that the changes that took place after the war on Iraq were in its favour while putting Syria in a tight corner. This was what Minister of Finance Benjamin Netanyahu meant by his argument that the world had witnessed serious changes since Ihud Barak's era and that Syria had turned into a little village in this world. Syria's weight deteriorated in contrast to Israel's enhanced status. Such a truth, consequently should be taken into consideration, he added.
MUBARAK CONVEYS SYRIAN PEACEFUL IDEAS TO WASHINGTON
ISRAELI MILITARY LEADER THREATENS TO INVADE DAMASCUS QUICKLY LIKE BAGHDAD
He added that there is a wide gap between Israeli's military capabilities and those of Syria, adding that Israel can fight day and night.
FATF's decision would help increase foreigners' transactions in the Stock Exchange and increase confidence in the Egyptian economy, they said.
He added that the FATF decision would boost transactions and increase the demand for stocks whether on the part of local dealers or foreign investors.
The market was awaiting any positive news to revive, he said, pointing out that the decision on removing Egypt's name from the money laundering blacklist was considered a turning point on the market at present so that the market could rise again with retaining interest rates at their levels, if they were not cut by the Central Bank of Egypt.
The decision was made in spite of the refusal shown by a limited number of shareholders in the extraordinary general assembly yesterday. Supported by the parent company which owns 85% of the shares and Banque Misr which owns 6% of the shares, Pfizer-Egypt will stay in Egypt with a volume of shares hitting 1435 out of 6.567 million original shares. Representative of Pfizer parent company said that Pfizer-Egypt should change its work strategy in the coming period.
The Cabinet Information and Decision Support Center (IDSC) said the annual inflation rate soared to 5.5% in December 2003 from 5.1% last November.
The dollar rise against the pound has raised the prices of imported cars astronomically. Those price rises ranged between 50-100%. Such prices continued even though the dollar rate of exchange has stabilized in Egypt and even went down against European currencies and the Japanese yen.
Head of the Importers Department in the General Federation of Chambers of Commerce Mostafa Zaki expects a rise in the prices of imported cars in the coming period as a result of another point related to the Egyptian market and the high demand for buying cars.
Foreign investments in projects in the country fell over 40 percent.
Foreign investments in the oil sector exceeded 1593 million U.S. dollars in 1999-2000 against 2057 million dollars in 2001-2002 and 2123 million dollars in 2002-2003.
The government didn't even set a blueprint to address the drop in both local and foreign investment inflows.
EUROPE BACKPEDALS ON A COMMERCIAL PLEDGE TO EGYPT
Egypt rejected this principle in November 1995. It was the only country that got a pledge from the European Commission not to have that principle adopted in the case of negotiating with the EU, he said.
He said that Minister of Foreign Trade Dr. Youssef Botros Ghali and Egyptian bodies concerned were following up that issue and that he was contacted the European commissioner for trade affairs in that regard.
The second kind of agreements aim at developing relations in some fields that are not governed by certain rules at the EU level. Therefore, such agreements will be in force so long as the new EU member states did not demand to suspend them, which is unexpected because such bilateral agreements constitute the legal base for more comprehensive relations that are not just confined to trade, he indicated.
Italy was Egypt's second key importer and key trade partner following the U.S. last year, with trade exchange having hit 2.34 billion euros in January-November 2003. The figure included 928 million euros' worth of exports and 1.16 billion U.S. dollars' worth of imports.
A first international leather-ware exhibition is to be organized in Cairo in the second week of next December. The Italian Union of Leather-ware Machines will take part in the event.
This exhibition would be accompanied by the convention of the World Telecom Conference in which leaderships of communication industry in private and public sectors and international financial institutions would take part. The World Telecom will discuss successful experiments in this sector and the systems of bankrolling communication projects from funds. The conference would also discuss communication deregulation policies, means of attracting investments, the broadband technology application strategies and the use of the Internet for both health and educational purposes.
Head of Cairo International Conferences Centre pointed out that a new pavilion for convening this conference would be completed by April next. The new pavilion would provide an area of 6,000 square meters space. The Egyptian stand would occupy 2,000 square meters, noting that 200 journalists had been invited to the exhibition with a view to showing Egypt as a tourist destination.
The story runs to the following effect: Investors, businessmen and industrial businesses are resentful about amendments to the bill on investment guarantees and incentives, accusing the government of failing to meet the principles of justice, equity and equal opportunities among investment businesses.
Thus, foreign and local investors will be engaged in unequal competitions on the domestic market, business organizations said.
The term of "internationally renowned businesses" is "elastic" and cannot be defined exactly, the organizations said.
In spite of continuous decrease of dollar exchange rate and the availability of the raw materials on the global market, iron sheet price increased twice in a row last February by 350 pounds.
It was discovered that furnaces have been out of order for 4 years without any move for repairing them, which urged the People Assembly's Industry Committee, in the presence of the Industry Minister Ali Al-Saedi, to accuse the Iron and Steal Company's officials of connivance.
They demanded working for increasing the cement companies' production capacities to a reasonable level in order to meet market needs, thus decreasing price indicators particularly as the former cement did not exceed 205 pounds only.
Experts also suggested the cancellation of dumping charges imposed on iron imports from some countries, reducing customs on production requirements, and amending the follow-up committee announced by the government to control dealings and uncover any manipulation by producers or traders.
There are many factors that complicated the problem, including some traders storing a large amount of iron to benefit from the price differential when iron factories increase prices.
On the other hand, producers did not deny such an increase, saying the matter was out of their hands. "Price rise of iron is not a fabricated crisis but rather attributed to uncontrollable factors including the international price hike of billet to over 370 dollars per ton while the factory cost per ton is lower than that of the supply by about 100 pounds only," said Board Chairman of Port Said National Steel Khalid Al-Burini.
AMERICAN, AUSTRALIAN WHEAT IN THE WAY TO EGYPT
Unprecedentedly, a major German company started preparations for erecting the first factory of its kind in the Middle East for producing car spare parts with investments hitting 300 million euros, said partner with Price Water House company Sherif Nour, who is responsible for financial consultations.
The project will yield huge sums of foreign currency, as 95% of the company's products will be exported to Europe and the Middle East with competitive prices due to cheap Egyptian labor.
Organic and non-organic chemicals topped the list of imports from Belgium, hitting 20.3 million euros against around 27.1 million euros in 2002.
Volume of bilateral trade between Egypt and China exceeded one billion dollars for the first time recording 1.090 billion dollars in late last year, up 15.4% in comparison to 2002.
EGYPTIAN-INDIAN COOPERATION FOR FINDING BANKING SOLUTIONS
PLANS FOR INCREASING EXPORTS TO SOUTH AFRICA
The third axis will be represented in agreeing with two French and British companies specialized in mounting exhibitions. These two companies will mount periodical exhibitions in Johannesburg or Pretoria or Cape Town, which aim at attracting the biggest possible number of customers thanks to the great fame of those companies in holding specialized exhibitions on the one hand and their huge base of customers on the other hand.
SAUDI DIALOGUE CONFERENCE: ISLAMISTS AND LIBERALS ENGAGED IN HEATED DEBATE OVER SCHOOL SUBJECTS
For his part, Hassan al-Saffar, a Shiite clerk, told Al-Hayat that Shiites, like other citizens, in Saudi Arabia ought to capitalize on the country's opening up and development drive, and should be incorporated into the society. The gathering is a jumping-off for an end to sectarian barriers created by unfavourable circumstances and conditions, he said.
-Purging subjects of incitements to depict some people as disbelievers and focus on the fact that Muslims' lives, money and honour should be safeguarded.
-Adopting a balanced religious attitude towards civilizations and knowledge so that learners may make use of their favourable aspects.
He termed women's involvement in the dialogue as "effective", saying they proposed "new ideas". He made it certain that more women would be given access to the gathering in the future.
Even those who trust the US and its "reform" concerns in the region should be cautious as long as the American Administration has forces from the extremist Right, like Paul Woolfwitz and Richard Pearl. We can deal with them only cautiously - one has to count one's own fingers after shaking hands with them and feel the place of one's wallet after exchanging a hug with them. Simply, they are intimate friends to the Israelis - rather, the extremist Likud members.
What do days hide, especially as far as the Americans are concerned with Iraq?
We should resist this mean tendency. I daresay that the visits paid by the Saudi Ambassador in Washington, Prince Bander Bin Sultan, to the American states as well as the lectures he gave there are aimed at that point through addressing the American mind.
It is better for us not to expect that such "passive concern" would change, if the Administration is changed in the coming elections. Even the Democrats, whose chances in winning the elections are rather poor, have become concerned about the Saudi issue. This was most obvious in the stance of Madeleine Albright, the US secretary of state under president Bill Clinton. In an article, published recently by the Guardian, she called for maintaining pressure on the Kingdom.
In the past two years, serious accusations, which did harm to Saudi businessmen, were leveled every now and then. Students in the US were chased till thousands of them were compelled to leave American universities for British ones. They even went to universities in Australia and New Zealand. Our method in handling this was the understanding of the American circumstances after the September 11th events and we tried to "let the storm pass."
It would be better if we chose weak rings in the American attack and legally boost their victims with the objective of dismantling the legal structure of accusations. The majority of these rings are weak.
Upon a request tabled by 16 MPs, the discussions in the National Assembly meeting held on 30th December was confined to the new education strategy. "I hope the government would neither submit to any foreign blackmailing or threats nor amend education curricula according to such threats," said MP Dr. Hassan Jawhar.
Al-Mutairi asked, adding that Kuwait is a Muslim country which has basic principles that could never be abandoned.
Addressing reporters following the session, Education Minister Rashid Al-Hamad said he was very keen on the MPs' remarks as "education is the responsibility of everybody."
"The future of education in the State of Kuwait preoccupies everybody in the society as it is affected, just like other social development factors, by local, regional and international circumstances," Al-Hamad pursued.
The US administration had informed France, Britain and Germany that the Syrian weapons threaten the American existence in Iraq. Following the capture of the former Iraqi president, the US administration will not take it easy as far as such weapons are concerned. The US said that president Bashar Al-Assad is requested to take a more effective position and be more transparent in replying to the international doubts regarding Syria's possession of WMD.
The meeting discussed pan-Arab coordination on how to consult the International Court of Justice about the Israeli separation wall.
Israeli Minister of Agriculture Yisrael Katz said the timing of the Golan settlement plan endorsement was not a coincidence, but rather it is an explicit direct message to Syrian President Bashar Assad to the effect that "Golan is part and parcel of Israeli land and that the Israeli government does not intend to abandon control over it."
Western sources affirmed that Israel had developed its military "Dolphin" submarines so that they could be loaded with nuclear heads. It, moreover, seeks to buy more of those submarines, the sources added.
The educational area created heated debates and splits among the participants in the 2nd Saudi National Intellectual Dialogue Meeting sessions in Mecca, organized by King Abdel-Aziz National Dialogue Center. It was held under the rubric of "Extremism and Moderation...All-out Methodological Vision", and will come to close Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Saudi women who attended the meetings voiced dissatisfaction with the dialogue as they were not allowed to present any working papers or research. The fact that only ten women against 50 men joined the dialogue rendered their involvement token rather than practical, they said.
Abdel-Rahman voiced his pleasure for meeting Arab League Secretary General Amr Mossa who confirmed that the Arab League is open for all the Iraqis to put forward their viewpoints.
FEATURES OF NEW EDUCATION STRATEGY IN KUWAIT
The strategy is meant to be a base for educational reform that would ensue from the civil society rather than the viewpoint of education officials only. It, furthermore, has a national vision of the educational system that is based on helping students to develop spiritually, rationally, socially, psychologically and physically in a way that would strike a balance between self-realization and serving the society while preserving the cultural specifity of the society.
The explanation request submitted by Premier Dr. Atef Ebeid yesterday (8th January) on Mubarak's orders is related to resolving the difference between the government and the opposition over holding bye-elections in constituencies that fell vacant after the resignation of "draft" dodging deputies, 17 in number, and whether candidature is open to all voters as the government said or is confined to the candidates of latest elections held in 2000.
Mubarak's decision reportedly to resort to the Constitutional Court surprised government circles which acquainted with it after Ebeid received presidential order to submit an explanation request. This indicates official orientations to adopt neutrality between the government and the opposition regarding the dispute and to redeem regard to the judiciary by granting it full authority to resolve the matter after accusations escalated against the government of wasting the judiciary rulings and failure to put them in effect.
The IRA issued a statement that says, "The IRA discussed what was reported by newspapers and aired by satellite networks about the Grand Sheikh's statements following his meeting with the French minister of the interior and France's intention to pass a law banning the wearing of Hijab in some pre-university stages.
4- Regarding the bill France intends to issue, the IRA resolved the following:

RULING NDP REJECT FORMING COALITION GOVERNMENT
He confirmed that a coalition government should be formed only when neither of the political parties gets the majority that enables it to form the government.
In a lecture entitled, "Public freedoms in Islamic sharia" Islamic thinker Dr. Yusuf Al Qaradawi emphasized that "human rights in Islam were determined by Almighty God rather than a committee of humans, a revolutionary council or a parliament".
He added that Al Azhar Sheikh significantly said that Hijab is religious obligation rather than a symbol and this is quite enough for us."
He added, "We asked Muslims in France to file a lawsuit against the French government if it passed such a law (banning hijab) as that would run counter to the French Constitution and international covenants and agreements."
Defending the cancellation of 13 international air lines, EgyptAir president said the losses of Manila air line only exceeded 120 million pounds in 10 years. A study revealed that only 50,000 out of about 1.75 million passengers (5%) arrive in Egypt from the 13 cancelled destinations onboard EgyptAir planes, he said, pointing out that such a modest figure justifies the cancellation of such lines.
These statements were made by Chairman of the Egyptian Businessmen Association Gamal Al-Nazer on the sideline of the Egyptian-Jordanian Business Council meetings held in Amman on Tuesday (29th February). A meeting comprising representatives of Egyptian, Jordanian and Iraqi companies would be held in Cairo soon to review the establishment of this consortium and consider joint projects to be implemented in Iraq, he said.
This increase came at a time when international prices of raw materials witnessed stability over the last weeks and the dollar exchange rate declined sharply on the domestic market.
The protocol was signed on the sidelines of the current visit paid to Egypt by Korean information and technology minister who heads a delegation comprising a number of prominent officials and businessmen working in the field of technology.
5 BILLION POUNDS NEEDED FOR SETTING UP 5 SUGAR PLANTS
A report, submitted by managing director of the sugar and Integrated Industries Company Hassan Kamel to head of Food Industries Holding Company Mohamed As'ad, said investments in the sugar industry should be intensified and a project should be set up at a capacity of 120.000 every 3 years to narrow the gap, which widens by 40,000 tons annually at least.
In their meeting with Prime Minister Atef Ebeid, Aswan parliamentarians called for having another plant in Kom Ombo established to produce sugar from sugarcane, as there is an area of 60,000 feddans at Wadi AL-Nokra where sugarcane can be cultivated. The investment cost of this project hits about one billion pounds. Therefore, total investments urgently needed for setting up 5 projects to produce sugarcane and sugar beet amounts to 5 billion pounds.
The Premier witnessed the signature of a cooperation protocol between Egyptian Industries Union headed by Dr. Abdel-Munim Saudi and its Iraqi counterpart headed by Qais Al Khafagi to promote cooperation between industries in the two countries and boost bilateral investments.
He emphasized that the Egyptian private sector could set up production bases, provide them with money and care, thus producing, through them, modern products, organized potentialities and competitiveness in international markets. This extended to the sectors of agriculture, industry, petroleum, an internal and external tourism.
Ebeid added that we would look after the Iraqi experiment and support what would be arranged for by Iraq's businessmen with their Egyptian partners to form economic and trade alliances.
He added that Iraq needed support for its construction and the construction of production sectors and services and to maintain development factors.
He pointed out the rise of unemployment rate in Iraq to 50%, adding that $74.6 billion would be spent till 2007 out of which $23 billion from donor countries and $18.6 billion from the American aid.
Following talks with the Kuwaiti prime minister, Ebeid attended the signing ceremony of a loan agreement between the Egyptian government and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development. Under the agreement, the fund will give Egypt a loan of 30 million Kuwaiti dinars to be used in financing Talkha Power Plant project.
The selected projects offered for implementation with complete Kuwaiti investments or diverse contributions include producing diesel engines, electric power, aluminium sheets, contributing to East Port Said Project, two cardboard and polyester fibre projects, two tourist projects at Lake Qarun and the Northwestern Coast, petrochemical projects, ship supply, Kuwaiti oil refining at Egyptian labs, a joint venture for personal and cargo land transport and cooperation in repairing and building ships and maintaining airports.
He added that a number of decisions had been taken this year for rejuvenating relations as the volume of commercial exchange between the two countries amounted to one billion dollars this year. He indicated that the number of Russian tourists visiting Egypt hit about half a million.
"Such loans are meant to increase private investments directed to such a vital sector. The CIB (Egypt) offered facilities in the last years to drinking water and sanitary drainage sectors amounting to 80 million pounds," CIB Managing Director Sahar Al-Sallab said.
In reply to another question about the date of granting such loans, Al-Sallab pointed out that they were currently available with the bank and that any investor could submit a feasibility study on his project and the bank would consider it. In case it is approved, he will be granted the credit, she added.
Alice expressed his hope that that fund would contribute to completing other efforts exerted by the Housing Ministry to provide better services.
There should be an integrated mechanism where the role of such authorities and the Ministry of Housing will be specified, he said, adding that such authorities should be given an opportunity to express their opinion in the projects that the private sector intends to enter, especially as the role of potable water and sanitary drainage authorities is confined to extending maintenance services.
FOREIGNERS RAISE THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO CIB TO 30%

Next to it come Latin America and Asia which get 23.3% and 13.2% respectively. Africa's share went down to 0.7% with Egypt getting the biggest part of those investments especially in the petroleum sector.
She went on to say that the American investments in Egypt are either attracted to national resources (petroleum) or are investments of a leaping nature transcending customs barriers and targeting the domestic market. This explains the liquidation witnessed by most of such investments apart from the petroleum sector with the reduction of customs duties. She pointed out that the free market with the USA would not lead to the increase in American investments in Egypt.
He went on to say that such aid failed to achieve the expected growth in developing countries. The countries that made the most benefit of such aid would achieve insignificant growth rates while corruption rates increased. Aid conditions have also come to be connected with reform and its course rather than projects which benefit of such aid as was the case in the past.
She added that the USA tops the list of foreign investors in Egypt which has almost 14.7% of the USA total foreign investments in the Middle East. In 2003, American investments in Egypt amounted to $362 million allocated to 262 projects.

Experts emphasized that CBE members differ over this issue describing CBE governor Farouq Al Uqda's statements that procrastinations of an interest rate decision were meant to give a further chance to probe the consequences of moving the rates either up or down as an attempt to justify hesitance.
A set of other monetary policies and tools can also be implemented to return savers and bank clients to the domestic currency through incriminating foreign currency dealings inside the country and reducing their interest rates to a zero level as is the case with a number of developed countries, together with tightening control on foreign currency markets to put an end to speculations that raised the rates of foreign currencies especially the American dollar against the Egyptian pound by 40% last year.
He added that continuation of implementing high interest rates increases the burden year after year. If the government domestic debt has exceeded LE300 billion according to the latest estimates a one-percent rise in interest would increase such burdens by an extra LE3 billions not just LE2.5 billion.
The dollarization phenomenon can be contained through the organization of the import process and the banks' undertaking their role in foreign exchange supply without forcing the client to rely on his own resources. Banks can also activate industrial investment which would secure domestic products as alternatives to imported ones. Confidence in the domestic currency can thus be restored through controlling exchange markets by maintaining exchange supplies rather than resorting to security measures in dealing with the problem as they have negative repercussions that stimulate further speculation in foreign exchange.

Bedouins' settlement projects include the construction of houses, training centers and water reservoirs within the framework of a comprehensive development plan, in addition to a tourist project in Dahab, Nuwiebaa and Taba as well as providing citizens with enormous facilities and establishing agricultural projects.
10% OF EGYPTIANS DISABLED
Regardless of the hard economic conditions Egypt is undergoing, the volume of Egyptians' expenditure on Christmas Eve amounted to over LE90 million, according to a study conducted by a number of researchers in the field of tourism.
452,000 EGYPTIANS GOT MARRIED, 63,000 SEPARATED IN ONE YEAR
EGYPT AT CROSSROADS
Although President Hosni Mubarak managed to remove a lump in Egyptian people's throat, I (the writer) believe that most Egyptian political and cultural elites still feel that the political system in Egypt with its current formula has come to an end and been mired in an inescapable critical situation, requiring a "major surgery to save the patient from his incurable disease".
It is well-known that President Mubarak used to take his son Gamal with him o some of his foreign tours before the latter occupied a post in the NDP. The Egyptian people dealt with this situation from the very beginning as a natural and legitimate right to use the help of a qualified and reliable son to follow up some sensitive reports or even organize and run the presidential office's affairs as a whole.
At the public level, they were labeled as part of a blueprint to provide a congenial atmosphere for a peaceful power transition from the father to the son.
In my estimation, the sweeping majority of the Egyptian elite continued to rule out even ahead of President Mubarak's recent interview that the patrimonial power thought even crossed the president's mind at any moment.
In fact, he joined the party with difficulty.
Undoubtedly, this truthful interview came to the satisfaction of all Egyptian people, who became more confident that the power inheritance idea has never crossed the president's mind, neither will it be a bone of contention during the president's tenure.
On December 7, 2000, the Supreme Administrative Court made a landmark decision stipulating the performance of obligatory military service or exemption from it for candidature for parliamentary elections. Thus, the membership of any candidate who fails to meet such a stipulation is null and void.
Such a step was utterly unjustified as it cannot comply with either the law or good discretion.
Once again, the majority of administrative judiciary rulings came to emphasize the necessity that such bye elections be confined to candidates of the year 2000, excluding those whose memberships were annulled.
If the NDP had conducted such elections according to proper legal procedures, it could have achieved enormous political gains on both internal and external levels even if it had lost all the seats.
There is a consensus of opinion among jurists and independent politicians that what happened constituted a legal and moral fault that should not be ignored or winked at.
Egypt, therefore, seems at a crossroads with full democracy as its only way out of both internal and external cul de sacs!
Giving his first statement after his installation, Akef told Asharq Al-Awsat that he would choose two deputies to help him shortly after consulting his colleagues, confirming that there was no plan to change the group's ideology.
Less than one week after the death of its former Guide Ma'moun Al-Hudaibi, Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) group declared the installation of Mohamed Mahdi Ake, 76, as the group's guide in the world and Dr. Mohamed Habib as deputy guide.
He had also an important role in the organization during the last years.
Akef headed the departments of students and physical education in the Gerneral Centre of Ikwan Group, till he was arrested in 1954 for smuggling Major General Abdel Muneim Abdel Ra'ouf (an army leader who supervised expelling King Farouk). He was sentenced to death but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment with hard labour.
A statement issued yesterday (14th January) by acting guide Mohamed Hilal said that Akef's election measures were taken in accordance with the Group's constitutional statute. "A ballot was held to know the opinion of bodies concerned and Group officers," Hilal added.
After the vote had been cast, all Guidance Bureau members pledged allegiance to Akef who was sworn in, afterwards. Deputy Guide Mohamed Habib belongs to the generation next to the old guard, but his opinions and attitudes comply completely with it.
The Guidance Bureau had entrusted Lawyer Mohamed Hilal to be the acting Guide following the death of Al-Hudhaibi till they elected a new Guide.
Burns met on Tuesday with Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher and Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa. He will meet President Hosni Mubark on Wednesday to discuss Syrian-Israeli peace process and the "strategic dialogue."
The Egyptians are free in their relations with Iran, he said, pointing out in press statements in Cairo that Washington follows up developments of Egypt-Iran relations.
"The American envoy for Sudan held a number of meetings in Cairo with Arab League officials. He and Burns also met with Moussa," spokesman for the American embassy in Cairo told Asharq Al-Awsat.
Jamaa Islamia said, "Bin Laden's fatwa (religious opinion) that permits killing American civilians made Islam suspicious and questionable."
Egyptian women have an increased tendency to commit violent crimes, especially murder, in view of the persecution they undergo, said a recent study concluded by the National Centre for Social and Criminological Studies in Egypt. Violence crimes, according to the study, spread among spouses, due to social and economic pressure undergone by spouses, who committed 80% of the crimes perpetrated in 2003.
The individuals covered by the sample made it clear that women deserved violence with its different forms and when punishment came from a husband to his spouse, it cannot be deemed as violence, said the study, noting that the rate of people who accept violence against women rose, even among women themselves, to 86% against 96% among men. "This emphasizes the social norms and misunderstanding domination of the wife-husband relation."
YEMENI PRESIDENT: WE'VE GOT TO REFORM OURSELVES
In a surprise press briefing in the Conference's press Centre adjacent to the main hall of the Republican Palace, Saleh said that the conference's recommendations would include a lot of items related to human rights and democracy. He considered them recommendations to all political systems to adopt democracy and respect human rights and shut down political prisons, apart from the prisons of terrorists if they go ahead with their terrorist acts either in our Arab and Muslim countries or in European countries.
The Yemeni President pointed out that the Arab world was facing international pressures in light of the current developments but it would be able to face them and reconsider its present situation and try to improve it.
A new move started last week and would result in a quantum leap because it is the first time for political movements to take decisions regarding Iraq jointly with religious figures to carry out bold steps, Secretary-General of the RDA Nabil Janabi said.
"He will serve us even indirectly because we know his ideas well and his desire to serve the Iraqi people. He is enthusiastic to the Iraqi cause. His arrival will also support the notion of royalty in Iraq, Janabi said.
KUWATI: ICM CHIEF - WE REJECT TERROR, SEEK OPENNESS TO DIFFERENT POLITICAL FORCES
"Change indicators in the ICM were clear a long time ago, particularly following the recent parliamentary elections and our feeling that it is necessary to have a new political discourse and introduce fresh young leading figures, he added.
It is worth mentioning that ICM in Kuwait had elected Badr Ahmed Al-Nashi as a secretary general succeeding Issa Majed Al-Shaheen who showed unwillingness to renew his term in office in order to pump fresh blood in the ICM.
Following the elections, Al-Nashi delivered a speech in which he emphasized that there was no relationship between the ICM and other political organizations outside Kuwait. "The ICM emerges from the Kuwaiti society and any relation it would establish would be like any other relation in the Arab Nation," he pursued, denying any organizational relations with any leaderships abroad.
Such indications, nonetheless, remain wrapped in mystery which shrouds the American strategy regarding the Kurds of neighbouring countries especially Turkey.
This may raise the question of the Kurds' aspired confederacy and whether it will be acceptable to all Iraqi categories, especially as some Iraqi forces which emerged after Saddam Hussein's fall reject such a formula, while other forces are eager to put the confederacy law up for all Iraqis through the polls.
Iraq consists of two main nationalities: the Arabs and the Kurds, according to international resolutions ranging from those of the League of Nations in 1924 to the autonomy rule government in March in the 1970's. This term was also used in 1958 Constitution - that is, after the fall of monarchy and before Baath party rose to power.
Strangely enough, there are so far no signs suggesting the dispersal of Kurdish fears in spite of the close relation with Washington.
Under the above heading, Dr. Tarek Saif, a university professor, writes a lengthy article to say: America has become a "Gulf-based country" but with the same characteristics of the former Iraqi regime. It has formed an American leadership in Iraq, viewed as a natural extension of the Iraqi Baath Party, whether in view of its unilateral plan to address the domestic situation, inattention to advice and recommendations or appointment of a single ruler who is the sole decision-maker. It is also hostile to Iraqi people and neighbours in Iran and Syria, hinging upon security and intelligence agencies and armed force and seeking to impose hegemony on the region just as did Saddam Hussein's former regime. It is also using WMDs in its internal and foreign wars, sending thousands of people to jails without trials, restricting freedoms and abhorring counter-opinions.
Concerning peaceful rotation of power, the US administration replaced Jay Garner with Paul Bremer (the American civil administrator in Iraq) without any coups or conspiracies unlike the earlier cases in Iraq. It can also change Bremer peacefully.
Arguments that the new state uses English in its deals, which does not match its affiliation to the region, can be rebuffed by saying that the "Gulf America" uses Arabic in its audiovisual mass media and press directed to sisterly countries in the region, including the Sawa Radio, Hi magazine and an underway "Al-Horah" (the free) Arabic satellite channel, not to mention American Arabic websites.
The U.S. was founded over 228 years ago under circumstances similar to the current ones in the Gulf-based America. Land was dwelled by groups of flowing settlers, with each group controlling a certain area and imposing its laws and traditions on it. There was no infrastructure, people suffered joblessness, looting and pillage were rampant, personal safety was lost and north-south conflict turned into a grinding civil war.
SAUDI REFORMS: WHAT IS MEANT BY POLITICAL PARTICIPATION
Meanwhile, news reports said that a number of Saudi female intellectuals were preparing a document about women's right in the Saudi society.
Firstly, the reform proposals submitted to the government are very ambitious and require big changes in the concept of statehood and the state's relationship with the government and the society.
It says it is preoccupied with reform, which is a positive position, but, on the other hand, it does not say what it means by its concept of reform, what the boundaries of such reforms are and what the results that such reforms would lead to at the end.
Practically, this means that the government is part of such a dialogue and approves of the recommendations of the conferees, which is considered another positive indicator for the government and its position towards the notion of reform.
The religious trend is divided into Sunnites, Shiites, Ismailites and Sufis.
The question now is: Has the government accepted the conception of participation as basic objective for reform?
However, the nature of such participation and its limits, according to the government's perspective, are still vague because we have not yet heard a clear definition of such a term by any Saudi official.
This seems to be the reason for the government's keenness on not to be a direct party in the dialogue, but rather a sponsor, which allows it to freely direct and choose.
The first option reflects a political wit that wants to start from the political reality to change it.
The civil society is considered, here, as a main element in forming the state.
It seems that we have not exceeded the stage of questions, especially for those who are not involved in the decision-making process.
Following the liberation of Syria, some Turks used to live in it due to their familial relations, interests and properties. The Syrians have similar rights in Turkey including the border cause and water quotas.
So, Turkish politicians did not conceal their urgent need for political, security and economic detente with Syria for its importance in the region, as it borders occupied Palestine from the North and it is a gate to Arab countries in general.
As for Syria, the last incidents in the region made it give up gradually some cards and adhere but rather "untightly" to some other ones, as the Palestinian card starts to come out of its hand under the American pressure.
After half a century of Turkey's pivotal role in the calculations of America and the West in general and after three decades of the Syrian rising role in the region, the two countries are haunted by a desire to retain what could possibly be retained of their regional role in light of the rise of other new forces allied to the United States.
In spite of all efforts exerted by Arab countries to cut the rates of mother mortality during delivery, such rates still constitute one of the hardest challenges to the health system in the Arab world.
KHOMEINI'S GRANDCHILD BACK TO IRAN DUE TO THREATS HE RECEIVED IN IRAQ
Once he received a message from his grandmother, Hussein collected his luggage ignoring his friends' warnings and headed for Qum in Iran so easily.
Replying to a question whether there were Egyptian security demands from Iran that obstruct the resumption of the Egyptian-Iranian relations, Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher attributed that delay to the internal conflicts witnessed by the Iranian scene between the conservatives and the reformists.
In an interview with Al-Hayat, Akif emphasized Muslim Brotherhood's desire to interact with social forces including the government and political parties.
He said, "None of us would enter into conflicts to reach a certain position.
We've often told them that our file had better be assigned to the political system.
He talked about the group's relation with other political forces and parties and emphasized keenness on dialogue with all forces on the Egyptian arena for the benefit of this nation.
We are advocates of faith, right, freedom and justice. Anything on the international level which fails to respect such constants is confronted by us because vehemently as we can as we are not free and freedom is absent in our country. Adversity now claims international dissemination. We, therefore, do our best to observe the rules of discretion.
He ascribed several problems in the Egyptian society to the absence of freedoms. He added that when Muslim Brotherhood nominated a woman to contest the recent parliamentary elections in one of Alexandria's constituencies, the government gathered all its forces against her thus causing her to lose even though she won the majority of votes. This was meant to prevent the people from having a good image about the group.
He said, "I know that Islamic organizations Union has men who are wise enough to stand against that malicious trend which has identical trends in Turkey and Tunisia against Hijab. God willing, our brothers in France will be able to cope with that matter in the way they deem adequate.
In 1993, I went to America and published a book on "political plurality and the woman". It was distributed in a mosque. No sooner had it been read that 30 women professed Islam as they are people who are convinced of what is right."
The main People's Committees (localities and municipalities) will be instructed to change the current Libya's six-word name, as the "Socialist" may be omitted for being inconvenient with the current international developments and current economic reform policy launched recently by Libyan Prime Minister Shukri Ghanem, a source close to Gaddafi told Asharq Al-Awsat.
The successive internal and external developments currently witnessed by Libya make it inevitable to change the current name in order to keep abreast of the legitimate aspirations of the Libyan people and be in harmony with the current positive aspects in Libya's foreign relations and its hope to immediately normalize relations with the United States, he added.
15 EGYPTIAN CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES QUALIFIED FOR EXECUTION OF INTERNATIONAL TENDERS FOR RECONSTRUCTION OF IRAQ
He said that the deregulation of the services sector trade especially construction as of next year makes it necessary to complete the plan for qualifying those companies and expanding them to include other companies in a bid to be up to an equal rivalry with major international companies currently planning to invade Arab and Egyptian markets in that field.
He pointed out that the banking sector's failure to support companies on foreign markets as well as the high cost of letters of guarantee required by banks for financing construction projects abroad, the equivalent of 10% of the tender value, as well as the difficulty of procedures of getting access to some Arab markets due to visas and restrictions of ownership or execution of construction projects without domestic partners have diminished the chances of Egyptian construction sector presence on Arab and even African markets, especially in light of the unequal rivalry with international companies.
Contrary to the belief of many people, economic advisor to the Prime Minister Dr. Hatem Al-Qarnashawi said that monopoly, that is a producer or an importer's complete control over a certain commodity or service, is not bad by necessity, but rather might have advantages. The more the production the less the cost, thus saving resources for the country, he added.
The monopolistic agreement between a number of producers with the objective of controlling the market by dividing it among them is more dangerous than overt monopoly, he noted.
The government's announcement that it would put up dollar saving coffers through the Post Authority raised fears of many economists and bankers that a new setback would take place on the exchange market, which was about to recover from dollarization and get rid of the unofficial exchange market.
According to economist Dr. Nabil Hashad, any attempt to increase the dollar interest rate under any nomenclature at present would lead to more pressure on the pound. He stressed that the interest rate rise should come within a package of clear-cut monetary policies and measures in synchronization with putting the dollar inter-bank mechanism into effect and commitment to full transparency in dealing on the market.
These saving coffers would add further burdens to the government and repeat the problem of the dollar bonds put up by the government with an interest rate hitting 7% at a time the dollar interest rate had retreated. This, therefore, cost the public treasury some 500 million dollars annually, Omar added.
According to Ministers of Insurance and Social Affairs Dr. Amina Al-Gindi Social Insurance funds will be invested with a view to diversifying investment spheres, preserving the invested funds, guaranteeing their value and development through their contribution to boosting economic and social development.
3,000 TEXTILE PLANTS THREATENED WITH BANKRUPTCY
The latest decision reduced the customs duties to 22%, down 11%.
The government decided to estimate customs duties on polyester threads at 12%. In the meantime, it estimated the customs duties on raw polyester imports, before being converted to threads, at 12%. This means that there are 300 local factories operating in converting raw polyester to threads threatened with closure, as local textile plants would import their production requirements at prices lower than their local counterparts.
These companies had been loss-making for years and still need an administrative revolution that could turn them into profit-making companies.
The private sector, on the other hand, suffers from problems represented in procuring currency and importing raw materials or buying local yarn, whose prices jumped up last year by 70%.
It had better seize those who smuggle such products in order to the give the local industry a chance to market its products.
It also subsidized cotton prices by 50 pounds per kanatar, he added.
LE29.7 BILLION EGYPTIAN EXPORTS IN 10 MONTHS
Crude oil exports rose to one billion and 712 million pounds, an increase of 43.6%; raw cotton exports went up to about LE3 billion, an increase of 54.3%; ready made apparel exports rose to LE1.1 billion, an increase of 38.2%; cotton yarn exports went up to LE606 million, an increase of 55.3%; rolled steel products went up to about LE569 million, an increase of 41.4%; textiles exports went up to LE561.4 million and an increase of 53.1%.

Mohamed Kamel. He stressed WB's confidence in Egypt's ability to repay its foreign debts. "Egypt can be given more than 2.5-billion-dollar loans from the WB over the coming four years. The WB is ready to extend any loans needed by Egypt," Kamel added.
Prime Minister Atef Ebeid received on Tuesday (March. 23rd) a report from governor of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) Farouq Al-Okda. The report said a surplus in foreign exchange resources was achieved, trade balance improved, deficit decreased and exports increased.
65% OF 2004/2005 INVESTMENTS ARE PRIVATE SECTOR'S
Abdel Hai said that the private sector was the main partner in development. He expected the private sector to contribute 75% to development projects through obtaining roughly 70% of credit in banks. He called upon the private sector to respond more to the facilities provided to it, increase contribution to creating job openings and enhance research projects and economic and scientific studies that positively affect it. "These studies are significant for opening new vistas before exporters and investors on internal and external markets," he concluded.
On the other hand, the Al-Watani Bank of Egypt's general assembly agreed on raising the Bank's authorized capital from 315 million pounds to 750 million pounds. It also assigned the board of directors to take the necessary procedures for increasing the paid up capital of the bank within the authorized limits.
It is to be mentioned that NSGB is registered on the first official list in the stock exchange with fully paid up capital of 500 million pounds and 50 million shares at a nominal value of 10 pounds each.
This move comes while several banks recently showed reservations about granting new facilities to those investors in spite of the growing risks involved in such an industry especially due to the issuance of the new decision.
The company would represent Russian and Egyptian businessmen and aim at offering trade services in cooperation with businessmen by giving access to trade information, preparing marketing studies, developing industrial investment projects, facilitating means of production, offering new products and helping set up an agricultural system for long scale exports, not to mention the development and improvement of Egyptian-Russian tourism and new spheres that can be added in the future.

During the period from May 3rd to 5th, Cairo will host African Communications Conference and Exhibition "Africa Telecom" where 40 African and Arab ministers will participate.
He pointed out that the conference would cover a variety of issues connected with the communications sector in Africa such as the status of that industry internationally and regionally as well as the challenges facing it in addition to ways and means of developing the infrastructure of communications and devising new successful economic models to offer communication services in Africa.
Members of the Commodity Council for Household Linens (CCHL) will submit a memo to premier Dr. Atef Ebeid in a few days' time monitoring the main challenges facing textile, clothes, and linen exports after canceling the quota system at the beginning of 2005. They will demand further support policies to ensure the protection of domestic production.
Head of the CCHL Mohamed Farid Khamis pointed out that although production conditions in Egypt were better than they were in China and India and had a stronger infrastructure than theirs, they had a better working environment, which enabled them to build enormous production capacities that could invade international markets.
The members pointed out a shortage of domestic yarn, which would threaten a cancellation of a good part of their export contracts as importers abroad stipulate that exported products should be 100 per cent Egyptian cotton made.
The Supreme Committee for Investment in the Ministry of Insurance will meet next Wednesday to discuss the investment of part of new insurance funds surplus in a number of projects.
Opening the headquarters of the National Company for Computer Services (NCS) Company, an affiliate of Babtin Group in Egypt, he said that other real estate projects comprised a project in Heliopolis with total investments of $160 million. Helipolis project, in turn, groups a five-star hotel, a shopping mall, and housing and office buildings.
How could this Palestinian mother of two, one of whom is a suckling, have the nerve to pretend to have a broken leg and walk lamely till she reached the frisking room? When a large number of Israeli soldiers gathered around her, she blew herself up killing a number of Israeli occupiers.
We (the writer) are neither inciting terrorism nor encouraging violence.
Do not claim that Israel's security efforts are the mover and shaker of every truce of the Palestinian factions, and then uprise to take revenge whenever a suicidal operation takes place here or there.
Prime Minister Dr. Atef Ebeid asked the political leadership to relieve him of his duties due to health reasons.
The ruling party, moreover, would play an influential role in naming new elements for holding government posts under the slogan "Party's Government not Government's Party". In that context, President Mubarak asked party leaders to prepare a list of important partisan elements qualified for holding ministerial positions in preparation for an imminent re-shuffle.
Regardless of the motives that drove such governments to reconsider their positions especially foreign ones and whether that shift was self imposed or imposed by the pressure of the existence of American forces on those countries' borders, there would be a movement that would certainly create different positions from those which had been dominant before.
Here lies the difference between the situation in East Europe where the peoples themselves advocated a big change after the Soviet Union breakup soon after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
In other words, peoples do not sympathize with that movement, especially as its external aspect is the more dominant onewhereas the internal factors still lacking in clarity that would make it an all-out project worth of internal support rather than mere American praise!
However, there is only one possibility in Israel - the continuation of confrontation with the Arabs.
Thus, only one thing is likely -failure that would lead only to confrontations!
Prince Turki said that Pearle's allegation about Saudi Arabia had been said about Syria. He added that Pearle was giving rein to his wishful thinking due to his Zionist zeal that can take only Israel's interest into consideration.
He invited anybody who predicted Saudi Arabia's end to visit it as the majority of those who predicted the Kingdom's fall had neither visited nor read about it nor even met any Saudis."

PARL. SIGNATURES TO NOMINATE MUBARAK FOR FIFTH TERM
President Hosni Mubarak vowed to continue political and economic reforms, saying that the reform is a "cornerstone that should be given priority". "Egypt made a great progress in that respect," he added.
"All the steps taken in the political reform process are well-planned and taken according to public interests. Reform is carried out gradually in order to avoid risks and maintain the public interests during transitional stages," Mubarak said.
Mubarak expressed his appreciation of the civil society institutions, highlighting the necessity of giving them a greater role provided that they sincerely work for the ultimate interest of the public rather than any external bodies.
Mubarak also underpinned the importance of holding a meeting between the Israeli and Palestinian premiers with the aim of negotiating on both sides' attitudes.
He maintained that the Palestinian people might accept from Arafat many solutions and alternatives that cannot be decided on by any other man. Mubarak also uncovered his contacts and discussions with the American president on the importance of achieving stability with a view to energizing the "roadmap".

According to well-informed sources,. The current meetings, which are dominated by the Ministerial Economic Group, are bent on taking measures pertaining to the level of basic goods prices which witnessed a remarkable rise over one year on end since the adoption of Egyptian pound flotation policy so much so that the increases ranged between 25% and 92%. A list of commodities, the prices of which have been reduced together with the new prices is expected to be announced in a few days' time.
The sources linked between President Mubarak's meeting with Premier Atef Ebeid a few days ago and such measures.
The deputies are preparing a document of justifications urging them to ask for the government's resignation, in the forefront of which are goods price hikes due to obvious errors in implementing the policy of Egyptian pound flotation, thus leading to its devaluation and the rise in the dollar rate of exchange which broke the LE7 barrier on the black market. Another error also lay in burdening citizens with extra financial duties on electricity consumption invoices represented in scavenging duties on behalf of foreign companies and the fact that new social brackets have joined the below-poverty line categories, thus taking the rate up, according to the deputies, to 58%.
The map of classes in Egypt has seen key shifts since the orientation-towards-free-economy program was put in place in 1991, and in light of technological shifts that increased white-collar workers at the expense of blue-collar workers and middle-class people's preoccupation with small-sized projects based on capital relationships, it said.

LE1 BILLION COST OF EXPORT ORIENTED PAPER PLANT
He pointed out that the new plant would be constructed under the free zone s ystem with a view to exporting its full production, thus production of the remained plants in Egypt would be oriented to the domestic market to meet the shortage on it instead of exporting its production and ignoring the local industry needs.

Egyptian Computer Markets Association head, Ala Al Ghawi warned that Egyptian computer markets had become investment repelling. He added that 40% of investments in the field of information technology had left for other markets like those of the UAE and Saudi Arabia. He attributed that to several factors in the forefront of which is fluctuation of rates of exchange, which created a state of lack of long-term commitments as well as the deterioration of selling and buying movement pending any new developments, in addition to the banks ceasing to finance computer projects and the rise in taxes on the basic components of computer sets.
Al Ghawi welcomed the step of reducing customs tariff on computer basic components to 2%. He, however, pointed out that Customs Department accuse computer traders of customs evasion and does not approve the invoices presented to it although they may be authenticated by the exporting country's chamber of commerce as well as the Egyptian consulate. He said that the customs reduction initiative would be of no avail due to the high rates of sales tax, storage spaces and services which eventually claim 16% of the product value.
Production will then increase to 500 thousand computers in the second years. Production is due to begin in 6 months' time 50% of which will be export oriented in the beginning initially to the Middle East, Africa and Eastern Europe.

Therefore, importers resorted to the local market in a bid to provide their needs at appropriate prices, not to mention the locally produced cotton's advantage of international quality.

This would help the domestic market to recover, raise production rate and, eventually, lead to the prosperity of auto industry and exports would be at reasonable prices to meet both internal and external demands.

Egyptian ceramics and porcelain have a good opportunity to penetrate South Korean market. These industries, he added, pollute the environment and need energy, which is not available in Korea, that is why it imports all its needs from abroad.

KUWAIT: POPULATION 2.5 MILLIONS
WHY DOES NOT PRESIDENT MUBARAK TALK TO THE PEOPLE ABOUT NATION'S CONDITION?
This is also because the majority of the Egyptian people still trust and love Mubarak for many reasons.
If his answer was in the affirmative, we believe that the first thing we want to hear from him is whether the rates of exchange had really been deregulated or not, whether the Egyptian pound had lost 70% of its value against the dollar or not and whether the prices of oil, flour, rice, lentils and food beans rose or not.
The people want their President to talk to them about the difference between stability and immutability.
People actually expect of Mubarak a special talk about their middle class in Egypt which has been crushed and utterly disappeared even though it had offered Egypt all its leaders so much so that its disappearance would distort the Egyptian personality characterized by the virtues of hard work, honesty, vigour and chastity!
We'd like to know from his Excellency too why he does not immediately bring about an all-out revolution, rather than a re-shuffle, including all Egypt's ministers, ministries, administrations, newspapers and magazines replacing those trusted by those with experience as the formers have already ruined the country and its people!

Over the last few weeks, one can notice "Lebanization signs" in Iraq. The Iraqis, therefore, should pay due attention to the concerns of wise and veteran diplomat Lakhdar Librahimi over the collapse of Iraq in sectarian conflicts.
They are "Lebanization" scenes: a majority complaining about injustices and a minority not recognizing this and even concerned about forming the coming Iraqi regime on that basis.
On the other hand, head of the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution Abdel-Aziz Al-Hakim emphasizes that Al-Qaeda is involved in assassinating his brother Mohamed Baqqer Al-Hakim and the aim was to foment a sectarian sedition.
The Iraqis themselves should take the lead, before it is too late, and exchange concessions in order to stop sectarian skirmishes as well as other skirmishes between the Arabs and the Kurds.
All legal and legislative procedures have been taken to abrogate the penalty in the coming few days, and no one will be jailed in connection with published views, Aref said quoting the president.

BIBLIOTHECA ALEXANDRINA DISCUSSES REFORM
GENERAL CONGRESS OF EGYPTIAN JOURNALISTS IN THE CONTEXT OF INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS
In consequence, our countries and governments will no longer be able to isolate themselves from the world's rapid movement under the delusion of having a cover of strict bonds and strong barriers as they all collapsed thanks to the revolution of information, freedom and communication technology.

In his back-page column, Chief Editor, Abdullah Al-Senawi writes an article which runs to the following effect: I'm afraid one of the main reasons for impeding a democratic development in Egypt and delaying the political and constitutional reform sine die lies in security fears! President Mubarak may well have security fears, which are naturally legitimate given his constitutional obligations, that foreign force might intervene through pumping millions of dollars into the Presidential elections should they be contested by more than one candidate, according to the demands of the change-seeking trend in Egypt! Such security fears, nevertheless, can by no means justify any delay of political and constitutional reform or a recognition of the free direct election principle of the president of the republic from among several candidates.
There is a general feeling that borders on "despair". The main truths give steady momentum to a an erosion of the regime's legitimacy and widen the gap between an inept government and an utterly desperate people. The main truths in frustrated humiliated streets, unprecedentedly augurs explosion. The procrastination of change sine die in the name of gradualness is a call to ultimate despair of any improvement of conditions or peaceful transition of power.
Regardless of any political differences with President Sadat, his legitimacy was based, in the first place, on the October War. In spite of our respect to President Mubarak, the rule's legitimacy is eroding, which threatens the country's security even before the security of the regime! Change should not be delayed as inevitable disasters might be looming!

"The Arab states will reiterate their firm commitment to this initiative and call on Israel to deal with it," AL Secretary General said, noting that the Arab stance on refugees, Jerusalem and the Palestinian statehood has not changed. What remains is the security issue and it is a regional issue that should be dealt with clearly, i.e. Israel should conform to the laws that the neighbouring Arab countries conform to, otherwise a security deal would be impossible.
The Greater Middle East initiative is acceptable, but under a different US policy and a different Israel.
Washington feels full guardianship over others and turns a deaf ear to every opinion. It gives "prescriptions" just like doctors who write prescriptions to their patients without even consulting them.
They want to draw policies of these countries. I'm afraid this proposal is a kind of shirking the confrontation with the Arab-Israeli conflict. It seems that the US doesn't want to think of the Arab-Israeli conflict away from other situations in the region that may include Iraq, West Asia, Afghanistan and Iran.

Foreign Minister Abdulaziz Belkhadem says that the army pledged to be neutral in the elections and there is not the least doubt that the presidency position would be decided through the ballot boxes.

IN IRAQ The Egyptian-South Korean business council will hold its fourth meeting in Cairo next Tuesday (April 27th) to examine the horizons of increasing Egyptian exports to South Korea and joint investment in Egypt through drawing upon the Korean technology and executing joint projects in Iraq.

Ebeid pointed to three key points. First; 22 percent investments of the annual gross national product (GNP) are needed to achieve a growth rate of 6-7 percent per annual.
She emphasized the role played by the international cooperation sector in supporting the activity of free zones and optimally using available finance.

MUBARAK: EGYPTIAN-SAUDI-SYRIAN INITIATIVE TO REFORM AL
This phone call came following statements by President Mubarak in which he criticized the American project known as Greater Middle East, describing it as an unacceptable "ready-made recipe".
For his part Saudi Foreign Minister Saud Al-Faisal said that both Egypt and Saudi Arabia agreed to submit a joint paper on reforming the Arab situation to the Arab ministerial council early next month.
Trying to diffuse concerns raised by Egypt and Saudi Arabia regarding the US projects to reform the Middle East, US Secretary of State Colin Powell said, "These initiatives will not be imposed from abroad."
In statements to chief editors of Egyptian newspapers on board of his plane during his return from Riyadh, Mubarak said, "We concentrated in this project on the necessity that Arab joint work should emanate from an institutional system, rather than an emotional one that won't be affected by any temporary circumstances."
In reference to Western projects for reformation in Arab countries, Mubarak said, "It is a mere illusion to think that anybody can impose solutions or reforms from abroad on any society or region.
During a symposium held in Cairo Lions Club, Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar Dr. Mohamed Sayed Tantawi and Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of Saint Mark Episcopate Shenuda III announced their support of Egypt's World Cup 2010 bid.

He expressed his firm conviction that comprehensive reform is a must provided that any reform program is designed internally in accordance with the needs of the region's peoples. The president also warned of chaos and instability unless the reform process is carried out in suitable phases so that the society can accommodate it. Giving the Iraqi example, Mubarak said every people and society have their own circumstances, values, traditions and psychological structure.

DUE TO RWANDA: LAWSUIT AGAINST THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
SINAI AND ISRAELI AGENDA
Israel's relationship with its neighbours and its historic connection with Sinai and the Palestinian issue are at the bottom of such provocative governmental remarks.
The security issue is not the only premonition of Israel as there are other motives that control Israeli policy:
Gulf and Iraqi oil can be one of Israel's ambitions too.
Back to the Sinai issue, it is an old issue that begins with the exodus of the Jews from Egypt, an issue that has been consigned to oblivion, and then the story of searching for a statehood.
What does then Israel want of Sinai, especially as Israeli comments were made in this respect?
The answer is in the negative as Israel obtains oil according to trade bases and the peace deal and Sinai is not rich in water. Israel's dream about getting River Nile water (to quench the thirst of pilgrims to Jerusalem), as claimed in the reign of late president Anwar Sadat, has been dashed.
The issue is clear-cut...emptying Palestine's land and dislodging its people. But, up till now Israel is still unable to put this scheme in place for two reasons.
PALESTINIAN-ISRAELI RADIO TO ENHANCE COEXISTENCE POLICY
The Palestinian manager Maisaa Saniora said that the programmes of the new radio station would focus on enhancing coexistence. Broadcasting will start in the Palestinian Authority territories. The radio administration is making some contacts with the Israeli Communications Ministry in order to get legal permission to air on the same wave the Palestinians were allowed to use in Madrid Conference.
"I fear that such a radio station would be anti-Zionist," he said.
The educational village would be like "a free zone" in which American, Israeli and Jordanian lecturers and scientists would teach high technology, biology and Agriculture sciences to Israeli, Jordanian and Palestinian students, said Israeli sources. A "Peace Center" would be set up beside this village to serve the region's peoples in every peace activity. This peace center would host international peace conferences to be similar to Camp David in the United States.
The Israeli Haaretz daily reported on Tuesday that Israeli Mossad Chief Gen. Ma'ir Daghan recently visited Egypt to discuss a potential Israeli withdrawal from Gaza Strip.
Israeli forces plan to step up their activities in Gaza Strip in the coming period, including sending forces in swift operations at the Palestinian National Authority-controlled areas and launching more assassinations against Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders.
The reports described these proposals as "proper and well-formulated".
Israel has earlier, before halting negotiations with Syria, accepted full withdrawal from all the Golan Golan Heights except for a narrow strip along the eastern bank of Lake Tiberias.
The CIA expects that bin Laden would be captured in the summer as the snow in the border area melts, said the official, who used to work as an international security affairs consultant.
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi called for establishing one African army to protect the black continent against any foreign aggression and help solve internal conflicts.
A country like Nigeria today, he added, shoulders a big responsibility of peace-keeping and defence operations in West Africa. It pays exorbitant expenses estimated at 12 billion dollars to keep peace.
The agreement was reached at a meeting by the constitutional body which was attended by the International Islamic Bank of Qatar delegation headed by deputy board chairman of the bank Sheikh Khaled bin Thani bin Abdullah Al-Thani and the Syrian Da'boul economic group headed by deputy board chairman of the group Zaher Ahmed Da'boul.
The agreement comes within the framework of measures taken by the Syrian government to encourage the Syrian private sector to cooperate with Arab and foreign banks in establishing private banks in Syria after 40 years of absence.
Moreover, the American Greater Middle East initiative is currently being raised amid absence of consultations with Arab countries. Some Arab countries, especially Israel's neighbours, may put such an issue on top of their agendas.
It might be mentioned that the development document introduced an article related specifically to Saudi Arabia. This proposal, dubbed covenant, talks about joint policies to achieve the objectives of the AL Chart.
The AL Secretary General shall participate on its meetings. The council will discharge the following tasks:
3- Bolstering Arab capabilities in the field of preventive action, early warning and forming Arab peacekeepers.
This proposal should be passed once it is endorsed by nine AL member states according to their constitutional systems. The endorsement documents shall be deposited with the AL General Secretariat.
For the first time, the statement called for holding presidential and parliamentary elections in Lebanon according to constitutional laws.
The statement voiced sorrow that Lebanon backtracked its freezing of capital punishment. The abrogation of this punishment would contribute to boosting human dignity and developing human rights gradually.
NAILA MU'WAD FIRST LEBANESE FEMALE NOMINATED TO PRESIDENCY
SAUDI ARABIA, EGYPT REJECT IMPOSITION OF REFORM MODEL FROM ABROAD
Al-Hayat learnt that the kingdom's leaders and the Egyptian President agreed that a unified Arab formula must be reached for developing joint Arab action and its mechanisms, including for example the foundation of an Arab security council and an Arab court of justice.
It highlighted the importance of making all efforts to activate the Arab peace initiative adopted by Beirut Summit two years ago.
In her exclusives to Al-Hayat Mu'wad said that turning the exception into a rule will bring about a change in the pioneering Lebanese experiment in the Arab region, as what is required is to restore democracy to Lebanon.
Sources with the Saudi Ministry of Defence and Aviation described such news items as a frameup, emphasizing that the Saudi Kingdom always calls for a Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction.
Washington puts forward an idea of holding a Middle Eastern summit on reforming the educational process in the region and ensuring participation of civil society's advocates of reform as well as political leaders.
The G-8 member states are expected to cooperate with the European Union and the USA in financing such an initiative to ensure its success and give it impetus as soon as it is endorsed.
* Giving priority to economic and social change and plans of redressing budget deficits in the Middle East countries without disregarding democratic reform or the existing ruling regimes reform.
* Providing financial and technical support for registering the electorate. * Establishing civil centers for defending public liberties and making them affiliated to faculties of law in the region.
* Urging the region's governments to allow independent institutions to work unrestrictedly and without any intervention in their affairs.
The charge of "destabilizing the Middle East" became destabilizing what is called for decorum the American "presence" in Iraq, the charge of obstructing the application of the democratic system in the Middle East came to mean opposing American schemes for the post-Saddam Iraq and the charge of backing terrorism came to mean winking at the infiltration of American "presence" resistance into Iraq across the joint border of the two countries.
They could be expected to pass through two stages, one of them tactical imposed in the short run by such considerations while the second is strategic and is required by an American apparent desire to stay in the embraces of the Near East Arabs as can obviously be guessed from the enormous financial commitment to what is called the construction of Iraq ($87 billion apart from growing military expenditure) and the projects prepared for the accommodation of such a stay, particularly the Greater Middle East project.
THE MIDDLE EAST ON THE THRESHOLD OF COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP
Even American arrangements for filling in the gap is still branded with defects or ambiguity in several aspects.
This guess is based on speculations about the Egyptian President's visit to Ankara last week and his meeting with Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezar where political and economic issues were broached especially the possibility of a joint role to be played by Cairo and Ankara to solve the problem of frozen negotiations between Syria and Israel which Damascus increasingly showed willingness to unconditionally resume while Israeli responses wavered between approval, rejection to caution.
Such prospective cooperation may be combined with Syrian activity towards Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Egypt as an attempt to escape from the ring that may be imposed on Syria.
In the forefront of such signs is the disappearance of the sole regional superpower that can play an effective role which has come now to rely on new components including the degree of political reform, economic cohesion, strength of domestic social structure, and having distinguished regional and international relations, not to mention closeness to the American expectations agenda in the region.
This may obviously be seen in what is going on in Iraq, its big weight in the Sudanese question and its orientations about Libya and its strategic ambitions in the region.
The security laxity that appears in some vital joints would be serious factors in turning the new Middle East project into a success.
Other countries, furthermore like Syria and Iran, who are expected to join that system, are subject to various types of pressure that would probably force them to yield to American demands not only out of their conviction of that behaviour having political feasibility, but also because they wish to settle their pending problems with the USA.
This option, too, would accelerate the steps of merging the region's countries into one system that would rely on abandonment of many prevalent thoughts.
WHAT DOES UNIFICATION OF CYPRUS MEAN TO THE GULFIDES AND THE MIDDLE EASTERNERS?
Professor of political sciences in King Abdul Aziz University, Dr. Wahid Hamza Hashim says that the opening of the Cyprus file at this particular time has been caused by the positive changes and opening climates recently witnessed by international relations.
Dr. Al Amir, however, agreed with Dr. Hashim that although it was Turkey which has to take the difficult decision, there are several motives that encourage it to offer the anticipated capitulations. The decision goes beyond the Turkish national home as a unified Cyprus would be the means through which the European Union would exercise pressure on Turkey, with American support and encouragement, to adopt a set of international action principles to prevent Islam from further taking root in Turkish culture. This, however, should not overshadow the fact that there is an obvious bias to the secular Islamic political Turkish model after the introduction of some amendments. Such amendments include a larger recognition of the rights of ethnic minorities, a depletion of the role of the military establishment and a deregulation of economic activities.
Political Concessions Over the same point, professor of International Relations, King Abdul Aziz University in Jeddah, Dr. Sadaqa Fadel says that the pressure on Turkey till next May 4th will aggravate in order that it may offer political concessions in favour of the establishment of domestic federation in Cyprus transcending Turkish and Greek ethnic differences.
US INFORMATION: AL-ZAWAHRI ABOUT TO BE CAPTURED
In Cairo, lawyer Mahfouz Azzam, Al-Zawahri's uncle, received an avalanche of phone calls asking him for information about his nephew and the cases in which he was accused before the assassination of late president Anwar Sadat and his departure from Egypt after he spent 3 years in prison for being accu sed in the assassination case.

Forefront of those companies is the Egyptian Bottling Company that has been sold at 131 million pounds, as less than four years later an investor sold 77% of the company's shares for 400 million dollars, which is ten times as much as the value at which the whole company had been sold.
Dr Shwaki Al-Sayed said that the general policy of the privatization program necessitates selling loss-making companies, which are considered a burden on the government, and keeping the profit-making ones as long as they yield profits. Disposal of profit-making companies is considered public fund plundering that should bring privatization officials to book especially when selling operations are suspicious or lack transparency.

Under this title, London-based Al-Hayat daily managing editor Zohair Qusaibati writes an article to say: Damascus has failed to follow "Libya's example" so it is now the right time for penalizing it, said U.S. Assistant State Secretary William Burns.
The fact that the media campaign in Washington on both Cairo and Damascus coincides with the imminent implementation of the Syria Accountability Act has insinuations, including two simple messages. The first message sent to the Syrians means that time is running out and a likely withdrawal of their forces from Lebanon will not be enough to turn over a new leaf with the U.S.
The incident involving an American diplomat being held in Damascus while attending a protest marking the Syrian Baath Party stepping to power is merely a "tiny mine" that may increase the appetite of the Syria Accountability Act makers.
While the simplest example of insolence and blackmailing is the paper's onslaught on "unimportant terms like nationalism and socialism" in Cairo and Damascus, the most heinous passivity is the silence of Arabs to the extent that they cannot even make any diplomatic protest.

It monitored Gamal's attempts to "suggest solutions to complicated problems in several spheres". He saw him as "leader of national action group, not an intruder into power trying to seize it."
The writer thought that Gamal Mubarak had managed to win the support of a broad sector of youth. His adoption of political reform projects in the face of the party's old guard power would ensure him a presence among those who sought a role which they had been denied for long years. He regarded Gamal as the most qualified, both in content and form to engage in the conflict due to his relations with the presidency establishment, which will provide him with momentum that would help him to engage in the conflict and lay down calmly and gradually the foundation stone in the change edifice within the framework of established rules.

Egyptian Shiites are currently estimated at about 1% of Egypt's population according to the report on religious freedoms issued by the American Department of State which put them at 700 thousands. The arrest of some them in Ras Gharib was a surprise to public opinion, which linked that 20-year Shiite absence to "Al-Tukya" principle, which allows its advocates to practice their rites secretly while pretending to follow other sects just to evade danger.

What is urgently required is this: a genuine change in the political environment, serious and new democratic rules should be established to restore for the Egyptian citizens their due right in resolving matters.
Surely enough, Egypt is heading for some kind of political reform this year. It is to nobody's interest that such a reform may be delayed or that fragile initiatives like the Egyptian initiative for political reform in the Arab world may be involved as it has not been taken in earnest by anybody either in Egypt or the Arab region. Its wording is embarrassed, it real goals stop at procrastination or perhaps attempting to seek refugee in the Arab summit in Tunisia conveying a message to America and the West that we reject foreign dictates for political reform but are meanwhile forging ahead with that reform in accordance with our special needs!
There is an overwhelming desire for a comprehensive democratic change, a change in policies and faces and the establishment of political regimes efficient enough to preserve the rights and interests not of the rulers but of their peoples.

ARAB LEAGUE REFORM AND DISSOLUTION OF ARAB SYSTEM
"The government encourages all forms of investment, be it local, Arab or foreign in order to increase job opportunities. Under this headline, Walid Shukir of Al-Hayat wrote an article, which ran to the following effect: It is hard to imagine any reform process in the Arab League that deals with action and decision mechanisms in such a regional organization without the attainment of a minimum unity of political positions and a minimum economic cooperation. Such cooperation is subject to impediments and deliberate sloth ensuing from sterility, monopolistic tendencies and temptations of "distinction" through false relations with Western powers to the extent, in some cases, of turning into mandates.
By the same token, differences between Arab foreign ministers and, therefore, their countries over the project of democracy in the Greater Middle East may seem absurd.
The problem also lies in another part of the American project, which represents a challenge which the Arab League and its main countries have to face.
This will be followed by or perhaps coincide with a redeployment of American forces in Asia and Europe in regard to the Greater Middle East. 2- Drowning the Arab system (and in consequence, the Arab League) within the framework of a new regional international system including Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran to be covered by the new deployment of the NATO and the American forces.
It is just an emphasis of excluding the international organization and may well be a rehearsal for a new international one wanted by Washington. This may well make it incumbent on the Arab League to start efforts to reform itself and unify positions towards those aspects of the American project.

INTERNAL DEBT EXCEEDS LIMITS OF SAFETY
The actual deficit, according to the final account, went up by 24.6 billion pounds in comparison to the total estimated deficit in FY 2001/2002 public budget, up 118.8%.

Several indicators refer to the current dangerous situation of the public debt in general and the internal debt in particular. The ratio of the internal debt to the GDP, for instance, exceeded limits of safety even in comparison to only the government's debts. During the period from 1998 up till now the growth rates of the public debts hit 13.5%, while the annual growth rate of the GDP hit 6.8%, which indicates the dangerous situation and the debt misadministration, said Prof. of commerce at the Faculty of Commerce, Al-Azhar University Mohamed Abdel-Halim Omar. There are many other indicators that we have exceeded the limits of safety to a great extent and that we have passed the stage of the simple problem that needs little effort to be solved it to the complicated chronic that can hardly be solved in the short run. This negatively impacts on the national economy as a whole, thus necessitating immediate and strategic interference in accordance with an objective plan to treat this crisis, Omar added.
Omar adds that such economic authorities sell their services to citizens at high prices equal to those on the market.

IRAQ: INTERIM CONSTITUTION ALLOWS JEWS TO RETURN FROM ISRAEL
The interim law caused a state of congestion in the Shiite street, said Al-Rabei, warning of hot incidents over the coming few weeks unless a new constitution based on a public referendum replaced the current one.
With the reservations of Shiite members of the Governing Council, a conflict between categories, to avoid using the word factions, started, with the main goal of distributing power among "centers of power or influence" which have been created by occupation or which emerged under occupation.
The Shiite were not taken in during the constitutional operation of producing the law of running the state in the provisional stage. They were rather subjected to American pressure that forced them to accept the "possible". After the signature which meant "Yes", however, came the reservations which meant "but".
Secondly, numerical democracy ensured the Shiites a leading position in the state, but the guarantees granted to other forces, especially the Kurds, have made the Shiites not a domineering or governing partner but an elder one.
The other American logic, on the other hand, is practically based on its fears as well as on the conflicts among Iraqi forces and other considerations suspicious of the Shiite forces that had never been loyal to the Americans.
The former regime, admittedly, had practiced the policy of racial discrimination against the Shiites and the Kurds but work for setting up a new system based on democratic principles has required a complete departure from the former regime's practices and mentality.
It seemed that getting rid of occupation has become the priority of Al- Sistani alone, to a further extent even than in the case of resistance whose identity or platform has not, so far, emerged.

Moroccans form the biggest foreign community in Spain. They have lived there since many decades. Immigration issues were among the thorny issues that bedeviled Spain-Morocco relations because Jose Maria Aznar's government tightened its grip on this community and did not "work for protecting the Moroccan economic interests in Spain estimated at US$ 6 billion," Moroccan officials said.
Madrid was also reserved about the free trade zone agreement signed between the United States and Morocco, saying the deal would boost Morocco's position between Europe, the USA, Middle East and northwest Africa.
Rabat hopes that the "illegitimate immigration" file be re-opened between the two countries.

"America aims at swallowing the Arab world, and handing the Arab countries on a gold plate to Israel", in this way Arab League (AL) Deputy Secretary General Nour Hashad justified the stance of the first institution concerned with the common Arab action. Such a stance ranged from bitter resentment to public condemnation regarding Washington's Greater Middle East project.
A: This dialogue and these discussions on the American project are a healthy and positive phenomenon in the Arab world. We are before a public dialogue that is angry at the way we are forced to accept Western projects which are too far from our traditions and conditions. Hence, the development that will be submitted to Tunisia summit included the establishment of an Arab parliament or a shura (advisory) council, which reflects attention the AL attaches to the Arab peoples and not only the governments.
Participants in Alexandria Conference on Reform on their second day were busy discussing their own working papers on political, economic and cultural reform in the Arab world as well as positions of Arab women.
The papers of the conference were featured by "self-reproach" and some of which were similar to the "Greater Middle East" project.
"It is no secret that many Arab regimes are still undemocratic and their economic conditions are similar to those of backward countries and their cultures are still far away from modernity and novelty," it added.
Arab Religious Discourse The paper dealt also with the Arab religious discourse and asked rulers to stop abusing religion for their own benefits, leave the door wide open for anti-religion secular trends to freely practise their activities.
Citing tangible changes in the feminist movement, the paper observed some shortcomings such as women's poor participation in political decision-making process due to the low representation of women in legislative and parliamentary councils.
Qassem's remarks were made during a celebration held by Hizbullah in Sajad town, south Lebanon. He concluded, "We believe in the moderate and balanced Islam which provides good for humanity.
Reforming the Arab League was at the top of priorities of the coming Arab Summit in Tunisia, but it has evaporated or rather has been postponed for one year to be on the 2005 Algeria Summit agenda.
Amid American pressure and insistence on reform, the AL development retreated to a "secondary" priority as it can simply wait.
In all likelihood, the truth will never be known.
There is another reason for arguing an endorsement of Arab League reform. The summit has to discuss the American project and the European projects to take a common attitude towards them.
The project, it is true, has become known either through leaking or smuggling, but this does not mean that the Arab capitals have received it.
There should, nevertheless, be a clear-cut or well-defined objective. The European Summit in Dublin at the end of this month may well find several initiatives awaiting discussion especially a French-German initiative. This summit will naturally try to draft a European project.
Would mere discussion of others' projects and rejecting their intervention be deemed sufficient alternative to the adoption of an Arab project?

Did you know that the value of that increase is just 15 tons and one feddan yields 20 tons.

Fahmi pointed out that the expansion of exploration activities nationwide especially in the Mediterranean Sea deep waters achieved many discoveries last year. New finds are expected to be achieved through the tenders which would be put up this year. 20 oil and exploration agreements are expected to be signed this year.
WILL OVERSEAS "ISLAMIC VIOLENCE" LOSE POPULAR SUPPORT?
It's certain that the amount of violence created by Al-Aqsa uprising (Intifada) in the consciousness of the Arab people was so tremendous. However, such admiration has not stopped at that limit but it turned into adoration of the "martyrdom" model that started in the second month of this blessed uprising till now.
On this background, Arabs and Muslims' reactions towards Sep. 11 attacks on New York and Washington emerged. US political leaderships could have dealt with these attacks rationally but the Neo- Conservatives in the USA adopted a more hard-line course that fuelled open hostility towards the USA after it took the offensive against Islam and Muslims all over the world. The war of Iraq certainly bore witness to those "imperialistic" intentions.
This became apparent when later operations took place in other countries rather than the United States, which has not seen such incidents since Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Bombings and blasts in Casablanca, Istanbul, Karbala, Kazyemia and finally Madrid were not acceptable by any means either from a political viewpoint or a religious one.
Perhaps Kazyemia and Karbala bomb attacks were not perpetrated by Al-Qaeda, a supposition which we strongly approve not because of Al-Qaeda's denial of those attacks but because premises reveal that people inside Iraq have interests in doing that. However, Al-Qaeda could be ideologically blamed for these attacks.
The conclusion is that denunciation of this violence among ordinary people even before elites and organized forces would leave its impact on planners of these attacks though it would not put a decisive end to them. These attacks, however, will lose its popular support and base among the crowds.
Asharq Al-Awsat got a copy of the draft agenda of the Arab League Council (round 16) put up now before the foreign ministers preparatory meeting as a prelude to being referred to the council at the summit level of the due to be held in Tunisia late this month. The draft agenda includes 18 items, regarding political, economic, social and cultural fields.
c- The current status of the General Secretariat and the member states' stance towards payment.
Asharq Al-Awsat learnt that in a closed-door meeting for Arab leaders during Tunisia summit Egypt would put up ideas of a unified Arab project for political reform that derives its broad lines from the document of Alexandria conference on reform on the ground that most intellectuals and politicians see it a basis for an Arab initiative forestalling the reform plans imposed from abroad.

The Council of Evangelical Churches in Egypt and the Middle East condemned the Israeli assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, founder and spiritual leader of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), as a crime against the symbol of struggle against humiliation and ignominy.
Popularity of Ariel Sharon the killer has risen in the Israeli Knesset following the assassination, allowing him to escape four no-confidence motions.

Al-Owais said that among the challenges that face the regional countries was the high demand for water along the last three decades due to urban, civilizational, industrial development as well as population growth.
He laid it bare that the bigger challenge that the region's countries face is how to run water resources perfectly and raise the efficiency of water usage to the utmost limit.
TAGAMO'H PARTY HOLDS WASHINGTON RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ISRAELI CRIME
General Guide of the Muslim Brotherhood Mohamed Mahdi Akef said the Israeli assassination of Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and other Palestinians is an unforgivable crime.
In a statement, the Muslim Brotherhood called on Arab and Muslim peoples and their leaders to be aware of schemes being plotted by Zionists and Americans to eliminate their entities.
Arab Democratic Nasserite Party held US President George W. Bush responsible for the crime of assassinating spiritual leader of Hamas Movement Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. In a statement, the party said Bush, who still describes Sharon as a man of peace, is responsible for such a crime citing the silence of the US Administration about all the Israeli crimes against the Palestinian people and its hastiness to condemn Palestinian resistance operations labeling them as terrorism.
The list of Palestinian leading figures targeted by Israel after Sheikh Ahmed Yassin include: President Yasser Arafat; chairman of the Executive Committee of Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), chairman of Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and leader of Fatah Movement. Israel holds him responsible for suicide bombings. Calls have been renewed to assassinate him.
Israel tried to kill him last September, but it killed his son while shelling his house.
Dr. Mohamed Al-Hindi; a prominent leader of Islamic Jihad Movement in Gaza Strip.
In its statement yesterday, the Press Syndicate Council said what had happened was new evidence to the brutal nature of Israeli entity.
Sheikh Yassin intended to videotape the message and send it to the Arab leaders in the summit scheduled to be convened in Tunisia late March instant, not to mention distributing the message in writing among them, Hamas sources said.
"Bravely fighting a war that has been imposed on them, the Palestinian people deserve to be provided with all forms of support and backing by Arab leaders. They need economic support to enhance their steadfastness. Wicked Zionists destroyed all means of decent life. They looted the wealth of the Palestinian people, who need military, security, media, moral, diplomatic and other forms of support that could help them forge ahead in jihad.
The assassination of Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin affected the Egyptian-Israeli relations that witness an increasing tepidity. President Hosni Mubarak cancelled Egypt's participation in the Israeli Knesset's celebrations marking the 25th anniversary of Camp David Peace Accord.
He described the crime as a "condemned crime", pointing out that its aim was to "undermine the peace process." Al-Mu'ashar will mull with his Egyptian counterpart over coordinating efforts to contain the aftermath of Sheikh Yassin's assassination.
KHALED MASH'AL: WE'RE NOT GOING TO EXTEND THE BATTLE OUTSIDE PALESTINE
The organizational form of the movement, however, is something else.
Q: Did any consultations take place in that regard?
If Sharon meant to break the will of steadfastness, we would get even more steadfast.
Q: All options are open?
A: This is up to our brothers the strugglers and the military wing.
Q: Including Sharon?
Positively speaking, all of us are adherents to the resistance option.
Q: What is the political message Sharon wants to send through the assassination operation in light of talk about a likely disengagement or withdrawal from Gaza?
Finally and perhaps more importantly, it was an attempt to what the Zionist call, "cleansing" Gaza from resistance and all factors of power it has whether political, military leadership, weaponry or cadres as a prelude to evacuating Gaza and arranging matters there for the parties on which Sharon and the Americans bet.
A: When Sharon put up the initiative of disengagement and withdrawal from Gaza Strip, he meant it to be in the context of circumventing the resistance or attempting to stop it and abort its achievements thus depriving the Palestinian people of the real fruit of resistance - the unconditional removal of occupation.
After the crime of assassinating Sheikh Yassin, however, Sheikh Yassin's blessing would continue even after his death, to act as a factor of steadfastness and unity on the Palestinian arena. His martyrdom will act as a catalyst unity of Palestinian ranks and consequently forestall all attempts to trigger any internal sedition among the Palestinian people.
It might be understandable, however, that one may resort to such treachery in order that one might reach a certain goal, but to combine strategic audacity with that horror through lack of any sensible aim behind the assassination would pass over anybody's head.
Sheikh Yassin, it is true, is Hamas Movement's undisputed key figure but he was never the organizer of its daily military operations, a fact well-known especially to Israel.
None in Hamas movement has ever had such a religious, political or struggle backdrop as would qualify him to take a major step towards military action, his well-established legitimacy, his clear personal and behavioural record raised him above any criticism from within or without Hamas movement.
This is also well-known to Javier Solana and the European Union.
If that particular political orientation gained legitimacy from Yassin, it would gain the approval of Hamas.
A question which is open-ended and far from easy to answer now that he left a big challenge facing Hamas at the leadership level.
The most serious thing that faces struggle or liberation movements is that relation between their political and military leaderships and the necessity that the latter remain subjected to the former.
Hamas would then face difficult options while adhering to a thin thread between its legitimate ambitions as a political movement to secure political influence and control proportionate to its size in the street and between being at loggerheads with the Palestinian Authority where Palestinian blood would be lavishly shed.
Whether one approves or disapproves of Hamas' operations, the important point here is the presence of a control mechanism and leadership.
The authority would lose the ability to have a special purpose or take a certain direction. The regional parties would face the same mess. Israel would face further operations launched by groups that cannot claim affiliation to any obvious political movement.
Considering the impact of the assassination which was a massacre that claimed the lives of nine Palestinians, in addition to Sheikh Yassin, it appears, in a paradox that may make Israelis angrier than others later on, that the "major winner" in the assassination aimed to destroy Hamas is Hamas itself.
The participation of thousands of people in Yassin's funeral procession in Gaza Strip and the West Bank reflected the large-scale tide of Hamas on the Palestinian arena.
Official comments were made by Jordanian officials, including the king himself, in this respect.
If Sharon manages to mix the cards of the PNA and other players, does it mean that he will be able to continue to convince his electorates with the banner "providing security for Israelis with fire and gunpowder in post-Sheikh Yassin stage?"
While Cairo is coordinating efforts with a number of Arab capitals to take strict stances towards Israel, the Arab League called on Arab leaders to respond vehemently, considering the assassination a turning point in the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Lebanon Lebanese President Email Lahud considered the assassination of Sheikh Yassin a fresh Israeli crime.
Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Islamic Shiite Council, Sheikh Abdel-Amir Qablan called on Muslim and Christian clergymen to pray in mosques and churches for the "lord of martyrs" Sheikh Yassin as well as other martyrs. Shiite authority Sheikh Mohamed Hussein Fadlullah considered American President George W. Bush the "killer." "The assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin is a result of a plot hatched by the occupation government to humiliate the Palestinian people through liquidating its political leaders," leader of the Lebanese Socialist Progressive Party and MP Walid Junbalatt said.
UAE Minister of Information and Culture Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan said, "The assassination of Sheikh Yassin is an act of state terrorism."
Qatar vehemently denounced the assassination of Hamas leader. "This crime is a continuation of the repression policy perpetrated by Israel against the Palestinian people," an official source with the Qatari Foreign Ministry said.
Demonstrators set the Israeli and American flags ablaze, chanting, "Iraq will avenge Yassin's assassination."
Demonstrations took place in the Palestinian refugee camps in Al-Bok'a and Al-Wahadat in Amman's suburbs. Jordanian Islamists called on Arab masses to condemn any agreement or relations with Israel.
Yemen called on the UN and the Quartet Committee to condemn this crime.
Libya Libya denounced the "crime", emphasizing that it is added to a catalogue of Israeli crimes.
Dr Abdel-Aziz Al-Rantissi used to do this in several Palestinian villages and farm communities round the city of Khan Younis.
His father died when he was in the second year of the preparatory school, which forced his elder brother to travel to Saudi Arabia to work and provide for his family.
He obtained his bachelor's degree in 1970, and continued his study to get his master's degree in pediatrics.
Late in 1987 Al-Rantissi was the Muslim Brotherhood official in Khan Younis. At that time a number of the Muslim Brotherhood leaders including Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, Abu Osama Dukhan, Mohamed Sham'aa, Ibrahim Al-Yazouri, Salah Shehada and Esa Al-Nashar, held a meeting and decided to participate in the Intifada under the title of Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas).
As he is obstinate, investigators of the Israeli internal Intelligence (Chabak) despaired of investigating him, as he used to punch them and not stop until he loses his consciousness due to torture to which he was exposed. Thus, he was indicted on the ground of other people's deposition as the "Tamir Law" which is in force against the Palestinians allows Israeli courts martial to try any Palestinian on the basis of other persons' depositions against him.
On June 10th last, Al-Rantissi narrowly escaped the first Israeli attempt on his life, which claimed the lives of two of his companions and badly injured his son Ahmed.
According to the movement, its foundation dates back to the 1940s as it considers itself an extension of the Muslim Brotherhood movement, notably in Egypt as there was a geographical link between Egypt and Gaza after Egypt had imposed security control over Gaza Strip following the establishment of the state of Israel.
Hamas separated between its political wing and its military one (Ezz Eddin Al-Qassam Brigades). Al-Qassam was an eminent leader who fell during the Palestinian revolution in the 1930s against the British mandate and the Jewish exodus to Palestine.
The politburo is elected every 4 years. Its head is entitled to remain in his post for only two terms in office.
Dr. Abdel-Aziz Al-Rantissi was chosen to be Hamas leader in Gaza Strip succeeding Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. He was deputy head of Hamas. This affirmed the fact that there are territorial politburos too.
So, no one knows the real number of Hamas members. Hamas leaders refrain from giving more details about their movement.
Salah Shehada is the founder of Ezz Eddin Al-Qassam Brigades. He had been the general leader until he was assassinated in 2002 in his house in Al-Darag district, Gaza.
An Ethiopian official was quoted as saying that his country started to carry out a feasibility study for a dam on the Blue Nile to be used in power generation as part of a regional initiative for cooperation with Egypt to run the Nile water.
It was reported that the Ethiopian government was seeking to get funds from the African Development Bank and other financial institutions to fund studies that cover diverse development areas.
He emphasized that the 1929 deal signed between Egypt and Britain should be reconsidered so that other countries can use the Nile water to achieve an economic development.
In contrast to the usually categorical rejection on the part of the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) leaders of any amendments of the country's constitution, Gamal Mubarak did not rule out constitutional amendments. In reply to questions posed by intellectuals and journalists during a party given two days ago by the Egyptian National Council for Foreign Affairs, which was attended by a number of accredited ambassadors in Cairo, he indicated that various ideas on constitutional amendment are under examination.
He linked the internal reform question to a just solution to the Arab-Israeli dispute and added that solving the Palestinian problem would accelerate and facilitate reforms. He, however, underlined that failure to achieve peace did not mean stopping the reform process.
He added that Egypt started reforms several years before without waiting for any initiatives from abroad. Egypt is determined to continue such reforms according to a schedule, he noted.
The most dangerous repercussions of this heinous crime lies in the fact that we have become unanimous that the Palestinian people have the right to revenge themselves on the Israelis no matter whether the victims will be civilians or military men.
Resisting Israeli occupiers is a right and a duty on every Palestinian so long as nobody could force Israel to respect the international community resolutions or protect the Palestinians against the liquidation policy perpetrated by Sharon - supported with most Israelis - against the Palestinian people.
"Support" here does not mean sending troops or announcing war. Rather, the Arabs should exert their efforts, contacts and political and diplomatic weight in order to unveil Sharon's brutality and adopt the Palestinian policy and the unified Palestinian legitimate leadership elected by the Palestinian people - whether the Palestinian National Authority, Hamas or others - and support it before the whole world. Such efforts, contacts and pressure may succeed in bringing the parties concerned again to the negotiation table.
President Hosni Mubarak called on the UN on Sunday to adopt a "binding" resolution denying terrorists political asylum.

Chairman of Car Dealers Division with Cairo Chamber of Commerce Efat Abdel-Aati said time is not suitable for increasing prices especially those of cars even if this increase was meant to develop the state's resources to create a balance between revenues and expenses.

Four years after Egypt's accession to the COMESA agreement, valid since 18th February 1999, official reports said that Egypt's trade balance with the COMESA member states has achieved a surplus in favour of the group. Egypt's imports rose from 12% to 28%, thus confirming that the COMESA agreement negatively affected Egypt and contributed no development to national economy. It rather negatively impacts on it due to the loss of customs charges, which have accounted for 400 million pounds since the agreement has been put into force in 2001.

Most Egyptian business organizations are reconsidering economic cooperation with the US in solidarity with public anger against the American policy in the region. This anger reached its peak due to the practices of the US military in Iraq and the imposition of unjustified economic sanctions on Syria.
Economic sources told Al-Hayat that the strategic dialogue which was expected to be held last month under Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher and US Secretary of State Colin Powell has been indefinitely postponed. Egypt wouldn't insist on holding such a meeting out of conviction that any rapprochement for the time being would be futile, i.e. Egypt would concentrate in the coming period on moving political, rather than economic, issues with the US, the sources added.
The free zone is far A prominent head of an Egyptian business organization said that a joint free trade zone wouldn't be established soon as Egypt turned down American barter deals in several fields. The US said that agreements take time for negotiation and that what is more important is the two sides' political will to push forward commercial exchange and facilitate transportation of commodities, which means that the free trade zone would not be discussed for another two years at least, if the situation was normal. But, submitting this issue within the framework of a political plan to be enforced by the US Administration means that negotiations on the free trade zone would indefinitely be postponed.
The Irish ambassador whose country is heading the current round of the EU said that the new spirit of cooperation between Egypt and the EU comes within a program for building mutual trust aims at providing job opportunities and raising the standard of living.

For his part, Fahmi stressed need to deepen and maximize localization in different sectors, including petroleum, natural gas and petrochemical industries to curb importation and develop technologies in a way that is concordant with locally available capabilities as well as providing more job opportunities.

"DEATH DANCE"...FFROM NORTHERN COAST TO CAIRO
The fad called by youth "death game" is a last dance with death by a rival before losing the race and then going to the grave or at best to hospital.
Each team often insists on confrontation, with collisions finally leading to heavy losses.
This fad is also spreading in Kuwait, Riyadh, Doha and all other Gulf capitals. It poses a security premonition to everyone due to relevant perils. By doing so, young men imitate mad chases in American cinema movies, which are excitingly made as deceptive studio moves.

MOSSAD WITNESSES INTERNAL FACELIFT
In a nutshell, such reforms, according to "Foreign Report" semi monthly released by Guinness Intelligence British monthly, aims at converting the Mossad from an organization for information collecting into a bolder and more daring combat corps.

According to well-informed sources, the project of unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Gaza is in the offing. They expected that such a withdrawal might take place in four months' time thanks to the intensive Arab, American and Israeli contacts which are currently underway.
The Palestinian territories witness active moves on many levels to control the security situation, especially in Gaza Strip as a prelude to Israel's pullout.
London sees that implementing one of those demands means that the ball will be in Israel's court, especially easing blockade on the Palestinians according to the "Roadmap."
The agreement includes three points: firstly, ensuring the legitimacy of resistance against occupation; secondly, civilians should not carry arms in public; thirdly, the Palestinian police are the only security body that can arrest any Palestinian.
ARABS ONE YEAR AFTER THE IRAQI WAR
The worst has happened and while the Arabs were busy falling out over trifles disregarding their new reality, somebody was lying in wait for that "order" evaporation and monitoring the signs of its degeneration. When the American occupation of Iraq took place, there was no need for any further effort to push that "order" towards degeneration.
Nobody even wondered why those "aliens" had not been in Iraq before occupation.
Each Arab country is meant to take care of its own internal affairs, thus leaving the regional issue to the "elder brother" in the case of reform as well as in the "national" issues.
Even the "street" which has come to be taken into account could hardly overcome its frustration.
What happened, therefore, was everybody's responsibility and beyond their ability as each could hardly further than minding his own business to fend off possible repercussions for his country.
It is America, which certainly brings Arabs together or disperse them. It is it that sets them a "common destiny" in accordance with their worn-out discourses.
"We're against the manipulation of religion politically or in any other way," he said, adding that "just as it is necessary to separate between different estates or powers, then there should be a separation between religion and the state so that religion may be kept away from any political speculations!"

The whole matter is attributed to the summit leadership."

A big center for assembling and distributing Chinese products will be set up in the economic zone to market Chinese products in Europe and the Middle East, he said. In an interview with Al-Ahram, the Chinese official denied that the current incidents in Iraq and Palestine might negatively impact on the economic and commercial relations between China and the region's countries, emphasizing that his country was seeking to boost the volume of trade exchange with the Middle East countries from 10 billion dollars at present to 50 billion dollars over the coming few years.
$10 MILLION FROM CHINA TO SUEZ INDUSTRIAL ZONE
Talks also included ways and means of pushing cooperation between Egypt and China in industrial, building material, petrochemical and natural gas fields as well as increasing production of Egyptian crops with a view to boosting Egypt's exports to China and training technical cadres in farming fields in Egypt, she added.
Egyptian companies prepared their participation bids and informed the Iraqi side of them through the Arab Contractors company's office in Baghdad and in coordination with Egypt's Commercial Office in Iraq, he said. This visit comes in response to negotiations held in Cairo late last March with a delegation from Iraqi construction companies to take part in executing infrastructure projects, he added.
The value of works expected to be implemented by the National Company for Construction and Building's subsidiaries is expected to hit 500 million dollars. Such works can be doubled during the next few years, Betah added. Monetary inflows of construction companies should be controlled. Cash liquidity should be provided through repaying companies' dues. Banks should also provide monetary cover of the letters of guarantees in foreign exchange so that the companies could practise their works successfully, Betah said, pointing out that paying off banks' dues and facilities would raise the volume of the companies' works to exceed 10 billion dollars.
In this concern, Al-Gabali pointed out big cooperation opportunities in the fields of rehabilitation of Iraqi factories, electricity grid, construction, communications, building material products.
DEVELOPMENT OF INDUSTRIAL CONTROL WITH S. KOREA
Basic infrastructure of industrial control are being developed currently, he added.
About 30 percent of gold factories closed down recently. Some of their owners changed their activity due to inability to pay workers' wages in light of the current state of lull, Abbas said.
The market will not bear such measures. Many jewellers will have to withdraw from the market or change their activity, Abdel-Hadi said, pointing out that some shops laid off workers retaining only one worker in order to reduce costs.
40% of the cars CIF (Cost, Insurance and Freight) value for cars with an engine capacity below 1,000 cc, 55% for cars with an engine capacity of 1,000 - 1,300 cc, 100% for cars with an engine capacity of 1,300 to 1,600 cc, 135% for cars with an engine capacity of 1,600-2,000 cc and 135% again for cars with an engine capacity of over 2,000 cc.
The statute was referred to the Minister of Finance.
The new customs duties are expected to take auto sales down by 5% to 10% this year, they said.
Sales of cars with an engine capacity of over 2,000 cc would retreat by 5% while cars with an engine capacity of over 2,000cc by 10% because the new rates in that case would range between 40,000 to 50,000 Egyptian pounds, Al-Hadari noted. I believe that would cause a great trouble to Egyptian auto producers because they work with 30% of their capacities and the market would not bear any price increases.
Many experts expected the annual proceeds of such customs charges would hit LE280 million, a figure bigger than the proceeds expected after imposing the new rates.
This, he added, has brought the sale and purchase movement to a complete halt in motor shows, although factories and traders announced commitment to real prices prior to the new duties.

In an interview with Asharq Al-Awsat during his visit to Cairo last week, he said that the growing increase in oil rates would cause many troubles to the European as well as international economy. However, he declined to discuss the current discord between the German government and the European Commission over the continued German budget deficit. The following is the interview:
A: There are many fields in Egypt in which Germany can invest including oil, natural gas, manufacturing of machines, cars, medical technology and water. But, we need the support of the Egyptian side, especially in the small-sized projects, as the two parties pay attention to such a sector. In Germany, we think that we were remiss not to support such a sector, while other countries managed to achieve high levels of welfare for this sector. In Germany, we have a list of structural reforms and my visit to Cairo comes within this framework.
Q: Have German exports to Egypt been affected by the increase of the euro rate of exchange in global stock exchanges?
Q: What is the effect of expanding the European Union on Egypt-Germany economic relations?
A: There is no room for fear. Egypt's partnership agreement with the EU is a good chance and the expansion of the EU will create more opportunities for Egyptian companies. Such European markets should be opened before the Egyptian products, and this is the goal of the agreement.
Ministry of Housing and New Urban Communities decided to put up areas in new cities for sale, especially in Upper Egypt through cooperative housing projects and family housing.

Mubarak hoped to be backed by the Arabs in offering the Arab model of reform but what happened in Tunis put the Egyptian president in an embarrassing position. He, however, could rely on some reform decrees he had given in the last months in addition to "Alexandria document" issued last month to offer a popular model of reform backed by Mubarak through attending the inaugurating session of the conference issuing it.
In this context, Egyptian foreign minister Ahemd Maher and his American counterpart Colin Powell, will head a dialogue session next Wednesday to discuss ways and means of promoting relations in various fields.

A unique study by the Centre for Social and Criminal Researches emphasized that 23% of Egyptian women beat their husbands during family quarrels at home. The study said that the rate of wives beating their husbands remarkably rose among rich families but declined among the poor or the low-income brackets of society.
In rich families, however, wealth invariably represents the main cause of violence which takes the form of slaps on the face or verbal abuse.
Female MP Dr. Georgit Sobhi, an eminent legal expert with the Justice Ministry, decided to put up fresh proposals on the political parties law.

Parliamentarians who tabled more than 27 requests for notification and urgent memos to the government, asked Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Dr. Mahmoud Abu Zeid to submit a thorough report on the results of Kenya round of talks between Egypt and the Nile basin countries that took place March last. The report should include all the initiatives relative to the cut of Egypt's quota of Nile water, MPs asked.

EGYPTIAN EXPORTS TO ARAB MARKETS EXPECTED TO INCREASE $5.5 BILLION WITH FULL TRADE LIBERALIZATION
Involvement with these blocs did not achieve the minimum limit of expected results, as evidenced by the fact that the growth rate of commodity exports did not exceed 16% from 1980 to 2003, she noted.

Cement companies owned by foreigners and private sector raised cement prices by 15 pounds per ton to be in the range of 235-257 pounds, including the sales tax, let alone transport costs and trader's profit margin.

15 ECONOMIC AUTHORITIES TO BE CHANGED INTO HOLDING COMPANIES
Hassanein said so during a visit paid by about 70 representatives of donor countries to the model tax customs centre on 27th May, together with Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Fayza Abul Naga.

Presented to the podium as the "general guide", Rantissi said, "By 'we' I mean Fatah and its brigades, Islamic Jihad and its battalions, the Public Front and its brigades, the Democratic Front and its brigades and Hamas and its brigades.
I can see the heralds of triumph coming out from here - Palestine," he said.
In an address directed to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat that seemed less strongly worded than before, Rantissi said, "Today we need to know the reality that became clear and obvious, where is peace in light of those settlements and the assassination of Sheikh Yassin and his companions?"
He lauded Hizbullah and its leader Hassan Nasrullah, denying any military cooperation between Hamas and Hizbullah, particularly in light of Nasrullah's statements two days ago that Hizbullah was at Hamas' disposal.
This model, which was grieved for by the masses taking to the streets in overwhelming demonstrations, deserves even more than tears or demonstrations.
It is that combative spirit which terrifies Israel and America.
Incidentally, after the first aborted attempt on his life, he almost left a will and comment on his martyrdom which seemed more powerful than scores of missiles when they were repeated by satellites channels.
Interviewed by Al-Wasat, Dr, Salah Abdel-Shafi, who supervised the survey, said Palestinian children's conditions are getting more complicated and may get worse in the near future.
But, the three years were plagued by vehement violence used by the Israeli military against Palestinians, rendering the entire Palestinian society open to Israeli violence.
Some 25 percent of boys and girls seek martyrdom.
- 83.2 percent of children watched shootings.
- 32 percent of children were psychologically shocked after watching accidents. - 33 percent of them suffer from aftershocks of watching such accidents, including nightmares, insomnia and enuresis. - 33 percent of them suffer from sharp effects and need psychological treatment.
Israeli air flights heading for Far Eastern countries currently cross the Red Sea, thus increasing the flight's time by 2-3 hours. A flight from Israel to Peking, for instance, takes more than 10 hours, which may be reduced to 7.5 hours through the alternative route. A flight to India will also be reduced to less than seven hours if the Israeli planes are allowed to use the Iraqi airspace.
He is of the view that Hizbullah had been persuading both Fatah and Hamas to choose certain targets in Israel. It managed to penetrate Fatah ranks in the north of the West Bank, while its activities in Gaza Strip are still limited and confined to smuggling arms and anti-aircraft missiles from Egypt to Gaza, he said.
He regarded that Arab unity stimulated extremists all the time, linking the delay to the crisis experienced by the Arab world over American military intervention in Iraq.
The Palestinian official went on to say, "Well, failure and disunity among Arab decision-makers are known, but it now comes following the assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin (the founder and spiritual leader of Hamas movement) and the American use of veto against a UN Security Council resolution condemning Israel for the assassination of Sheikh Yassin."
An Arab official said on Saturday that Palestinian President Yasser Arafat had accepted the part related to the Arab-Israeli conflict in the recommendations discussed by the Arab foreign ministers in Tunis. Arafat had signed a copy of a relevant document faxed to him.
Under this headline, Jihad Al Khazin of Al Hayat writes an article which runs to the following effect only in part: A meal is currently simmering to move the peace process led by Egypt in coordination with Jordan and Syria and in cooperation with the USA as well as an active British role.
The new move will be primarily based on President Hosni Mubarak who will be represented in the talks with the Israelis, the Palestinians and the USA officials in the region by chief of Egyptian intelligence Maj. Gen. Omar Sulayman.
There are conditions for the continuation of that process mainly including that President Yasser Arafat should act as a catalyst rather than an impediment of the process and that the Palestinians should combine security bodies into three rather than 11 or 12 bodies so that only the National Security, the police and the intelligence would remain.
He hoped that after withdrawal, there will be internecine fighting among the Palestinians in Gaza to establish an entity separate from the West Bank which would mostly continue to be subject to occupation, thus avoiding the establishment of an independent Palestinian State.
The Palestinian leaders to whom I talked feel reassured about the Egyptian role and President Mubarak personally, but they are not sure about the result as Sharon's quiver has a lot of ploys to abort the process.
There are some protocol and non-protocol related mistakes, particularly political ones, which had accumulated and caused the gross blunder that made Tunisia put in force its "rightful state decision" that way.
No Arab country would refrain from any mischief in order to protect its interests with Washington, regardless of its Arab reputation or the opinion of its people.
This problem is still on the cards and has been exposed by the postponement decision, which even made it more difficult and complex.

The Ministry of Finance put up additional taxes in order to redress the public budget deficit, which amounted to 53 billion pounds due to overpopulation, according to the government allegations. The actual reason lies in the increase in luxurious expenditures and failure to rationalize the government's expenses, especially on entertainment including parties, festivals, banquets, and officials' motorcades and guards, according to a report by the Central Auditing Agency, let alone celebrations of governorates' national days and congratulations and condolence ads in newspapers, a type of behaviour which Dr. Zakaria Azmi (chief of Presidential Divan) warned against indulging in.

Plastics industry developed over the last decade as plastics replaced other materials like glass and metals in conventional uses.
"We have a plan with the Industry Modernization Center for developing petrochemical industries, which produce plastic raw materials like polyethylene," he added.
Moreover, production of some other manufacturers decreased due to the rise in foreign exchange rates, hence the hike of raw materials prices.
A plant has to import the rest of its needs.
It reaches 30% in case of importing components only," said Abdel-Aziz.
"We agree on the results, as we agree on the mechanisms, which means that we will not interfere with supply and demand, so that the market would be the only mover to determine rate," he added.
Service export revenues rose by some 25%."

We should overcome any differences, he said, referring that all Nile basin countries were working hand in hand to implement the Nile basin Countries Mechanism Initiative, which began in 1998.
American officials' false statements in that regard were tantamount to a slap on the face of Arab rulers and officials who never fail to talk about the American role in the peace process and who think that conciliation and dealing with Sharon and his ring as if they were a civilized group would narrow the gap and persuade the terrorist rightist Likud to back out of its schemes.
Nor is it in America's interest that the Arabs should agree on any unified position whether towards the Palestinian cause, the reform of the Arab League or facing foreign intervention under the pretext of reform so long as Arab schisms prevent any ability to face American pressure.
Tony Blair, too, has to join them quite blindly.
Under this headline, Abdullah Al Ashal, a former ambassador with Egyptian Foreign Ministry writes an article on page 9, which runs to the following effect only in part: The American initiatives, which explicitly aim at bringing freedom to the Arab world and converting its dictatorial regimes into good political systems where the citizen would have the final say within a national consensus on public interests and full transparency, have several shortcomings in the forefront of which is the fact that countries do not base their policies on aid and charity for their own sake but rather on a pragmatic approach to achieve certain interests that have nothing to do with good intentions or good will.
If this was then the truth of American projects, the Arab reaction would still remain so disappointing that our aggravation of the malaise would be ensured.
The officialdom's thinkers, then, cited false arguments in defence of the Pharaoh who should have reconsidered the matter and led the reform himself. He seemed not to be convinced that that reform was a prerequisite or that it was he himself who was meant by all appeals for reform.
Thirdly, if all proposals for internal Arab League reforms were approved would that be the end of the matter?
Secondly, it is not true that reform is an ambiguous paradigm or that it needs rites, gradualness, or centuries to be achieved or that it suffices for us to admit to our need of reform and leave the rest to future generations to carry it out.
LET'S HOLD A REFERENDUM ON THE US REFORM!

Each country's interests should include helping the Palestinians to live in peace in an independent state, as without that no interests would be realized, especially in those countries where there are hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees.
Putting the Arab summit on the back burner showed some Arab leaders failure to realize the turmoil and wrath that dominate peoples. Thus, the Arab leaders did not discuss the peace initiatives put forward for establishing an independent Palestinian state, which means the continuation of the Palestinian suffering and Israeli targeted assassination, thus impeding every attempt to improve the Arab peoples' standard of living.
However, European countries advise Washington to be patient in dealing with this hot file.
Expected Detention Campaign Reports published in Washington referred that Iran's attempt to invest every second in this range of time gives an explanation to several issues including the strict stance adopted by the Iranian leadership towards the reformist trend.

The report emphasized the importance of optional exploitation of the available production capacities especially with regard to steel squares with a view to reducing its production cost and increasing its quantities. This can be achieved through the completion of the efforts required for operating the Suez Company for Steel to full available capacity and removing the technical obstacles in the Egyptian Iron and Steel Company.
The report also pointed out another factor which is failure to optimally use available capacity as using full production capacity leads to an increase in production quantities, thus leading to lower costs. It turned out, however, that the use rate of available capacity in some companies was very low as it reached 33% in International Factories Company, 4.42 in Egyptian-American Company in 2003. Such a rate did not exceed 26% of the available capacity for steel square production in the Suez Company for Steel.
In comment, PA Speaker Dr. Sorour said that the CAA's reports were secret and must not be distributed. He asked the deputies to read them during the committee's meeting.

Hijab expected that the summer months would witness a higher sales movement than last year. He also expected that the idle stock exceeding 100 thousand housing units would start to be disposed of. Such a system would bring about promotion that enables posh units seekers to get the required finance, thus encouraging them to leave their units to others. This would also meet the latent demand that does not have the purchasing power to get the required housing units.
The Minister of Finance confirmed that investment certificates issued by the National Bank of Egypt (NBE) which amount to LE50 billion ($8 billion) could contribute to real estate financing, especially as they are tax exempted.

Nile Basin countries basically need the river water for electricity generation, piscine wealth, river transportation and drinking. It is noteworthy that agriculture in the 9 riparian countries depend mainly on rains and cannot be transformed into irrigation from the Nile water.

An official with the Iraqi Water Resources Ministry complained about the escalating threat of Nile Lily plants that invaded the Tigris at Al-Qut Dam, 200 kilometers to the southeast of Baghdad.
On the other hand, no pesticides can be used in that case because 90% of Iraqi villages depend on rivers as a source of water for drinking and other household applications.
They attributed the slow flow of water at that bend to the width of the river at that point, thus including more sediments that will possibly block the river if no remedy was sought to that problem.
"There're sharp differences between Muktada Sadr and the Shiite authorities in Najaf in light of a conflict between his father Mohamed Sadek Sadr, who was assassinated by the former regime, and the authorities in Najaf and Iran," said Rasem Al-Marwani, who was a close friend to Sadr the father.
A key official in Al-Wefak Al-Watani (National Accord) party told Al-Hayat that the IGC would discuss the bloody incidents between Sadr's supporters and the coalition forces although the IGC's members are preoccupied with a UN delegation visit. He also denied any role by foreign bodies in inciting the young Shiite leader to violence.
Iraqi milieus believe that Sadr's uprising, if it continues, will divide the Shiites' ranks that include moderate leaderships and may change the Iraqi scene where the Shiites and the Americans allied earlier to topple Saddam Hussein's regime.
The recently announced statement by Shiite leader Muqtada Sadr that the situation of Hamas and Hizbullah concerned Iraq may be the first explicit approach taken by a Shiite leader towards Hamas especially as President Bush and his Administration regard Hizbullah and Hamas as pillars of international terrorism with complete disregard for the fact that there is a legitimate resistance protected by international laws on defending homelands.
Some may argue that powers are not equal as what the Palestinians may do before the Israeli army? What would the Iraqis do before the American dictator? However, reality says that Israel had withdrawn from South Lebanon under Hizbullah pressure. It also says that the Iraqi resistance had exhausted American forces and that Gaza, due to the courage of its heroes, had given the Jews a lesson never to be forgotten. This in toto means that power cannot be restricted to armies, tanks and aircraft as the will of man can outdo all that especially if he was defending his land and soil against a usurping occupier.
Under this heading, Al-Ahram deputy chief editor Salama Ahmed Salama wrote a column to say: In all its forms, war is nothing but a demonstration of the meanest aspects of cruelty and hideousness of human nature.
This is not less savage than the atrocities committed by Israel in killing Egyptian POWs en masse.
A year after the occupation of Iraq, evidence and proofs clearly show that the Alliance Forces did not succeed in gaining the confidence of the Iraqi people, but rather caused a deadly wound in the hearts of many categories of people who were subjected to insults, torture and maltreatment not to mention disrespect of the Iraqi man's dignity, under the pretext of establishing security and pursuing and uprooting remnants of the bygone regime.
The US governor Paul Bremer pledged that the incident would not pass without severe measures and punishment. This would cause the situation in Iraq to escalate in murderous violence and bloodshed on both sides.
Under the U.S. command-devised plan, the number of the new Iraqi army will be 40,000 troops by 2005.

According to western intelligence agencies' estimates, there are 70,000 Kurdish militiamen in north Iraq, which are armed with medium and heavy weapons, while there are 30,000 Shiite militiamen in Baghdad and south Iraq, armed with soft and medium weapons.
A study conducted by the U.S. command said that the new army will not be able to protect the country's borders against foreign threats so between 50,000 and 100,000 American and western troops would remain in Iraq indefinitely until Iraq becomes able to safeguard itself.
Thomson is chairman of the Near East and South Asia Center for Strategic Studies, which is now training a team who will manage the new Iraqi ministry of defence.

Before we proceed to review the political project which we regard as vital we should review some facts about the current Iraqi situation which we sum up as follows:
In order to face such a big problem, there should be five federal states so that the imminently explosive situation may be defused in accordance with the project we're going to explain. The following remarks, however, should be taken into account:
4-The Shiites reject a return to the previous situation: Iraq's population is predominantly Shiite who were tremendously exposed under the previous regime to repression, persecution and political and occupational exclusion. Their areas were also deprived of urban and economic development. After such a bitter bloody experience they are entirely averse to returning to the previous situation at all costs and no matter the consequences.
Article 1 Generalization of the federal system formula of government in Iraq to cover all Iraqi regions and governorates without exception by setting up five federal states on a geographical basis. The name of the country should be the Federal Republic of Iraq and should be implemented as follows:
Due to the tense situation in the Iraqi society in terms of national, religious and factional aspects because of the policies adopted by successive dictatorships, it might be useful not to be included in any of the administrative units or federal states suggested or neighbouring it as in such a case, this might give the impression to both the Iraqis and the outside world that the rule in Iraq had assumed the sectarian formula to which Baghdad is administratively related.
Article C: The army and the armed forces should be retained within the competence of the central government in the federal system.
Article D: National Culture should remain within the competence of the central (federal) government provided free democracy concepts be ensured. Any new tendencies towards dictatorship by any one creed or any one opinion should be banned. No individual, party, nationality or creed should be allowed to impose its opinion, attitude or creed upon the people by force. This needs constant efforts to enhance democratic culture, the principle of dialogue and persuasion at the expense of violence and suppression.
She told Al-Alam Al-Youm daily that the mechanisms would coordinate between the partnership unit in the international cooperation sector, chaired by Ambassador Gamal Baiyoumi, and other departments concerned with cooperation with the EU.

The Egyptian private sector can play a role more influential than that of its Israeli counterpart. Some Egyptian companies have already started to put such an orientation into effect, he added.

SAIF AL-ISLAM QADDAFI ....
After his graduation, Saif Al-Islam had been very close to the Industrial Research Center in Tripoli where he oversaw several deals to the value of tens of millions of dollars with multi-national companies.
One of the channels that had been set up by Saif Al-Islam is a charity that is concerned with the phenomenon of youth addiction to drugs in the Libyan society. This charity had been set up in cooperation with some people who work in this field like Mohamed Al-Maswari. The charity main headquarters in Tripoli was named "Al-Irada" (the will). One of the most important activities that was overseen by the charity was a football match between the Libyan national team and an Italian team composed of the players of the two teams of Lazio and International.
Several bodies expect that Saif Al-Islam is the first candidate to succeed his father. However, most of those who close to Gaddafi knows that he will not leave his position even to the closest one to him. The most probable scenario is that bequeathing authority will take place only when Gaddafi dies naturally. However at that time other sons of Gaddafi, forefront of whom is Al-Mu'tasem Gaddafi, will have better chances than Saif Al-Islam.
The former American official called on the Arab leaders to promote what he called as peace concepts, mentioned in the Arab peace initiative, during their upcoming visit.
Arab Foreign Ministers will meet in Cairo late April, he stressed, considering mid-May a possible time for holding the postponed summit.
WHAT DO ARAB SUMMIT OPPONENTS WANT?
The problem has always lain in the country-oriented tendency to abandon such resolutions together with every Arab cooperation, let alone foreign hegemony pressure which can by no means be ruled out.
Representatives of the country-oriented state which refrains from cooperating with Arab countries in favour of a closer link with foreign powers would hide behind the Arab League (council and summits) through accusing it of being responsible for failure to implement its resolutions or lack of effectiveness.
Similar things have already taken place in the 1970's when the Soviet left and some progressive trends attacked Arab solidarity and summits.
Such trends, therefore, started to assume the positions of the leftist and the progressive trends in the 1970's in criticizing Arab solidarity and the Arab League, but much more blatantly and audaciously this time as they are now advocating a cancellation of the Arab League and summits if they failed to meet American demands of the Arab situation in toto.
At the end of this month, the American House of Representatives is expected to study a bill submitted by two deputies from the Republican and the Democratic parties to rehabilitate Sudanese Security bodies, purge them of some officials who were "involved in terrorist acts", and investigate how far 12 senior Sudanese officials were involved, including first deputy of the president, in certain international incidents and to put any of those to trial if his involvement or support of international terrorist acts was proven.
This week, the Congress sub-committee on African Affairs will examine the bill before it is returned to the committee on International Affairs and put up for the vote in both the Congress and the House of Representatives.
The bill asks the Secretary of State to investigate the size and type of support offered to Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), Hizbullah and the current presence of Sudanese volunteers in Iraq and how far their contribution is to anti-American forces operations.
Under this title, Khalid al-Haroub, a Palestinian writer and researcher in Cambridge, Britain, writes a lengthy article to say: Abruptly, growing reform initiatives and calls for democracy in the Middle East region, be they from abroad or home, tried to evade baffling questions and even pretend that they do not exist.
American calls and projects are generally based on the logic of American national strategic benefit, rather than the region's benefit.
The Americans want a democracy without Palestine or the Palestinians, while the Arab officials seek a cosmetic democracy without Islamists.
The Islamists' childish political practice and intellectual and political failure to invent programs and theories that can reassure domestic and international community have led to less popularity and water-downed evidence used by those who defend their (Islamists) access to democracy and politics.
The Islamic democrats are different from undemocratic Islamic extremists, fanatics and terrorists who only listen to their leaders regarding themselves as commanders of the faithful Muslims.
administration, which is based on orientalists statements by fanatic researchers who want to wipe out the gap.
For example, the proposed inter-Arab parliament which Arab rulers hope will be a la the European Parliament will not be elected and even half of its members will come from their countries' "cosmetic" parliaments in the Arab world. In other words, it will be meaningless and powerless.
The governments are aware that they may be unseated under any real reform.
But, once more, such fears and others should not block the implementation of the more important principle of ensuring political freedom and democracy to all since the substitute is civil wars and bloodshed.
But, the problem that is not less important basically lies in how ready the ruling regimes are for conceding their interests and privileges in favour of a reform project. Reform should start with and end at presidential palaces or this direction will be funny.
Any reform will be meaningless if it does not include difficulties facing the Arabs.
Nevertheless, what happened and what is happening now open the door for a looming rift on the Arab arena that may be more serious than that which happened following the Camp David peace deal or the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
The shift means that the Arabs will not be the key movers any longer even in the region where they constitute the vast majority of the population, and neither Egypt nor Saudi Arabia will be a central country in the region anymore. Thus, Israel is most likely to be the major player thanks to its military strength, closeness to the U.S. and political, military and security omnipotence.
What happened in Tunis might be aimed to persuade the Arabs that their current regional formula had crashed to a halt.
Now, everything is almost different. The master of the region is the U.S., which sees that the Arab countries and regimes are unable to fight against terrorism and that it does not need them any longer to secure oil or other interests as it has now an army in the region and at the heart of several Arab countries. Israel has also become a major regional country in the region and a partner to the U.S. in leading the region, and the national trend, which was a partner in the fight against the international tide of communism, is now antagonistic to western interests.
He attributed the failure of negotiations held between Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom and Libyan officials, whose details were leaked to the media to Shalom's political ambitions to hold the post of premier like Israeli Financial Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
He estimated the number of Libyan Jews at 30,000 only but Falah who received Libyan pilgrims to Jerusalem several years ago, estimated their number at 140 thousands of which 130,000 are in Israel and the rest are divided among European countries, especially Italy.
Falah voiced his hope for settling this file according to the law, pointing out that Gaddafi promised him in a meeting to settle the Jews' rights but the Jews waited till other pending causes at the international level like Lockerbi and Berlin Casino bombing were resolved.
However, Chirac voiced his sorrow to his guest that Syria did not appreciate that, even though France had dispatched a special envoy to meet the Syrian President Bashar Assad to explain the issue. The sources laid it bare that Chirac had informed Khaddam that if Syria wanted "actual cooperation" with the EU, it had to agree on the text concerned with the ban of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), particularly as it is very close to the text that Syria was about to sign.
Khaddam said the US would not move in another arena in the region due to the difficulties in Iraq. "Only the UN can save the situation there," he added.
In a memo submitted by the party, chaired by Yousef Al-Faisal, to the Syrian leadership, the party called for the independence of the judiciary through separating the legislative power from the executive power.
He held responsible all political parties in case they worked individually, saying that that kind of work would end up in a civil strife in which militias would fight a civil guerrilla war.
Asked about the possibility of holding elections in Iraq, bin Al Hussein said, "These elections should not be put off. Everybody should be committed to the June 30 date, deadline for the transfer of sovereignty to Iraqis.
A few minutes after opening the session, the judge decided to adjourn the trial to 25th November next, thus to the disappointment of both prisoners and their families.

The success achieved on exchange markets and the drop of the dollar rate of exchange on the black market, which hit 6.34 pounds against an official rate of 6.20 pounds are attributed to the government policies of rationalizing imports that have domestic counterparts which used to consume 15 percent of Egypt's foreign resources, the CBE board of directors said.

Businessman, Mahmoud Al-Shazli said that the recent stability of the dollar rate of exchange is not primarily related to the economic recession. He regarded the state of anticipation and lull dominating the market now as not related to any particular political state but rather related to an extensive popular requirement of change that would boost the efficiency of the public and the private sectors and improve equity in the distribution of income so that fresh turnouts of consumers may appear, thus developing domestic demand. Investors would, then seek to meet the new needs and the country's development capacity would consequently grow. He pointed out that it would be rather difficult for anybody to decide to invest in light of the current stage of political lull.

On the other hand, there are many experts making reservations about the Ministry of Finance's approach in estimating this debt, confirming at the same time that the local debt hit about 370.6 billion pounds by the end of June 2003, i.e. more than 94% of the GDP, thus exceeding the safe limits in a way that threatens the coming generations.
About 50% of the government's local debt was borrowed from the NIB's saving coffers, foremost of which are insurance funds. Such funds are primarily contributions of the state treasury to backing the resources of such funds, Hassanein said. Further analysis makes it clear that the government had borrowed to repay such contributions and then re-borrowed the same funds once again to fulfill the obligations of development plans. Therefore, such debts should be accounted twice, he pointed out.

KIDNAPPING ...
Will Shiites, through abduction, achieve what their Lebanese counterpart Hizbullah achieved in Lebanon?
On June 29th, 2004, the biggest prisoners swap in the Hizbulla-Israel conflict history took place when Israel released 23 Lebanese nationals and 400 Palestinians in return for an Israeli colonel captured in by Hizbullah.
Yesterday, Islamist deputies and activists in Kuwait condemned the American forces and their allies in Iraq for using excessive force in Iraqi cities thus claiming hundreds of lives among women and children. They constituted a popular parliamentary committee to provide support and relief for the Iraqi people.

He pointed out that a campaign to raise donations started to extend help to those harmed by Iraq's incidents.
IRAQI FAMILIES MOVE TO KUWAIT
Kuwaiti authorities are expected to encourage those families to return to their country before such a movement turns into a phenomenon that would lead to the escape of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis in case of civil war outbreak.
Damascus and Khartoum categorically denied reports alleging that Syria hid banned weapons in Sudan.
The source, quoted by Middle East News Online website alleged that Damascus had been sending, at least since last January, Scud C and D missiles in addition to consignments containing substances used for producing WMDs.
The sources are of the view that there are more urgent causes in this stage that must be given special attention, particularly the unemployment problem and legislative and economic reforms.
THE NEXT FEW WEEKS ARE CRUCIAL FOR IRAQ AND THE REGION
George Bush is a victim of his religious zeal which turned him into a fundamentalist on a proselytizing mission.
Such errors included not only disbanding the Iraqi army, reducing the American forces required to maintain stability, reducing the funds needed for the creation of new job opportunities for the Iraqis, distancing the UN from the political process and calling it in only too late, dictating to the Iraqis instead of pacifying them, the suspicious ridiculous imposition of solutions, ignoring militias at first, closure of Al Hayat newspaper giving orders to arrest Shiite leader, Muqtada Al Sadr and the adoption of the Israeli way of occupation, destruction of houses, detention without trials and closure of Falluja region and the infiltration of Israeli elements of about 800 into Iraq and giving some of them free hand to commit sabotage operations in Iraqi names or in Al Qaeda name.
Now he is in a dilemma, if he refused to meet the military's demands. He might face a revolt if he was proven guilty of tampering with the souls of American soldiers for election considerations.
Such factors are known to Iraq's neighbouring countries, Iran and Syrian may act for the enhancement of the American bog in Iraq as they consider themselves targeted, so why should they help America get out of the bog? This, in turn, frightens Gulf states neighbouring Iraq for several reasons including Iran and its Shiites dimension and potentialities being quite a scourge to those states on the internal level.
His threat to assassinate the Palestinian president, Yassir Arafat after the assassination of Hamas leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin paves the way to alliances between Palestinian and Iraqi organizations besides alliances with Al Qaeda network in more than one site.
He wants Bush's endorsement of keeping enormous areas and settlements in the West Bank intact.
He wants American funds to implement it plan to abort the American President's vision and plan called "the Road Map".
All this leads to the worst speculations for both Iraq and the Americans in Iraq, the worst for the Palestinians as well as for Israel slipping into the mentality of blockade and its harvest.
There is no reason, therefore to gloat over what might befall America or undermine its grandeur as even that might bring about a lot of counterbalances.
The reason, of course, lies in the expansion of the American "hassle" with Iraq's Sunnites to some of its Shiites for the first time since the fall of former Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, which indicates a possible slide of Iraq into anarchy and perhaps a civil war, a possibility warned against by both Qatari foreign minister and some Arab dignitaries.
The size of such an incident was, however, seen quite exaggerated for several reasons!
Systani, therefore, would not mind very much Sadr's disappear from the political scene.
Finally, although Sadr proved to have the ability to stir the young and the poor, he himself is not above his thirty one years of age. In spite of being the son of Ayatullah Mohamed Sadek Sadr who called himself "Wali Faqih" and was assassinated five years ago, he is not politically seasoned, which is quite a defect in the Iraqi "jungle" infested with all types of political wolves and foxes!
What happened at Falluja has raised and will raise even more questions and put up scenarios that would affect the whole situation in Iraq and the destiny of Bush himself.
What is more important now is not the files of the past but the registers of the present.
The second, which is less improbable is the outbreak of a civil war which would last for long and be contributed to by all countries that suffer from the changes in Iraq or rather the Lebanization of Iraq.
They also saw it as a clear message to the Americans regarding what awaits them in Iraq in the next nine months.
- The Arab countries which failed to find a seat on the American train that rushed wildly or rather ran amok following the September incidents.
- Russia which is just over the moon at every American failure in Iraq's even though its discretion makes it quite docile to the Americans. How can it feel otherwise while America is now camping on its borders as the NATO has extended eastwards?
Henceforth, all options would possible till the end of the year and all cards would be far from decided or settled including the destiny of Bush and that of the Iraqi entity itself.
Other observers see that the recent escalation between Sadr's group and the American troops may contribute to the blackout imposed on the extensive military operations carried out by such troops in Falluja in retaliation for the four American contractors who were killed and mutilated.
In this context, researcher Dr. Hussein Hafez Al-Okaili said, "The occupation troops would have dealt with the situation in the Iraqi street with more discretion. As they should have gained more experience in dealing with the Iraqis through over one-year presence in Iraq. The Americans should have determined the places that are about to explode once they are provoked.
Therefore, they will make a dangerous precedent in disregarding the holiness of laws. If they were compelled to pursue and arrest Sadr, they would expose not only their troops to critical dangers especially in light of explicit support prevailing in Iraq's central and southern governorates, but also a large number of Iraqi innocents whether they are Sadr supporters or others, as they have nothing to do with the goings-on.
Yesterday, an Egyptian Products Exhibition was inaugurated in the S. Korean capital Seoul, attended by a big number of S. Korean companies board chairmen, businessmen, heads of foreign diplomatic missions, members of Egyptian economic delegation and Ambassador Omar Hilmi, Egypt's ambassador to S. Korea.

The movement of selling and buying slowed down in wait for further price reductions, particularly as the parliament and the press disclosed that producers exaggerated rebar prices over the last period and that dealings were not transparent.
Steel sheets prices went down from 410 dollars to 300 dollars per ton. Meanwhile, scrap prices decreased from 300 dollars to 190 dollars per ton. However, prices of steel sections and flat sheets are still high as such products are subjected to conditions which are different from those of scrap and steel sheets. This would cause the factories that use such input losses bigger than those factors using steel sheets and scrap iron.
To the contrary of what was expected, rebar traders and distributors monitored confusion in the movement of selling and buying. Saad Eddin Ali, a retailer, said consumers refrained from buying in wait for more reduction in prices.

CHINA HAS 50 PERCENT OF EGYPT'S COMPUTER COMPONENT MARKET
Officials with international companies operating in Egypt see that China has achieved much progress in the information and communications technology area, and has become one of the most attractive to foreign investments as internationally famous companies own factories in China. However, this does not mean that these companies' products in China are cheaper than other markets.

KURDS...IIMPORTANT DIGIT IN THE NEW BALANCES' EQUATION
The Iraqi provisional state administration law gives them a set of advantages that vexed a number of political circles because it adds fuel to the regional fire.
By easing tension with them, Iran uncovered two results: firstly, Tehran's desire to settle this file; secondly, the impact of the regional climate on the mechanisms of dealing with them.
Unless their ambitions are dealt with positively, Iraq's Kurds option can be, consequently, repeated in other countries, especially as Iran and Syria have an agenda of suspended visualizations with the US.
One of them will be an Arab Sunnite; the second, an Arab Shiite; and the third, a Kurd.
The most dangerous thing in this agreement is that it gives Kurdistan the characteristic of a regional government that will continue practising its current activities.
For this point, Turkey is opposed to the status given to the Kurds by the new law during the provisional stage. It also criticized the law because it gives the Kurds more than their political rights while it disregards, for instance, the rights of the Turkmen.
However, after the Egyptian-Syrian unity, Arabism orientations come to the surface sharply. The authorities started to push other nationalities into a tight corner especially the Kurds, Syrians and Assyrians.
The Syrian agreement with Kurdish groups in such countries softened pressure on them. However, the recent Al-Qamshali incidents uncovered a new face in the Syrian equation.
This analysis is based on three essential indicators.
Therefore, this card can be used to pressurize these countries to soften their interferences in Iraq, according to the American declared accusations. America can also obtain concessions from these countries in some files that are not less vital.
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi warned the American administration against attacking Najaf City as this would put Washington in face with the Islamic world and would lead to disastrous results.
3- Considering attacking Karbalaa and Najaf as a "redline". If the American forces attacked the two cities they should bear the responsibility for that including the change of the Iranian stance.
Kharazi underpinned that there is no direct talks with Washington, as Iran knew, through previous talks, that the American do not abide by their agreements.
Under this headline, Salama Ne'mat of Al-Hayat wrote an article that ran to the following effect: Ironically enough, following the last bloody incidents in Iraq, the US political course that runs in parallel with the military one has now been confined to employing the same powers that Washington used to marginalize since the ousting of Saddam's regime - namely Iran and its allied religious leaderships.
Arab countries concerned might need to review their policies to benefit by past mistakes that made a country like Iran a main regional player in an Arab country even though it is burdened with domestic conflict between Reformists and Conservatives.
Arab governments contented themselves with statements on their keenness on the territorial integrity and independence of Iraq without taking any action to help Iraq to achieve this integrity and that independence.

The Kuwaiti government opened a new arena for confrontation with Islamists by declaring merging Faculty of Sharia with Faculty of Law in Kuwait University.
Newspapers quoted Kuwaiti Education Minister Dr. Rashid Al-Hamad as saying, "The merger issue has been decided upon according to the premier's directives." An academic source said to Al-Hayat that the university administration had not received any official order for merger until yesterday (14th April). "The die has been cast politically away from any academic considerations," he added, expecting administrative and academic problems. Faculty of Law students protested against putting them on an equal footing with Faculty of Sharia students. Moreover, the university Student Union alluded to staging a strike if the university board approved the merger.
Islamists accuse liberals who are close to the current government of seeking to have such a decree passed to liquidate the Faculty of Sharia and inciting the government to issue such a decree particularly in the last two years.
The liberals see that trend as correct and charge the Islamists with politicizing the issue. In a statement on 13th April secretary general of Democratic National Alliance Khaled Helal said, "The merger between the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Sharia requires a technical decision away form politics."

The plan also demanded an economic and social about-face by pressing for a serious blueprint to eradicate poverty and joblessness, creating a tax and financial reform, stopping the sustained deterioration of the Egyptian pound, stemming the tide of deterioration in saving and investment rates, providing better educational and health services and fighting corruption.
It also provided for developing pan-Arab relations through supporting Iraqi and Palestinian resistance groups, in addition to Egyptian international ties, reconsidering Egyptian-American relations on the basis that there is a deep contradiction between mutual interests in light of U.S. policies. The party finally called on all political parties, trade unions, civilian establishments, research centers, university professors and national and democratic personalities to discuss its initiative and propose amendments to it in order to arrive at a reform program acceptable to all parties.
It added that the talks focused on the exchange of information and estimates and coordination of positions on the eve of the International Atomic Energy Agency session to discuss the Iranian nuclear project.

EGYPTAIR PUTS OFF RESUMING FLIGHTS TO BAGHDAD
Real estate experts and consultants expected a boom in the real estate market during the coming period. They based their argument on the actual start of the real estate finance system that appeared clearly in the high rush on the first real estate exhibition and housing units and tourist resorts that wound up in Cairo late last week.
On the other hand, head of Real Estate Investors Union Hisham Mustafa said that there are many means that could give momentum to the market in the coming period, mainly including the low rate of exchange and the government's approval of compensating contractors for the differentials of prices in the works assigned to them, that had been affected by the rise in exchange rates. Moreover, there is an extremely important factor, i.e interest rate on financing non-low income categories whose problem has been solved through low-income categories subsidy fund, on condition that interest rate should not exceed 10%. "It is considered the main factor for encouraging such a system," he said.
Al-Siba'i added that banks' intervention in promoting real estate projects, whether those whose construction or capital they contribute to or those they sponsor, will have a positive effect in the coming period as the harbingers of such participation started to show up and the real estate market reaped some fruits. A big number of housing units have been sold particularly through such an approach that will be adopted by many Egyptian banks.
Al-Balkini suggested that banks and real estate banks would put up booklets to be distributed in hotels and airports and even in streets. This means is used by many a country besides exhibitions and was proved successful, thus reflecting on the sales volume shown on their websites.

Then they would be marketed in the Egyptian Capital Market Authority. This action will relieve the burden of local debts service on the public budget that hits 35 billion pounds per annum, thus decreasing the chronic deficit in the state's public budget that rose to 51 billion pounds in the budget of the FY 2004/2005.

The campaign on Muqtada Sadr's Mahdi army may be followed by other ones on other militias such as Badr legion, affiliated to the Supreme Assembly Council for Islamic Revolution and others, as the coalition forces decided to disband militant organizations in the country, consequently it is unreasonable to disband some militias and let others, Bachachi told Asharq al-Awsat.
Such conditions aggravated due to service problems, which were already weak, including electricity, gasoline and oil crises and others. All such things were, undoubtedly, negative aspects, he pointed out.
Accepting this post depends on the competence and other related powers that may be held by the president, as such issues will be laid down and endorsed during the coming two months."
Aboul-Motasem pointed out coordination between Shiite and Sunnite groups and especially the followers of the young religious leader Muqtada Sadr to resist American occupation. He, however, declined to give further details in that regard. He added that such coordination had not developed enough so far, but he expressed wishes that it would develop enough to form a unified field command between Sunnites and Shiites whose platform would concentrate solely on one point: driving the American occupation out of all Iraqi lands.
He uncovered that a big number of former Iraq regime forces had joined Iraqi resistance.
Regarding Arab volunteers in Iraq, he said, "Arab volunteers have very good morale, and are resisting everywhere. They have become in control of all crossroads to be able to hit American forces wherever they move in Iraq.
Now Bush is facing his new Vietnam in Iraq. Instead of Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese legendary leader, he finds scores of that category in Mesopotamia, the most outstanding among them is Muqtada Sadr, the third son of Mohamed Mohamed Sadik Sadr who led the Shiite authority out of its long silence into high-sounding slogans. It is thus called the vocal in contrast to the silent Authority led by the biggest Shiite authority in the world, Ali Al Sistani.
However, by the end of the day, he opted for negotiations with that resistance after he tried using F-16s, Apaches and all sorts of destructive weapons. He preferred to negotiate through the Iraqi Governing Council members especially Mohsin Abdel Hamid who, together with his party, belongs to the Sunnite regions.
According to one of those belonging to the Iraqi Communist Party participating in the Governing Council, Muqtada Al Sadr tried to fill in the power vacuum after the fall of the regime in April, taking advantage of the anti-regime Shiite public feeling.
He died at hospital after the same bullets had denied the lives of two of his own sons, Mostafa and Muamil, but his third son Muqtada Sadr remained alive to inherit Sadr the second trend.
Sadr the second trend is known to be discountenanced by Qum authorities as well as by those related to the Iranian vision because Sadr belongs, in the first place, to the vocal authority refusing to keep scholarship Hawza (Seminary of Shiite law colleges) as a place for just giving religious lessons unrelated to the public situation in Iraq and the Islamic world and, in the second place as Sadr is facing foreign authority out of conviction that the referentiality should be Arab both in grassroots and leadership, an approach entirely rejected by Iran which thinks that influence on holy places should be Iranian rather than Arab.
Strikingly, a statement was issued by Mostafa Al Ya'coubi, one of Sadr's aides now under arrest, emphasizing a military resistance of occupation while other authorities' statements, though condemning occupation forces random killing of both parties, have urged detente and peaceful solutions to problems, a quite approach from that of Sadr, the son who emerged from the dark to face Bush, the son.
Under this headline, in an interview with Dr. Zafir Al-Ani, Political Sciences professor in Baghdad University, who is working now for the United Arab of Emirates University, talked about the Iraqi scene interactions.
A: This does not mean that occupation was accepted by the broader sector of Shiites who, however, have got a popular tradition represented in the presence of a religious establishment in the literal sense of the word which is financially, administratively, organizationally and intellectually independent. A Shiite citizen, therefore, cannot act without a fatwa (religious opinion) by major authorities who did not order a jihad (holy war). This is, however, one of the very few occasions on which the Shiite grassroots rebel against the religious Hawza (Seminary of Shiite law colleges) as their patience seems to have been stretched to the limit because a year of occupation has passed leaving all bad impacts on the Iraqi citizen. He, consequently, did not wait for a fatwaa from a religious authority, which has not so far been given.
A: Of course, this was one factor among others. Sadr has thus lent the Iraqi question its Arab and Islamic dimension emphasizing the option of resistance, especially as he chose the most adamant anti-American and Anti-Zionist models in the region.
Q: Can this urge Sadr to seek power in the near future if occupation forces left Iraq?
The battle of Falluja has broken the barriers of fear of facing the American hellish military machine, not to mention the heavy losses inflicted on the American forces which made their command admit that they were facing their most crucial stage since the beginning of occupation, especially in light of a street war that suggests an organized and trained resistance that has a national project.
Netanyahu then listened to the advice, responded to it and delayed negotiations for three years on end.
1-An American approval of the Jewish state identity opening the door to transfer (deportation) possibilities brandished by Israeli leaders against the Arab minority (one million and 200 thousand souls) 2-An American approval of rejecting the return of Palestinian refugees to their lands from which they were deported in 1948, i.e they will have to be settled in the Palestinian state.
5-Recognition of the legitimacy of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip through unifying the denunciation of the Palestinian struggle against occupation which all must cooperate to eliminate and through confirming that Israel had the right to defend itself against anti-occupation acts.
When the American President now ignores settlement negotiations, the Palestinian and the Arabs, he quite ineptly places American-backed Israel versus the whole Arab region, thus inciting the whole Arab region to sense danger and prepare for facing it.
American calculations of the Arab official situation in terms of military and economic weakness may well be true and may even make it optimistic about the possibility of imposing its dictates.
There is the popular force of Lebanese Hizbullah which could hardly be kept calm if Israel went too far in executing its scheme especially regarding transfer. There is also the Palestinian popular force inside the Israeli entity. Such force could act if it discovered that the transfer logic would be put into effect.
This project, too, is subject to Arab objection and the attempts to impose it might possibly engender Arab war or wars or perhaps the outbreak of Arab-American war or wars launched by popular resistance instead of official armies.
Al-Sinoussi said, "I warn my people against any promises promoted by the regime's agents about reforms or measures to alleviate oppression.

But if they chose to avoid the reality of the diabolic developments that the Palestinian cause undergoes and to say that they still offer their peace initiative and adhere to the roadmap, they would be emphasizing to Bush and Sharon that they are a nation that knows how to coexist with illusions, deceit and lies.

The Arabs used not to have any illusions about the American-Israeli alliance, but they have a difficulty in understanding the American Administration's insistence on weakening the moderates who are aware that all those who are accused by the United States of practising terrorism gain "legitimacy" and even "popularity" through revealing the injustice done to the Palestinians.

The Ikhwan described the decision as "arbitrary", adding that the university president decided to refer a number of female students to investigations as they staged a hunger strike last Tuesday evening in protest against the decision of banning students from sitting for exams.

He added that in order to meet the increase in demand and with a view to ending the Israeli fertilizers presence on the Egyptian market, production lines work three shifts a day taking into account that the agents of the Israeli companies try to increase their sales after they have realized that they would lose their stake on market.
These courses began with training 15 Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip in the maintenance and rehabilitation of electric grids which the Israeli aggression destroyed. This will be followed with another two similar courses.

RETREAT OF CHINESE DEMAND, PUBLIC PRESSURE TO ENFORCE ANTITRUST LAW BEHIND REBAR PRICE DROP
Regarding the effect of change of iron prices on the real estate sector, Dr. Sayed Abdel-Baki with the Housing and Construction Centre pointed out that the average cost of reinforcing iron in buildings rages between 61 and 75 percent, adding that reinforcing iron represents about 69 percent of the concrete structure if the rebar price stands at 3300 pounds (532.25 dollars) per ton and 46 percent if the iron price ranges between 1100 pounds (177.41 dollars) and 1200 pounds (192.54 dollars).
Retreat of rebar prices is expected to positively affect the cost of constructions, thus pushing the real estate market forward, especially as this synchronized with government attempts to control the rise in the (dollar) rate of exchange, Sabbour added. There is no justification for raising prices of new constructions at present, he said, linking this to some factors foremost of which is China's stable demand for iron products, as it withdraws a big percentage of world market, and stability of foreign currencies which control material imports. Production capacity of Egyptian plants also reached their maximum levels, as data revealed that 40 percent of the available capacity in Egyptian factories is unused, he said.
Taking the social dimension, national economy and controlling monopoly into account is a difficult equation that needs a smart administration to strike a balance among such dimensions, he said, pointing out that the Egyptian market is lacking in apparatuses that probe the impact of decisions on industry and other related sectors in an economic and societal rather than static manner.

The insurance will equal the value of the goods during the period of storage and will be against all dangers including insurance against breach of faith.
In his explanation about how to deal with obstacles, which impede both public and private sectors, Rashid said that he had enough expertise to deal with obstacles which faced businessmen, pointing out the importance of finding solutions to such hindrances.

Following the end of meetings, Tunisian Minister of Tourism paid a visit to French tourism union to mull over increasing the number of French tourists to Tunisia through reducing the current prices by 5%.
In the beginning we would like to refer to some official statements and figures that confirm the government involvement in public fund plundering in privatization program. In 1993, the World Bank (WB) report said that the value of the public enterprise sector companies hit 550 billion pounds, while Al-Ahram Center for Economic studies and the National Investment Bank appraised them at 500 billion pounds only.
The same scenario was repeated with AL-Nasr Company for Boilers, the sole company of its kind in the Middle East. It was sold for 58 million pounds, which was less than the price of the land on which the factory was built. What is more funny is that when the issue was raised in the People's Assembly it was discovered that the real selling price is 56 million pounds only and not 58 million pounds.
Lawyer, Samir Abdel-Mohsen pointed out that the government had violated the law in selling operations, as the company has to be appraised at first and should not be sold less than the appraisal value, otherwise this will be an explicit public fund plundering. It was expected that the government would sell those companies at prices more than those set by the World Bank or the specialized centers in Egypt. What happened can be called selling on a whim or "selling under the table"
In an interview with the International France Radio, he called Israel "poison in the Middle East region."
Israel's permanent representative to the UN strongly attacked Brahimi, saying that his government would lodge a formal complaint against Brahimi with the UN.
Israel backtracked on its stance towards Israeli Prime Minster Ariel Sharon's statement, in which he declared that he washed his hands of the pledge he gave to the US President George Bush not to harm Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.
TRADE IN IRAQI ANTIQUITIES FLOURISHES IN ISRAEL
The economic institute in Tel Aviv admitted in a study entitled "Iraq and the Promised Land... common interests", which was issued on 7th April on the occasion of the first anniversary of the fall of Iraq, that Israel now sees Iraq and its resources as tools that help it to get out of its economic crisis due to the Intifada that caused gross losses that Israel will not easily make up for.
He added that the prices of the stolen Iraqi antiques range between 15 and 250 thousand dollars per piece. The Israeli Antiquities Authority gets 10% of any deal concluded whether inside these exhibitions or outside them as they are sold after being shown to antiquities experts. He revealed that tens of houses in Israel now have Iraqi antiquities for trade or decoration purposes.
A READING OF ISRAEL'S IRAQI CARDS!
Prior to the war, it was said that the Zionist lobby saturated with Torah beliefs might control both the mind and the heart of the American Administration and force it to fight the Iraqi battle on behalf of Israel, thus confirming a reverse of the theory of the relation between the American and Israeli partners based on assigning dirty tasks in the Arab region to Israel on behalf of the USA.
Nor does Israel fall short of taking advantage of both long and short-term meanings. Once Baghdad fell, Israeli officials unanimously pointed out the new developments which the Arabs, whether Syrians or Palestinians, would have to take into account.
We may even go further and argue that Israel wants to strip the new Iraq of any Arabism dimensions connecting the Iraqi and the Palestinian peoples. Such an Israeli goal is still a far fetched dream. It is wrong to impetuously contend that on April 9th, 2003 some Iraqis expressed their hatred of the Palestinians by assaulting them in some districts in Baghdad and forcing them to leave their homes into the open. It turned out that such behaviour had purely economic motives which are not very difficult to deal with and had similar incidents even among the Iraqis themselves. At most, such clashes with the Palestinians may be attributed to the naive belief that those Palestinians were biased to the former regime, which required retribution.
To my mind, such an Israeli bet has been a fiasco. Israel, according to data, has also missed the economic target together with its economic and normalization ramifications connected with operating oil pipelines between Mosul and Haifa across the Dead Sea.
Nor can it be sensibly claimed that the Governing Council has adopted or is about to adopt any courtship policy with Israel that would take it away from the general Arab trend.
We don't think that Zionism whose human resources are already limited has opted for directing such resources to any country other than Israel.
LIBYA ALLOWS ISRAELIS TO TAKE PART IN WORLD CHESS CHAMPIONSHIP
Chess International Federation welcomed the invitation and so did the Israeli Foreign Ministry, which added that it had no objections to taking part in the championship.

IRANIAN SOURCES: AYATOLLAH HA'IRI TO RETURN TO IRAQ, VOWING TO CONTROL SADR
Ha'iri, who granted himself the authority of velayat-e faqih (the rule of the jurist) in Iraq, formed a committee at his office to raise funds to help Moqtada Sadr and his Mahdi Army.
Ha'iri vowed to do his utmost to put an end to the phenomenon of Moqtada Sadr and demilitarize his Mahdi Army provided that the issue of chasing Sadr due to his role in killing Shiite leader Abdel-Majid Khoui and another two people should be delayed until after a caretaker Iraqi government is formed on June 30.
AL Secretary General Amr Moussa, who met with the British ambassador in Cairo on 26th April, said that the AL is prepared to host a conference uniting the different factions of Iraqi forces to discuss the future of Iraq, said the AL spokesman Hossam Zaki.

A leading figure in National Congress Party led by Ahmed Al Galabi, Aqil Al Taai, accused traditional forces in the Arab world as well as American interests of intervening to return Baathists to their posts in the new State's institution and agencies.
He went on to say that the Americans had already started to consider giving prominence to Iraqi forces which bear hostility to Iran.
He said that the recent American step in support of the restoration of Baathists does not prejudice Al Galabi's person nor does it indicate any American criticisms of his style in running the uprooting operation. He described the step as an American attempt to influence the shape of the political regime in Iraq.
The heinous and unprovoked attack on some of the company's workers and brutal treatment of some corpses showed the harsh circumstances under which the company is working in Iraq, he said. However, he said, the company is aimed to provide prosperity, democracy and freedom to the Iraqi people.
It employs many retired officers and servicemen (the Americans who were killed in Iraq are retired military officers) as they do not need much training and some of them worked in foreign countries.
USA AND NATIONAL AND DOCTRINAL MOSAIC IN IRAQ
Are the southern lands of Iraq the property of the Shiites alone? Are the lands of central Iraq populated by the Sunnites only?
These facts are derived from the status quo in Iraq. These facts undermine the social foundations on which Dr. Lewis based his US strategic project on dismantling the constitutional unity of Iraq into three ethnic and doctrinal small states.
To make things clearer, the new Iraqi defence minister, appointed at the behest of the US Civil Administrator Paul Bremer, is the nephew of Ahmed Chalabi. The chairman of the court that would reportedly try Saddam Hussein is also the nephew of Ahmed Chalabi, who is dying to preside over Iraq.
The average per capita consumption ranges between 70 and 80 kilograms per annum. According to this rate, an Egyptian share of domestic wheat hit 100 kilograms on the basis that wheat production hits 7 million tons annually. Therefore, Egypt's production of wheat may meet local consumption if it is well used, stored and marketed, the study added.
The government's plan aims at increasing the wheat-cultivated area to 4 million feddans in 2017 to be able to produce 10.5-12 million tons. This will be within the state's plan to reclaim 3.4 million feddans till 2017.
The company will exploit the tantalum, niobium, tin, feldspar and quartz.
Besides, a state-of-the-art technology and new mining experience will be introduced to Egypt, and Egyptian workers will be trained as well, hence the provision of 250 new jobs that will increase annually to 450 jobs. Egypt will also possess half of the company's assets and a new residential compound would be established in the desert. More importantly, Egypt will be placed at the international map of mines.
The new company will work according to main axes, foremost of which is setting up networks to supply new industrial cities and urban communities with natural gas. The cities will be provided with natural gas in stages. The first stage will include Badr City, Al-Shorouk city and new cities affiliated to Greater Cairo such as the 6th of October city and others. The second stage will include the 10th of Ramadan City and then, the new cities with governorates, he said.
They said that there is a committee for these general assemblies that comprises head of Misr Iran Development Bank Ismail Hassan; head of Delta International Bank Ali Negm; Capital Market Authority consultant Mahmoud Fahmi; head of Faisal Islamic Bank of Egypt Abdel-Hameid Abu-Mossa and governor of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) Dr Farouq Al-Oqda.
For his part deputy head of Bank of Alexandria Mohamed Radwan said that the banks' general assemblies would be legitimate till the issuance of a decision amending them.
Head of the risks sector with HSBC sahar Al-Damati said that article 93 of banks new law stipulates that it is the premier who issues the decision on the formation of public banks' general assemblies to endorse the financial lists, distribute profits and endorse the export budget. It is to be mentioned that former premier, Ebeid issued a decision for appointing representatives of public funds in the meetings of the general assembly, Al-Damati noted.
Ezabi called on Premier designate Dr Ahmed Nazif to be careful while choosing the members of his government, pointing out that this government has a hard task to do, as it will lead Egypt while enforcing the free trade agreement early 2005, which highlights the necessity of qualifying the state's economy for this leap to avoid negative repercussions.
Head of the economic committee with the opposition Tagamo'h (Grouping) Party Dr Gouda Abdel-Khaleq voiced pessimism about the new government's ability to bring about any reform regarding the deteriorating economic conditions in the country.
Abdel-Khaleq refused to comment on the personality, ideas and tendencies of Dr Nazif contenting himself with saying that he was once a colleague in the teaching staff of Cairo University. He alluded that Nazif lacked any political background, as he did not involve in any political activity before taking over his ministerial post, which means the continuity of choosing technocrats rather than politicians for the post, a thing that makes them lacking in social and popular sense while making decisions.
82% OF BUSINESS COMMUNITIES WELCOME CABINET RESHUFFLE
PLAN FOR DEVELOPING MISR-RUMANIA BANK TO BE IMPLEMENTED
The bank also studies inaugurating new 5 branches in the coming period.
The second level includes the bank's expansion in issuing new banking products to enhance its presence on the retail banking market. In this regard, 5 products are planned to be put up during the coming period.

Refining capacity hits 50,000 tons annually.
According to Hermes financial group expectations, the new government will speed up the tempo of the economic reform. In a report it issued yesterday, Hermes pointed out that the new premier, Dr. Ahmed Nazif had a strong record in deregulating the communications and technology sector in the last four years and could remove obstacles to the growth of the sector. He encouraged the private sector to enter investment in technology and communications and has prepared the sector for the GATT agreement since 2002.
EGYPT SUSTAINS 2 MILLION POUNDS IN LOSSES DUE TO PARTICIPATION IN FOREIGN EXHIBITIONS
The GOIEF sustained 2 million pounds in losses due to participation in foreign exhibitions as a result of failure to promote Egyptian products of foreign markets.
The GOIEF failed to reveal why this inexperienced company in particular was charged with a promotional campaign in Senegal. The GOIEF also incurred 349,000 pounds in losses when it took part in the International Furniture Exhibition in Paris due to the exploitation of half the hired area at a total cost of 61,000 pounds, and decor high costs amounting to 183,000 pounds, or 80 percent of total contributions.
EGYPTIAN-AMERICAN BUSINESS COUNCIL TO CONSIDER FREE TRADE AND QIZ AGREEMENTS NEXT WEEK
The sources said that the meetings will mull over the development of the tax environment in Egypt with the aim of providing the appropriate atmosphere to attract more American and foreign companies in addition to providing technical aid to develop youth's skills in divers fields.
Businessman Adel Al-Ezabi, deputy head of Investors Division in the Federation of Chambers of Commerce, said, "Efforts are being exerted to have the QIZ agreement concluded as a first step to sign an Egyptian-American free trade agreement."
Exaggerated protectionist measures of the textile industry encouraged many producers to neglect the product development and quality standard, hence the current crisis. "The cancellation of quota system and the textile trade deregulation were not a surprise, as we know many years ago that that would happen. However, the Egyptian industry could not qualify itself to deal with the new situation," he added.
The Egyptian side in the Egyptian-American Business Council which headed for Washington last Saturday will discuss this issue with the American officials.
In statements to Al-Ahram he said that the European Union was cooperating with the Egyptian side through enforcing a package of bilateral cooperation programs that aimed at modernizing Egyptian customs sector, streamline commercial flows between Egypt and the European Union and enhancing the skill of the cadres working in different commercial sectors and helping them to achieve the necessary reform steps to draw upon the partnership agreement that was enforced early last month.
In their meeting in London last week, Egyptian-British Business Council members agreed to send a paper to the premier. Head of the Egyptian party in the council, Eng. Mohamed Nussier and head of the British party said that the paper dealt with the economic reform, transparency, British investments and the development of the British University construction in Egypt.
Regarding the first issue, for example, over 37 million tourists leave Britain every year, out of whom only 1% come to Egypt, 360 thousand British tourists. The issue of textiles, and textile industries come in the forefront of the council's priorities as such a sector includes, besides ready-made clothes, all kinds of linen like bed covers, curtains, carpets, moquettes, towels, upholstery drapery. This is meant to expand dealings, as was emphasized by Mohamed Farid Khamis who put potential Egyptian exports to billions of dollars annually.
Major General, Ahmed Abdel-Hamid Al-Shallal who used to teach in the cancelled Al-Bakr Academy for Strategic and Military Studies says that what is really required is a sustainable political process as well as an international regional consensus to get out of the crisis.
However, many side effects might take place like weakening Shiites and cutting their political role to size.
Failure to Achieve Goals: He said that the goals sought by America through attacking Falluja and other cities had not been achieved.
When combat takes place in alleys and narrow lanes the soldiers feel at a loss even while having sophisticated weaponry and technology, thus giving their even weaker rivals a big advantage as they know the topography of their own district.
Thirdly, they failed to dismantle resistance cells.
Secondly: Forcing the alliance forces to open direct dialogue with Falluja inhabitants.
In Falluja engagements, however, American tanks as well as the Apaches have become easy target for the combatants who redeemed respect to anti-armour weapons especially the Russian weapon, RBJ 7 which fell into forgetfulness after the October 1973 war when it played a main role in crossing the Suez Canal.
A: The resistance faced by the American forces bears evidence to political and military failure. On the political level, there is no definite concept or agenda for the date of withdrawal of occupation forces now present on Iraqi lands, ending occupation, transferring power to the Iraqis or holding free democratic elections. This is quite obvious as the USA is seeking to set up three military bases in Iraqi lands to ensure its permanent presence.
A: The conflict that occurred between Sadr followers and occupation forces is only partial rather than comprehensive. It was not approved by other Shiite authorities especially Sistani, the greatest Shiite authority in Iraq. The first spark of a Shiite confrontation with occupation forces has not been off yet, as there are only limited confrontations which other Shiite authorities are averse to escalating in the hope of reaching power peacefully. Therefore, they did not enter into armed confrontations in the hope of reaching power through ballot boxes as they are a majority in Iraq.
A: The Iraqi resistance now is the first defence lines of Iraq and the region. I was worried about a possible sectarian division in the Iraqi community and a conflict erupting between sects. However, the killing operations and the behaviour of occupation forces has led to cohesion among such groups whether they belonged to the Sunnites or the Shiites. If the Iraqi resistance failed to face occupation forces, the American Administration would turn to other countries in the region.
A: If the Iraqi resistance held ground, it would fail. If, on the other hand such resistance collapsed, which is not unlikely, it would open the door to any future American options in the region.
Latest statistics show that the number of Islamic banks worldwide rose to 270 banks whose total assets amount to 260 billion dollars, said Board Chairman of the General Council of Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions Saleh Kamel.
This will boost the economies of Islamic countries and support the dynamism of the market through capitalizing the assets of companies and projects with bonds and other devised financial instruments, he indicated.
"Funds deposited with Islamic banks are mostly accumulated in Iran due to the application of the Islamic system to all of its banks," Secretary-General of the council Ezzeddin Khojah told Al-Hayat.
The World Bank (WB) mulls over laying down a strategy to settle water conflicts in the Nile basin and Middle East countries, said a report by the WB.
The WB laid down an action strategy for using water in certain sectors such as drinking water, drainage water, irrigation and power production, the report said.
The increase in poverty rates in the region is regarded as a big embarrassment to its governments especially as the population rate living in abject poverty (i.e. less than one dollar daily) in developing countries has gone down to nearly a half between 1981 and 2001 out of 40%, to 21% of total world population.
High-ranking sources with the company said it has totaled $1.7 billion in losses since its establishment in 1983.
The company, which sells fuel and runs oil refineries in Europe, uses meager quantities of Kuwaiti oil crude, which does not exceed 10% of its total uses, they said. "A host of senior officials were not changed and no fresh blood has been injected in the company since 1985. The foreign CEOs of the company remained in their posts while the four Kuwaiti CEOs, namely Nader Sultan, Naser Al-Salim, Kamel Al-Hersi and Gamal Al-Nouri, were changed," they pointed out.
Latest indicators show that the company began to lose a big portion of its quota on the Danish market.
During the 30-minute meeting, Kurdish luminaries submitted their demands, including "setting free all Kurdish detainees, especially after Qamshali events, and returning Kurdish students to their colleges, institutes (10 students) and university hostels (21 students), Darwish noted.
Well-informed sources told Al-Hayat that there were "extremist and ultranationalists among Kurdish personalities that use strange-sounding words in the Syrian political discourse, in an indication to certain statements that include words such as "Syrian Kurdistan" and "West Kurdistan".
This statement was made by Prince Saud Al Faysal in an address on Tuesday night at Walldorf Astoria Hotel during a party cosponsored by the American-Saudi Business Council and the Foreign Policy Association. He pointed out that Mujahideen were then given credit by the White House which even welcomed them.
He went on to say that Al Qaeda ideology could be summed up as holding all Islamic countries governments as illegitimate as a prelude to the reestablishment of the Islamic Caliphate with Al Qaeda as leader.
He added that the attacks launched against Saudi Arabia were targeting it because it may well be one of the most eligible countries for launching a war against Al Qaeda and ridding of its ideology in the Islamic world.
During the interview, Prince Saud Al-Faysal warned against the consequences on Iraq's neighbours and the whole region if the present conditions went on in Iraq.
The latest was the suicide attack against a security complex in Riyadh which claimed the lives of scores of innocent people. It was perpetrated by terrorist groups believed to belong to the remnants of Al-Qaeda network and its new advocates when President Bush's stupid policy and his absolute support of Sharon's schemes succeeded in recruiting them and fuelling indignation and anger as well as filling them with such despair so as to drive them to the brink of suicide.
For the last months, the Americans have never ceased to warn of expected terrorist operations against their interests, but such operations mainly took place inside and against Arab regimes in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Morocco, and Yemen.
Since the September incidents, Washington has been implementing such sophisticated mechanisms to invest the terrorism phenomenon in the Middle East with an unabated energy seeking fresh targets and supporters.
SUDAN: OFFICIALS ASK FOR THE SEPARATION OF THE NORTH

Othman was of the view that the current negotiations with Kenya "won't achieve peace".
DECLARED MASSACRE
Clashes with Falluja inhabitants started early from the first month of occupation. This city gave the former regime, or rather the former state, many of its natives as soldiers and security men.
Some people add to them Al-Qaeda network and "foreign militants", about whom no true information is however available.
That is to say that the "Sunnite Triangle" has now only one side, namely Falluja, which has to be broken in order to destroy the whole triangle.
It is mainly the decision of the military, but the massacre needs coverage from the top of the hierarchy.
The scenario is, thus, as follows: a ceasefire after agreeing on handing over everybody including the foreigners and then giving up arms. Then, the American troops would enter every neighbourhood and house as they had done before in a deterring and savage demonstration of power, just as what we see, but to a lesser degree, in Hollywood films.
If George W. Bush was told that that was a battle against Al-Qaeda rather than a campaign to suppress a rebellion against occupation, there would be no need for predictions of his decision.
The government finally decided to hike potable water prices by 20-25%.

HEAD OF INVESTMENT AUTHORITY: INVESTMENT CRISIS ENGENDERED BY BUREAUCRACY
A: There are some procedures to improve tax law, streamline customs procedures, improving ports and developing banks, as this will greatly reflect on investment, because these are the main problems that face investors.
A: There is no bureaucracy in establishing companies but rather preserving the rights of the others.

The study entitled "Pricing Irrigation Water in Egypt - the Thought and Threats - confirmed that most Egyptian farmers were poor as about 95% of Egyptian farm holdings were less than 5 feddans.
In reply to the argument that urges the water pricing technique, Al-Gamasi's study said that farmers are not the sole beneficiaries of the Nile water and it would not be fair, therefore, to burden them with its maintenance costs. He pointed out that there were several activities that might be more remunerative than agriculture like using the Nile water for generating electricity, building houses near the Nile, the tourism usage of the Nile water, piscine production and household and industrial applications. For example, the study added, a house overlooking the Nile would have a much higher price than one that is a long way from the Nile. He pointed out that housing along the Nile or the use of that site can be much more remunerative than any expected water irrigation revenues only if some economic and calculation rules were properly applied.
On Friday, a plan was released in Tel Aviv for a constant and comprehensive settlement to the Palestinian cause including full pullout from Gaza and extracting part of Sinai in return for Egypt getting part of Wadi Feran. However, the plan, which envisions an Egyptian-Jordanian-American mandate on the Palestinian territories, did not include the establishment of a Palestinian state.
The following are the salient points in the plan:
- Egypt shall grant the Palestinians 600 square kilometers in Sinai in order to control overpopulation in Gaza Strip.
- Egypt, Jordan and the United States shall have mandate on the Palestinian territories.
Commenting on these proposals, Palestinian Minister of Negotiations Affairs Sa'eb Erikat said Israel should commit itself to the implementation of the Roadmap, which calls for establishing a Palestinian state by 2005 and working out the concluded agreements instead of seeking other new ideas or plans.
The draft plan, which a political source described as changeable, was laid down while Sharon was planning to pull out from Gaza unilaterally and trying to convince the United States of greenlighting it as a step towards peace.
The 15 deputies demanded that a comprehensive ban be imposed on any American requests in that sphere.
The reasons for such official lukewarmness and popular boiling in Cairo-Tel Aviv relations are attributed to the assassination of Hamas' spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and then his successor Dr. Abdel-Aziz al-Rantissi. Matters got worse last week by Sharon's threats to assassinate Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, which provoked the Egyptian authorities to double its punitive policies against Israel at one go rather than gradually. The first of such punitive measures was taken following the assassination of Sheikh Yassin when Egypt was compelled to close down the Israeli Academic Center in Cairo and cancelled all its activities under security pretexts and in order to forestall a number of Israeli academicians and university professors who reached Cairo to deliver lectures on Israel's history but they turned off.
Participants in a recent symposium organized by the African and Asian Peoples' Integration Organization said the U.S. and Israel seek to poke their noses in the Nile water to affect Egypt's quota of water and change international agreements to enable Israel to make use of the Nile water. They want to discuss such matters during an international water conference in the Middle East region. Therefore, the conferees called for Arab concerted efforts to stand against Zionist-American schemes, urging Egypt to review its domestic and foreign policies with the Nile Basin countries.
For his part, Mohamed Sayed Ahmed, a famous writer, said Israel plans to achieve water security just as it had nuclear security, especially as it made water desalination projects at low costs, financed by the European Union, Japan and America.
The importance of the industrial zone to be set up with Israel is based on the fact that it comes within the framework of a statement made by the American President in May 2003 following the fall of Baghdad on the foundation of an American Middle Eastern free trade zone in ten years' time or rather a zone linking the US on one hand and the Arab countries together with Israel on the other hand, which has already been done with Jordan through its free trade zone agreement with the US following the political settlement between Israel and Jordan. The QIZ step was the practical step taken on the road to normalization. They are zones devoted to producing commodities qualified for exportation to the American market without being subject to customs duties. Such industrial zones products should contain an Israeli component estimated at 30%, which would open the region to Israeli goods on one hand and ensure Israel cheap supplies of Arab gas and water on the other hand.
The two parties exploited Abdel-Malak being in Cairo - he resides in Assiut - in the last few days and acquainted him with their parties' platforms. Each party also tried to persuade him to join them, especially as Abdel-Malak was a former MP when the Labour Party was in alliance with the Muslim Brotherhood during the 1987 parliamentary elections, Asharq Al-Awsat learnt.

The step comes a week after the leftist Tagamo'h (Grouping) Party had announced an initiative, which was also preceded by an initiative by the Muslim Brotherhood Group.
CRISIS IN LEFTIST TAGAMO'H PARTY DUE TO IKHWAN'S POLITICAL REFORM INITIATIVE
It is worth mentioning that Al-Said had lashed Ikhwan's political reform initiative and accused them of practising political opportunism and of courting the Americans through offering themselves as a political alternative on the model of the Turkish Justice Party. Ikhwan, however, counter attacked Al-Said on the pages of their organ "Afaq Arabia" accusing him of trying to disunite parties and political forces with a view to propitiating the government.
GOVERNMENT RATIONALIZATION MEASURES: SELLING WATER TO HOSPITALS AND PLACES OF WORSHIP PRICING DRAINAGE SERVICES

Just like electricity consumption, potable water consumption will be subject to the category system.
INTERNAL DEBT EXCEEDS LIMITS OF SAFETY
The actual deficit, according to the final account, went up by 24.6 billion pounds in comparison to the total estimated deficit in FY 2001/2002 public budget, up 118.8%. This percentage is extremely high if we take into consideration that the total estimated deficit, according to the amendments of the FY 2000/2001 draft budget, is estimated at just 14.7 billion pounds," said member of the Economic Committee of the ruling National Democratic Party Dr. Salah Al-Gindi.
Several indicators refer to the current dangerous situation of the public debt in general and the internal debt in particular. The ratio of the internal debt to the GDP, for instance, exceeded limits of safety even in comparison to only the government's debts. During the period from 1998 up till now the growth rates of the public debts hit 13.5%, while the annual growth rate of the GDP hit 6.8%, which indicates the dangerous situation and the debt misadministration, said Prof. of commerce at the Faculty of Commerce, Al-Azhar University Mohamed Abdel-Halim Omar. There are many other indicators that we have exceeded the limits of safety to a great extent and that we have passed the stage of the simple problem that needs little effort to be solved it to the complicated chronic that can hardly be solved in the short run. This negatively impacts on the national economy as a whole, thus necessitating immediate and strategic interference in accordance with an objective plan to treat this crisis, Omar added.
Omar adds that such economic authorities sell their services to citizens at high prices equal to those on the market.
Deputy head of the Higher Shiite Islamic Council in Lebanon Sheikh Abdel Amir Qablan held the West, particularly the US, responsible for aggravating the conflict in the Middle East region.

She cited the men's oppression of Muslim women in the name of religion as an example. Former German ambassador to Morocco Murad Hofman believes that the Western enmity against Islam goes back to past centuries and has become part of the Western heritage.
Egyptian opposition parties denied reports that the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) had fixed a date to resume the national dialogue, which started with them last November.

The group pointed out that its members repented and rejoined the people's ranks after they had been involved in collaboration with Israel. They pledged to clean up the Palestinian society of the dirt of collaborators.
The "facts" in question must be the theft of land and the building of settlements on the land of others and the gains that Israel has come into through war and aggression, which are all facts that Washington had considered as illegal and illegitimate until the "Bush promise" changed that situation and threw to the wind those international resolutions that still consider such "facts" as illegal and illegitimate.
Where is the commitment to the Roadmap, if such commitment has not gone beyond being just words? Do the members of the Quartet really believe that the Roadmap is still as they approved it, or they have succumbed to the amendments made by Bush and Sharon in the map?
It is now impossible and impractical to gamble on a role by the European Union, Russia or the United Nations that would get the United States to change its position.
Who told the experts of the Administration that a clarification was needed? Things are quite clear as it is. Who told them that calling in the representatives of Arab media and pumping more words into their microphones would make things clearer?
So, President Bush went after an electoral scoop, but he did not heed the consequences of the destruction he has wreaked.
The Quartet has also supported Sharon's preferences with regard to the Palestinian leadership with which he would deal, but it did not specify the leadership it supported, the one that draws its legitimacy from the Palestinian people, or the one that Sharon and Movaz will select.
In an interview with Egyptian Al-Mussawar weekly magazine issued on Friday (7th May), Mesh'al said that the Islamic nation should not deal with the situation as an onlooker who fears for the future of Hamas. "We are ready for resistance but we are concerned about the future of the nation that leaves the battle to Hamas and the Palestinians despite the fact that the whole nation is at risk and the Palestinians are the first defense line," he said.
Regarding Hamas priorities for the time being, Mesh'al said, "These priorities are confined to how to face the unceasing Israeli aggression on the Palestinian people, and how to escalate resistance as a legitimate self-defense right of the Palestinian people.
Mesh'al confirmed that Hamas has not participated in the Palestinian Authority, saying, "Our stance towards this issue will not change. We reject to participate in the Palestinian Authority, which abides by Israeli security commitments by virtue of the agreements it signed with Israel.
On the other hand, Tunisian MPs warned against introducing amendments to school syllabi in compliance with foreign pressure. Discussing a loan by the World Bank to reform the education system, the MPs said that loans and aid should not be associated with interferences in the content of such programmes, in an indication to the Greater Middle East plan, which aims to "modernize" the education system in the Arab world according to the American perspective.
"The time of launching the project," said an official who took part in formulating the project, "might not be ideal in view of the deteriorating conditions in Iraq and Washington's backing of Ariel Sharon's unilateral disengagement plan, in addition to the pictures of torturing Iraqi detainees."
The proposed reform document will not be an alternative to implementing an Arab-Israeli peace; however, reform should not be linked to the peace process. Action should be taken on both sides separately, he added.
The Irish ambassador, who paid a visit to Bibliotheca Alexandrina with the EU's ambassadors yesterday on the occasion of ten new countries joining the EU, expected the EU conception of the strategic partnership to make a positive impact on Egypt, as the expansion of the EU was a big challenge to the EU countries which dealt with it in a dynamic way. The EU is Egypt's biggest trade partner and the second biggest exporter of foreign direct investments and tourism, he said.
Al-Zaydi went on to say that investigations with those arrested uncovered many things that helped the process of successive falls of terrorist cells.
He added that despite the Kingdom's vast area, the terrorists' integration with society has become impossible especially as they are looked upon by citizens as their primary enemy after innocent citizens and residents fell victims to their operations in Riyadh Public security headquarters.
In that context, Gulf Cooperation Council Interior Ministers signed the Anti-Terrorism Joint Gulf Agreement in Kuwait yesterday.

Kidnaps go rampant in Baghdad, thus increasing citizens' concern.
A recent Arab economic report pointed out that creating job opportunities become one of the main challenges which face economic and social policies makers in the Arab World due to the big number of those who enter the labour market every year. The work force in the Arab world reached 103 millions in 2002. This labour force is characterized by its low educational and training levels, which is reflected in its low output.
It added that the good administration, decision and perfect execution of those plans and programs would contribute to achieving production integration among Arab countries.

Reduction of the public budget deficit is not the main priority of the financial policy in the coming period, Ghali said, pointing out endeavours to set the frameworks necessary for raising the level of national economy so as to achieve higher growth rates.

EGYPT, MOROCCO & TUNISIA MOST LIKELY TO SUFFER FROM EU EXPANSION
For two months and until the eve of that great event in the history of the European Union, a number of European commissioners in charge of trade and economic relations, in the forefront of whom was Pascal Lami, toured the Mediterranean partners especially Morocco and Tunisia, the first countries to sign partnership agreements in the Arab World. The tours are meant to reduce concern about the ten new members who vie in several trade, agricultural and industrial and even services spheres. On the other hand, they will also aggravate the problem of migrant workers, who bring considerable foreign exchange revenues which relatively redress the balances.
European Union experts think that Mediterranean Arab economies do develop but not rapidly enough to relieve the negative implications. A big number of industrial companies in the relevant countries, therefore, did not achieve such improvements that would cope with the sharp competition to be expected as of May 1st, 2004 and after the final lifting of customs barriers in 2006, which urged Algeria, for instance, to ask Brussels at the beginning of April to delay the implementation of the agreement items till the end of 2005.
Last week, Pascal Lami unhesitantly told Moroccan Shalang Ebdou magazine that the Europeans preferred to import textiles and ready-made clothes from Poland and would certainly continue to do that in the future.
If the capacities of the ten new countries are so limited in the field of tourism that they cannot vie, so far, with Mediterranean countries, they will fare well in the future, as was the case with Spain and Portugal especially as a new slash of young businessmen in Czech, Polonia, Hungary and Slovenia started to opt for popular tourism.
NATO AND GULF SECURITY
The US does not need a wide-scope regional security structure to secure its military bases. Moreover, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, in turn, do not need to engage in official arrangements to determine their interests in advance.
Absolute dependence on the US military protection, albeit important in protecting some Gulf countries from foreign acts of aggression, would not lend to the success of the endeavours to reach more stable and effective security arrangements.
* What are the activities that should be concentrated on?
* What are factors that hinder such cooperation?
Surely enough, such a vision might lead to more hatred, in lieu of mitigating tension in the region, where other countries, such as Iran, would seek to use different means of menace to prevent the establishment of such cooperation.
This theory prevails at the level of government stances. Nonetheless, it is necessary to point out that most of the region's peoples have also been tending more and more to accept, even if hesitantly, such a reality.
The region's peoples seem to look forward to government policies that tend to formulate and enforce active security solutions at the regional level within the context of such aspirations, many Gulf people see that excessive dependence of the US capacities would cause self-satisfaction and accordingly delaying the consideration of concepts related to the necessity of formulating an alternative security policy.
* What are the issues that the NATO should seriously take into account within the framework of its efforts to boost cooperation relations with the GCC countries?
Undoubtedly enough, the concept of "coalition of the willing" denotes the possibility of achieving aspired success, in case the allied countries could determine the level and volume of their individual support.
Eventually, in spite of focusing on the GCC countries' security issues, the Palestinian cause requires a concrete action for a fair solution. The notion that links between the Palestinian cause and security of the Gulf region does not prevail or dominate the regional policies, as some like to depict. Nevertheless, this does not mean that such a link is absent, but it is real and available.

On the other hand, CBE former governor, Ismail Hasssan who is now Egypt-Iran Bank president showed reservations about raising interest rates in the short run.

However, the chambers of hotels and travel agents okayed the fresh tax after having been added to the prices of new tourist contracts as of early next November.

The US-based Coptic National Society (CNS) said in a statement, "The agreement is an unprecedented historic development, not only because it admitted the Copts' right, but also because of the texts it included, representing the fruit of hard efforts by the CNS."

* A census of Copts shall be conducted under international supervision, disregarding the current Civil Register for many reasons related to forgery in Copts' registers on part of the Arab government in Egypt.
* Administrative systems inside the Coptic church shall be developed to be up to the international level.
Remarkably enough, the last item contradicts the thoughts and racism of Muris and his mates. He alleges that he rejects discrimination on the basis of religion or traditions, while most of the vocabulary and expressions flow with racism. It seems that Muris and his mates were sound asleep when they had a nightmare, rather than a dream, of self-rule of the Copts who reject such sectarianism, including Pope Shenuda himself.
Expatriate Copts should not be held responsible for the behaviour of some of them who deviated from the Egyptian traditions, he said, adding, "We are one and the same people made of the same fabric where both Muslims and Christians coexist without discrimination."

COMBAT HINDERS FLOW OF EGYPT'S EXPORTS TO IRAQ
ISRAEL ACCOUNTABILITY AND SECURITY ACT BEFORE CONGRESS
CNI president and former consul to Saudi Arabia Eugene H. Bird said to Al-Hayat, "2000 copies of the message were sent to the Congressmen and the Senate in an unprecedented step in the history of the US policy."
Economic, military and diplomatic sanctions shall be imposed on Israel in case it did not abide by the act. The US shall, accordingly, stop financial support to Israel (3 billion dollars annually), as a part of it is used for bankrolling occupation and building settlements and the "Separation Wall".
Under this headline, Rashid Khashana of Al-Hayat writes an article which runs to the following effect: Ten months after Israeli Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had given his famous statement urging Hebrew companies to penetrate the Iraqi market, it can be argued that the Israelis have largely achieved that end, thanks to American facilities as well as the tendency of the Transitional Governing Council to wink at Israeli organizations participation in reconstruction deals under Western or Arab cover.
Nor is such an intelligence activity confined to the capital Baghdad as it is focused, in the first place, on the Kurdish area in the North as it is regarded as an advance position to observe Iran and Turkey.
However, the bulk of information had been unfolded and the governments can no longer bury their heads in the sand or ignore the danger of Israeli penetration in Iraq. This is a crucial issue which requires a clear position and practical measures of the forthcoming Arab summit to be abided by all.
In a nutshell, Israel has covered half the way towards its goals in Iraq but it still needs Arab silence to cover the remaining half. This will place the coming Arab summit before two options, either confronting the imminent danger to all through accountability and full boycott or direct or indirect collusion which would, by the end of the day, lead to tightening the grip or control on Iraq as a prelude to reaching for the others.
The latest of such schemes has been a project comprising the regions included by a rift and a unified geological pattern from Turkey to South Africa comprising the Arab countries overlooking the Red Sea, then African countries related to the same geological pattern like Ethiopia, Kenya, Eritrea and a number of other countries as far as other southern countries under the pretext of persecution of their natural and cultural traits, a slogan which can hardly be argued against.
Israel is trying to hold other meetings to make use of their recommendations to get the UNESCO's official approval of its malicious scheme, but Egypt and a number of other Arab and Islamic countries are coordinating for hitting the Zionist scheme, which has been highlighted by Arab Archeologists Union in the Arab League.
Since Israel will ever be Israel always trying to threaten Egypt and Arab national security, it started to disseminate its previous ideas through a new project giving it access to all sites in several countries especially the upper reaches of the Nile without the least objection, but even with every kind of support as what it was doing was under the UNESCO cover thus including Israeli action as attempts to preserve heritage, for which it should be given credit!
Israeli Coordination with Jordan Such a crime was introduced by Israel at first in coordination with or rather through deceiving Jordan. It was suggested that an application for including the Jordan Valley be submitted by Israel in its capacity as project initiator and to be supported by Jordan.
Again, Egypt's delegate and some of his colleagues wised up to the hidden intention of Israel's delegate.
Israel managed to bring non-Arab countries that may, nonetheless, affect Arab national security like Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Eritrea. The meeting wound up with recommendations that uncovered Zionist ambitions to create a new entity ensuring normal access into those countries together with the cancellation of scientific research and preservation of the international heritage.
3-Setting an integrated regional work plan between Israel and those countries and presenting it to the International Heritage Centre, together with a unified list of the sites that can be included on the international list.
7-Looking for strategies to prove the rift's character as a natural and cultural unit and ensuring legal protection for that concept.
In coordination with the AL and Arab countries delegates to the UNESCO, they uncovered the danger of such a Zionist project in the context of an Israeli attempt to publicly effect a cultural and environmental penetration and threatening Arab national security in general.

He added that France would contribute to this program by providing technical assistance through sending consultants and offering training scholarships according to the needs of this program, noting that Egypt would contribute 300 million pounds to the program over 6 years.

The member, who preferred to be anonymous, added that by way of compensation the American side showed readiness to offer more customs exemptions to Egypt's exports after the failure of the preliminary negotiations of establishing a free trade zone between the two countries, which can be resumed by 2007. Every year, the United States chooses some countries to hold negotiations with them over the establishment of free zones, he said, pointing out that Egypt can only involve in such negotiations after 3 years.

For his part, head of the consortium said that all survey and design works as well as line courses and contracts for delivery of all equipment have been completed as a prelude to starting actual work of such a giant project.
This came following a decision taken by Minister of Foreign Trade and Industry Rashid Mohamed Rashid on Thursday regarding stopping imposition of anti-dumping charges on reinforcing iron imported from Ukraine and Russia. President of Port Said National Steel Company Ragab Al-Borini welcomed the decision but called for the cancellation of the customs duties imposed on billet, too.
In this respect, Ayad Steel factory owner Wanis Ayad stressed the importance of canceling customs duties on billet. This decision differentiated between users of billet and scraps in production.
This will be an attempt to alleviate burdens shouldered by this industry, he said.
Meanwhile, others criticized the decision considering it ineffective in light of importing small quantities of rebar from Ukraine and Turkey, confirming that there is no monopoly on the market in addition to the rise of imported billet, the raw material for producing reinforcing bars.
Qassim criticized iron and cement companies for raising prices unjustifiably, which threatens the market and affects consumers. They pointed out that prices hikes happened in Egypt only every five or six years.
On the other hand, deputy head of the division Al-Sayed Atris said that rebar is being sold in Egypt with low prices in comparison with overseas prices, especially as the price of exported rebar hit 490 dollars per ton and imported by 500 dollars per ton.
It is difficult to forecast the impact of the decision for the time being, he said, calling for not restricting the freedom of companies on the market and buttressing competitiveness to put an end to monopoly which is being supported by strong parties.
Head of Customs Department Mahfouz Al-Argawi said that no change will affect the customs tariffs on cars till 2010, as Egypt is committed to fulfill its commitments towards the World Trade Organization (WTO) that granted Egypt facilities till that date. The customs tariffs on cars depend on their engine capacities.
Hesham Abdel-Hamid, 22 years old, have been working as a policeman for 12 years before he decided, following the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime, to return to university.
Mosul inhabitants know well the 'disco detention camp' and its American torturers," he said.
After Hesham had found no way out, he decided to tip off the Americans, believing that detention will deter his colleague. Ahmed was trapped and detained.
This was the approach adopted in interrogating detainees.
Didn't you know that I was a White House guard?'
The prison stories are many and disgusting.
Hesham bitterly narrated how homosexual soldiers called some detainees to practise perversion with them. The soldiers turned up music very loudly so that the prisoners' cries could not be heard when they are beaten.
But, I was taken aback by a heinous unimaginable world. The Americans practise torture simply. Interrogators from the FBI or other bodies urge jailers to use excessive cruelty even after investigating detainees."
A Shiite source said, "Sadr is sure that the US forces want to break into Najaf and Kerbala and he says that they would, thus, enter the lion's den." The occupation, Sadr says, wants to control the wealth of the religious hawza (seminar of Shiite law college), which it collects from the Khomos (fifth) and other alms. He, however, said that the Shiites would play the same role they played in the 1920 Revolution led by Imam Ahmed Sadr, grandfather of young Imam Muqtada Sadr. The revolution killed 100,000 British troops including 80,000 Indians who were recruited in the British Army.
The Israelis played a dirty game in Iraq, by purchasing real estate at tempting prices without declaring their identities. Nonetheless, resistance groups discovered that trick and might have implemented many operations against them, particularly as unprecedented US alert was declared following the execution of some military operations.
Prior to the war, the American Administration categorically refused to regard Iraq as an independent country that should be dealt with within the framework of international standards and laws regardless of the nature of its ruling regime.
The Iraqi state was, therefore, dismantled, as if it had never existed and as if the Iraqi people had no history.
In that case, too, it would be possible to redeem honour to the detainees and to compensate them.
The practices that had emerged in detention camps in Iraq cannot be attributed to some perverts or sadists who secretly practise their perversion.
Nor did such practices occur because the Americans wanted to humiliate or demoralize the Iraqis within the framework of the military confrontation.
KUWAIT CONCERNED OVER IRANIAN SPONSORSHIP FOR SHIITE PARTIES' MEETINGS Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry summoned Iranian embassy charge d' affaires Abul-Kassim Al-Sha'shaei to a meeting with the Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry's undersecretary Khalid Soliman Al-Garallah who expressed his country's protest against and concern over the meetings held between Kuwaiti parties and a representative of Iranian government in Iranian embassy.
It touched on holding three meetings in the Iranian ambassador's house and the house of a former deputy in the alliance. An agreement was reached to support Khaminie and Hizbullah trend.
"Six Syrian projects in the fields of threads, jeans, salt, olive oil, food processing, cement and a commercial complex will be put up by the Syrian party," sources in the forum said.
HIZBULLAH'S MUNICIPALITY SLATES WIN IS MESSAGE TO AMERICANS CONFIRMING ITS POPULARITY
Some milieus deduced that Baath's alliance with Hizbullah represented a Syrian political approach to the parliament's speaker, Nabih Berri, leader of Amal movement. Sources allied to Damascus said that some authorities attribute such a tendency to Syria which wanted to bring about a coordination between the two parties. If this, however, proved too difficult to attain, any campaign against Hizbullah that could be made use of by its enemies especially the USA could, then, be avoided.
Some members of George Bush administration think that Syria has centrifuges that could be used in enriching uranium to be used in producing bombs, even though intelligence bodies have different opinions on such a case, said some diplomats and experts. These remarks were made a few hours after US Assistant Secretary of State Richard Armitage had said that the sanctions that Washington's threats to impose sanctions on Syria were "inevitable" and would likely to be enforced in the current month. "This is going to happen soon. It is inevitable," Armitage said in an interview with the US Arabic-speaking Al-Horra TV channel.
"In view of the type of revealed intelligence in Iraq, people now are worried about the US intelligence about other countries," said a Western diplomat who is close to the International Atomic Energy Agency.

Quoting Assad, Mostafa said, "So long as you are Syrians you do not need to be invited as the family members cannot be invited to their own home."
Ambassador Mostafa who does not discriminate between a Jew, Muslim or Christian pointed out that the Syrian leadership regarded Syria Jews as Syrian expatriates as sons as its sons in the diaspora as long as they had good intentions for their country.
Following negotiations with the Syrian leadership which said, "We need not be consulted so long as they are Syrians," arrangements started so that the delegation visit to Damascus might be made as Syria's doors are wide open to all its children."
AMENDMENTS IN SAUDI NATIONALITY LAW
The Shura Council members unanimously agreed on withdrawing the nationality of a naturalized person who commits an offense that might jeopardize the state's security.
The step reflects Ikhwan's efforts to push female candidates in the coming parliamentary elections in 2006.
During the October 2002 parliamentary elections, the Salafis supported women's vote but they were opposed to women's right to candidature. However, Islamic Shiite factions are not opposed to women's vote or candidature whether in public elections or political institutions.
He was optimistic that the parliament would introduce constitutional amendments that could bring Al-Wifaq closer as a prelude to running elections after two years and a half in a way that would, according to him, bolster political and Islamic cooperation between the two parties.
Will those Arab leaders remember that according to Bush's promise to them in the Roadmap and in his meetings with them, a Palestinian state should be set up in 2005 following a series of procedures provided for by the map, but so far only some requirements of the Palestinians were met? Although 2005 has become in the offing, there is not the least hope in any procedures on the road of political negotiations.
Sharon continues amending the bases of the political operation in the Arab-Israeli conflict under the umbrella of the map and the dust of the Likud's majority rejection of the withdrawal from Gaza Strip and the dismantlement of its settlements. He is doing all that in complete coordination with the American Administration in light of Bush's excuses for his army violations in Abu-Ghraib prison as well as other regions in Iraq and within the framework of an organized information campaign to cover up for an audacious policy which has led to further Iraqi unity against occupation.
Such frivolities can be attributed only to Arab submission, fear of Washington and acceptance of all its maneuvers to deceive Arab public opinion.
JORDANIAN TRADERS RESORT TO HAIFA PORT TO IMPORT VEHICLES
The free zone at Al-Zarkaa City resumed its work after a state of standstill it witnessed last month owing to the political turmoil in Iraq especially in Falluja.

Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry undersecretary Khalid Jarallah expressed Kuwait's dissatisfaction at the meetings held between Kuwaiti parties and the Iranian government envoy to Al-Sha'shai. Furthermore, he asked for clarification from Iranian authorities for those contacts seen by Kuwait as doing harm to bilateral friendly relations.
"We categorically deny such allegations because success in any elections can only be secured through sincere positions and public support," it said. Failure of NIA's candidates in the latest elections came as a natural result for mobilizing corrupt and antidemocratic forces by opponents, it added.
TEHRAN: ENDORSEMENT OF ANTI-TORTURE LAW
The reformist parliament had failed to pass most of the laws which it had endorsed because they were rejected by the Constitution Guardianship Council which consisted of 12 conservatives. Foremost of such laws is one that clearly defines "political crime" and another law that limits the powers of the Constitution Guardianship Council to ban the candidature of some people for the elections under the pretext that they were ineligible for candidature.

Most Egyptian business organizations are reconsidering economic cooperation with the US in solidarity with public anger against the American policy in the region. This anger reached its peak due to the practices of the US military in Iraq and the imposition of unjustified economic sanctions on Syria.
Economic sources told Al-Hayat that the strategic dialogue which was expected to be held last month under Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher and US Secretary of State Colin Powell has been indefinitely postponed. Egypt wouldn't insist on holding such a meeting out of conviction that any rapprochement for the time being would be futile, i.e. Egypt would concentrate in the coming period on moving political, rather than economic, issues with the US, the sources added.
The free zone is far A prominent head of an Egyptian business organization said that a joint free trade zone wouldn't be established soon as Egypt turned down American barter deals in several fields. The US said that agreements take time for negotiation and that what is more important is the two sides' political will to push forward commercial exchange and facilitate transportation of commodities, which means that the free trade zone would not be discussed for another two years at least, if the situation was normal. But, submitting this issue within the framework of a political plan to be enforced by the US Administration means that negotiations on the free trade zone would indefinitely be postponed.
The Irish ambassador whose country is heading the current round of the EU said that the new spirit of cooperation between Egypt and the EU comes within a program for building mutual trust aims at providing job opportunities and raising the standard of living.

ISRAELI CONCERNS OVER INDIAN CONGRESS PARTY RETURN TO POWER
However, the political milieus argue that India under Sonia Gandhi might adopt the "Turkish model" in its relations with Israel, hence its maintenance of strategic alliance with Israel.

They said, "We cannot accept any fragmenting of the cause.

FROM AL-SHOUNA TO RAFAH
The first of such illusions emerges quite disgustingly as an attempt to impose such concepts on the Middle East due to prospective premises, which can by no means be denied as all peoples are looking forward to a better life, peace, development and more feasible exploitation of resources.
In the course of time those fora turned into chances for beautifying the image of American policies for all their errors, follies, fanaticism, prejudices and the deviations committed by America's soldiers in exercising torture or rather for all their contradictions to the Davos spirit or even the realism of businesslike minds.
All this notwithstanding, the Israeli delegation was invited and would be cordially welcomed and would explain what force majeure forced the Israelis to destroy. They would also defend devastation before an audience who was supposed to come to bolster the value of construction.
It is uncertain that the forum audience are aware of the contradictions between what they came to do and what is already being done.
EGYPTIAN BANKS HAVE RESERVATIONS ABOUT ENTERING IRAQI MARKET FOR THE TIME BEING
While Egyptian banks showed reservations about entering the Iraqi market, some Egyptian investors working in Iraq asked banks not to refrain from the Iraqi market especially as it is a promising one that would witness a state of big boom after the elections are held next January.
Some banks said that the construction of Iraq needed years and it is not necessary to enter now. We have to wait until conditions stabilize because the risks now are too high and most companies operating in Iraq started to suspend their activity and withdraw its labour after several of its personnel were kidnapped. For example, a Saudi company, as well as a Jordanian one stopped their activities.

EGYPT'S MESSAGE TO THE SUMMIT REACHED ALL PARTIES ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE FINAL STATEMENT
Some may not mind foreign military protection being extended to them and to their peoples to avoid problems or emergencies.
The NATO Secretary General once contacted the Egyptian authorities offering to visit Cairo.
He tried to explain that the NATO terms of reference had expanded and that it had a political role, but the reply was the same!
Due to all those facts, Egypt thought to put up its vision, in Tunis summit, regarding the Arab world's dealing with international parties about the reform initiatives in which those parties claimed that they were interested.
All arguments were presented and all views were quite freely explained.
When Ahmed Mahir wondered if that matter had not been settled the day before, two ministers from two neighbouring countries said, "A further study will do no harm".
The argument went on for so long that the summit meeting was delayed for over two hours, which made the current summit chairman president Zein Al Abedin Bin Ali say, " All papers that came late should be excluded from the final statement."
Although many Arab leaders approved of Mubarak's proposal, the summit Tunisia presidency decided to put it aside and be content with items agreed upon during the summit preparation.
All foreign ministries without exception were convinced of the purport of President Mubarak's proposal to the effect that the Arab identity should be preserved and the Arab League institutions, especially the Arab League Council, should be the appropriate place where Arabs could negotiate and coordinate all their affairs, Maher said.
AL-BAZ ADVISES BUSH TO TENDER HIS RESIGNATION
EFFORTS TO GIVE EGYPT SECURITY ROLE IN GAZA STRIP
Europe believes that this role is a solution to the Israeli purported problem that the Palestinian Security bodies would fail to curb violence. Due to its good relations with the Palestinian Authority and opposition factions (Hamas, Jihad, Fatah, and Al-Aqsa Battalions), Egypt would be able to ensure calm.
Israeli officials justified such operations saying, "Israel is forced to impose security there (in Gaza Strip) and curb weapon and drug smuggling, after Egypt had refused to undertake such a task."
However, Dahlan categorically denied, in a phone call with Asarq Al-Awsat, any contacts with the Israelis.
Abu Zeid said, "Ethiopia and Uganda undoubtedly emphasized that there were no projects that might prejudice Sudan and Egypt's interests, either with the participation of Israel or any other country."
Egypt's annual quota of the River Nile, amounting to 55.5 billion cubic meters, can not be reduced, Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Dr. Mahmoud Abu Zeid said.

They said that the market is currently averse to any interest rate rise but needs some measures to reduce it with a view to boosting investment they added, urging a reduction of interest rates.
Investors emphasized that raising bank interest rates would urge them to stop dealing with the banking apparatus as they already suffer from the current interest rates which amounts to 12% and may rise to 18% according to the repayment period, in addition to exaggerations in the commissions charged by banks from borrowers. Every month 1% is paid as commission for the highest debit balance thus taking dealings up to 1.2% of the loan total every year, besides the correspondence and feasibility studies which banks prefer to do themselves to check how serious the project is, which raises interest rates actually to 20%.
The stability witnessed by foreign exchange market in Egypt and the retreat in black market dealings to an unprecedented levels even prior to the implementation of the rates of exchange deregulation policy in addition to the continuation of the dollarization phenomenon in Egyptian banks or rather investors high demand for saving in the dollar or other foreign currencies instead of the Egyptian pound. The rate of dollarization phenomenon exceeds 26% of total deposits. Added to that, the best remedy to the current rise in inflation rates is represented in raising interest rates, which would lead to a strong rise in the citizen's purchase and a relative stability of prices.
He pointed out that over a period of almost one year on end the majority of banks did not raise their interest rates despite the CBE bias towards that move. Some banks even reduced interest rates on their deposits due perhaps to the cash liquidity rise with most banks because of poor credit operations during the period that followed the faltering problem. The government, consequently, has to study the reality of the banking market and take the decisions that could put things right rather than complicate matters.
At a time when banks were about to reduce the interest rate on deposits, which ranges now between 7-9% at most, a shocking decision was taken by the National Bank of Egypt (NBE) and Banque Misr to put up new saving coffers with a fixed annual interest rate of 12%.
The reason for the decision was due to the fact that banks did not respond to the Central Bank's tendency to increase the interest rate through the treasury bills it put up over the last period at an interest rate of about 15% so as to increase profits through the differential between the interest rate on treasury bills and that on deposits which still ranges between 7% and 9%.
He described it as "Egypt's Riviera" pointing out that its potential is not less than that of Taba, Sharm El-Sheikh and Red Sea.

SAUDI FATWA PROHIBITS WATCHING AL-JAZEERA
Never has the Gulf dream especially the Kuwaiti one to have a new Iraq that does not pose a threat to the neighbouring countries security after Saddam's fall seem so far fetched as it does today in light of the escalating tension in Iraq and the obscurity of the political scene.
The scenarios of Iraq's future and its repercussions on neighbouring countries especially Kuwait have been defined by Dr. Mohamed Al-Said Idris, head of the Gulf Studies Section with Al-Ahram Centre for Political and Strategic Studies, Dr. Moahmed Al-Said Idris in three basic scenarios, - A scene of American victory and success of the Kuwaiti bet relying on the occupation's success in confronting all security and political challenges in Iraq and therefore getting down to building a democratic Iraq, which represents a threat to Gulf States security because turning Iraq into an American protectorate means the establishment of distinguished relations between it and Israel, which represents a regional and Arab setback in the long run.
IGC CHAIRMAN: WE WON'T ACCEPT INCOMPLETE SOVEREIGNTY
Did you, as a council, find out the reality of such sovereignty?
A: I think there is a misunderstanding especially when the American Secretary of State Colin Powell talked about incomplete sovereignty.
Our security conditions, nevertheless, which is currently and obviously unstable, make us in need of the presence of international forces, for which we wish more extensive contribution.
I think that one of our top priorities is to develop the skills and capabilities of our national security. We should also know that security could be achieved when security men are Iraqis talking the same language and sharing the people its feelings and sympathies. They should also be able to get intelligence information.
Neither as a governing council nor Mr Lakhdar Ibrahimi nor the coalition authority nor the American President's envoy, Robert Blackwell has finally put up any names as the matter is still subject to discussion. In the next couple of weeks, efforts to form the government will be over and the next stage will, consequently, be extremely critical. There are no definite names but I for Iraq's President or the cabinet's premiership or even membership.
Q: Some people put up your name for governing Iraq?
Q: What would happen if the Kurds insisted on their position?
A: The Governing Council will, unprecedentedly, do a good job. We're going to hand power over optionally to the next transitional government.

The consultations held by UN Secretary General envoy to Iraq Lakhdar Brahimi which are supposed to lead to an announcement of an Iraqi government in a few days' time, coincide with expectations that are taking shape of the personalities that would undertake responsibility during the second transitional period in the post-Saddam Hussein Iraq.
An agreement on the distribution of positions to factions and nationalities is still hampered by a Kurdish demand of the president's position. Lakhdar Brahimi is still canvassing Baghdad to check the opinion of political forces, etc to reach a formula for the presidency and the premiership, which seem to be still subject to Kurdish protest.
Mahdi Al-Hafiz may well meet most conditions as the Sunnites would not mind his appointment because he belongs to the independent democratic grouping headed by Al-Pachachi and is also a Shiite from the South.

IN IRAQ: THE ARABS LOSE WHILE IRAN WINS!
It benefited from the Saddam Hussein regime audacity and now is picking the fruit of American awkwardness.
The Iranian win started once the American administration and the Pentagon hawks were tempted to regard Iraq a chance to retaliate for such attacks.
Iran could have worried about the establishment of a pro-US Iraqi regime.
The costs of the Iraqi adventure do not encourage the current or the next administration to repeat the experiment on another court.
Even if Iraq was destined to face a bloody chaos, Iran would be the most capable of co-taking advantage of existing situation.
Balances were disrupted inside the Iranian-Iraqi-Turkish triangle.
The Arabs lose in Iraq while Iran wins.

He said the conditions in Egypt reached a state of weakness. He stressed the necessity of achieving a real development so that Egypt would take its appropriate status regionally and internationally. It became a strong demand to launch a real reform process in all fields and choose people characterized with seriousness and credibility away from the spirit of prehensile resourcefulness which afflicted some people known for honesty and transparency.
Diplomats, former ministers, lawyers, professors and thinkers are considering how to lay down regulations for the declaration. These regulations would ensure acting from within the ruling regime and not opposing it so as to move stagnant water without blaming certain people or bodies. Rather, steps should be taken so that Egypt could restore its regional and international position. Internal conditions should be analyzed and advice should be offered to all.
Egypt supports the Palestinians not only in the security field but also in all fields, said the source. Security, agricultural, economic and administrative experts would be sent to Palestine.
The source denied Egyptian mediation for moving Arafat from the West Bank to Gaza, saying, "This is not true. We had talks with the Israelis over the necessity to give Arafat full freedom of movement in the West Bank and Gaza." Arafat should not move to Gaza without Israeli guarantees so that Gaza would not be the last station and non-return to the West Bank, added the source.
The security issue has to do with the issue of reforms which the PA should take into account.
Al-Zuheiri was supposed to be investigated today to examine the issue of extending his custody together with 32 others who spent a month in remand custody.
The Ikhwan bloc deputies in the parliament asked the council to conduct an urgent investigation within the framework of its terms of reference in the incidents and circumstances concomitant with the arrest of the defendants in the case and their exposition to torture and negligence, thus leading to the death of Eng.
Furthermore, Ikhwanite sources said that Central Security as well as special forces besieged Mit Al-Kholi village in Al-Zarqa town, Damietta governorate to prevent the arrival of any of Al-Zuheiri's relatives or friends to offer condolences to his family.
The proposed amendment retains the 50% rate for workers and farmers of party slate candidates. Elections would be held according to original and reserve slates so that reserve members would occupy the seats that fall vacant during the parliamentary session.
The sources said that the distribution of parliamentary seats among all governorates would be subjected to careful calculations.
All statistics pointed out that individual elections have not for long constituted an element of attraction to the Egyptian voter to practise his right in selecting this representatives in the parliament.
Egypt stipulates establishing full normalized diplomatic relations before receiving Iranian pilgrims coming to visit Alul-Bait (prophet's family) shrines spread in many Egyptian cities.
The source added that the two sides are currently focusing on pushing up economic and commercial relations rather than normalizing diplomatic relations.
Ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) Secretary General and Minister of Information Safwat Al-Sherif has put an end to speculations about both the timing and the size of the cabinet reshuffle in Egypt. He denied the party or any official leaking particular names for key positions nominations in the next reshuffle.
National newspapers and magazines chief editors close to decision-making circles have recently expatiated on a forthcoming large scale reshuffle and criticized the situation in light of the presence of ministers and officials they branded as "resourceful and smart".
He said that such meetings would continue in the next few days to discuss the details of several issues including political reform.
In a symposium on the future of water in light of global variables, held in Saad Zaghloul Cultural Centre on Thursday, Abu Zeid pointed out that the presence of such a number of Israeli experts was not threat to Egypt. "Egypt is stronger than Israel in terms of water expertise. Pakistan asked Egypt to provide it with Egyptian expertise in irrigation projects.
This came in response to an urgent query submitted to the parliament by Muslim Brotherhood deputy Hamdi Hassan in which he quoted the family of Egyptian scientist Mohamed Abdel Moneim Al-Azmirli as saying that the latter was assassinated inside a prison near Baghdad.
He was also listed among the wanted within the occupation forces search for weapons of mass destruction and Iraqi scientists.
The deputy asked Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher to disclose before the PA the actions taken by the Egyptian Foreign Ministry to defend the Egyptians in Iraq, particularly scientists. He is also required to reveal the ways and means of bringing to account the US forces accused of torturing the Egyptian scientist to death.
Taking any step towards the preparation of certain reform demands and referring them to the government will be useless in case of a cabinet reshuffle. It is better to wait and see whether the talk about the reshuffle is real or mere talk to reassure citizens in such a perplexed situation, the sources added.
POLITICIANS ABOVE THE AGE OF 70 RULE... AND OPPOSE TOO
Opposition and government men compete with each other for setting records in staying in their positions for long years and assigning old people to leading positions.
The first was presented by Nasserite MP Hamdin Sabbahi (49) who desires to found Al-Karama Al-Arabiya (Arab Dignity) Party after he left the Nasserite Party led by Dia'eddin Dawoud who was born in 1926.
Therefore, Prime Minister Atef Ebeid seems to be relatively young, as he was born in 1932.
Information Minister Safwat Al-Sherif and Minister of Wakfs (Endowments) Mahmoud Hamdi Zaqzouq were born in 1933.
Minister of Local Development Mustafa Abdel-Qader was born in 1940.
Minister of Youth and Sports Dr. Ali Eddin Helal was born in 1944. Health Minister Dr. Mohamed Awad Tag Eddin was born in 1945
The MPs, namely Abdel-Mon'em Al-Oleimi, Al-Badri Farghali, and Dr Hamdi Hassan, said that the draft law would offset with the burdens imposed on the low income people, especially civil servants and public sector employees. The draft law will also put an end to the rich enjoying of the same indirect subsidy directed to the poor, which causes disorder in the social structure.
The MPs revealed that they did not handle in detail the categories of the proposed charges and taxes, pointing out that that would be determined after deliberations inside the parliament, discussions with businessmen MPs, 42 in number, and consultations with the Finance Minister.
In continuation of the state of instability currently undergone by the opposition Al-Wafd Party, two leading figures, namely head of the party's Water Resources and Irrigation Committee Dr. Ahmed Abdel-Khaliq Ashennawi and rapporteur of the Economic Committee with the party's higher authority Mostafa Annasharti, split after they had tendered their explained resignations to the party leader Dr. No'man Gomaa.
They pointed out a state of "liquidating opponents" inside the party.
A number of the current leaderships will announce their resignations from the current party and will join the new party, Ashennawi added.
The deputy said that the book contained phrases that obviously offend Egypt and its peoples.
Everybody in the street acts at will!
Girls in your country also enjoy the same rights as boys.
Spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) parliamentary bloc broadsided the government and accused it of turning life into a hell and meeting the needs of the well-to-do rather than the poor.
"The continuation of such a situation contributes to spreading hatred and crime among social classes and affects negatively the Egyptians' feelings of belongingness."
Egypt's mosques and churches pray that Victor would be set free and return home safely, he said.
Their concerns are particularly attributed to the fact that the USA's imports of Egyptian products of this sector (yarn, textile, ready-made clothes and household linen) reached, according to the quota system, about 535 million dollars in 2003 out of 1.37 billion dollars worth of Egypt's total exports, i.e. more than half the value of exports.
NEW BANKS RAISE INTEREST RATES!
The bank also raised interest rates on three, four and five year-term saving certificates with cumulative interest to 12% cashed at the end of each certificate term. A few days ago, the bank obtained the approval of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) of the issuance of that certificate. It was then approved by CBE board of directors in its last meeting and notified its branches of putting it into effect as of tomorrow (September 1st).
She pointed out that the bank currently owns another 5-year term certificate with a monthly interest rate of 10.25%. On the other hand, Al-Alam Al-Youm, learnt that there are other several other banks which are about to raise their interest rates on some of their savings coffers especially saving certificates after getting the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) approval.
For her part, Shahinaz pointed out that there should be no link between the low Interbank rates and the rise in internet rates on saving certificates emphasizing that the market was "not merely saving certificates", but an integrated system controlled by the cost of funds with each bank.
EGYPT'S SHARE OF INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL FLOWS DOWN 48%
Some Islamic countries have cash surplus estimated at $1 trillion invested in Western countries while inter-Arab investments reached only 10%, Omar noted. Egypt has a chance to increase its quota of international capital flows through offering guarantees to investors via a third international party, carrying out items of contracts concluded with domestic companies, reforming the monetary system regarding exchange rates, putting an end to corruption to reduce illegal expenses and bringing to an end all harmful practices of competition such as monopoly.
DELTA INTERNATIONAL BANK RAISES INTEREST RATE TO 12.25%
Detla International Bank certificates term hit three years at annual revenue cashed every three months. Under the guarantee of the certificates a loan amounting to 90% of their value is allowable.
He pointed out that the contribution of Gas De France to the gas sector was not confined to the 5% represented by that deal. He emphasized the company's intention to develop its contribution to the Egyptian gas sector so that it would cover not only getting Egyptian gas and exporting it abroad but also achieving other goals like the transfer of technology employed in that sector as well as training labour and other investment aspects which can be activated in that sector.
Regarding the countries which show the highest demand for buying Egyptian gas, besides France, he places America, Italy and Spain in the forefront of the countries expected to conclude future deals in the field of Egyptian gas exports.
She pointed out that preparations were underway for the second stage Train-2 and regarding the possibility of Egyptian banks contributing to the gas projects, Delta International Bank Board Chairman Ali Negm says that gas projects are giant ones that need syndicated loans contributed to by more than one bank.
Fayed pointed out that banks' demand for contributing to financing gas projects was also attributed to the fact that the rate of credit risks were reasonable in financing that industry.
In cooperation with a group of Egyptian investors, Egyptian and foreign banks are considering heading for the Libyan market to invest in it in a few days' time.
United Bank of Egypt board chairman, Hassan Hussein who doubles as Managing Director uncovered that a delegation of Egyptian businessmen and investors would visit the Libyan capital Tripoli next October. The delegation comprises a group of investors in cement, real estate development, contracting and petroleum. He pointed out that the Libyan party took interest in Egyptian contribution to development and investment.
He emphasized that the Egyptian banks opting for the Libyan market had its effects on investors' milieus concerned with investment in Arab countries. Some companies had expressed willingness to contribute to projects, which are economically feasible.
He highlighted the importance of the Egyptian banks in the Libyan market for the evaluation, study and marketing of projects.
He announced intentions to expand in the Libyan market through opening a new branch for the bank where the Libyan government would contribute about 24% of the capital.
Among these banks are Suez Canal Bank, a private bank, other investment banks, in addition to two state-owned banks, the National Bank of Egypt (NBE) and Banque Misr.
While the banks that launched new saving coffers monitored a remarkable demand for them, confirming intentions to expand investment in the sectors of natural gas, fertilizers, energy, information technology and communications, most other banks showed reservations concerning such a step ruling out the possibility of following suit, but admitting, in the meantime, to its state of bewilderment and wait in light of the ambiguity regarding interest rate orientations. This meaning has been emphasized by board chairman of Misr-Iran Bank and former CBE governor Ismail Hassan when he said that due to ambiguity of the interest rate situation, a sound credit and investment decision is rather difficult to take. While the CBE is giving indices of price stability, the Ministry of Finance is raising the interest rate on treasury bonds and sometimes the reverse takes place. He pointed out that the state of fluctuation and contradiction extended to all the banking sector's units as some banks have recently tended to reduce interest rates in an attempt to reduce the cost of its funds and avoid bearing the burdens ensuing from the high liquidity rate.
For her part, CIB managing director Sahar Al Sallab expected such a step. She expected that interest rates whether in public or private banks would witness more or less general rises in accordance with the prices of treasury bonds put forward by the Ministry of Finance. She pointed out that the CIB resorted to moving its interest rates by .05% in a bid to better employment of its available liquidity and to create a balance between investment in treasury bonds and granting distinguished interest rates to clients. She supposed that such a step would help borrowers cope with a similar increase in lending rates.
FIRST ARAB ECONOMIC BLOC INCLUDING EGYPT, SYRIA, MOROCCO, KUWAIT
US DOLLAR SALE FEVER SWEEPS BANKING MARKET

$488.9 MILLION FREE ZONES EXPORTS
A government official revealed a sharp retreat in the Egyptian cotton exports during the season that ended on August 29.
Cotton exports were high in the last season due to the availability of huge quantities of cotton with companies over the previous years as well as the low cotton supply on international markets, especially after the weakness of the Indian cotton crop.
This indicates a rise in the steady trade balance deficit to reach LE5.403 billion as a differential between imports worth $12.807 billion and exports to the value of $7.404 billion.
Despite the rise in the exports of some commodities, the value of many of them after the rise remained limited. The value of peanuts exports reached $1.2 million in the 9 months; dried onion, $1.4 million; preserved and dried vegetables, $1.7 million; potatoes, $3.8 million; medical herbs, $4 million; aromatic oils $5.1 million and
This sector's exports during the period January-May last amounted to 508 million dollars against 414 million dollars during the corresponding period in 2003, up 23%.

Meanwhile Cairo Paribas Bank announced putting up a new saving certificates at an interest rate of 12% with a 3-year term and a steady interest cashed every month.
Lending prices between banks (Interbank) went down yesterday to their lowest rate recording ever 0.25%. This decline was ascribed by the Egyptian Watani Bank international transactions director Mohamed Rustom to the end of the reserve rates and controlling bank liquidity, when Interbank rates usually reach their lowest. Such a decline, however, was due to the remarkable increase in domestic currency liquidity on the banking market at higher rates than the normal recent rates.
BANKS' SHARE OF TREASURY BONDS HITS 58.6 BILLION POUNDS
Egypt's share of international capital flows retreated by $171 million, or 48%, while net flows reached $353 million last year to retreat to $182 million this year.
Saving rates in Egypt do not exceed 15%, professor of Islamic Economy at Al-Azhar University Abdel Hamid Ghazali said, noting the difficulty in doing without international funds during the current period, asking for reliance on inter-Arab investments in the future to do without international funding gradually.
Yesterday, Delta International Bank joined the list of banks, which decided to raise their interest rates on saving certificates.
BANKS VIE FOR INVESTING IN GAS SECTOR A growing interest has been recently taken in the gas sector by banks in particular and by investors in general.
He also pointed out that 20% of the world's imports of Egyptian gas are carried out through Gas De France company, which justifies, the French banks interest in financing petroleum and gas investment projects. In the forefront of such banks comes the National Societe Generale Bank. He added that the biggest banks in the world compete for winning opportunities of participation in investment in Egyptian gas sector.
Misr International Bank director Hala Fayiq says that Egypt had recently witnessed the biggest two projects for the liquefaction of Egyptian gas, the first one by British Gas, the biggest contributor to it, besides the project of Malaysian Petronas company and the second is C-Gas project in cooperation with Union Fenosa company.
One bank takes the lead in financing those projects in coordination with other banks. Negm pointed out Delta International Bank contribution to similar projects like that of fertilizers at Abu Qir the contract of which had been recently signed with Misr International Bank (MIBank). Negm emphasized Delta International Bank readiness to contribute to financing gas projects in the future if it was invited to do so and after a feasibility study is done for the project and after making sure that there was a financial surplus allowing contribution to such enormous projects.
Deputy Director of the National Societe Generale Bank, Abdel-Mohsen Al-Simari says that investment in the gas sector is one of the most rewarding of investment fields whether that investment was direct or through the bank entering into syndicated loans. He emphasized the feasibility of investments in the gas sector as a promising sector that represents no risk at all, which explains his call for Egyptian banks to take interest in investment in gas sector.
The group included United Bank of Egypt, Commercial International Bank (CIB)-Egypt, Arab Banking Corporation (ABC) and American G.BB Morgan Chase.
Egyptian banks hold meetings with their Libyan counterparts to discuss aspects of cooperation, available opportunities, financing potential, nature of projects as well as means of presence there.
In reply to a question on the political dimension behind the Egyptian banks' orientation, especially as the ban was lifted on the Libyan market, Hussein said it was a banking option which had nothing to do with politics especially regarding laying down Egyptian investments there and cooperation with Libyan investment companies.
Executive head of Arab Banking Corporation (ABC-Egypt) Tarik Helmi uncovered the bank's desire to enhance its presence or representation by spreading new branches on the Libyan market especially as the Libyan government contributes to the corporation's capital.
Deputy board chairman of CIB (Egypt) Sahar Al Sallab, who doubles as managing director said that some Egyptian banks were studying the Libyan market and its investment opportunities as well as the suitable means of getting access especially regarding petroleum and construction pointing out the CIB study of the Libyan market.
The competing banks have to sell such certificates to individuals and natural persons, rather than funds or corporations.
Some other banks, however, raised interest rates in a bid to attract further funds. He added that he preferred deliberation in taking the decision of raising interest rates to ascertain whether the CBE would carry on with its policy of expansion in drawing liquidity or that was a temporary state. He expected the state of wait to continue for sometime to avoid enormous burdens that might negatively affect the bank annual revenues and consequently net profits.
She thinks that the launch of new saving coffers would encourage many hesitant banks especially private ones to increase interest rates to avoid withdrawal operations in favour of the new coffers, and in a bid to expand their quota of liquidity available on the market.
The first Arab economic bloc, including Egypt, Syria, Morocco and Kuwait, will be announced soon and will include Arab economic cooperative organizations later on.

Advocates of the first trend oppose the idea of reform and change and seek to promote an idea that reform is considered a response to external demands, especially American ones.
Observers see that the enormous articles on reform and change written by chief editors and published recently in major national papers were test balloons for causing controversy in the Egyptian street to poll opinions of political and cultural elite and sort out attitudes and take them into account when reaching a final view on reform steps and the nature of change.

The sources uncovered that law professors and experts in law and the Constitution participate in reviewing the bill prior to putting it up for public and extensive discussions. They pointed out that the bill would be amenable to deletion and addition to cope with the Constitution provisions and remove all provisions that are suspected of contravening the Constitution.

It also contributes to the elimination of family tribalism and urge deputies to exercise their control and legislative roles.

State-owned and private banks' share of treasury bonds recorded 58.6 billion pounds, down 1.3 billion pounds over one month.
During a seminar held at Saleh Kamel Center for Islamic Economy, Al-Azhar University, it was revealed that Egypt and Islamic countries need to exert tireless efforts to attract foreign direct investments (FDI) and raise its share of total international capital flows.

This has been confirmed by the signature of several agreements, the latest of which was the conclusion of a financing agreement to the value of $950 million in favour of exporting Egyptian liquefied natural gas to France. B-Gas Company and its partners, Malaysian Petronas and Gas De France, have finally approved of financing the first unit project to liquefy natural gas of the Egyptian Company for Liquefied Natural Gas in order to be exported to France. The first notification to withdraw the first payment has been issued as a prelude to lending banks delivering the first payment of the funds estimated at about $600 million of the project and the shareholders. This clearly shows the international financial community's confidence in the company project as international enterprise, which will contribute to the placement of Egypt on the list of the seven major gas exporting countries in the world by the end of 2006.
For his part, British Gas Company director pointed out that 29% of the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project is divided between E-Gas (12%) and the Egyptian General Organization for Petroleum with the same percentage (12 %). Gas de France Company, on the other hand, contributes 5% the finance and the remaining percentage constituting 71% is divided on between British Gas and the Malaysian company of Petronas.
Hala Fayiq pointed out that the two projects bear witness to the international capability of Egypt in gas reserves, which hit about 65 trillion cubic meters.
Deputy Director of National Societe Generale Bank Tarik Fayed points out that the role played by the National Societe Generale Bank in the gas deal won by Malaysian Petronas in cooperation with British Gas and Gas de France is the role of financial advisor, which procures the required funds.
For his part, Director General of Gas de France pointed out that Gas de France's contribution to the deal which had recently been concluded with Malaysian Petronas and British Gas amounts to 5% of the contract value, which hit $950 million, which is concluded on behalf of a project to export Egyptian liquefied gas to France in coordination with the Egyptian Liquefied Gas Company (B-Gas).
The political tendency and the conditions currently undergone by Libya, together with lifting the American ban on Libya supports the Egyptian banks tendency to head for Libya which is regarded as a promising market for investments especially infrastructure, airports and communications.
Hussein added that the bank was currently holding consultations with its key clients who want to invest in Libya, especially as the United Bank of Egypt had been chosen as an investment advisor to the Egyptian party. Agreement is underway with the Libyan government on the nature of projects, especially as the Libyan companies contribute about 20% to the bank capital. The bank is currently considering some projects to probe the possibility of financing them. He declined to uncover the volume of the funds allocated by the bank to investment in Libya.
Cairo-American G.BB Morgan Chase's regional director Mostafa Al Sahn added that the Libyans were supposedly receiving their funds kept in American banks, which amounted to millions of dollars especially as the date of lifting the American embargo on Libya is approaching. Al Sahn is visiting the Libyan capital in a few days' time to inform the Libyans of the situation of their funds with the bank and to open new fields of investment.
He expected the Egyptian-Libyan banking cooperation to take the form of documentary credits and cadre training. He pointed out that the banks had no political orientations but rather financial and economic ones.
BANKS VIE FOR ISSUING HIGH-INTEREST INVESTMENT CERTIFICATES
LAUNCHING SAVING COFFERS AT DISTINGUISHED INTEREST RATES RAISES MISGIVINGS
For his part, National Bank of Egypt's board chairman Hussein Abdel Aziz ruled out the possibility that the new saving coffers would affect loans while monitoring a remarkable shift in favour of the Egyptian pound in the three days following the launch of that saving coffer. He declined, however, to define the rate of the shift. Abdel Aziz understated misgivings about accumulation of liquidity due to the remarkable demand for the new coffer of the distinguish 12% interest rate. He pointed out that such a step came within the framework of developing monetary policy to secure economic policies and development plans in the forefront of which came curbing inflation rates, raising saving rates from 17.5% to 25%, restoring confidence in the national currency and putting a final end to dollarization.
International Delta Bank President Ali Negm pointed out that the fact that one or more banks resorted to raising depositors' interest rates was subject to the degree of its need to a further financial liquidity and the available potential to employ such funds. He added that there was an orientation to increase credit rates in the coming stage and get out of the doubt circle that caused the faltering problem. This would require more liquidity. He added that the new saving coffer grants the Egyptian family better interest rates periodically, and curbs spending on goods and services and consequently helps to reduce inflation rates, giving banks credit flexibility especially as they are exempted from the rate to be deducted in favour of the CBE monetary reserve.
The main objective of this bloc is to boost inter-Arab trade exchange, he said.
The banks' issuance of new saving certificates at high interest rates has pushed most US dollar depositors to convert their deposits into Egyptian pound ones.
Egypt's exports to Syria edged up by 160 percent to 26 million US dollars in January and February this year compared to the same period last year. Its imports from Syria recorded 11 million US dollars.
A report on such zones' dealings received by Minister of Planning uncovered that they had negative results with a 94.3 million dollars deficit due to the rise in imports over exports in the corresponding period.
The government delegate with Cotton Exporters Union Mohamed Al-Shewi ascribed the retreat of cotton exports to numerous problems including the American subsidy of the American cotton, which competes against the Egyptian cotton on international markets.
Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) figures pointed out a 25% growth in the value of exports in the last 9 months of the fiscal year 2003/2004 against 14% increase in imports value.
There has also been a rise in the value of manufactured exports such as iron and steel, fertilizers, carpets, medicine, citrus fruit, raw cotton, dried onions, crude oil, petroleum products, aluminum products, peanuts and ready-made clothes.
Although Egyptian textile exports had increased over the last three years from 899 million dollars in 2001, 945 million dollars in 2002 and 1.037 billion dollars in 2003, producers and exporters of this sector are concerned due to the cancellation of the quota system by the WTO as of next year.
Exporters of such products to the USA voiced their hope to conclude preferential agreements such as QIZ (qualified industrial zone), which they seek, as a private sector, to achieve. Minister of Foreign Trade and Industry Rashid Mohamed Rashid emphasized that the conclusion of such agreements fell within the private sector rather than the Ministry of Foreign Trade's competence.
Yesterday, the market witnessed a new rise in interest rates on saving certificates led by Egyptian Arab Land Bank and Cairo Paribas Bank. The Egyptian Arab Land Bank raised its interest rates on its saving certificate "Development of capital" to about 12.8%. It is a five-year term certificate with a cash cumulative interest cashed every month at LE8 per each LE1000 certificate and LE163.5 at the end of the certificate term.
Fouda added that, the bank in return, could pay its clients the interest on the certificate in foreign exchange.
Rustom pointed out that the CBE intervention by putting up even one deposit could raise the Interbank rates, but its refrainment from issuing deposits will keep prices at their low rates.
A recent report by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) said the private and foreign banks' share rose up to 18 billion pounds, up 443 million pounds in April.
Chairman of the center Dr. Mohamed Abdel Halim Omar said total international capital flows in 1997-2003 hit $6 trillions, noting that Egypt and developing countries got 30% only of international capital flows.
Inter-Arab trade represents only 8.9% of total Arab trade volume, Dr. Saed Abdel Khaliq, director of Economic Research Department under Foreign Trade and Industry Ministry, said. He also noted that Arab investments abroad hit $1.2 trillion, while inter-Arab investment hit $16.9 billion, or 1.5%.
Delta International Bank Chairman and Managing Director Ali Negm said the bank decided to raise its interest rates in response to market conditions, pointing out that subscription to such a certificate had no restrictions, as it would be offered to individuals and institutions alike.
Head of the French economic mission in Cairo emphasized that the agreement was one of the most important agreements on the level of Egyptian-French relations because it pertains to the natural gas sector, a strategic sector whose importance is not only economic but also political.
British Gas Company director pointed out that the future plan of the company aimed at the continuation of constructing production lines relying on the availability of gas on one hand and the availability of buyers.
She highlighted the big demand for such projects by foreign banks in addition to the International Finance corporation (IFC) and Egyptian banks contributing to that deal like Misr International Bank, Commercial International Bank (CIB), and National Societe Generale Bank. She added that the volume of contributions offered by this category was in the range of $200 million out of a total finance hitting about $1.3 billion representing the first stage of financing Train-1, which had been completed.
Regarding the feasibility of the banks contribution to gas projects, Al-Fayed says that after the discovery of gas and as the world's reserves reached economic rates, banks became certain of the economic feasibility of prospecting for and marketing gas as well as exploiting such reserves due to remunerative economic results. This explains why banks are so interested in financing gas projects in general as well as the projects related to gas like those of fertilizers relying on gas.
EGYPTIAN BANKS HEAD WESTWARD FOR LIBYAN MARKET
Libya has a big reserve of oil, which makes it a fertile field for foreign investment.
He pointed out the Libyan market prosperity and the disappearance of the problems concerning donations which used to be caused by international agencies.
He highlighted the Egyptian banks desire to invest in the Libyan market due to the availability of investment opportunities especially in the field of petroleum, communications, airports and infrastructure that require further finance. He, however, declined to uncover the volume of investments to be pumped in to the Libyan market. He added that during his expected visit he would discuss with Libyan companies the possibility and mechanisms of finance as well as the quality of the projects to be implemented. He expected the Libyan government to extend facilities to Egyptian banks and offer them exemptions to help in one way or another with the finance operation.
He pointed out that Libya was promising and rich in oil and had an infrastructure, which is eligible for investment due to security and political stability.
More private and investment banks have started to issue distinguished investment certificates at higher interest rates (12 percent) than the current market rates.
Despite an outstanding liquidity surplus estimated by the latest Central Bank of Egypt CBE report at about LE46.9 billion or the equivalent of $7.55 billion at the beginning of last June and although such funds were employed in new projects the credit facilities of which amounted to about LE296 billion or the equivalent of $47.67 billion, some public and joint Egyptian banks launched a new service of saving coffers in the domestic currency at a distinguished interest rate of 12% and a 3-year term. Bankers described such a move as ambiguous, especially as banks did need to attract any further savings and as raising interest rates would aggravate economic sluggishness and the burden of debt service, thus negatively impacting on public budget deficit. Bankers also doubted that such a step might be able to curb inflation as, according to them, such inflation in Egypt is not so much caused by over consumption expenditure or an increase in demand for goods and services that could be dealt with through withdrawal of liquidity from the market as it is due to a rise in the cost of production which led to a rise in prices.
The Nile Bank board chairman, Kamal Al Sabbagh emphasized that the orientation of bolstering the bank liquidity is a positive matter and does not run counter to the CBE or government policy in the coming period. He added that putting up saving coffers at distinguished interest rates was one of the well-known tools that could contain inflation in the short run and restore confidence in the national currency. He pointed out that raising interest rates would positively affect an increase of foreign investments but they increase domestic debt in the short run if such a rise took place within an integrated system of measures in the forefront of which is reduction of taxes on markets.
For his part, former Minister of Planning, Dr. Ahmed Al Darsh warned against rushing into raising interest rates, as the cost would be too heavy for the state public budget. He pointed out that a 1% rise in interest rates could cost the budget an additional burden of LE2.1 billion.
Within this framework, Abdel-Dhaher held a meeting with a delegation from the Kuwaiti Agricultural Cooperatives Union. The two parties voiced their desire to boost cooperation among Arab cooperatives to serve national economy and take further steps towards more economic cooperation.
Sources said all foreign and Arab currencies are available at the banking market.
In 2003, Egyptian exports to Syria shot up to 74 million US dollars in 2003 against 60 million US dollars in 2002. Imports from Syria rose to 74 million US dollars in 2003, creating a balance with exports, against 38 million US dollars in 2002.
61% RETREAT IN COTTON EXPORTS
This subsidy forced foreign companies to cancel their contracts of importing Egyptian cotton due to its high price, Al-Shewi said, adding that foreign companies preferred paying a fine of 10% of the value of the contract to implementing the importation deal.
However, due to the relatively big weight of imports compared to exports, the imports value hit $1.566 billion while the export increase value stood at $1.499 billion.
On the other hand, there has been a decline in the value of the exports of medical herbs, carbon, coal, raw linen, aromatic oils, aluminum, rice and cotton yarn.
Meanwhile, high ranking diplomatic sources unveiled to Asharq Al-Awsat that there were differences of opinion between Egypt and Turkey regarding Turkish attempts to urge Arab and Islamic countries to recognize the government it backed in the Turkish party of Cyprus and to end its diplomatic isolation.
For its part, Ukraine said that the shipment was confiscated due to the contradiction between the label on the container and the shipment constituents.
The amendments introduced by the administration to President George W. Bush's original initiative on democracy and reform in the Middle East crowned discussions between both leaders during Mubarak's recent visit to the US, as well as Arab reactions and opposition to the initiative, the American official said.
THREE TRENDS IN RULING MILIEU SPLIT OVER REFORM
Advocates of the second trend see that reform became a must and the continuation of the current positions would embroil the country in a lot of crises whether with external or internal forces.
He said the conditions in Egypt reached a state of weakness. He stressed the necessity of achieving a real development so that Egypt would take its appropriate status regionally and internationally. It became a strong demand to launch a real reform process in all fields and choose people characterized with seriousness and credibility away from the spirit of prehensile resourcefulness which afflicted some people known for honesty and transparency.
Diplomats, former ministers, lawyers, professors and thinkers are considering how to lay down regulations for the declaration. These regulations would ensure acting from within the ruling regime and not opposing it so as to move stagnant water without blaming certain people or bodies. Rather, steps should be taken so that Egypt could restore its regional and international position. Internal conditions should be analyzed and advice should be offered to all.
Egypt supports the Palestinians not only in the security field but also in all fields, said the source. Security, agricultural, economic and administrative experts would be sent to Palestine.
The source denied Egyptian mediation for moving Arafat from the West Bank to Gaza, saying, "This is not true. We had talks with the Israelis over the necessity to give Arafat full freedom of movement in the West Bank and Gaza." Arafat should not move to Gaza without Israeli guarantees so that Gaza would not be the last station and non-return to the West Bank, added the source.
The security issue has to do with the issue of reforms which the PA should take into account.
Al-Zuheiri was supposed to be investigated today to examine the issue of extending his custody together with 32 others who spent a month in remand custody.
The Ikhwan bloc deputies in the parliament asked the council to conduct an urgent investigation within the framework of its terms of reference in the incidents and circumstances concomitant with the arrest of the defendants in the case and their exposition to torture and negligence, thus leading to the death of Eng.
Furthermore, Ikhwanite sources said that Central Security as well as special forces besieged Mit Al-Kholi village in Al-Zarqa town, Damietta governorate to prevent the arrival of any of Al-Zuheiri's relatives or friends to offer condolences to his family.
The proposed amendment retains the 50% rate for workers and farmers of party slate candidates. Elections would be held according to original and reserve slates so that reserve members would occupy the seats that fall vacant during the parliamentary session.
The sources said that the distribution of parliamentary seats among all governorates would be subjected to careful calculations.
All statistics pointed out that individual elections have not for long constituted an element of attraction to the Egyptian voter to practise his right in selecting this representatives in the parliament.
Egypt stipulates establishing full normalized diplomatic relations before receiving Iranian pilgrims coming to visit Alul-Bait (prophet's family) shrines spread in many Egyptian cities.
The source added that the two sides are currently focusing on pushing up economic and commercial relations rather than normalizing diplomatic relations.
Ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) Secretary General and Minister of Information Safwat Al-Sherif has put an end to speculations about both the timing and the size of the cabinet reshuffle in Egypt. He denied the party or any official leaking particular names for key positions nominations in the next reshuffle.
National newspapers and magazines chief editors close to decision-making circles have recently expatiated on a forthcoming large scale reshuffle and criticized the situation in light of the presence of ministers and officials they branded as "resourceful and smart".
He said that such meetings would continue in the next few days to discuss the details of several issues including political reform.
In a symposium on the future of water in light of global variables, held in Saad Zaghloul Cultural Centre on Thursday, Abu Zeid pointed out that the presence of such a number of Israeli experts was not threat to Egypt. "Egypt is stronger than Israel in terms of water expertise. Pakistan asked Egypt to provide it with Egyptian expertise in irrigation projects.
This came in response to an urgent query submitted to the parliament by Muslim Brotherhood deputy Hamdi Hassan in which he quoted the family of Egyptian scientist Mohamed Abdel Moneim Al-Azmirli as saying that the latter was assassinated inside a prison near Baghdad.
He was also listed among the wanted within the occupation forces search for weapons of mass destruction and Iraqi scientists.
The deputy asked Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher to disclose before the PA the actions taken by the Egyptian Foreign Ministry to defend the Egyptians in Iraq, particularly scientists. He is also required to reveal the ways and means of bringing to account the US forces accused of torturing the Egyptian scientist to death.
Taking any step towards the preparation of certain reform demands and referring them to the government will be useless in case of a cabinet reshuffle. It is better to wait and see whether the talk about the reshuffle is real or mere talk to reassure citizens in such a perplexed situation, the sources added.
POLITICIANS ABOVE THE AGE OF 70 RULE... AND OPPOSE TOO
Opposition and government men compete with each other for setting records in staying in their positions for long years and assigning old people to leading positions.
The first was presented by Nasserite MP Hamdin Sabbahi (49) who desires to found Al-Karama Al-Arabiya (Arab Dignity) Party after he left the Nasserite Party led by Dia'eddin Dawoud who was born in 1926.
Therefore, Prime Minister Atef Ebeid seems to be relatively young, as he was born in 1932.
Information Minister Safwat Al-Sherif and Minister of Wakfs (Endowments) Mahmoud Hamdi Zaqzouq were born in 1933.
Minister of Local Development Mustafa Abdel-Qader was born in 1940.
Minister of Youth and Sports Dr. Ali Eddin Helal was born in 1944. Health Minister Dr. Mohamed Awad Tag Eddin was born in 1945
The MPs, namely Abdel-Mon'em Al-Oleimi, Al-Badri Farghali, and Dr Hamdi Hassan, said that the draft law would offset with the burdens imposed on the low income people, especially civil servants and public sector employees. The draft law will also put an end to the rich enjoying of the same indirect subsidy directed to the poor, which causes disorder in the social structure.
The MPs revealed that they did not handle in detail the categories of the proposed charges and taxes, pointing out that that would be determined after deliberations inside the parliament, discussions with businessmen MPs, 42 in number, and consultations with the Finance Minister.
In continuation of the state of instability currently undergone by the opposition Al-Wafd Party, two leading figures, namely head of the party's Water Resources and Irrigation Committee Dr. Ahmed Abdel-Khaliq Ashennawi and rapporteur of the Economic Committee with the party's higher authority Mostafa Annasharti, split after they had tendered their explained resignations to the party leader Dr. No'man Gomaa.
They pointed out a state of "liquidating opponents" inside the party.
A number of the current leaderships will announce their resignations from the current party and will join the new party, Ashennawi added.
The deputy said that the book contained phrases that obviously offend Egypt and its peoples.
Everybody in the street acts at will!
Girls in your country also enjoy the same rights as boys.
Spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) parliamentary bloc broadsided the government and accused it of turning life into a hell and meeting the needs of the well-to-do rather than the poor.
"The continuation of such a situation contributes to spreading hatred and crime among social classes and affects negatively the Egyptians' feelings of belongingness."
Egypt's mosques and churches pray that Victor would be set free and return home safely, he said.
In an urgent quest for notification to Prime Minister Atef Ebeid on Saturday, Ikhwanite deputy Hamdi Hassan called on Wali to tender his resignation to President Hosni Mubarak as soon as possible due to corruption incidents that have become recently rampant in the Ministry of Agriculture.
Hassan accused Wali of banishing his technical office manager and stripping him of his posts immediately after he made his depositions before a court of law, which ran counter to Wali's statement before the parliament when the issue was at first raised.
Hassan pointed out other major cases that are being examined by the judiciary including the case of importing carcinogenic pesticides.
There are a large number of monuments put randomly in the Egyptian museum without any database, he said, unveiling that the first inventory of monuments was conducted in 1959 for seven months but it was not completed. In this inventory, it turned out that 65 monuments of Tutankhamon had disappeared, and 400 rare monuments and 33 thousand monuments were lost during the first years of establishing the museum.
A study by Cairo University's Commercial and Economic Research Centre expected the number of mobile phone subscribers to hit 7 millions by the end of the current year, taking total funds spent on mobile phone up to 9 billion pounds.
Savings plummeted by 15% due to spending on the mobile phone, the study said, pointing out that the mobile phone and private tuition swallow 40% of the family's income.
The number of the poor is on the increase especially following the imposition of more charges on the poor alone, it said. A special report by the Shura Council Agricultural Production Committee showed that 45 percent of Egypt's population now live below the poverty line.
Some 12 million Egyptians live in the open, notably at graveyards, shanties, garages, mosques and stairwells, according to a report by the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMS).
The government always imposes further charges on people immediately after expanding the construction of villas and palaces.
Deputy Chairman of the General Division of Investors under the Federation of Chamber of Commerce Adel al-Ezabi said Egypt came 76th on the list of exporters. Figures announced by the Ministry of Foreign Trade on the high value of food and farm produce exports have not been achieved so far, he added.
The film shows the life of a Christian family who were living in Shubra district (Cairo) in the 1960's. The family has a little child who loves cinema, but faced with the family's conservatism.
Minister of Housing and Urban Communities Mohamed Ibrahim Soliman said that all the seven stations were completed.
There have been widespread repercussions to the case of exporting cement to Israel which Al Arabi dealt with in several previous issues. While the Palestinian people's sons were exercising all sorts of protest against the Israeli government building of the separating wall, including martyrdom on their own lands and at their own homes which are exposed to confiscation in favour of the racist separating wall, and while president Yassir Arafat and the Palestinian government were knocking all doors of the international community and the Hague Court of Justice to stop the construction of that wall, Egyptian cement was being passed through Palestinian lands to the separating wall under Palestinian government importation permits.
Through interviews, meetings and documents it has been proved that a certain Zeiv Blenski, a German Israeli citizen and owner of Blenski for cement companies LTD in Haifa and a company for the distribution of oils and petroleum had signed an agreement with Misr Beni Suif Company for Cement to buy 120 thousand tons of in bulk cement in favour of the Israeli market during the period of building the racist separating wall.
Those companies not only did harm to Palestinian national security by smuggling cement to the racist separating wall but also was guilty of tax erosion as they failed to pay clearance duties for most of the cement. The amounts of smuggled cement which entered the Palestinian market, according to the documents of National Economy Ministry and the Ministry of Finance hit 33 thousand tons, which is an insignificant part of the total amount of permits obtained which was estimated at 420 thousand tons, the clearance duties of a big part of which was not paid. Investigations also proved that the Ministry of National Economy which granted import permits omitted to check or follow up the cement entry into the National Authority Territories and went on issuing new import permits to the same companies without dating the permits, according to the official investigation report submitted by premier Ahmed Qurie to the Legislative Council committees.
NCHR deputy chairman Ahmed Kamal Aboul-Magd told Asharq Al-Awsat that he would meet with the Egyptian Minister of the Interior in a bid to make sure of such information.
He confirmed that he would hold a press conference following every meeting of the council with a view to explaining the subjects discussed in the council and replying to the journalists' questions.
It is to be mentioned that the last meeting of the NCHR caused high sensation due to the several and conflicting press statements given by the council members, which gave a strong impression that there is a conflict inside the council, especially regarding the issue of emergency laws.
The rapporteur of the committee and secretary general of Tagamo'h Party Hussein Abdel-Raziq said that emergency law that was put in effect on 6th October, 1981, and extended till 31st May, 2006, has been used to detain ten thousands of citizens, against whom security bodies have leveled different charges.
Welcoming the request, Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Kamal Al-Shazli said that the government was ready to discuss the issue at any time, pointing out that such an issue is important and concerns every citizen's interest.
The discussions of the Committee on Health in the People's Assembly uncovered that the government is involved in a new crisis jeopardizing the Egyptian people's health.
This grave incident was discovered by chance and it was found that the consignment contains radioactivity that is 7 times above the allowed level, he added.
The two deputies Dr. Hussein Al-Serfi and Dr. Talat Abdel Kawi urged that the Minister of Health would attend the next meeting of the committee to discuss this vital case that is relevant to citizens and animal wealth.
The committee decided to forge ahead with the file of radioactive fertilizers and call the ministry of health, AEA, professors of public hygiene and a number of experts to discuss the problem.
Al-Maidan weekly newspaper got a copy of a serious report from Alexandria and Dekheila Port Authority.
The source attributed this to the bad conditions of the Egyptian fleet, the small size of the Egyptian ships and the great capabilities of the Israeli ships.
In response to a number of deputies' urgent statements, Abou-Zeid said in a written message that Egypt's relations with Nile Basin countries nowadays are by far the best.
Tanzanian minister together with 20 members of the Tanzanian parliament came to Egypt to know about Egypt's water needs, Abou-Zeid said, adding that nothing would do harm to Egypt's interest in Nile water.
WHERE WOULD SHARON'S NEW PLOY END?
We can only mockingly laugh at such a farce run by Sharon and the Zionist extremism group, the latest of whose acts was the farce of taking the vote in his cabinet two days ago about withdrawal from Gaza Strip.
Any move outside that framework can only be described as misleading, deception and waste of time.
Cairo has asked Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to waive control over security bodies within reforms inside the Palestinian Authority, said an Egyptian high-level source.
Cairo has no objection to the participation of the moderate wing of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in the Palestinian Authority, the Egyptian source said.
EGYPTIAN SOURCE: ARAFAT WILL ANNOUNCE SECURITY BODIES' CHIEF MID CURRENT MONTH
The source pointed out that he agreed with Arafat to necessarily give Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei more competence and hold dialogue with different Palestinian factions inside Palestine.
Mubarak told Sharon that by this vow he could ensure two things: firstly, the personal safety of the Egyptian listed men and secondly relatively quiet Israeli withdrawal from Gaza Strip.
Egypt would dispatch 200 security officers to Gaza Strip to train PNA security bodies in facing home security risks, according to the security deal.
Egypt on Monday called on Israel to fulfill the original plan of full withdrawal from Gaza on the basis that the Arabs and the Palestinians pin hopes on it to push the peace process forwards, emphasizing that fresh changes cannot be introduced to every stage of the plan.
In a bid to play on words, Shalom said Israel is happy about Egypt's strategic decision to play a key role in the Middle East region in the current stage, and to persuade other countries in the region to move towards peace with Israel on the basis that Egypt is a major Arab country.
The question is related to the necessity of keeping security, rather than smuggling arms, as Palestinians do not get "materials" through the Egyptian border, the Egyptian official.
Egypt moves quickly and firmly, not out of its leading position, historical role and responsibility but rather for more direct and simple reasons: Gaza is not an Egyptian neighbourhood but an extension to it in terms of borders and social relations, including marriages as was the case with Libya before Gaddafi's revolution and with Sudan before the nationalists stepped to power. However, Gaza was also, at a certain stage, under direct Egyptian responsibility.
One thinks that Cairo will be at ease with such a fundamental change in light of what happened in Algeria and Egypt before it.
Solayman tried to explain to Arafat that the matter has become urgent and that Egypt is as concerned with the matter as Palestine.
If the Palestinians in the diaspora had taken part in those elections, he would have won overwhelmingly since late Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. In the name of Egypt's president, Solayman suggested to Arafat to be another Mandela.
Mandela was released in return for the freedom of his citizens.
In return, Arafat should not disregard Egypt's role after a 50-year Egyptian-Palestinian partnership.
The accuracy of the missile enables it to destroy tactical targets such as radars or ballistic missile launchers at a remote distance.
However, Washington refused the demand lest Israel would sell the technology of that missile which is the best in the world to other parties such as China or India.
Even though Israel did not reveal much information about the new missile, cruise missiles are generally able to carry nuclear, chemical and biological warheads.
Israel also has Jericho ballistic missiles whose range is 2000 kilometres. Some Jericho missiles were equipped with nuclear warheads Arab cities and capitals.
The US had agreed in early 2002 to sell Egypt Harpoon-2 cruise missiles which are launched from sea launchers, after removing a software that enables them to hit land targets as a result of Zionist lobby pressure in Washington.
Spokesman for Hamas Dr Mahmoud Al-Zahar said that Egypt's regional and national role should not be reduced to supporting just one Palestinian faction.
Replying to questions sent to him, Al-Zahar replied from his hideout in Gaza saying that Hamas movement heard about the Egyptian initiative from several sources some of which are Arab and others are hostile. He noted that Egypt has the right to protect its borders with Gaza Strip, which is controlled by Israel, adding that the Egyptian security issue is a step that should be reconsidered.
In reply to another question about Hamas' participation in the legislative elections, Al-Zahar said, "The movement will not let its people down and will go to ballot boxes."
IRAQ STUDIES SETTING UP TWO HUGE DAMS
The construction of the two dams of Bikhama and Mandaw in Arbil would cost 8 billion dollars, he said.
The source also told Al-Hayat that American companies submitted studies and plans to the Iraqi Ministry of Agriculture for setting up dams in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad with a view to raising the Tigris water level. This would activate fishing as a source of livelihood for hundreds of Iraqis and river transport means, the source added.
After Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani separated from Barzani in 1966 and founded the Kurdistan Democratic Party in 1975, he, along with his supporters, formed Peshmerga forces just like Barzani's groups. Thus, each party had its own fighters, carrying the same appellation.
Badr fighters went on battles against Iraqi forces in southern Iraqi Ahwar and entered Iraqi territories from the north in the lands then controlled by the Kurdistan National Union, and took part in the 1991 uprising.
-The Iraqi National Wefak (Reconciliation) Movement: it was established late in the 1970s. It is led by Ayad Elawai, the current provisional prime minister.
It consisted of seven or nine groups until the Iraqi Liberation War. But, it was then divided into parties and movements. The congress remained as a political movement led by Ahmed Challabi.
Damascus accused Israel of committing "violations" in the Syrian territories along the borderline with the occupied Golan including the burial of nuclear waste in Al Sheikh mountain, planting mines in Qatana and Al Harmoun districts and banning Syrian citizens from cultivating a big part of lands or reclaiming lands in their vicinity in addition to stealing the waters of the Western side of Al Sheikh mountain and diverting their course to the occupied lands in the Golan.
As for water, the Syrian Foreign Ministry report estimated the stolen quantity at about 500 million cubic meters through full investment of the Banyas river and Lake Tiberias and Syrian Al Hema water.
Sheikh Habash who occupies the position of head of Islamic Studies Centre pointed out that the Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had previously met with Sheikh Youssef Al-Qaradawi, Sheikh Ishac Al-Farhan and Essam Al-Beshir, all three well-known leaderships for Ikhwanite orientations in the context of arrangements for a possible return to the country by Ikhwanite leaderships as well as other opposition Islamic personalities.
Habash uncovered that a conference had been recently held in Syria to renew the religious discourse where a number of Muslim Brotherhood leaderships participated, like Fathi Yakan, in a development that clearly indicates that the Islamic and national streets in the region stood against the American projects targeting both Islamic and national projects and putting forward the Great Middle East Project as an alternative to them.
"Writing a permanent constitution aims at establishing good and democratic governance in the country to incarnate grassroot participation in decision-making and ensure full rights and freedoms for our fellowmen," Hamad said, noting that the constitution was written in recognition of Qatar 's Arab and Islamic affiliations.
The fresh constitution provides for respect of basic freedoms, press freedom and independence of jurisdiction. Nobody is allowed to interfere in lawsuits and the course of justice, it said. It also bans torture, confiscation of individual rights by house-arresting or restriction of movement.
According to the new strategy, the Middle East and North Africa will cooperate to develop the benchmarks, standards, and main tools to support the implementation of water demand management activities and encourage riparian countries to develop successful strategies to run the demand for water.
Al-Nasser said, "The Dead Sea level has decreased by one metre per year since the 1990's, this means that some 300 million cubic metres of water are lost by neighbouring ground water aquifers every year."
SAUDI ARABIA: EXCHANGE FIRMS TO BE MERGED INTO ONE COMPANY
A number of Saudi businesswomen welcomed government decisions to open new work fields for women. They emphasized that they requested to obtain licences required for practising economic activities, pointing out the woman 's important role in developing her society side by side with the man.
The conference issued a document entitled "Cairo Declaration". The document stressed that the prospective vision of Arab education is based on a strategy under which standards of the active school, which ensures that every Arab child would have access to distinguished education, could be met.
Meanwhile, it said, "Development, modernization and reform should inevitably include the whole world and lead finally to the spread of just and comprehensive peace according to international legitimacy resolutions, respect of human rights, administration of justice and law and abandoning double-standard policy.
A number of Western ambassadors, including US ambassador to Cairo David Welch, were among the participants.
Dr Borhan Ghalyoon, Chairman of the Sorbonne University's Center For Contemporary Orient Studies in Paris, wrote:
Are there any differences between the improvement of conditions for women's participation in public life and those proposed by foreign countries?
What European Atlantic-overlooking countries want is to protect the Arab regimes themselves from the consequences of deterioration of the situation, so as to avoid repercussions in industrial countries. They believe that it is in the interest of ruling Arab regimes, and equally in the interest of industrial countries, to reform the situations in Arab countries in order to curb the persistent and growing corruption that has come about as a result of neglect of public interest, the interference of political powers in economic affairs, the abuse of public resources and interests by those loyal, connected or related to senior public officials.
Arab governments have made no secret of their full cooperation with foreign governments against extremist groups and internal opposition movements, and have even antagonized them against democratic Arab opposition groups and parties, which Arab rulers have described as more antagonistic towards the United States than Arab ruling regimes.
What the United States and the European Union want is to eventually bring about minor political reforms that would not go beyond being just cosmetic actions to go side by side with the economic, bureaucratic and educational reforms that Arab governments have not objected to, and which some Arab governments are already enforcing.
Although Egyptian textile exports had increased over the last three years from 899 million dollars in 2001, 945 million dollars in 2002 and 1.037 billion dollars in 2003, producers and exporters of this sector are concerned due to the cancellation of the quota system by the WTO as of next year.
Exporters of such products to the USA voiced their hope to conclude preferential agreements such as QIZ (qualified industrial zone), which they seek, as a private sector, to achieve. Minister of Foreign Trade and Industry Rashid Mohamed Rashid emphasized that the conclusion of such agreements fell within the private sector rather than the Ministry of Foreign Trade's competence.
Yesterday, the market witnessed a new rise in interest rates on saving certificates led by Egyptian Arab Land Bank and Cairo Paribas Bank. The Egyptian Arab Land Bank raised its interest rates on its saving certificate "Development of capital" to about 12.8%. It is a five-year term certificate with a cash cumulative interest cashed every month at LE8 per each LE1000 certificate and LE163.5 at the end of the certificate term.

The Egyptians have the right to insist on having such guarantees because Sharon and his gang's commitment to the Roadmap is an overt lie and only similar to Bush and his Administration's lie of being committed to such a map.

The ideas put on the margin of the recent meeting of the Organization of the Islamic Conference foreign minister in Istanbul, Turkey had given an impression that the two countries had obtained a sort of Islamic approval of sending such forces.
The recent developments indicated essential amendments to the Tunisian and Moroccan attitudes to the Iraqi file. After they had objected to the war that aimed at invading that country and undermining its former regime by force of arms, at least in public statements, the Tunisians set up relations with the "Transitional Iraqi Governing Council" whether directly or indirectly. King Mohamed VI on the other hand, was one of the first leaders to contact the new Iraqi President Gazi Al Yawir as well as premier Iyad Alawi whom he praised for his "discretion" and "nationalism".
In all likelihood, Morocco and Tunisia's European partners do support such a step both explicitly and implicitly including France as they see it is impairing the American role in Iraq and in favour of a greater role to the UN.

This report was compiled by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and announced on 22nd September by Haba Handousa, Professor of Economics in the American University in Cairo. Morocco came first among African countries in terms of the volume of direct foreign investments. The volume of investment inflows into Morocco surged up to 2.3 billion dollars in 2004 versus 500 million dollars in the previous year, the report indicated. This is attributed to a proper implementation of the privatization program.
Family sector savings may reach 78 billion pounds or 15% of the GDP. Such savings include bank deposits, investment certificates, post office saving bank, and savings of insurance funds' staff, Othman said.

Chairman of the Rice Committee with the Commodity Council for Agricultural Crops (CCAC) Ahmed Al-Wakeil said that the actual value of the total exported rice in the last season amounted to 225 million dollars, thus topping the list of exported agricultural commodities including cotton. He noted that rice exports had been achieving the highest revenues among the exported agricultural commodities for 8 years, which should to be continued.
Another exporter asked for not defining the exported quantities of rice!
He proposed importing rice to put an end to speculations on it and to help achieve balanced prices. He also stressed the importance of compliance of the Egyptian standard specifications with international specifications and warned against making any violation to international standards as that might impede exportation of the Egyptian rice. He said that a committee, including representatives of the Authority of Standard Unification, the General Authority for Exports and Imports Control, Supply Ministry and Agriculture Quarantine was formed with a view to determining the specifications and developing them through introducing new modifications to them as regards reduction of impurities and raising the quality of rice.
The state's role in the national economy management process should be that of the organizer rather than that of the investor, he said, emphasizing that this may give room to the private sector with its big, medium and small-sized entities to assume a basic role in the economic activity and achieve efficient economic resources management in a way that enables the government to bolster its social role and focus its limited resources on protecting low-income categories.
Poverty control and increasing income of low-income categories will not be achieved through expenditure out of the public treasury but rather through rationalized customs and tax policies encouraging small, medium and big-sized projects to make progress and devise applicable alternatives to decrease tax burdens, he pointed out.
32 BANKS TO BE MERGED IN ONE YEAR'S TIME
The banks to be merged are Exterior Bank, Mohandes Bank, United Bank of Egypt, Nile Bank, Commerce and Development Bank (Al-Tegaryoun) and Islamic International Bank for Investment and Development.
The sources uncovered that the number of banks in Egypt is considerable and is not compatible with the economic conditions. Some of those banks have branches in a limited number of governorates which might reach three or four at most.
Minister of Investment Dr. Mahmoud Mohieddin said his ministry focused on attracting foreign investments, that seek good investment opportunity with accepted risks, through preparing the good environment by taking a package of decisions and laws that would qualify Egypt to get its fair share of the international and Arab investments, especially the Gulf ones.
So the current stage depends on the criteria of the efficiency in the application of such laws in all investment fields.
These bodies would review the companies' performance.

The remarks were said during Rashid's meeting with members of Japanese Businessmen Association, who are currently visiting Egypt. There are some mechanisms through which industrial sectors and exports could be backed, including modernizing the industrial sector, restructuring the Export Promotion Fund (EPF), making the best use of partnership agreements, cementing human resources' contribution, activating financial resources, boosting exports, developing strategies of the industrial sector, and providing information and communications means, Rashid pointed out.
He said the simulation models prepared by the ministry affirmed that it is possible to make up for that deficit through the proceeds which will come from a boost economic activity in a period ranging from 12 to 18 months.
For his part, former prime minister advisor Dr. Hatem Al-Qarnashawi said the average deficit in the state public budget will increase in the short and medium runs due to application of the new financial policy. However, the question is: Is the increase of budget deficit for activating economy a required aim or not?
He also expected that a real leap would take place in the rates of Arab and foreign investments in Egypt. Reduction of tax to 20% means that Egypt will enjoy the lowest tax rate in the Arab region, which makes it qualified to attract further investments during the coming period.
Magdi Al-Dahan. Al-Dahan told Al-Alam Al-Youm daily that the map was submitted to the Transport Minister Essam Sharaf who approved it. It is also expected to be referred to the cabinet next month as a prelude to implementing it.

A number of political forces' leading figures uncovered their intention to choose one person or more for the posts of the president of the republic and his vice-president once incumbent President Hosni Mubarak's fourth term comes to a close in October 2005.
A springboard for about-face is to introduce constitutional changes that may slim the president's power and set only two presidential terms, as well as carry out an all-out democratic reform through pressure groups, he said.
Assistant Secretary-General of the suspended Labour Party Magdy Korkor linked the election of a president from among several candidates to the realization of other reform steps.
The current stalemate, he maintained, may lead to or bar consequences. The intellectuals' reform calls represent the Egyptian street's demands, he said.
We hope this would continue to be Egypt's destiny otherwise the power patrimony nightmare would take place thus putting an end to the republican sense in favour of an unequivocal monarchical one! We don't think that deception is palatable to anyone. Gamal Mubarak's rise to power can not be due to any special competence or genius of his as the only asset he has is the fact that he is Mubarak's son, which, according to the constitution, cannot be an ordinary citizen due to his father's enjoyment of absolute or rather divine rights. We won't be taken in by any body's argument that it is Gamal's legitimate right to be candidate for such high ranking position because if Gamal Mubarak were an ordinary citizen, he would not even think of nominating himself for chairing a village council not to mention being the president of a country of Egypt's size?
Question 2: Will it be aborted and who may abort it?
Answer to question 1: A minimum reform is confined to a cabinet reshuffle, a nomination of the deputy president.
It, nonetheless, largely depends on his health conditions. If he pulled through and became well enough to supervise the kick off operation, it would be the best option compared to two other options: to suffer a setback even before the kick off thus depriving it of legitimacy and granting the old guard the chance to try to fill in the vacuum or to pull through only too much to give up his hatred of the idea of nominating a deputy president despite of the fact that he is not getting any younger.
Answer to question 4: Gamal Mubarak is not automatically nominated for patrimony, but he is not excluded from it for good.
Some stretch these remarks to Gamal Mubarak who is described as not very knowledgeable of society, its structures and even language, which recalls what was once said about king Abdullah II before his ascension to the throne, a snag that can be cured by teachers who should be well selected for somebody who should be willing to learn.
As regards the results of the visit recently paid by President Mubarak's envoy to Ramallah and Tel Aviv, Maher said, "Matters are moving in a positive direction and some issues are still under consideration."
ISRAELI SHIPS CONTINUE MOVING IN EGYPTIAN PORTS RAISING EUROPEAN FLAGS

The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) established many universities the Third World countries such as Macomb International University and some other universities in Ecuador, Uruguay and Mexico, in addition to the American universities in Ankara, Beirut and Cairo. There are other agencies that serve the plans of forming the Egyptian mentality, such as Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, Ra'ed Foundation, Middle East Research Group and University of George Town, Dr. Abdel Aal added.
On the other hand, professor of Comparative Education and Education Management in the Faculty of Education, Ain Shams University Dr. Abdel Ghani Abboud said, "Assistance is nothing but loans to be paid back by draining the resources of the downtrodden people." Education projects achieve only American control and render people slaves, while chanting liberty slogans, he added. "The US, the major patron of hegemony and might extend those grants to helpless peoples." The purported educational assistance is only long-term soft loans to the Ministry of Education to be deposited with the safes of certain bodies affiliated to the ministry. These grants are paid back to what the donor countries call educational "experts" who teach national cadres, on the one hand, and spy on those cadres, on the other hand, Abboud said.
The project offers financing resources in the form of "risk capital", in addition to extending other technical assistance to beneficiaries. The finance is meant to rehabilitate small-sized projects to enhance their production, thus increasing their export opportunities.
The U.S. international trade committee emphasized what was recorded in an important report on the expected impacts of relieving 35 countries, including Egypt, from the impacts of cancelling the aforementioned quota system. The report reached a number of important results foremost of which are expected negative effects on Egypt's weaving exports to the United States in light of the current situation unless a free trade agreement was signed by the two countries to give Egypt's exports "preferential treatment" on the American market.
Hassan said, "Not only did the author demand that but he also asked that "rhetoric" be cancelled as it was no longer fit for the spirit of the age".

AUTO MANUFACTURERS WARN OF NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF CUSTOMS TARIFF
Car Manufacturers Association submitted a memo to Prime Minister Dr. Ahmed Nazif, Finance Minister Dr. Youssef Botros Ghali and Minister of Foreign Trade and Industry Rashid Mohamed Rashid. The memo included proposals for introducing a supplement to the customs tariff amendments so that 18 factories can continue work. These factories have investments to the tune of 8 billion pounds. Some 17 thousand personnel in different engineering and technical specialties work for those factories, which include joint companies established in cooperation with international ones.
So that production of passenger cars and trucks may not stop, the Association suggested solving local feeding industries in terms of the customs tariff so that it can reduce their prices. The Association also suggested exempting the locally produced passenger cars up to 1600 cc from the resources development charges which hit 3% and was applied last May. The customs release on imported components of local car plants (CKD) is carried out without the approval of the General Organization for Industrialization in order to make sure that the rate of local industrialization was met and that it does not contain imported components that can be produced locally. The customs tariff, as mentioned before, was reduced to 40% for imported cars up to 1600 cc and it was reduced from 32% to 50% for imported trucks according to their relevant loads. Therefore, it is suggested to introduce a customs item for components and parts of dismantled cars which are sold to car assemblage plants as is the case in many countries like India and Morocco in order to achieve the minimum limit of difference between customs duties on imported components and the finished product so that local plants and feeding industries can continue production and compete with imported products regardless of the slight difference between prices.

George Ishac, a media man, proposed a panel of national wise men from different political forces to call for putting the 500-signatory statement in place.
He, nevertheless, has been removed from a position of power which he seized for almost a quarter of a century. Such a step may also be followed by another perhaps as in the September congress, removing him from his position as ruling party secretary general. Nor is it possible that such a position would be granted to any of the other members of the two, Kamal El-Shazli, Safwat, Youssif Wali as it is now their turn to quit the game in favour of, and here lies the danger, that leading the role moving to Gamal Mubarak directly or perhaps through another stuntman to continue Safwat's transitional role. Then, the state's administrative machine might be moved to support nominating Gamal Mubarak for the position of the President's deputy with steps rapidly taken till the appointed deadline, - the end of the President's fourth term in office!
Question 1: What is meant by potential reform?
The answers to such questions are these:
Answer to question 2: Such a reform kick off may be aborted if the old guard remnants could rally round a symbol close to President Mubarak whose say, of course, remains the decisive factor.
However, since security is the man's first priority, some features of reform can be betrayed by his potential nomination.
Advantages here cannot override disadvantages. The man described as having reform intentions and as both understanding and being understood by the Americans, is sometimes criticized for representing lobbies that are not always in harmony. Nor can any of them claim any projections into the future, not to mention their narrowness and weak relation with the cases of the Egyptian grassroots.

The symposium organized by Fundamentals of Education Department, Tanta University uncovered the serious danger threatening Egypt and the Arab World as a result of foreign aid extended under the pretext of developing education in Egypt.
The researcher pointed out that the latest studies highlighted the negative effects of foreign aid, mainly including penetration of developing countries' national security and making the flow of aid conditional upon the country's adoption of a pro-donor country policy. US documents stipulate that foreign aid should achieve American interests and consolidate Egypt's technological dependence on the US. Experts receive high salaries that consume a large portion of the aid, he pointed out. There is neither integration nor contacts between donor parties, hence the multiplicity of formulas and visions proposed for educational systems and bad distribution of foreign aid and loan allocations.

EGYPTIAN PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT
Nor was the rebar crisis resolved by the parliament even though the government managed to have some hot files carried forward to the next session including the competition and anti-trust law, real estate wealth protection law and tax law.
The deputies described Dr. Ebeid's word as a farewell address to win the sympathy of the deputies who kept applauding for him and his cabinet members who were all present.
The Egyptian premier confirmed that the growth rate in the first 9 months this year hit 4.1% and the growth in foreign exchange reserve increase hit $2.7 billion taking total reserve up to $14.2 billion and the Suez Canal revenues hit $2.1 billion.
Data of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) on the balance of payments for the fiscal year 2003/2004 pointed out a noticeable improvement in the proceeds of balance of payments hitting 30 billion dollars against 24 billion dollars last year, a growth rate of 23%. However, payments went up 27%, so the total balance of payments suffered a deficit of 158 million dollars against a surplus of 546 million dollars in the last fiscal year.
On the other hand, external payments were distributed as follows: 51% for non-oil commodity imports including raw materials and medium, capital and consumer commodities; 9% for oil imports; 8% for sums remitted by Egyptian-foreign companies, trade payments and construction service payments; 4% for travel of Egyptians for the purposes of tourism, education, training, pilgrimage and Umra (minor pilgrimage); 2% for air transport of Egyptian airplanes abroad; around 1% as direct investments by Egyptian expatriates in the form of projects in neighbouring countries; around 1% as outgoing foreign investments in the Egyptian stock exchange whose sales increased over its purchases; less than 0.5% for Egyptian investments in securities at foreign stock exchanges. The performance of sub-balances within the balance of payments included continuation of the trade balance deficit for about half a century.
One of the thorny issues that resulted from the amendments of customs tariff is the state of car assemblage industry in Egypt and its related feeding industries. Car assemblage industry entered a critical stage that threatens investments with suspension including national and foreign capital and dismissal of tens of thousands of workers with a view to sharply and suddenly cutting customs tariff, on fully manufactured imported cars in contravention of the announced policies. This cannot be justified at all even by the statements of Foreign Trade Minister, Dr. Rashid Mohamed Rashid who said Korea is the only country that produces cars. This statement is totally untrue, as Iran produces 7000 cars of all makes.
The problem does not stop at production of passenger cars only, but it also covers trucks, as the customs tariff on trucks up to 5-ton load was cut down to 32% instead of 40%; 5-9-ton load, to 22% instead of 40%; 9-18-ton load, to 12% instead of 40%; over 18-ton load, to 5% instead of 40% although the rate of local production of the first two categories reaches 70%. Thus, the customs differential in imported components decreased to less than 30% for the first item and less than 20% for the second item after the article 6 was applied. This means that the production of those two categories, which make up 90% of Egypt's production of trucks, will stop and the supply of local components from feeding industries will stop too.

"We will ask Al-Wafd for clarifications about such a meeting," Tagamo'h Secretary General Refaat Al-Sa'eed told Asharq Al-Awsat.
They try to find a way out through dealing with different parties to give an impression that they are open-minded but they are actually unchangeable, he said.
The Muslim Brotherhood Group in Egypt managed to break the political blockade imposed on it after its prominent leaders held meetings with liberal Wafd Party officials to discuss the formation of a "national reform committee" to be announced within days.
What we are going to agree on would come within the framework of undisputed democratic demands and dialogue would extend to include the rest of the parties," sources from both sides noted.
Wafd Party would not form alliances with any party or political trends in the coming legislative elections, he said, noting that Muslim Brotherhood was an indispensable political trend that cannot be ignored.
Wednesday's conference would discuss constitutional changes to achieve political reform in the country, conditions of parties and restrictions imposed on them, anti-corruption measures, influence of religious discourse on the society, Islam-democracy-freedom of expression relationship and women's position in Islam.
"What is happening in the Sudan needs cautious reconsideration, as this dear Muslim country has natural and human resources that make it worthy of contributing progress in the Islamic World. However, they meant to preoccupy it with its own affairs and problems; whenever it cures one of its wounds, another one gushes blood."
Akef slammed what is happening in Darfur, West the Sudan. The regrettable clashes between Arab and African tribes, who are both Muslims, rendered 250,000 refugees homeless. The problem is solved through Western relief and governmental agencies some of which seek to achieve goals that are averse to the Sudan. Meanwhile, this cause was missing in Arab and Islamic agendas.
A prominent leader in opposition Wafd Party uncovered the opposition of some prominent figures in the party to the recent rapprochement between Wafd Party and the Muslim Brotherhood Group.

PRESIDENT'S POLITICAL ADVISOR: GAMAL MUBARAK NOT NOMINATED FOR EXECUTIVE POST
In statements published by Al-Wifaq website, Al-Baz ruled out that Gamal would be appointed in an executive post. "The allusions lately made by an American newspaper are mere press fantasies," he said.
Al-Baz confirmed that President Mubarak is following up the situation and has his own sources from which he derives his information. "He does not rely on the reports of the ministries or control bodies," he added.
An official report issued recently by the People's Assembly (PA) said that the government still adopts a squandering policy in expenditure and that all that is reported about rationalizing expenditures is no more than slogans by which the government tries to polish its image and create a deceptive impression that it appropriates the biggest part of its capabilities and available resources for setting up service projects for citizens in all governorates.
The report inquired about the measures taken by the government to implement its announcement that annual expenditure would be cut down from 52 billion pounds to 30 billion pounds only.
Nasr Eddin asked the IAEA to reveal the secrets of Israeli Dimona reactor located on Arab borders with Israel, particularly after the end of its life expectancy. Israel distributed anti-radiation pills to villages and residential areas surrounding the reactor so that they would be able to avoid any radioactive leakage from the reactor.
The sources added that the message disclosed information to the effect that Israel had used "Caterpillar" bulldozers since 1967 to demolish 9000 Palestinian houses, which rendered 50000 citizens homeless. Moreover, the IDF used these bulldozers since the beginning of the 2000 uprising to uproot 200,000 olive trees and destroy in April 2000 a whole district in Jenin Refuse Camp in addition to the assassination of the American peace activist Rachel Courri who was run over by a D9-Caterpillar bulldozer on 16/3/2003 when she tried to obstruct it from destroying a Palestinian house in Gaza Strip.
President Arafat is urgently asked to link withdrawal with the Roadmap, which was totally buried by Sharon a long time ago.
This mission is unexpected to be easy despite the declared support from the United States, the European Union and the Quartet committee, which met specifically for this purpose concurrently with Solayman's visit to Ramallah and Tel Aviv.
Egypt will help train Palestinian officers and send Egyptian officers to Gaza to control both the ceasefire and Palestinian bodies.
All Egyptian proposals including Israeli pre-commitment not to carry out operations against Gaza in the future, evacuating Philadelphia corridor, re-operating Gaza airport and harbour under multinational forces' control, and raising the blockade imposed on Arafat have been met only with an emphasis that the Egyptian role should focus on fighting terrorism, i.e. disarming Palestinian factions and, eventually, playing the role of protecting Israel.
Due to Palestinian internal hurdles and the Israeli offensive policy, the Egyptian move will, therefore, turn from being an overture to implementing the Roadmap into a game played in the injury time.
The danger of Al-Qaeda getting access to possible Iraqi WMD is really on the cards, Russian deputy foreign minister said, pointing out that there is no evidence that the former Iraqi regime was in connection with Al-Qaeda.

Primakov cast doubt on Saddam's capture, saying, "It seemed fabricated." He expressed his conviction that Saddam handed himself over to the Americans and that the American Administration formulated the scenario of the arrest in a way that serves its goals.
Professor of Law and International Relations in Cairo University Dr. Abdullah Al-Ashal said that the transitional government though the occupation puppet, would gain relative legitimacy through the Security Council resolution unanimously passed. He added that there was glaring inconsistency between such a unanimously passed resolution investing the new government with political legitimacy and the council's refrainment from encouraging occupation or the recognition of any legal consequent effects.
Added to this, international expert counsellor Hassan Omar pointed out that a legal dilemma would face the government and the occupation authority if the daughter of Saddam Hussein and some former government elements announced a government in exile to be the "legitimate government" thus bringing a serious problem to the surface.
BREMER'S IRAQI GIRLFRIEND LEFT BAGHDAD PRIOR TO BREMER
Because her situation was very critical, the woman decided to move her family to live inside the Green Zone, a privilege won a by few Iraqis who are close to the coalition authority. Now, she had to move them once again to live in Amman, Jordan, three days ago in preparation for departure to the United States.

They may only withdraw from Iraqi cities to their outskirts when the Iraqi government becomes strong enough to defend itself and its own premises.
In a previous article, I wished that Dr. Eyad Allawi's government would seek to have a popular base or grassroots for it and for the liberal forces to prove itself in the elections in case they are held.
The training issue has spread far and wide in the Arab region, in fact, as a polite expression of the security and then military intervention.
Its combatant force ready for engagement does not exceed 55 thousand soldiers, some of them are currently serving in Afghanistan and others cannot just be exported to Iraq because of German and French objections.
It also enjoys the cordiality of Shiite religious parties and organizations, especially when it sees Abdel-Aziz Al-Hakim demanding that bankrupt Iraq should pay one hundred billion dollars to Iran in compensation for the 8-year war between Khomeini and Saddam.
Police and security collages used to match and even excel their numerous counterparts in Arab countries.
His nationalist record places his present and future above his sectarianism as a Shiite.
Allawi announced the dissolution of sectarian and ethnic militias with their bulk merging into Iraqi security forces.
Since monarchic and then republican Iraq was born and even under Saddam, sectarian and ethnic representation was valid, though theoretical and deformed, in the formation of governments and parliaments. The new Iraq today admits to this abominable face of fictitious democracy fraught with its sectarian and ethnic load.
This concern expressed by the Sunnites through negative or rather armed rejection of the new Iraq is, however, marred by the infiltration of some religious terrorism elements who turned from retail hunting of the Americans into wholesale killing of the Iraqis.
Strangely enough, the bankers' refusal coincided with a rise in the number of companies operative in that field.

A poll conducted by Alexandria Professional Syndicates Committee on Boycotting American and Israel Goods indicated that 73% of the polled people are not familiar with the qualified industrial zone (QIZ) that were established in cooperation with Israel.

The investments allocated for replacement and upgrading of projects hit 4.8 billion pounds or 17%. About 603 million pounds only will be allocated for expanding as well as setting up new projects, he emphasized.
He indicated that there are contracts for exporting about 100,000 palm leaves
The price of the Egyptian exported rice should be reconsidered to be able to compete and define the export target within a limit that does not exceed 450,000 tons with a view to achieving stability, he indicated.
Secretary General of the CCAC, Dr. Hamed Mabrouk said that the council used to set an exportation target, noting that the stability of the pound exchange rates and the tenders in which the holding company takes part on prices will go up.

They are also capable of introducing more efficient operation and production rules, he pointed out.
Minister of Investment, Mahmoud Mohieddin said that the main public banks such as the National Bank of Egypt and Banque Misr would not be privatized. But, this does not mean that the government has not already taken a decision to sell one of the four public banks. This step will be announced soon.
The sources pointed that there were another 26 banks whose grace periods were extended for another year by the CBE. Should they, however, fail to raise their capital, they would be merged next year.
The sources emphasized that a committee had been formed to study the banking sector's positions' compared such positions with the positions of banks in some other countries including Israel and Turkey and referred the results to the NDP Policies Committee which approved them.

He pointed out two criteria adopted when selling the public enterprise sector's companies the first, is selling those companies to investors who are able to run them with economic efficiency in order to preserve the public fund, the second came in coordination with the directives of the political leadership that stress ensuring personnel rights and not harming any worker by selling any of the public assets.
He pointed out that the period of leading the public enterprise according to what is called "one man show" had ended.
However, he pointed out that there is no backtracking on the incentives that were stated in the current investment law. At the same time he pointed out that there are excessive facilities and incentives that would be reconsidered. He called for giving the new board of directors of the General Investment Authority (GIA) with its new members, who have good experience and potential in spite of their relatively young ages, a 3-month period to be acquainted with the problems and the administrative elements in the GIA. Some of those elements, we admit are not qualified enough to deal with investors or perform their task effectively.
He noted that there is a big list of obstacles that face the application of the real estate finance law foremost of which is the registration and defining of income and also of interest rates to the end of the list of problems we need to solve.
The ten companies include fully state-owned companies, mainly Mamoura for Housing and Construction and Alexandria for Mineral Oils. The company would put for sale its shares in the two companies.
SERIOUS STEPS TO ACTIVATE PRIVATIZATION PROGRAMME
They said the real deficit will exceed 9.6 billion dollars during the current fiscal year, i.e. around 8 million pounds over the expected limit. They expressed their optimism about the ability of the new financial policy to activate national economy and attract more Arab and foreign investments in addition to supporting local industry. This, eventually, will increase proceeds in the long run due to the expansion of tax payers base. However, experts see that the problem will lie in how to avoid the crisis in the short run and distribute the burden of financing deficit in a normal way.
The new financial policy gives priority to activating economy, taking into consideration the fact that the budget deficit should not exceed the safe limits, he noted.
Professor of tax accounting at Ain Shams University, Dr. Said Abdel-Monem said the studies conducted by the Finance Ministry about the effect of tax reduction from 40% to 30%, affirmed that the decline in proceeds range from 3.5 to 5 billion pounds.
CONSTRUCTION, DEVELOPMENT OF 16 INVESTMENT ROADS

Projects will be presented to the parliament in its coming session, including the establishment of economic courts which are specialized in economic and commercial affairs, the minister said. Such courts will help settle economic disputes which caused the economic crisis to worsen.
Growth rates are also less than required. Foreign investment will not come to Egypt unless obstacles and bureaucracy are removed, he said.
Returns of commodity exports increased 30%; oil exports, 24%; tourism, 44%; Suez Canal, 27%; maritime and air transport services, 25%; expatriates' remittances, 1%; and aid and grants, 34% in comparison to the figures recorded last year.

Meanwhile, the balance of payments achieved a surplus of 3.7 billion dollars during the fiscal year 2003/2004 against 1.9 billion dollars in the last fiscal year.

AUTO MANUFACTURERS WARN OF NEGATIVE ASPECTS OF CUSTOMS TARIFF
Car Manufacturers Association submitted a memo to Prime Minister Dr. Ahmed Nazif, Finance Minister Dr. Youssef Botros Ghali and Minister of Foreign Trade and Industry Rashid Mohamed Rashid. The memo included proposals for introducing a supplement to the customs tariff amendments so that 18 factories can continue work. These factories have investments to the tune of 8 billion pounds. Some 17 thousand personnel in different engineering and technical specialties work for those factories, which include joint companies established in cooperation with international ones.
The Association also suggested exempting the locally produced passenger cars up to 1600 cc from the resources development charges which hit 3% and was applied last May. The customs release on imported components of local car plants (CKD) is no exports, 24%; tourism, 44%; Suez Canal, 27%; maritime and air transport services, 25%; expatriates' remittances, 1%; and aid and grants, 34% in comparison to the figur carried out without the approval of the General Organization for Industrialization in order to make sure that the rate of local industrialization was met and that it does not contain imported components that can be produced locally. The customs tariff, as mentioned before, was reduced to 40% for imported cars up to 1600 cc and it was reduced from 32% to 50% for imported trucks according to their relevant loads. Therefore, it is suggested to introduce a customs item for components and parts of dismantled cars which are sold to car assemblage plants as is the case in many countries like India and Morocco in order to achieve the minimum limit of difference between customs duties on imported components and the finished product so that local plants and feeding industries can continue production and compete with imported products regardless of the slight difference between prices.

Meanwhile, the sources expected that a number of the members of the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) policy committee, chaired by Gamal Mubarak, will be assigned ministerial posts in the new government, foremost of whom are head of People's Assembly education committee Dr. Hossam Badrawi who is expected to head the Ministry of Education and head of the NDP's Economic Committee Dr.
Amid this climate of change, official sources with the NDP said that president Mubarak would not leave his post as head of the ruling NDP, which he has been occupying since 1981, pointing out that Mubarak's chairmanship of the party is unanimously supported by all NDP members and leaderships.
The sources added that those who argue that Mubarak's chairmanship of the party obstructs power rotation among political parties can be answered by saying that ballot boxes are the thing that decides which party has the majority and, consequently, has the right to form the government.
Abied's statements were derived from the statements of premiers who preceded him. His statements may also be included in his successors'.
The arena becomes empty before the criticizers who highlighted the necessity of carrying out a drastic change. The critics ask for forming a public government according to the people's will to shorten the distance between the citizen and government and make the citizen the main partner in decision making.
Two days ago, Foreign Minister of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Nabil Shaath said that the Israeli aggression hinders any progress in the peace process. The Egyptian initiative is still on, he said. However, Egypt would not send security experts unless Israel stopped its aggression on the Palestinian people. Egypt does not accept shooting at Palestinians during the presence of Egyptian experts on Palestinian lands, he added.
A number of Egyptian prominent artists, writers and journalists launched a new public rally under the name of "National Movement for Change". The movement aims to start a public campaign to urge for amending the Constitution, especially with respect to electing the President and vice president through direct voting.
The new movement includes international film director Youssef Shahin; wirter Fahmi Howeidi, Arab Journalists' Union Secretary General Salaheddin Hafez; head of Al-Wasat Party, (under construction), Abul Ela Madi; former head of Judges Club Yehia Al-Refai; MP Hamdeen Al-Sabahi, who heads Al-Karama Party (under construction); Essam Al-Islamboli; journalist Gamal Fahmi; and chief editor of Al-Arabi newspaper Abdel-Halim Qandil.
The structure of the People's Assembly and Shura Council will be kept untouched in the constitutional amendment, i.e. keeping the 50% farmers and labour of the parliament makeup, let alone free education, health and social rights, they added.
Shura Council Speaker and NDP Secretary General Safwat El-Sherif's announcement of including the file of constitution amendment on the political reform map, although he did not set a date for such a step, may open the door for a comprehensive political compromise with different political and partisan forces, they indicated.
EGYPT MAKING READY TO RECEIVE MUBARAK WITH CELEBRATIONS TO PLEDGE SUPPORT
It is the first time for Mubarak to be absent for two weeks abroad. It is also the first time he travels for treatment.
Mubarak's health conditions are published on a daily basis in opposition newspapers, which softened their sharp tone in calling for political reforms after Mubarak had fallen sick lest their stands should not be misinterpreted as "impoliteness".
People's Assembly (PA) deputies, and opposition leadership welcomed the government's decision of backtracking on applying the idea of partisan proportionate list system. The decision that was announced by the state Ministry for Parliamentary Affairs and Assistant Secretary General of the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) Kamal El-Shazli will keep the currently enforced individual voting system.
Several deputies including Kamal Ahmed, Ibrahim Al-Gogary, Nagy Abdel Mon'em, Fayza Al-Tahnowi, Mohamed Khalid Quweita, Abdel-Mon'em Al-Tunsi, Mahfouz Helmi, Seif Mohmoud, Abdel-Wahab Quta, Farouq Metwalli and Refaat Bashir said that keeping the electoral individual system is mean to preserve the political trends legislative right, especially as independents are the key winners in the past parliamentary elections.
It is to be mentioned that the PA (the main legislative body in Egypt) does not apply the electronic voting system in spite of its possession of voting board.
"NEW REFORMISTS" START CHANGE SILENTLY
President Mubarak approved of the viewpoints of the new team of reformists led by Gamal Mubarak and more than 50 prominent personalities from the NDP, especially after Egyptians have realized the bad conditions of all society institutions. Reports, compiled by control bodies over the last two months also emphasized that dangers of corruption have become rampant in many state institutions, especially as circumstances have served the new reformists with the emergence of corruption cases, moral collapse and retreat of accountability policies in the society. The Egyptian leadership has become, then, aware that the whole country may sink in such a state of corruption, hence the inevitability of paying attention to the reform scenario that stresses the necessity of getting rid of the old guards together with their followers from decision-making circles and the government formations and introducing, on the other hand, essential and structural amendments to all state institutions through pumping fresh blood of young personalities who are not in the limelight. According to the elements of the political scene in Egypt, the coming days will carry a surprise - a comprehensive reform starting with sovereign ministers and the ministerial economic group till it reaches the main circles in the state.
Observers said that the advocates of the new thought in the National Democratic Party (NDP) have given the thumbs up in the last fortnight, especially after transferring Safwat Al-Sherif to Al-Shura (Advisory) Council Speakership.
The new thought quite contentedly disregards any talk about a new election act, an urgent need to constitutional amendments or the fact that corruption has run rampant turning into a mechanism for the redistribution of incomes at the expense of the vast majority of population.
The society has either to accept that and pay higher prices for commodities or accept the creation of unproductive job opportunities and relatively cheaper prices, a policy which the country cannot afford any more due to the public debt and budget deficit reaching a point that can hardly be surmounted.
PRESS IN THE BATTLE OF POWER PATRIMONY
Its chief editor, Samir Ragab, however, lost no time in denying such a disfavor pointing out Gamal's frequent praise of its progress and its calm detached tackling of various issues.
Karam promised to talk with us and gave us more than an appointment but our attempts to meet or talk to him were to no avail. Nevertheless, on the websites that oppose power patrimony, he has been pursued by sharp and sometimes sarcastic criticism of his phrases, which introduce Gamal, describing him as just like any Egyptian youth having worked for several years till he, with great difficulty, found a job in a bank.
His denial found applause from Al-Arabi. He, however, emphasizes that "Mr. Gamal" is a motive power and a collective vision representing the whole generation, charging the opposition with failure to visions put up any alternative to those put forward by the reformists, being content with just illusory demands, whereas Mr. Gamal could in just four years revive the "fragile" party and come into prominence.
Are we to inspect consciences as Abdullah Kamal accused us of trying to do? We carried our enquiries to Anwar Al-Hawari, Al-Masry Al-Youm Chief Editor. We rang him up more than once and it was only last week that we were referred to his office to find a decisive reply, "You've left us your idea and we have already informed Mr. Anwar of it, but he has not made up his mind yet."
"When we reminded him that the paper is still owned by a media man, Emad Eddin Adib who is also its editor in chief and, as far as I know, the only person who openly demanded that Gamal be appointed deputy President, Al-Alfi advised us to seek Mr. Emad's opinion adding that as a chief editor he had never been asked to side with any position or person or to support a particular orientation.
He rejected some people's tendency to classify the paper at will or simply to do so and then try to find a justification.
I, then, asked, "Have all these been confined to Gamal's personality" His reply was, "This is a natural development, as he is in charge of the NDP Policy Committee which all policies go through.
Al-Mustaqbal Al-Gadid premises, Othman Towers behind Merry Land is surrounded by heavy security guard. In the entrances there are monitoring cameras.
We only want to link the youth with the government.
But why Gamal, in particular?
When I added that the others whom we do not know should also have a chance, he replied, "We don't want grudges between parties!! (the exclamation marks are the writer's) Rashdan rejected the possibility of patrimony, the way it went in Syria as political trends in Egypt, according to Rashdan, are stranger than "Gamal" and would not permit a "patrimony".
GEDDAFI IN A BRITISH OPERA
According to technical producer Steve Shandra Saval who works on the Opera, the Libyan leader's biography is a good material for presenting various opera singing dimensions if we take into account his bodyguard of beauties.
Saval hopes that the opera will deal with several issues ranging from oil and trade on the one hand, and the Arab, then African orientation on the other hand, not to mention the explosion of Pan Am airplane over Lockerbie and financing Arab and international terrorist organizations in the 1970's and the 1980's.
Sources in the know disclosed that Arab League (AL) Secretary General Amr Moussa has declined to receive his salary from the AL financial budget for a year in an attempt to attract attention to the suffocating dire straits AL is facing.
Estimates show that only 49% has been contributed to the AL budget, as its members have not paid off their financial contributions in full.
Among the 22 Arab countries only Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Oman pay off their contributions regularly, while Libya has not paid yet its contributions for the past two years.
Although he threatened more than once to tender his resignation due to sharp criticisms to which he was exposed from some Arab capitals, Mossa is still optimistic about the possibility of solving the AL financial crisis by the end of his term in office in 2006.
What is the Palestinian stance towards the Egyptian move?
But there is historical information that can shed light on this issue.
It is difficult to ignore the relation, or at least the possibility of a relation between both visits and the Egyptian role in Gaza.
It should be noticed that it is only one condition even if it is related to an issue that is vital and important for the Palestinian refugees who lived in the Diaspora for more than half a century.
If this is true, Egypt would have expressed its surprise at this big and unprecedented shift.
The Egyptian role in this framework provides an Arab cover for the Israeli explanation of the US roadmap peace plan.
The Egyptian role will probably remain restricted under the the Israeli withdrawal plan, which is a pure security plan. This means that the security mission will be entrusted to Egypt, and then Israel will devote itself to implementing its schemes in the West Bank.
On the other hand, the US Administration, through Assistant Secretary of State William Burns, welcomed the Egyptian initiative. It, however, refused to present any guarantees that could be conveyed by Cairo to the Palestinians.
The official stance of the PNA welcomes the new Egyptian role. More than a Palestinian official considered this role as a result of Palestinian-Egyptian understanding.
Palestinian expectations may be more optimistic, while Egyptian abilities are restricted by the Israeli "veto" and the US bias.
This means that Egypt will not wait for long to find itself in a crossroads between the Palestinians on the one hand and between Palestinians and Israelis on the other hand.
Egypt has no influence on the Israeli decision regarding the withdrawal plan.
Even if there were guarantees from the US Administration which might be undeclared due to circumstances of the year of elections, this is not so important as the US policy towards the region over the last two decades uncovered that the adoption by any US administration of the idea of guarantees with any Arab party against Israel is not more than a mechanism for buying Arab approval, hence the ignoring of such guarantees so that they would became meaningless in the course of time.
The question is this: On what does Egypt depend in its expected role in Gaza?
Maybe there are guarantees and accounts we know nothing about.
At the end of the third quarter, foreign debt reached 29,434,300 US dollars compared 29.703 billion dollars in the second quarter of the reporting year.

On the floor of their small flat, two girls sat with their two suckling babies, the eldest of whom is only ten months. Around them sat other flatmate girls, doing their daily work and playing with the two babies. Babies are considered the youngest two occupants in the Al-Amal Orphanage for Girls. But the surprise is that the age of their mothers ranges between 13 and 15 years.
The new center will provide those young mothers with shelter, health care, legal and educational services as well as programs for training them in different crafts and skills with the aim of giving them the opportunity to earn their living.

This institution also supports constructive initiatives that aim at rehabilitating children and adolescents in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Abdel Halim warned against allowing multinationals to invest in the Nile water projects. He described their access to investment in water in the Nile Basin countries as a "new form of colonization in the region".

Egyptian Minister of Wakfs Dr. Mohamed Hamdi Zaqazoq emphasized that the renewal of religious discourse in Egypt was inevitable and had nothing to do with any USA pressure or demands.
During his recent meeting, he emphasized that the American ambassador asked for nothing against Islam as some people alleged. They were discussing the selection of preachers to be sent by Egypt to America in the month of Ramadan.
Regarding the regulations of building mosques, the Minister of Wakfs said, "It is just unreasonable to have a mosque built at too close intervals.
The number of female farmers exceeds 7 millions, i.e. 10 percent of population and 3 percent of workforce. Although Egyptian female farmers represent 48 percent of agricultural workforce and produce 40 percent of farm produce, about 71 percent of them do not receive wages. This increases illiteracy rate among them to 40.3 percent of total Egyptian illiterates. This rate may reach 85 percent in some areas, the study indicated.
Al-Azhar scholars (some of whom saw it as a response to American pressures) objected to the decision.
The decision, nevertheless, has created a sensation among Al-Azhar scholars, teachers and students despite constant denial on the part of Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh Dr Mohamed Sayed Tantawi and the Minister of Wakfs that there was any foreign pressure on religious establishments.
Concerns also heightened following statements by Dr Ahmed Al-Tayeb, President of Al-Azhar University in an interview with a religious paper last week that a Cabinet committee would shortly evaluate full faculties affiliated to Al-Azhar University. Any faculty which lacks all educational requirements shall be closed down as "such faculties represent a drain on the university resources".

Head of the delegation, priest Marcos Aziz, pastor of the Virgin Mary Church, told Al-Hayat that he asked his friends of Muslim scholars whether they would have agreed to have such scenes shot in a mosque and they definitely declined and showed their solidarity with the Egyptian Copts seeking to necessarily have that movie halted. The movie's director and producer are distrusted to involve Christianity in dramas in a proper manner, Aziz said, pointing out that the director, in particular, does not abide by the church's teachings.

Head of General Organization for Developing Piscine Wealth Dr. Talaat Nasreddin called on businessmen to invest in fish farms.
Egypt exports only 3500 tons of different kinds of fish and shrimps, he noted. 51% of Egypt's total fish production comes from fish farms, while 49% comes from natural resources such as lakes etc, even though growth rates in natural resources are very poor.
He confirmed that there are cooperation protocols with Somalia, Sudan, and Eritrea through which Egyptian vessels would be allowed to fish in the territorial waters of those countries in certain times. Meanwhile, some countries like Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Spain refused to allow Egyptian fishing vessels to fish in their territorial waters. The organization needs 195 million pounds to remove weeds that spread in lakes, causing a shortage of piscine production.

Everything is probable in Britain except for Libyan leader Geddafi becoming an item for an opera currently prepared by British National Opera House to be shown on its theatre in London at the beginning of 2006 if everything was OK.
Saval thinks that the National Opera House decision to achieve that work indicates the development of the opera from an art for the elite into a popular art, hence the absence of any restrictions regarding the composed item: Geddafi.
The new opera music will not be classical but will include a mixture of the rap and the pop, etc in order to attract a new audience of youth who belong to other races in Britain.

It is to be mentioned that during the opening session of the 16th Arab Summit that was held in Tunis in May last Mossa highlighted the necessity of finding a quick solution to the AL suffocating financial crisis, which may lead the AL to go bankrupt and stop most of its vital activities.
A report compiled by the AL Secretariat said that the hazards resulting from the AL-member states unpunctuality in paying off their contributions to the AL on due time were ridiculously.
RELATION BETWEEN US BALFOUR DECLARATION AND NEW EGYPTIAN ROLE
And finally, What does Egypt hope to achieve through this move?
Egypt's accepta nce of playing that role came after the visit paid by Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom to Egypt and his meeting with presidential advisor Osama Al-Baz on 7 June.
If this assumption is true, the link between the two incidents will be the then so-called Second Balfour Declaration announced by US President Bush during President Mubarak's visit to the US.
It is noticed here that this American Balfour declaration was given to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon during his visit to the White House.
To the contrary, nothing of that happened, but rather there was unprecedented Egyptian readiness to return to Gaza within the framework of the Israeli withdrawal plan.
Egypt may look to its role from the perspective of its support of the Palestinians and guaranteeing an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.
Sharon clearly stressed his refusal of any political dimension for the Egyptian role.
And even if circumstances required that the Egyptian role should gain a political dimension after the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, this dimension will remain within the limits of mediation between the Palestinians and Israelis. It will remain just like an Arab shadow of the American role, which is essentially aimed to give Israel the right to veto the proposals and solutions that don't harmonize with its views and political and security interests.
In fact, given the deterioration of the Palestinian situation including the PNA; divisions, corruption and the Israeli ferocious attacks not to mention the deteriorating Arab political situation, the PNA had to accept the proposed Egyptian role as this role may be a protection shield in the face of Israeli attacks.
The Israelis want to make security in Gaza an Egyptian responsibility and the Palestinians want Egypt to return them to the negotiating table with the Israelis.
Palestinian factions may alleviate their refusal of the Egyptian role, but until when?
However, the refusal of the plan by Sharon's Likud party caused it to change and be divided into four stages, each of which to be subjected to a vote by the cabinet.
In fact, this happened many times with the Egyptians and Palestinians.
Nobody knows, including the Egyptians themselves.
Anyhow, the answer to this question is known by Egyptian foreign policy-makers until further notice.
Medium and long-term loans out of Egypt's total foreign debts at the end of the third quarter hit 27,650,300 US dollars from 27,955,700 US dollars at the end of the second quarter.
"I just want my family's property of houses and lands that were usurped by Israel or even by Sharon himself."
TECHNOLOGICAL SYSTEM TO ACTIVATE AND SUPPORT INVENTIONS AND INNOVATIONS IN ARAB REGION

Yesterday (4th July), Minister of Wakfs (Religious Endowments) Dr Hamdi Zaqzouq said that several decisions had been taken regarding building Azharite religious institutes and mosques. He emphasized that such procedures aimed at promoting objectivity and observing demographic distinctions as well as public controls and standards.
Azharite sources said, "Attempts have been made to hush up the matter to avoid public opinion incitement. However, this blackout or denial became useless as the government decision text including 10 items had been sent to Al-Azhar officials."
EGYPT TO ORGANIZE ISLAMIC CHRISTIAN SPORTS FESTIVAL
Churches often sponsor useful activities for youth and children during the summer vacation to support them intellectually, culturally, spiritually and socially.
Egyptian Copts translated their anger and condemnation of baheb es-sima (I Love the Cinema) movie, which is showing, into action. Four senior priests as well as Christian and Muslim lawyers submitted a memo to Prosecutor General Maher Abdel-Wahed's office, calling on him to have the movie stopped and take legal action against the movie's producer and director.
It is noteworthy that a number of dramas had previously stimulated Copts, such as awan al-ward (the Season of Flowers) serial, which portrayed an ideal marriage between a Muslim man and a Coptic girl, a marriage that is opposed by Egyptian Copts. The serial's scenario was, consequently, changed in later episodes to emphasize that the church considers such a kind of marriage as troublesome.

"The problem of attracting the American market is attributed to the absence of direct foreign airlines to Egypt," head of the Egyptian Federation of Chambers of Tourism Elhami Azayyat said, adding that this problem tops the problems that face growth of this market. He urged that such companies be encouraged to open direct airlines. "There're large numbers of American tourists who want to visit Egypt, but the absence of direct airlines hinders their move. Moreover, the American tourist lacks awareness about Egyptian destinations, let alone unrest in the Middle East that affects the move of tourists, especially after American tourism to Israel had come to a halt," ASTA chief in Egypt said.

IKHWAN REFUSE TO MEET USCIRF
Sources inside the Ikhwan Group did not rule out that head of Ibn Khaldoun Centre Dr. Saadeddin Ibrahim has a key role in including the Ikhwan in the Religious Freedom Committee report due to his close relation with the Americans and his relation with the Ikhwan that developed while he was imprisoned. Therefore, he acted as a go-between for the Ikhwan and some Europeans, thus resulting in holding a joint meeting in a club in Cairo, which was considered as a dialogue between the Ikhwan and Europeans.

ALL SUDAN, NOT ONLY DARFUR IS TARGETED
ABSENT DOSSIER FROM NAZIF'S AGENDA!
It does not appear whether from the careful reading of the letter or the new prime minister's passing remarks that a different policy will be adopted by the new cabinet.
At a time Egypt is getting ready for new government a poll carried out by Al-Alam Al-Youm revealed that 82% of the business, banking, stock exchange and trade communities welcome the cabinet reshuffle. This was clear in their answers to four questions raised by the poll. The poll showed that 70% of the samples said that the ex-government have not kept its promises included in its 5 plans submitted to the People's Assembly, while 30% only said the opposite.
Under this headline Mohamed Abdel-Gawad, member of the National Democratic Party policy committee and a researcher in Al-Ahram Center for Strategic Studies, writes an article which runs to the following effect only in part: Remarkably, Dr Nazif is not known to be well versed in the spheres of national economy management, which used to be for long the primary responsibility of Egypt's premier. Nor do we know whether Dr Nazif has any defined vision in that sphere.
The government in Egypt is more of a technical and administrative body than a political one, some indicators show that Dr Nazif's government was part of a wider scale political reform process according to Egyptian standards of course.
NAZIF GOVERNMENT BEST REPRESENTATION OF NDP'S POLICIES
He believes in timetables, which define beginnings and endings. However, he has all right to be given ample time to work and show the results of his carefully-chosen cabinet.
NEW GOV'T WITH OLD MENTALITY
Secretary General of the National Democratic Party and Speaker of the Shura (Advisory) Council Safwat Al-Sherif said that he had agreed with NDP Policy Secretary Gamal Mubarak to postpone sine die the Supreme Council for Policies meeting, slated for Wednesday (14th June), until coordination is done with the premier and his ministers.
On the other hand, lawmen and parliamentarians urged for the activation of Ministers Accountability Act issued in the late 1950's and the Illegal Gain Act issued in 1950 and amendments thereof.
Head of the Arab Nasserite Party Diaaeddin Daoud said, "We have not yet known the new government's policy so that we could be able to assess the situation objectively. There is, however, an important issue of changing many personalities and forming the government of Dr. Nazif whom we heard some people praising."
"We can neither be optimistic nor pessimistic towards the new government as there is no optimism on the horizon. What is more important, after changing is political change, as no benefit would result if things remained unchanged. Rather, things would be worse in case conditions remained unchanged," Akef added.
The choice of Dr. Ahmed Nazif as premier was attributed to his technological interests and his relation with the new cognitive community which had helped achieve an amazing leap in developed countries, thus indicating a new vision advocating the Egyptian state in a bid to benefit by it.
It, nevertheless, indicates a continuation of the state's crisis in its quest for updating and changing leaderships.
By the same token, it can be argued that the new generation's selection criteria rely on a tendency to choose young technocrats and that the Policies Supreme Council changed into a "laboratory" for the election of new echelons instead of qualifying them through their involvement in the thick of public political life bottle and urging them to mix with society components in a bid to possess natural leading capabilities.
The fact that most old elements (20 in number) will retain their positions in the government will obviously one of the strong negative factors impeding the implementation of the new ideas which the young generation seeks to promote in the party and the state, especially as far as attempts of development, political and constitutional reform are concerned.

The Egyptian side in the Egyptian-American Business Council which headed for Washington last Saturday will discuss this issue with the American officials.
These expectations were enhanced by the phone call President Hosni Mubarak received from Iranian President Mohammed Khatami to congratulate him on the success of the surgery he had in Munich.

OPPOSITION PARTIES: POLITICAL REFORM FIRST
People should be put on the right track and the state of one man should be come to an end," he said. Economic reform would be of no avail unless it is preceded by a political one.
Afterwards and in a next step we should face our urgent problems such as unemployment, prices rise, and corruption, he said.
Intellectuals issued a call under the title of "Comprehensive Reform and Power Rotation" considering the main solution to get out of this grinding crisis is to carry out urgent reforms such as canceling emergency law, carrying out constitutional reform that allows electing the President of the republic and the vice-president from among more than one candidate and for two terms in office, confining the president powers, unleashing freedoms of setting up parties, issuing papers, forming societies and conducting fair parliamentary elections.
Member of the supreme authority of the opposition Al-Wafd Party Dr. Ibrahim Abaza said the new government is technocratic and is not far different from the former three governments which all came to achieve economic reform.
"I think we need a new package of political and economic reform, to give us a spark of hope," he said.
The Egyptian Businessmen Association welcomed the new make-up and expressed its confidence in the new government's ability to make big changes that can help improve economic performance, raise the standard of living, increase foreign investments and face various challenges.
He called on the government to stop recruitment as this is considered disguised unemployment.
This, according to Abdel-Fattah, means that the new government will be a copy of the former governments which established the theory of technocratic and bureaucratic theory.
The political arena will witness important changes next September following the winding up of the National Democratic Party (NDP) congress.
THE NEW CABINET IN FIGURES
Now in the government of Dr. Ahmed Nazif, and after those three ministers were excluded, Minister of Culture Farouk Hosni is the minister who spent the longest term in office, as he has been occupying his post since 1987, i.e. about 17 years.
He was 42 years old when he was firstly appointed, thus he was the youngest minister, until Dr. Nazif, who was born in 1952 also, joined the government.
Afterwards, he was appointed as minister of foreign trade, when the ministry of economy was canelled in Dr. Atef Ebeid's government.
As regards age, Minister of Manpower Ahmed Al-Amawi is the oldest minister, 72 years old. He was born in 1932. Thus, the average of ages among members of the new government declined by 10 years at one go, compared to the previous government.

Observers may notice that the summit has endorsed a role for Turkey, as a NATO-member, to implement the Greater Middle East Initiative that was formerly endorsed by the G-8 summit on June 8th last. The initiative aims at bringing about all-out changes in the countries of the Middle East and South Africa.
On the formal level we can accept this logic, but as far as content is concerned the matter will be somehow different, which should not be underestimated by the Arab world as a whole.
In fact, NATO's proposal of dialogue with countries to the south of the Mediterranean is not new, as this proposal has been offered since 1994 and much of its rounds took place quietly between all the Arab Mediterranean countries to the exclusion of Libya and Syria. Those rounds were confined to exchanging views and familiarizing Arab countries with the new role of NATO in light of the international variables. Some of those rounds tended to show the NATO's role as presentation and those countries as recipients, who kept deep doubts regarding this dialogue, especially as a country like Egypt has a constant principle in its foreign policy based on rejecting joining any military pacts or setting up such pacts in the Arab region.
Contenting ourselves with the negative response and reiterating certain statements and principles is not the best solution, especially as pressure on the parties concerned will not stop. There is a need to crystallize a new approach to deal with NATO as an international political and military organization. Such a need emanates from the futility of avoiding developments that take place around us, or attaching to historical experiences that were, of course, great at certain times. If we take into account all these variables, we will find that we need to build a regional security based on concepts, visions and interests of the members of the region.
As long as the Israeli policy is aggressive, brutal and obscure regarding its nuclear program, Israel will have no right to be a member in the regional security system any way. Setting up a regional economic or security system requires mutual transparency, balanced burdens and commitments, harmonious in visions and real interests based on a real popular support and before that relinquishing calls for hegemony. As such conditions are absent from the formula of NATO's dialogue with each Arab country, they are absent also from any talk relative to Israel's join of any regional security system to be set up by the Arabs if they want.

However, a legal source at the Customs Department denied so, stressing that the rulings of the Supreme Constitutional Court are not applied retrospectively to the collected taxes and charges, as they are rendered unconstitutional by a court ruling. The law no. 168 of 1998 stipulates that an unconstitutional text has, in most cases, a direct effect on dropping the text, while no taxpayer has the right to apply court rulings retrospectively.
The initiative, as the minister said comprises three main axes: firstly, increasing trade exchange between the two countries to two billion dollars in three years' time so that Egyptian exports could not reach less than one billion dollars, 0.2% of Chinese imports from world countries.
Thirdly, establishing a permanent office at Cairo for China Council for Promoting International Trade (CCPIT) so that it could help Egyptian medium and small-sized projects to export to Chinese markets through providing training and marketing studies and information and taking part in Chinese international tenders.

If it has been logical of the Egyptian press and government to welcome such a vote as the Egyptian army has relied on the USA for arms and military assistances since late president Anwar Sadat ventured to tense the Egyptian-Russian relations after the October 1973 victory which was won with Soviet arms and then signed the Camp David Peace Accord (1978) and the peace treaty between Sadat and Begin (1979) and the American Administration decision to reward both Israel and Egypt by offering economic and military assistance.

What are the reasons for such debts? Are they logical such as financing budget deficits or exploiting such debts for serious investment projects according to well-defined plans? There are, to start with, conflicting estimates of Arab debts to the external world.
Regarding his vision of the economic and political effects of Arab debts crisis, Dr. Abdel Azim says that such debts have multifarious reflections including social, economic and political aspects especially due to the development of the globalization movement and the domination of international blocs and multinational companies over international economy.

Under this headline, Salama Nimat of Al-Hayat writes an article, which runs to the following effect: As long as over 70% of the world's oil is either "Islamic" or passes through pipelines in Islamic lands, the tug-of-war between America and Islamic countries may well continue until one party either wins the other's heart or just controls it.
While America could militarily intervene in "rogue" countries that might threaten world peace in Afghanistan and Iraq to ensure America's leading position in the world, Washington will have to find more "civilized" means to abort unified Europe and China's attempts to reach the quest which Saddam Hussein sought but failed to reach by occupying Kuwait as a prelude to subjecting oil Gulf States to his policies and ambitions that transcended the region's borders.
So did it with Iran's Shah because of his ambition to dominate the oil region for reinforcing his regional role and international status.
It is no secret that America refuses to impose taxes on oil consumption as Europe does in order to keep American production cost lower than European production cost, thus giving Washington an economic advantage which it wants to keep.

The sources told Al-Ahram Al-Arabi that the last week witnessed an urgent Egyptian move towards Libya of the incessant developments in the Sudanese file.

"How could America urge Egypt to sign the agreement, and then it asks for delaying it?" the source wondered. He went on to say if Egypt and Israel reached any agreement, there should be an effective role of the American Administration in it. So, there is not any progress in that respect without the three parties' approval. The American commercial representative closely follows up the issue, he pointed out.

He expected that extending the pipeline for conveying the Egyptian natural gas to Israel would start with the advent of the coming year. He pointed that this agreement would remove any hope for selling the Palestinian gas to Israel as the Palestinian electricity company had formed a consortium with British Gas with a view to winning a deal for exporting the Palestinian gas to Israel while EMG was awarded the deal.
Under that system a technical committee will be formed to ascertain that the value added rate are met by the factories in the countries with which trade agreements were concluded.

Petroleum Minister Sameh Fahmi and Chairman of the People Assembly's Committee on Industry and Energy Dr. Ameen Mubarak witnessed the signature of an agreement for establishing an Egyptian-German Company for designing and producing pumps according to international specifications in the framework of the petroleum sector's strategy for enhancing local manufacture, increasing the local component to reduce reliance on importation, rationalizing the usage of foreign exchange so as to raise hard currency surpluses, achieve the best economic use of natural resources, increase the value added, create new job opportunities for youth and transfer and develop modern technologies.
The new plant will help create 150 new job openings, including workers and engineers of the governorate. The minister pointed out that the plant would start production in its first stage by the end of 2005, in which the local component would be less than 50% to rise to 93% of the end product later.
Orascom refused to announce the deal value. However, it said it would announce the details of the deal later according to the rules of declaration in Cairo and Alexandria stock exchanges as well as Karachi stock exchange in which CHAKWAL's stakes are registered. The new plant, which will be established by OCI, is expected to serve the major province in Pakistan; Punjab whose population hits around 90 million.

The former ministry's random policy as well as the present ministry's lack of clear vision caused the loss of Egyptian long staple cotton external markets. Exports contracts went down from 3.5 million kantars in the last season to 1.5 million kantars in this season. Cotton prices collapsed in the domestic market. The price per kantar retreated from LE1000 in the last season to LE600 in the current season; which is the guarantee price defined by the Agriculture Ministry as a minimum for selling and buying the crop.
The sources said that the Egyptian and American crops of that type of cotton are similar with Egypt claiming 46% of international production due to the Egyptian cotton long staple advantage. The American Administration, therefore, resorted to illegal stratagems to undermine the Egyptian cotton competitiveness. It applied two systems for subsidizing export and spinneries, relying on subsidizing buying the crop from farmers.

Khaled Mohamed Ali of Al-Osboa write an article to say: Within the framework of its preemptive wars and its management of the world through preventive strikes, the United States sexed up escalation of the situation in Sudan.
1. Making a huge media uproar to contain the repercussions of Abu-Ghraib abuses. The US automotive could tow the old vehicles of Europe and the absent Arab media as far as the target station.
The urgent part is to strike the Egyptian-Sudanese detente and excluding the Egyptian role completely from Sudan. Experts at American research centers monitored such official, popular and organized approach between the two peoples of Egypt and Sudan. This detente was represented in signing many agreements, foremost of which were the four freedoms agreement which allows the two peoples the freedom of possession, travel, residence and trade. This means that there is real integration between the biggest Arab country in terms of human resources and experience and the biggest Arab and African country in terms of area and natural resources. The Egyptian-Sudanese detente poses a threat to the American vision regarding the conflict-torn Sudan.
The third good is the Arab gum, which is used in many strategic industries especially cola drinks and medicines. It is concentrated in the area of conflict in Darfur and sold to the US as a raw material. It is considered a target for a big number of American companies.

Khalid Mesha'al, head of Hamas' Politburo, cast doubt on the background of what is so-called "reform Intifada" because he thinks that some Palestinian officials raised the banner of 'anti-corruption" to "settle personal scores " converge with US-Israeli reform agenda to "exclude" President Arafat from the political game.
It also seems that he was alluding to former Security Affairs Minister Mohamed Dahlan when he mentioned financial corruption related to wheat and cement deals.
Hamas' spokesman Sami Abu Zohri unveiled to Al-Hayat contacts and efforts exerted by the movement inside and outside Palestine to end the rift erupted 10 days ago. The quarrel started following the abduction of Palestinian Police chairman Ghazi Al-Jibali in addition to a liaison officer in South Gaza Strip and another 4 French people.
Such contacts and meetings came within the framework of efforts made by Hamas Movement to solve the internal crisis.
PALESTINIAN QUANDARY!
The Israelis and the Americans, however, know well - after they had made constant contacts - on whom they could depend.
The goal is to pull out from Gaza to swallow as much of West Bank territories as possible through settlements, the wall or under any other pretext.
In the Iraqi turmoil where occupation forces still see that they invaded the country in order to achieve the noblest and sublime goals, the Israeli occupation forces, in turn, are allowed then to cook "solutions" at its own will or specifically to destroy what it wants to protect its violations, robberies and crimes.
Thus, they let Sharon continue his sabotage policies and asked the PNA to conduct reform.
It is the Palestinian President who should not allow an intra-Palestinian division over his leadership to take place.
Arafat, on the other hand, has no advantage in letting Sharon decide his own destiny, nor has he an interest in being a problem to his people one day.
For his part, Dr. Gab Allah Ali Gab Allah, Minister of Culture consultant and head of the Egyptian delegation to the committee, said representatives of 137 countries, including 24 countries, which have voting right, took part in the committee meeting.

If any tremors hit the 50-year-old nuclear reactor of Dimona in Negev Desert, fatal radiations could be released threatening millions of people in neighbouring Arab states, former Israeli nuclear technician Vanunu warned, describing this possibility as "second Chernobyl".
"Israel is very concerned about my release because it knows well that my activities could escalated the Israeli nuclear armament issue on the international arena," he added. Israeli nuclear weapons are in themselves an imminent threat to the Middle East, he opined.
Vanunu lives now in East Jerusalem at which he works as a bell-ringer at the Anglican Church after he embraced Christianity in prison 19 years ago.
The Leading Bureau of the ruling party under al-Bashir convened an extraordinary meeting to discuss Darfur crisis, possible foreign military intervention in the country and government measures to face the situation.
The ruling party decided to launch a large-scale diplomatic and political drive, al-Khalifa said, noting that President al-Bashir would fly to Russia and other countries to inform their leaders of latest developments in Darfur.
Egyptian medical mission returning back from refugee camps in Darfur denied allegations of wide-ranging rape operations carried out by Janjaweed elements against African women there.
The Sudanese government raised the state of alert to face possibilities of foreign military intervention in Darfur, West Sudan.
He argued that talk about Darfur is "a step to intervene in Sudan". Nafie harshly criticized the US, revealing that the US used the weapons of mass destruction issue as a pretext to intervene in Iraq but now it faces a fierce battle there.
This striking fact is really apparent in the growing tone of such a fuss that came following the signing of a peace agreement between the Sudanese government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), south Sudan.
While it tries to have a UN Security Council resolution passed against Sudan, Washington insists on vetoing any resolution condemning the brutal crimes perpetrated by the Israeli occupation in the Palestinian lands.
IS THERE ANY RELATION BETWEEN DARFUR AND IRAQI WMD?
Iraq was, therefore, attacked and its people were tortured and humiliated while the story of WMD was turned out to be a fiasco.
The Sudanese government is accused of practising ethnic cleansing against the Africans in favour of the Arabs, a charge that is totally contrary to the reality in Darfur because what is taking place in Darfur is subject to internal complicated factors, which the Sudanese government is doing its best to solve!
This argument has been proved by Britain announcing to send 5000 soldiers to Darfur and Australia welcoming to participate in a military mission there - the same triangle that was formed ahead of invading Iraq!
Under the agreement, Petrodar will undertake exploration operations and link wells to each other together with assembling and refining centers. It will also run refineries, the six pumping stations, an integrated export-oriented port, oil transport pipelines and communication lines.
Meanwhile, Sudan's Minister of Energy and Mining Dr. Awadh al-Gaz said during the signing ceremonies that his ministry would continue developing the Sudanese oil sector. During the ceremonies, attended by Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir, al-Gaz stated these agreements were meant to promote development efforts of our people and ensure a safe access to the age of technologies and developed industries.
Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah, a prominent member of the royal family in Kuwait, voiced his concern that America may force Kuwait to submit regional concessions in favor of settling situation in Iraq. "I fear that I live to see the day when someone says that Umm Qasr Port and Werba and Bubiyan islands are an issue needs reconsideration," Al-Sabah was quoted as saying.
ISRAELI SABOTAGE SCHEME IN ARAB COUNTRIES
Israeli sources uncovered that the secret meeting was held on July 14th, adding that hundreds of Mossad agents were living in North Iraq from which they moved into Iraq and other countries using foreign passports and receiving orders from espionage stations officials in the region. The sources said that there were three Israeli espionage stations in the region, one of which lies in Qatar and the second in Arbel in North Iraq. A number of Israeli spies were arrested in New Zealand while trying to steal passports to be used for terrorist acts in unidentified quarters.
It is noteworthy that Iyad Alawi's government in Iraq decided to cancel the ban on travel to Israel in the new Iraqi passports.
Al-Shara was addressing Syrian journalists. He replied to their questions about relations with Iraq after Allawi's visit and with America and Europe as well as Israeli penetration of Iraq.
"President Al-Assad said that Damascus would support any Lebanese president," he said, emphasizing that the issue of giving Lebanese President Emil Lahud another term in office is a Lebanese decision rather than a Syrian president's.
After Al-Shara had emphasized that his country's stance was not hard-line nor was it based on alleging that Syria has weapons of mass destruction striking a strategic balance with Israel, he pointed out that what is demanded from Syria is an "Israeli demand". "How can there be partnership with Europe if they adopt the Israeli vision?"
Syria's argument embarrassed the Europeans. "If the goal is disarmament in parallel with establishment of peace we will support this move, whether this will be before or after peace," he said.
Meanwhile, deputy Hussein Al-Haj Hassan, who belongs to the same bloc, called for dealing with agents as a phenomenon not as individuals and removing the political cover that protects and encourages them.

The complaints' lawer Fayz Al-Haj Shaheen filed a complaint with the public prosecutor Adnan Addom against Libyan leader Gaddafi and 17 Libyan officials for being responsible for kidnapping Sadr and his two escorts in Libya and forging official documents to cover up the crime.
It is to be mentioned that the Libyan Jewish community intensified their activity recently. Head of the Libyan Jewish community Raphael Falah held a press conference in London in which he highlighted the necessity of coexistence between Arabs and the Jews, as, according to Falah, they were always partners.
He added that the Jews fought the Italian occupation beside their Libyan brothers, as a Libyan Jewish division consisting of five thousand soldiers participated in fighting the Fascists. The Arabs had also helped the Jews in the Nazi detention camps as they smuggled food and relief to them, Falah added.
The Libyan leader Mu'ammar Gaddafi took the most important step by announcing Libya's scrap of weapons of mass destruction in addition to other wise steps like the settlement of the case of Lockerbie and other outstanding issues with Western states.

Criminal aspects would certainly unfold, but political aspects are the raison d'etre of the whole crisis. Public opinion has a right to know the reasons which might urge an international scientist of Dr. Hamza's size to think, just think of assassinating his main opponent the Housing Minister!

Gamal is immersed in the realm of power, while people are totally engaged in their realms and affairs, do not approach him, wait for him or pin hopes on him.

Moreover, a second deputy chairperson, whether man or woman, will be also chosen, especially after efforts to persuade Niveen Lotfi, a prominent cadre with CitiBank in the USA, to undertake this post on the heels of a conference held in Sharm El-Sheikh by the bank last month failed. Besides, other cadres belonging to the American school (CitiBank), to which Ahmed Al-Baradie belongs, are being sought to assume responsibility of the general director and board member who supervises the bank's investments in joint companies and banks, a post that has been vacant since the recent Taba blasts in which Shahir Kalta was killed.
At the National Bank of Egypt's level, there is still a chance to promote Zeinab Abul-Farag, general director of the bank's legal sector, especially in light of rumours about leadership changes in the bank.
However, Negm ruled out the possibility of political directives regarding promoting female cadres due to being ladies or belonging to foreign banking schools, especially CitiBank and others, which he described as useless with domestic banks because the American banks have certain approaches and culture that are different from Egyptian economic and cultural circumstances. European banks and banking schools are closer to us in terms of credit, banks and finance, he noted.
However, president of Bank of Commerce and Development (El-Tegaryoun) Fatehi Yassin said that such changes in the leading posts were less important that mergers and their role in the banking reform, adding that the plan of promoting ladies with Egyptian banks is true, especially the aforementioned names. This trend is supported by the absence of equally qualified men cadres or even women belonging to the Egyptian banking school, he pointed out.
Minister of Planning Othman Mohamed Othman said direct subsidy surged up to 10.3 billion pounds last year against 6.9 billion pounds in the previous year, up 49 percent. Direct subsidy is part of a state policy to provide basic and necessary commodities to people, especially low-income categories.
EGYPT ACHIEVED HIGHEST GROWTH RATE IN EXPORTS TO COMESA LAST YEAR
Taking into consideration the relative importance of COMESA countries among Egypt's trade partners, we find that Egypt's exports to COMESA countries last year hit 130.2 million dollars (2.11%) against 2.005 billion dollars to the European Union (33.3%) and 1.039 billion dollars to Arab countries (17%).
If we draw a comparison between Egypt's net trade balance with COMESA countries in 1997 and 2003, we will find that Egypt's trade balance with COMESA countries achieved a surplus with a number of member countries. Sudan comes first with 32 million dollars at an increase rate of 1027% followed by Mauritius with a surplus of 4 million dollars at an increase rate of 480% over 1997.
Kenya is the biggest exporter to Egypt from among COMESA countries. This explains how big the deficit in Kenya's trade balance with Egypt is, as Egypt's imports from Kenya amounted to 60 million dollars last year, down 18% in comparison to 1997, followed by Sudan whose exports to Egypt hit 48 million dollars at a growth rate of 113.5% over 1997, then came Zambia whose exports to Egypt increased from 30 thousand dollars in 1997 to 35 million dollars last year. There are some countries whose exports to Egypt declined 100% in 2003 in comparison to 1997, including Congo, Burundi, Swaziland, Seychelles and Comoros.
Egypt's exports to Sudan last year mainly included cement at a value of 21 million dollars; reinforcing iron bars to the value of 7 million dollars, and bleached rice to the value of 6 million dollars. Egypt's imports from Sudan included watermelon seeds to the value of 11 million dollars; sesame seeds to the value of 10.5 million dollars; pure copper cathodes to the value of 8 million dollars, and live camels to the value of 6 million dollars.
Egyptian exporters exported large quantities to Turkey but such quantities remained in free zones and were re-exported to other countries due to such decrees, thus taking Egyptian rice exports down, during the first seven months this year, to 7 million tons from 19.3 million tons during the corresponding period last year, a decline of 63.73%.
The company's net profits rose to 145.33 million pounds against 131.97 million pounds during the corresponding period last year, up 10%.
Addressing the Shura Council in its opening session on Sunday, Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif pointed out many problems facing the Egyptian society at present foremost of which is unemployment, which needs much efforts to be solved.

NEW 3874 INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS TO BE SET UP NEXT YEAR
MINISTER OF PLANNING: GROWTH RATE HITS 4.8%
EGYPT NOT TO ACCEPT "QIZ" WITH USA UNLESS IT BRINGS IT BENEFITS
The Egyptian negotiator will not continue talks unless he obtains all guarantees and conditions that help Egypt achieve its interests and draw more investments and boost its exports to the US market, the minister noted.
He denied that the Egyptian Customs Authority might violate the GATT regarding duties and the difference in bills as the seventh article of the GATT allows the acceptance of such a difference.
She pointed out that such a growth rate is possible in Mediterranean partnership countries including Egypt through economic liberalization and boosting European investments in Egypt and partners from the Mediterranean Sea Basin countries.
Egypt turned down a demand by the consultative office of the European Union to necessarily raise electricity prices in order to near that of European and Middle Eastern countries, which are currently making arrangements to finish the suggested electricity linkage among Egypt, Syria, Palestine and the EU.
It is the first visit to be paid by Russian prime minister in more than 30 years. The last visit paid by a Russian premier was in October 1973.
Egypt usually imposes customs tariffs which the Russian side sees exaggerated ones. Egypt reduced its customs duties imposed on the Russian exports of paper to Egypt.
Russian sources pointed out that if the Russian Premier managed to remove the obstacles that face that contract, the coming period would witness a boom in the contributions of the Russian companies in modernizing the industrial installations that Egypt established in cooperation with the former Soviet Union.
The Russian side showed great interest in coordinating the policy of exporting gas to Europe and other markets as they want to cooperate with the Egyptian state-owned companies in that field. Furthermore, Russia desires to develop joint cooperation in scientific researches and high-tech.
Contracts have been clinched with South African institutions to train tax personnel to the new draft law applications, he said.

The government has backtracked on its promises to carry out fresh tariff cuts in?ÂÂ A M o? 0 ?| bjbja=a= 4Â° EUROW EUROW I? ??

The new tax bill will be enacted next February or March once the cabinet okays it, said Minister of Finance, ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? After just a few weeks or rather at the beginning of 2005, the GATT agreement will start to be enforced.
Al-Talatli added that the new plan main items are enhancing the competitiveness of about 4 thousand industrial installations, boosting the capacity of business associations to help their membership through providing those organizations with financial and administrative support in coordination with the Egyptian government, the qualification of 300 Egyptian business consultants in the field of the studies and services of modernizing industry and improving the legislative, organizational and administrative climate affecting businesses through recommending the passage and amendment of some bills required for boosting industry such as the laws of competition organization, anti-trust, as well as defining taxation and customs.
The decision, he said, is part of political leaders' directives to spur farming produce exports, remove barriers impeding them and to enable exporters to compete at international markets.
AMERICAN OFFICIAL BLASTS INVESTMENT ATMOSPHERE IN EGYPT
The World Bank (WB) classified Egypt among the countries of high investment cost and high risks, he noted, adding that the investor might lose every thing unless he completes the project he started in insinuation to the obstacles facing foreign investors when they want to end their investments.
Islamic Bank for Development agreed on a loan and grant program to finance development projects at a value of 53 million dollars.
The current program grants 41.5 million dollars as a finance to North Cairo Power Station; $411,000 for developing irrigation in West Delta; 400,000 dollars for loaning small and medium-sized projects of Social Fund for Development; 260,000 dollars as technical aid for qualifying FGF leaders; 10 million dollars as no-interest loan for financing development projects in general; and $260,000-grant for quality control on products of biological preparations and vaccines to ensure safety of such products and their arrival at markets and consumers.
This comes at a time when major international banks declared their keenness to cover the new increase of the capital of their branches in Egypt.
On the level of foreign bank branches operative in Egypt, main branches of Lebanese Jammal Trust Bank, National Bank of Abu-Dhabi, National Bank of Oman, Canadian Nova Scotia, Mashreq Bank of United Arab Emirates and National Bank of Greece declared their readiness to cover the required increase. Meanwhile, stances of other branches were not clear. These branches include National Bank of Pakistan, National Bank of Sudan and Iraqi Rafedein Bank.
Port Said National Bank is planned to be amalgamated with the National Bank for Development, as the latter is the biggest contributor to the former's capital which hits 70 million pounds. Furthermore, it is planned that the United Bank of Egypt, Egyptian Commercial Bank and Suez Canal Bank will be amalgamated into one bank. The destiny of Nile Bank, Egyptian Workers Bank and al-Mohandes Bank is not clear yet. Other banks like Arab Investment Bank, Alexandria Commercial Bank and Alexandria Maritime Bank are also expected to amalgamate.
This rise will be funded through the bank's accumulated reserves, he said, pointing out the bank's fulfillment of all control regulations, including allocations, credit worthiness criterion and others.
According to reliable source the agreement between Bahgat and banks included a number of points forefront of which are the following:
* Appointing deputy chairman and managing director for Bahgat Group from the NBE. The managing director shall be responsible for controlling monetary inflows of the group.
Experts consider that the settlement agreement will be conducive to similar deals with other businessmen, especially those who are still at large.
He added that 41% of those contracts signed with the US, followed by Argentina and France 26% each, then Australia and Russia 4.5% and 2.5% respectively.
Bankers and businessmen said the markup of euro and pound sterling against the US dollar will affect negatively Egypt's foreign trade that should be flexible to cope with the new variables ensuing from the dollar's continuous decline against euro, pound sterling and other Asian currencies.
In spite of the continuous rise of euro and pound sterling against the dollar, Egyptian bankers rule out that transactions in unofficial market will revive, claiming that the foreign currencies available in banks and exchange firms are enough for meeting the needs of importers whose demands for different currencies, especially dollar, increase in the last quarter of every year.
Diversification of foreign exchange sources would be useful in such circumstances, as it would allow a bigger margin and reduce probable losses, especially if the euro's markup against the dollar continues for a long time.
In the same context, secretary general of Cairo Chamber of Commerce Mustafa Zaki sees that the euro's surge will negatively affect Egypt's imports from EU countries which top exporting countries to Egypt, as they accounted for 33% of Egypt's imports in the first quarter of this year 2004/2005 with 1.6 billion dollars against 948 million pounds for America; 6.7 million dollars for Asian countries; 190 million dollars for Britain; and 280 million dollars for Arab countries. 70% of Egypt's imports last year came from countries whose currencies increased against the dollar, which caused Egypt additional burdens.
He pointed out a plan to add 10-15 thousand hotel rooms annually, indicating that a room costs 60,000 dollars, which means that Egypt needs 900 million dollars annually to be contributed by foreign and local investors.
52.6% INCREASE IN TOURISM REVENUES, 31.7% IN EXPORTS
He stressed the stability of exchange rate on the market, as it is an attractive factor for investment in addition to preserving investing in social security network to protect low-income brackets.
Following the signing of the contract, the minister said that there were new mechanisms for making it easy for companies to get finance such as issuing bonds.
Meanwhile, industry modernization program CEO Salim Al-Talatli uncovered that some of international institutions like the World Bank and African Bank for Investment asked to contribute to the fund.
The Arab tribes in Darfur were accused of forming such militias.
The following are excerpts from an interview with Al-Mahameed chieftain, Moussa Helal:
A: They live in north Darfur, specifically in old Katam and its suburbs and peripheral areas of Kabkabiya. Our area in Katam province has been divided into Kabkabiya and Meleit provinces.
A: Their robberies used to be carried out by large groups, amounting sometimes to one hundred people. They were targeting huge funds through concentrating on herdsmen, fairs, state vehicles and citizens.
Q: Are there any proofs to your argument?
A: Yes, this is a natural thing anywhere. It is not a conflict but rather skirmishes that are usually solved through traditional rules.
A: Long years ago, but we didn't belief that we were targeted. However, they escalated their activities in 2000 against Arab grasslands.
Q: Have they put their threats into force?
Q: Who are the Janjaweed that are accused of perpetrating murder in Darfur?
Q: Why have you been accused of being the leader of the Janjaweed?
A: By accident from people and through the media.
A: I'm not sure of that. I'm not a criminal regardless whether I've been blacklisted or not.
Q: But we knew that you met the American charge d'affaires in the American embassy in Khartoum?
Q: What did the American charge d'affaires tell you?
A: The British ambassador to Khartoum.
Q: Do the Darfur rebels include Arabs?
During the last years of former Sudanese president Ja'far Numeiri, the government armed tribes to defend themselves after armed robberies had run rampant in Darfur. The Salvation government as well as Sadek El-Mahdi also did the same. After the political factor had mingled with armed robbery in the last years, the Salvation government armed some tribes. We also suggested that the government should recruit some of our youths.
Sudan's ambassador to Cairo Dr. Ahmed Abdel Halim made a vivid presentation of Darfur's crisis in an interview with Al-Ahram newspaper to say:
The movement set up training camps for rebels and provided them with necessary military hardware. In an atmosphere of wars and coups and intertwine between tribes along borders between Sudan and neighbouring Chad, Chadian militias used to enter Sudan and sell arms to Sudanese warring tribes. After the end of drought and desertification stage in 1984, robbery gangs and outlawed militias, including Janjaweed, were formed. If you checked detainees registers at that time, you would find out that they belonged to different tribes.
Second: Sudan's government has signed an agreement with UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan in his capacity to solve the crisis within 90 days.
Under this headline, Randa Taqieddin of Al-Hayat wrote an article, which ran to the following effect: Churches explosions in Baghdad are reminiscent of a warning launched by late Palestinian struggler, Faisal Al-Hussaini, "Orient House" official in occupied Jerusalem during his visit to France a few days before his death.
Al Hussaini, emphasized to Al Hayat that he wanted the authorities in the Christian West to urge the East Christians to stay in their countries as their exodus posed a great threat to the Arab region.
In the 1960s and the 1970s, the ratio between Christian scientists, doctors and engineers doing postgraduate studies abroad was equal to that of their counterparts from other religions.
Lebanon is currently witnessing an exodus of Christian youths for economic and political reasons.
Iraq is currently witnessing an attempt of some radical religious parties to control some universities like Basra University by imposing a certain costume on female students. A growing number of Christians who sell alcoholics were also killed.
Islamic, Christian and Arab bodies have condemned targeting churches. Those include Organization of Islamic Conference and Muslim Brotherhood Group.
Figures point out that one hundred and two Christians were killed after the war, some of whom because of selling alcoholics or due to working as translators for or serving the Americans.
In Riyadh, Organization of Islamic Conference Secretary General, Dr. Abdel-Wahid Belqziz denounced the attacks targeting innocent Iraqi citizens such as the blasts against some churches.
Al-Sistani condemned the attacks that targeted churches in Baghdad and Mosul describing them as heinous criminal acts.
In Damascus, Kaftaro condemned the blasts claiming the lives of innocent victims of the Iraqi people inside their worshipping places which come within the framework of criminal acts against civilians.
The Middle East Churches Council said, "Aggression on churches is a sinful attempt to sow the seed of discord between Muslims and Christians of the Iraqi people.
In a phone conversation by Asharq Al-Awsat, Al-Bakkaa expressed deep regret at the assassination of 35 university professors, adding that 84% of the universities' buildings and equipment were destroyed during and after the war, thus suspending enrollment in more than 134 scientific specialties in postgraduate studies departments. "Although there is a shortage of chairs, desks and fans while temperature amounts sometimes to 58 centigrade. There are about 500,000 university students," he said. The following are excerpts from an interview with Al-Bakaa:
A:There are 11 faculties, not universities. Last year, a new university called Alulbait (the Prophet's Family) university was set up. It is not a religious university but rather teaches different sciences.
A: The number of lecturers of PhD and master's degree holders amount to 16500.
A: During and after war, many buildings were set ablaze and their labs were looted. The Baghdad-based Fine Arts Academy was the most affected building as it was completely destroyed. Fans and chairs and everything of a value were stolen from university buildings.
So far, some staff rooms still lack in offices, chairs and air conditioners.
WHY IS IT WRONG TO SEND ARAB & ISLAMIC FORCES TO IRAQ?
Therefore it was necessary to find somebody who would foot such bills on behalf of Washington. The American scheme, known to everybody, is not withdrawal of course but reducing involvement to a minimum while preserving control. America, therefore, saw the idea of sending Arab and Islamic forces as its saviour from its quagmire in Iraq especially after the political, military and security reports of the new conservatives group confirmed that the position in Iraq would be George W. Bush's door either back to the White House or out of it.
What is happening now regarding sending Arab and Islamic forces to Iraq is as renewal of the scenario to which America has been accustomed for decades. Anyhow, some articles of faith should be taken for granted here: Firstly:
It is worth mentioning too that involving Arab and Muslims in the Iraqi bog is the big goal on which the American Administration insists to cover up for its failure on one hand and stop the drain of American blood shed daily in Iraq on the other hand, and also to assume the image in the eyes of the Americans electorate, of the American gentleman, who having toppled Saddam's regime, proceeded to hand over power to the Iraqis and then assigned the task of keeping security to the Arabs and Muslims who have common grounds in race and religion with the Iraqis.
During a demonstration in Kiryat Shmona, Northern Israel, Abu-Zohr said, "In four years, Israel has succeeded in doing what Hizbullah failed to do with us over 25 years, and now we feel humiliated.
Abu-Zohr was in charge of intelligence body affiliated to Israeli intelligence in the southern sector of South Lebanon.
Most of them left Israel actually.
"GADDAFI FEDAYEEN" ADMONISHES AL-SADR'S DISAPPEARANCE CASE INCITERS
In reply to Al-Sadr's family announcement that they would sue Gaddifi before the Lebanese judiciary, the statement said, "This matter cannot be ignored, we threatens whoever tries to defame Libya and its leader, would pay dearly".

After years of persistence, Syrian George Rizkallah succeeded in opening the first-ever center for teaching the Aramaic, the language of the Christ, in Ma'lola village, according to scripts drawn by Prof. of old language in Damascus University Mohamed Mahfel.
The three villages include 12,000 inhabitants speaking an Aramaic dialect, especially those who are above 45 years old particularly in Jab'adin, which includes 5000.
"However, the Aramaic retreated before the Arabic after the Islamic conquest of the region", Mahfel said.
Attended the celebration also was Baseel Dahdouh from Syrian Nationalist Social Party, who calls for the unity of the Levant countries and was happy about the inauguration of such a center which has political and cultural dimensions.
The proposal to set up the authority submitted by independent fundamentalist deputy Sheikh Jassim Al Saidi had opened the door wide to constant "confrontations" in the press and electronic sites between Islamists and secularists.
He added, "It is difficult for the project to come to light amid the escalating integration of economic and social life in Bahrain with the international situation.

Secretary General of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, Hafiz Abou Sida said in press releases yesterday (29th July) that the idea of that forum was created at the hand of a group of Egyptian and Arab thinkers and intellectuals on the sidelines of their participation in the conference on reform mechanisms in the Arab world held in Cairo in the period from 5 to 7 July (this month).
He added that the second direction is connected with the intellectual and cultural aspects through making in-depth studies and putting up ideas and reform experiments for discussion by all parties.
The council said that the committee's report whose features started to take shape was just a case of malicious propaganda against Egypt and its people.

The results of presidential election last April, which led to the re-election of Bouteflika for a second term, noticeably showed that the power struggle is in favor of the president.
However, the elected President, Bouteflika, who, traditionally in Algeria, assumes the portfolios of defense and armed forces, lost no time in announcing that he did not like to be a "three-quarter President". This led to a crisis with the officers of the military establishment.
The military establishment did not resort to the old way of resolving matters, i.e. deposing the president. who was reportedly about to tender his resignation during the second half of his term in office.
The result of the conflict between the two men became the compass of power struggle between President Bouteflika, the first civilian heading both the Algerian presidency and the ministry of defense, and the military establishment that want to be in control of political life.
The President succeeded in doing this backed by the popularity he gained through the elections, after he put an end to the rebellion against him inside the Liberation Front, the rise of a new generation of professional officers in light of a plan that was overseen by Al-Amari himself, encouraging economic results due to the rise of oil prices in addition to developing international relations especially with the EU and the US.
Iraqi Minister of Culture Moufied Al-Gazaeri described the activities of the U.SS forces based in Babylon as sabotage acts, noting that such acts do harm to the historic city.
"There were a number of Iraqis working in an office affiliate to culture ministry in historic Babylon before the invasion of the US forces, however, after the US entered the city they gave a few of them access to the office but restricted their movements so that they can not reach the military sites. So we do not know the volume of destruction which the US forces activities did to the historic places".
Senior official of the Syrian Refugees Commission Ajmal Khaibari told Al-Hayat that about four thousand cases (each case includes family members) had been registered with the commission. This means that the total number of Christian refugees ranges between 20,000 and 25,000. The commission's offices receive about 90-100 applications every day, he said.
"The Syrian government took a humanitarian prevented their deportation or causing any problem to them. They are to be safeguarded temporarily due to their conditions till their problem is solved," he added.
While Iraqi traders prefer to live in the two coastal cities of Tartus and Latakia where they can transport their goods from the two ports to Iraq, Christians prefer al-Jazira areas near Iraqi borders due to the hospitality of inhabitants.
Economic sources told Al-Hayat that the decision came after Jordan threatened to not allow Syrian fizzy drinks access to its markets in application of the reciprocity principle. It is worth mentioning that Syrian carbonated drinks exports to Jordan are valued at 2 million dollars.
Syria is still imposing protective measures on some local industries such as T.VV industry, detergents, olive oil, car engine oil, tobacco and its derivatives, cheese, cotton yarns, moquette, clothes of all different kinds.
Arab diplomatic sources expressed deep concern about a possible Iranian-Israeli confrontation, saying the Middle East region was facing a "hot autumn" due to the continuing Iranian nuclear activities and a US-European ban on Tehran's accession to the nuclear club let alone Israel's intentions to nip the Iranian nuclear program in the bud before nuclear Iran becomes a de facto reality.
Britain, France and Germany believe that diplomatic efforts in that regard are far from over and note international legitimacy channels to the exclusion of the military option, they said.
It would have no option but to retaliate, especially that hardliners, at that time, would force their way to decision-making circles.
HAMAS PROMISES CAIRO NOT TO IMPEDE ISRAELI PULLOUT FROM GAZA
Meshaal's meeting with Egyptian officials led to a "verbal understanding" including Hamas' willingness to get involved in politics. But, the group has made no official decision whether its involvement will include participation in legislative elections, especially as it rejects the bases, including Oslo agreement, on which the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) was built. The movement is also ready to stop firing Qassam homemade rockets at Israeli targets if Israel halts its military operations in Gaza Strip, the sources said.
On Hamas' participation in elections, he said, "We do not say so, but we will wait. However, we will participate in taking initial steps to achieve such an end."
In the face of international pressure, Israel launched a balloon test regarding the future of the Palestinian and Syrian territories occupied in 1967. Alternate Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was quoted as announcing before a large number of settlers the government's intention to dismantle a large number of settlements within the framework of a wide-scale withdrawal from the West Bank after withdrawal from Gaza. Meanwhile, Chief of Staff Moshe Yaloun voiced his conviction that theoretically Israel may withdraw from the Golan Heights in the framework of an Israeli-Syrian peace agreement void of bargain as far as security considerations are concerned.
Sharon had always used Olmert as a trial balloon launcher, the last of which was the promotion of the disengagement plan three months ago.

NDP TO MULL POLITICAL REFORM DOSSIERS NEXT SEPTEMBER
Meanwhile, legislative and legal committees of the NDP, the People's Assembly and the Shura Council and National Specialized Councils are bent on formulating their visions of a package of political reform laws to be made public by the NDP congress. The package includes amendments to the laws on exercise of political rights, the People's Assembly, elections, abolishing imprisonment penalties in publication cases, the emergency law and amending NGOs law. By doing so, the NDP will have completed its political reforms, which were preceded by economic reforms required by President Hosni Mubarak from the government of Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif. They will all be discussed in the new parliamentary session scheduled in mid-November.
The Arab Democratic Nasserite Party leader Diaa Eddin Dawoud voiced opposition to the NDP move, saying: "We will not accept membership of the CPPA as we see the judicial authority as the only agency to decide on forming and dissolving political parties."
The law was proposed by "power jurists" to late president Anwar Sadat in order to undermine political life and cut political parties down to size by controlling their fates and enabling the executive represented by the CPPA and the Party Court to impose hegemony on political life, Abaza added.
Union Democratic Party leader Ibrahim Turk emphasized that the CPPA is unconstitutional and illegal as it only includes some parties that have parliamentary representations.
Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) Group Guide Mahdi Akef said the group believes in actions, rather than words, and supports concrete reform moves. "Let Safwat el-Sharif say what he wants...the road to reform is known. When a decision is made in this respect and tabled for discussion, we (the group) join such discussions as we can not deal with events in advance."
It also regarded the meeting as acceptance of American intervention in Al-Wafd affairs. "Meeting with the US Secretary of State to consider an Egyptian internal issue is considered a violation of the simplest meaning of dignity and national sovereignty."

Yesterday (Jan. 2), the Egyptian pound rates of exchange recovery against the American dollar went on at the beginning of dollar inter-bank system dealings this week. The dollar rate ranged between LE6.04 and LE6.05 compared with about LE6.08 and LE6.1 last Thursday.
The companies failed to meet the citizens' needs by trying their foreign exchange. They, therefore, stopped buying the dollar for some periods of the day last week under the pretext of the unavailability of sufficient Egyptian pound liquidity. However, an official with an Egyptian exchange company admitted that the real reason for stopping dollar purchases was the hour after hour fluctuations of prices. The banks connected with exchange companies change the price more than three times a day mostly by reducing them, which led to losses incurred by exchange companies. They buy enormous amounts of dollars, euros and pounds sterling but when they take them to the bank to sell them, they suddenly discover that their sales of exchange had gone down.

Economists expected that 2005 would be the year of Egyptian-Israeli economic cooperation in light of the QIZ agreement, emphasizing that boycott would be ineffective in curbing such cooperation.
The year 2005 is expected to witness the establishment of new Israeli companies and banks under the QIZ accord, he said, pointing out that such investments already exist but they have declined during the last period.
The QIZ will not have a big effect on attracting Israeli investments or setting up Israeli banks or ventures in Egypt, as the gates between the two parties have been opened regardless of the agreement, said consultant of the European Commission in Cairo Hesham Radwan.
Israeli goods are already sold at the Egyptian market without any trademarks indicating their origin, Al-Khatib added.

DOLLAR RETREATS BEFORE EGYPTIAN POUND
President of Misr-Romania Bank Abdel-Rahman Baraka ascribed this retreat to "reduction in demand for the dollar on the part of importers and activation of inter-bank transactions whose continuity will lead to more dollar retreat and the increase of the volume of dealings. This system allows banks to sell and purchase with each other to circulate their surplus of hard currency". It is to be noted that 34 banks participate in the inter-bank.
QIZ BETWEEN UNFLOLDING TRUTH & VIOLATION OF CONSTITUTION
Even if that was true or if the government did not want to hide anything from public opinion or if it was convinced that its division to sign the QIZ protocol with the Zionist enemy would serve the national interests, why, then, didn't it refer the agreement text to the public or put it up to the People's Assembly to have it discussed in a debate where pros and cons are given a chance to express their views?
Ten days after the signature of the protocol, the government suspiciously confirmed through a statement made by the cabinet spokesman that the cabinet had discussed the QIZ protocol in its meeting dated December 23rd and emphasized that it had nothing to do with national security nor did it have any financial ramifications that could affect the public budget, consequently the People's Assembly would only be notified of it! Now we contend that the protocol was closely related to national security and had financial impacts on the state's public budget. We also challenge any government erudite scholars to prove otherwise. No matter what propaganda, mass media or publicity campaigns they might use, they would not succeed.
Finally, the agreement provides for the formation of a joint committee to supervise its implementation. The committee should hold periodical meetings in Cairo and Jerusalem alternately. Does the signature of such a provision imply a recognition of Jerusalem as a capital of the Zionist enemy?
On a request from Muslim Brotherhood Group expressing a wish by a delegation from the Group to visit Al-Tagamo'h Party, and hold a dialogue over the current political situation, were made to hold arrangements for such a meeting on Thursday August 5th.
During the meeting, Al-Tagamo'h Party delegation expressed the following views:
Our party rejects the use of religion as a cover for political action.
It is, therefore, out of the question to set up an alliance or a front with any force, party or political trend whose platform and social and economic leanings are radically at variance with those of Al-Tagamo'h party.
Al-Tagamo'h representatives pointed out that setting up an alliance in the way proposed was a rather untimely step and needed to be referred to leadership bodies. Some points in Muslim Brotherhood initiative, furthermore, needed a dialogue like the theocracy and discrimination against women.

The Coptic rejection of "Baheb Essima" (I love cinema) film is motivated by Coptic institutions desire to keep the image of Christians as "pure" and "intact" as possible. Egyptian churches, especially Orthodox ones, used to produce scores of Christian films and distribute them to Coptic churches and satellite channels such as "Sat-7", "Al-Hayat" and "Miracle" and among Coptic expatriates in the West. Most of these films used to depict the lives of messengers, prophets and saints in a good image and that is why these churches object to the aforementioned film.

Chief editor and Al-Gomhouria newspaper and board chairman of El-Tahrir Foundation Samir Ragab writes a column on page 15, some excerpts of which run to the following effect: How numerous the meetings held by Arab foreign ministers to avoid imminent disasters were, but they unfortunately were to no avail!
That's why I say it is a good initiative that Arab foreign ministers should hold an emergency meeting to discuss the problem of Darfur and urge the international community represented, of course, in America not to take a course of action that might prejudice the interests of the Sudanese who lead a hard life as a result of each faction lying in wait for the other, and the insistence of each party to share out the resources of all.
Now losing no time to provide financial, in kind medical and food assistance would considerably contribute to solving the crisis which is basically caused by struggle for livelihood!

He added that nobody could prevent an Arab from supporting his own Arab brother in Iraq.

The Israeli closure of Rafah crossing point, where Palestinians were held for several days, was merely a test for the Egyptian position on which Israel hinges upon in view of the settlement of thousands of Palestinians to be expelled from their houses with the expansion of Israeli settlements, which will not stop in spite of some Israeli politicians' assurances that some Jewish settlements in Gaza Strip and the West Bank should be conceded, according to the reports.

SUDAN'S REFUSAL OF AFRICAN PEACE-KEEPING FORCE OPENS DOOR TO FOREIGN INTERVENTION
Observers fear that the Sudanese rejection of AU forces was a "too early" and unstudied position that has not been subjected to any in-depth discussion, saying that Sudan's positions could bring it at loggerheads with the AU, which still adopts a moderate line in contrast with the UN Security Council's resolution threatening military intervention last month unless the Khartoum government meets certain demands in a period seen by many as "short and impractical".

Rashid disclosed that the Egyptian arrangements are made in parallel with American and Israeli ones, confirming that omitting to announce any details about the QIZ so far is attributed to the desire not to cause confusion among businessmen.

He noted that the commercial representation office in Berlin exerted intensive efforts for promoting those two exhibitions among importers and businessmen associations in Germany.

This also encouraged savers to exchange their dollar savings for Egyptian pounds as interest rates on Egyptian pound assets reached about 10% against about 2% interest rate on dollar assets.
Meanwhile, exporters urgently demanded that they should be supported and granted facilities and further exemptions to make up for the losses, most of them incurred due to the sharp fall of the dollar against the Egyptian pound.

He added that the cut percentage in the tax value of the industrial activities hit 38% in comparison to 50% in the commercial ones, so the committee saw that the new law did not support industry, which was contrary to the state policy and orientations that aim at increasing the contribution of industrial activities to the gross national production (GNP).

He added that the elements which must be available mainly include the elimination of the red-tape and bureaucratic behaviour and the acceleration of litigation procedures through the creation of courts specialized in economic disputes and the implementation of verdicts in addition to the availability of relative advantages.

Experts pointed out that despite the rise in building input prices as a result of the rate of exchange deregulation in January 2003, this contributed to a rise in Arab and foreigners' demand for buying real estate units as a result of the devaluation of the Egyptian pound. The year 2004 witnessed a heavy demand for buying posh housing units in the new and coastal cities.
Former Minister of Housing Eng. Hasab Allah Al-Kafrawi said that most building components are domestic, adding that its basic elements are domestic except for rebar and timber which are imported from abroad especially some types of billet. The real estate market, therefore, is the last market to be affected by the rate of exchange movement as its elements are mostly domestic products. However, the building and construction market witnessed a terrible rise in prices with the rise in exchange rates.
Engineer Osmam Battah, head of the Technical Affairs Sectors in the National Company for Construction and building said that the devaluation of the dollar did not exceed 3% as the dollar went down from LE6.2 to LE6. The decline, therefore will not affect the real estate market as it will not considerably affect the rebar prices. On the other hand, factories rely on its stocks of raw materials, cement, bricks, rebar and gravel, etc.. which were bought at rates prior to the deregulation of the rate of exchange. The market will not witness a decline in prices until the old stocks are consumed and new stocks of building materials are bought at the new prices.
Members of Industry Committee in Businessmen Association pointed out that the policy of exporting raw cotton represented a waste of the state's resources and that insistence on expansion in cultivating long-staple cotton had reverse effects on the Egyptian economy, especially as garment industry is depending on importing yarn from India and Pakistan for their high competitiveness.

SOMALI PRESIDENT HOLDING AMERICAN NATIONALITY ELECTED
Although the Algerian judoka Omar Meriga has beaten his Israeli rival Ihud Fax after the Iranian famous judo contestant refused to play with him, Algerian newspapers said the judo event marked a new chapter in normalization with the Hebrew State.
In the same context, Algerian President Abdel Aziz Bouteflika has previously denounced "biddings" of some Arab countries that have relations with Israel in "one way or another" while he was talking about the possibility of normalizing relation with Tel Aviv. However, he has shown a more understanding position towards the Greater Middle East Initiative proposed by the US Administration provided that reform should be "homegrown".
A group of mosque preachers and religious scholars in Samarra urged "faithful youth" to join the ranks of what they called, "Al-Hadi Army", after the name of Imam Ali Al-Hadi, buried in the city.
A group calling itself "Islamic Jihad Battalions" gave out a communique regarding Muqtada Al-Sadr as a resistance hero and called for providing him with money, men and arms. It threatened to target police forces, the National Guard land Iraqi Civil Defense unless they left their jobs and declared repentance within 48 hours.
Moreover, the minister categorically denied reports that her ministry was studying a proposal to give Iraqi passports to the Jews who left Iraq after 1948 and indemnifying them for the property they left or sold in the country before departure for Israel.
Nor has anybody thought that the security climates will be optimally calm.
Secondly, when the UN took part, even formally, in constituting a temporary Iraqi government it was also granted a kind of "international legitimacy" to run the country pending the elections that would give rise to a sovereign and legitimate government.
In the absence of any political or security explanation and in light of similar experiments elsewhere, it can safely be said that "the agreement" which was said to have been achieved was not to the liking of "occupation forces" which asked National Security Advisor to withdraw and stop all negotiations.
Such a trend, it is true, did not have any clear objectives nor did it put forward impractical demands. It just contended itself with proving its presence and should therefore be recognized by others.
It is therefore feared that the conference held yesterday be lacking in the required nationalism so long as some categories or trends failed to take part in it and so long as the "occupation" embassy is the authority which would determine the one hundred members of the transitional national council whose task, it has been said, would be to control the provisional government and contribute to preparations for the elections.
This reality gave rise to two Shiite trends combined by a common rejection of occupation desire to complete victory. They are, however, torn asunder by the strategy adopted.
On the other hand, Muktada's masses with their age and social properties, reflect total ineptness or lack of experience.
No matter how bad occupation may be and it is, by definition bad indeed, it can not do Iraq as much harm as can giving such cadres free rein in Iraq's political life.
For or against liberty? By the same token, completing victory over Saddam may take place through driving out occupiers but keeping the homeland, enlightenment and freedom!
According to the recent changes carried out by President Bouteflika in his capacity as the supreme commander of the armed forces and national defense minister, Major General Ahmed Sanhagi was appointed secretary general of defense ministry. Sanhagi had been a mere management secretary commissioned to follow up the administrative affairs only since the last government reshuffle in February 2000.
It is believed that Bouteflika, who on several occasions voiced his rejection to be a three-quarter president in terms of competences and powers, will be the most powerful person by virtue of these changes, which will take the military establishment back to its normal position without prominent decision-making circles abandoning their competences in running the country's affairs.
KHARTOUM WATCHING OUT FOR IMMINENT ATTACK FROM ERITREA ON E. SUDAN
There have been huge inflows of Eritrean refugees over the last days, mostly from youth and the military who gave up their arms to the authorities, deputy governor of Kassala state Ba Bakr Dakna added.

Meantime, The Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) under John Garang warned against an all-out war in the country.

He also warned against wasting peace chances because this would be an unforgivable mistake.
Railway lines' capabilities in Syria are unsuitable for more loads, said Turkish officials, adding that the decision in that respect may be taken jointly by Syria and Iraq.
The Iranian lawsuit will be the second one against Gaddafi following the one filed by Al-Sadr family last month, said Sadr Eddin.
The Central Auditing Agency (CAA) briefed Minister of Information Mamdouh Al-Beltagui of blatant violations in the Egyptian Radio and Television Union (ERTU) exceeding 120 million pounds due to violations committed by former as well as incumbent leaderships.
Some leadership offices were refurbished more than three times a year and 6 million pounds were spent under this item, the CAA said.
Surprisingly enough, 30,000 pounds were recorded for each dress bought to her, in addition to purchasing some of her songs, which she has not sung yet.
As the security situation in Iraq is the factor which determines the nature of the commercial activity, the private sector managed to cover the needs of the Iraqi markets. The role of Iraqi Trade Ministry is confined to implementing contracts relative to memos of understanding to secure ration card commodities, a system which is still in effect after the war.
Waheed stressed the occurrence of several mistakes and violations in trade agreements on the part of some exports, revealing that importers intended to remove the names of producing companies contenting themselves with the name of the country of origin on the imported goods and commodities.

In a sudden development, the Egyptian government publicly apologized for an article, which dealt with the Nazi Holocaust against the Jews. The article was published in Al- Lewa Al-Islami newspaper, an organ of the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) in Egypt, thus creating a great sensation.
Al-Beltagui said, "The NDP is the majority party in the Egyptian community. It does not believe that what befall a nation or people could be a fallacy. Nor can the sufferings of the Jews or the other peoples of the world in the Second World War due to Nazism be made light of. What was written by Dr. Rifaat Sayed Ahmed in Al-Lewa Al-Islami newspaper has nothing to do with the Egyptian citizen's views or the ruling party's thought and policies.
The embassy's act, according to sources, came following instructions it received from the US State Department. Having received a report by MEMRI Institution on the article attached with the Arab version of the newspaper the American Congress and the White House also received a copy of that report.
The writer considered that an indicator threatening the press that would perhaps force it to avoid dealing with any Israeli excesses.
Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Mohamed Sayed Tantawi has given the green light to a delegation of Al-Azhar scholars to visit the occupied city of Jerusalem and other occupied Palestinian territories at the invitation of the Palestinian Ministry of Endowments and Islamic Affairs.
Israeli occupying forces deny anybody access to Palestinian territories, mainly occupied Jerusalem, unless an Israeli visa is obtained. Accordingly, the Egyptian Al-Azhar delegation will have to obtain an Israeli visa before entering Palestine.
The scheme will be carried out by the Israeli intelligence agency (Mossad) through elements holding East Europe countries' nationalities and moving from Marseilles in France, south Italy and Greece.
He stressed that Muslims, Shiites or Sunnis, reject persecuting or expelling Christians, pointing out that "the problems the Christians underwent in the Islamic reality are like those ones undergone by Muslims in the same reality."
We notice that the explosions that targeted churches in Iraq came on the heels of the explosions in Islamic places, which tells everybody that these explosions have nothing to do with the Iraqi Islamic issue, but rather with sedition in Iraq that arouses the religious issue and bring it to the front for political aims and targets, so that some people might speak about the expulsion of Christians at a time when they know that Muslims, Shiites and Sunni, reject this issue as well as any persecution against Christians.
The international community would adopt a resolution supporting the American stance in September next. The Iranian government would, thus, have to choose whether to cooperate or to be isolated, Rice forecasted.

The Algerian government has adopted a proposal by Justice Minister, Al-Tayeb Bel'iz to introduce essential changes to the personal status law (family law in Algeria) by cancelling the condition of guardian of the bride attending marriage ceremony and restricting polygamy by stipulating getting a permit from the judge. It also announced other measures rejected by the Islamic party (National Reform Movement and Algerian Muslim Scholars Association).
The government communique pointed out failure to respect such conditions leads to the annulment of the marriage contract before the consummation of marriage.
The government communique pointed out that the amendments adopted came in response to the President's directives and ran parallel with the constitution and Islamic Sharia principles, while resorting to the gate of interpretation.
The religiously well-reputed Sheikh Shaiban adds that the conditions set regarding polygamy might urge a man to divorce his wife in order to marry the woman he wanted. He asked the deputies to turn down the negative points that were included in the government measures when they are put up for the vote before they turn into valid laws, as it was a matter of protecting society from collapse.
OPPOSITION PARTIES CALL FOR CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM
The document stressed that Article 74 of the Constitution, which gives the president of the republic absolute authority, should be abrogated and a constitutional reform should be introduced ahead of the end of the president 's current term in office.
The three parties reached the final formula of the document following a chain of intensive meetings, which started after the Tagamo'h had launched its change programme last April.

DARFUR ...
Israel poses a threat to Egypt from the East, the USA, from the South in addition to controlling the sources of the Nile and water coming to us. This is shown in their following items:
Agriculture, therefore, does not constitute any problem because both fertile land and water are bountiful. He adds that Bush wants to control Darfur to deceive American public opinion through achieving a quick gain to cover up from what is happening in Iraq. Furthermore, in Darfur, unlike what happened in Iraq, there is a sort of agreement between European and American interests, which would spare the USA any trouble regarding European objections when it thinks of invading Sudan. If Sudan was divided into five states and was controlled, France would follow in the USA footsteps especially in Africa which was based on imperialism-based lines and still subject to European control.
Major General, Hosni Nabih Al-Desouqi emphasizes that seizing the Sudan and controlling the Nile sources constitute a big threat to Egypt's national security, adding that it is a scheme to seize resources in Sudan and impair Egypt's role.
Al-Ahram Al-Arabi held an interview with Egyptian Foreign Minister, Ahmed Aboul-Gheit, some excerpts of which run to the following effect:
At the end of last month I visited Libya and Sudan, two Arab and African countries like Egypt. The main reason for visiting South Africa is to participate in the ministerial conference of the Non Alignment Movement to be held in Durbian city where it would be possible, God willing, to meet a number of the movement's foreign ministers including brothers from Africa, Asia and Latin America. Our presence there will naturally be made use of for holding bilateral discussions with officials in South Africa and seizing the chance to have a tour in some countries whether on the way to or back from South Africa to hand over messages from the President to the Presidents Mwai, Kibaki and Thanba Mbeki and Kibaki and to discuss some important issues with officials in the three countries related to the future of the African Union as giving momentum to development sports and the means of boosting the continent's auto capabilities in the field of peacekeeping and the fields of the international community participation in reinforcing such capabilities.
Besides, scholarships and training courses are awarded to rehabilitate cadres in the fields of the police, diplomacy and agriculture etc. Thousands have already benefited by this. The African Fund also supervises setting up medical centres carrying Egypt's name in some African countries, the first of which is expected to be set up in the Gabon in a few months' time. The fund's role is not confined to bilateral cooperation but extends to cooperation with Japan, Norway, Belgium and several other donor countries, in addition to Arab and Islamic development funds to expand the fund's activity and develop its capabilities.
There are several Egyptian construction companies operative in Africa and Arab Contractors have been very successful and are highly reputable. There are enormous opportunities to contribute to the reconstruction of Sudan, Sera lion, Rwanda and Burundi and the development of the infrastructure in Equatorial Guinea and the Congo etc whether through self initiated or international funding. The door is open to other companies, too. There are wide horizons for the entry of communications, IT, spinning and textile companies into Africa.
In a nutshell, there is very solid common ground between us which by far exceed the distance that separates us. While competing we should take particular interest in joint cooperation. This would be better for us and for the continent as a whole! That was why Egypt had withdrawn its offer to host the African parliament.
In the last couple of months, the weekly issuance of such bills did not exceed LE2 billion.
The study added that the Egyptian citizen's income is LE200 on average, and yet he/she spends LE500 at least. Those with LE1 thousand average spend LE3 thousand per month on food, housing, clothes, education and medical treatment.
Other economic sources in the study estimated the current price rises at a range of 15% and 40% suggesting a reconsideration of the chronic deficit in the trade balance and ending the state of deteriorating production in many organizations, replacement of imported products with high quality domestic ones especially in the case of the latter being available. These are the commodities which Chambers of Commerce Federation pledged to inventory to make available for importers. The successive price hikes, however, made a mess of everything and the poor were lost between labyrinths of partial solutions and sedatives while the monster of high prices gnawed at the society's flesh.
Per capita consumption of fruit decreased from 65.051 kg in 2002 to 64 kg in 2003.
The main opposition parties in Egypt have forestalled the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) Congress to be held in September by escalating their political campaign for political and constitutional reform.
It is noteworthy that the ruling party will hold its second annual congress on September 21st for two days. During the congress, the party will discuss a set of decisions for political and constitutional reform as a prelude to their referral to the government and the parliament. This has been subject to opposition criticism in light of the party's freezing dialogue with them which aimed at reaching a common concept for reform.
The conferees reviewed the political, economic and social developments in the country, and the fallout of the ruling party's clinging to flawed policies that have sent the country into its ongoing strangling quagmire in divers fields.
Gomaa told the reporters that the move called by the three parties springs from a national duty that Egypt needs to revamp its political, economic and social structures in a bid to address domestic, regional and international problems.
The next step is to form a standing opposition secretariat and office, he added.
Egyptian IFTA (religious opinion) Authority confirmed the legitimacy of the prisoner having a sexual intercourse with his wife in a special room in prison.
The fatwa cited verses from the holy Quran to prove the case.
Zari' added that the prisoners' marital relations are allowed in a number of Arab and Islamic countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Morocco.

MPs SUGGEST GIVING NCHR COMPETENCE TO CONSIDER COMPLAINTS OF EGYPTIAN EXPATRIATES
The vagueness of the NCHR's role was apparent when it hesitated to dispatch a delegation to London to meet Dr. Hamza and get acquainted with the problem, hence the necessity of introducing legislative amendments so that Egyptian expatriates could contact and send complaints to it.
Unprecedentedly, Egypt will release prisoners who spend a term jail not less than 4 years for 48 hours every three months during the last two years of their penalty.
It penetrates the society culturally and religiously and carries out evangelical and political role tending generally to Zionism, she said. The AUC also carries out a dangerous intelligence role and spies on Egypt through researches surveying different social classes under government auspices, thus threatening Egyptian national security, the researcher said.
The Egyptian researcher says that Sahara contains three of the biggest sand seas of the world following Saudi Arabia's Rub' Al-Khali (Empty Quarter), Algeria's Eastern Western Erk and the Great Sand Sea between Egypt and Libya with an area of about 300 thousand square kilometers. He emphasized that Egypt topped barren areas in the world as barren deserts claim 86% of its whole areas and deserts claim 14%. Although the Nile is the ideal model for rivers and alluvial plains communities, it has a desert climate. That is why the Nile Delta and Valley may be considered just oases in the middle of the desert but are watered through a river's water rather than groundwater like other oases.
FOREIGN INVESTMENTS WENT DOWN 80%
The Investment Ministry received bids from Arab, foreign and Chinese investors, said the minister, adding that the value of those bids was more than their counterparts last year.

EGYPTIAN COORDINATION WITH ISRAELI ARABS TO VOTE AGAINST SHARON'S PROJECTS
The meeting also led to Egypt's adherence to its conditions related to Gaza project especially that the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza should be full and comprehensive including withdrawal from Philadelphia Corridor, stopping sweeps and assassinations, opening the airport and the seaport, a Palestinian control on international checkpoints, not turning Gaza into a big jail after withdrawal and the continuation of Palestinian workers crossing the green line in search of work.
Israel occupation forces prevented a number of the Palestinian national football team players from entering Egypt to join the national team members who are currently in a training camp in Ismailia, Egypt.
Those soldiers will join extensive courses to receive lectures on the Jewish people's heritage, Zionism and religious identity, followed by rites of ablutions and circumcision and then religious courts endorse their embracing of Judaism.
According to military sources, 350 soldiers were recently judaized with 7500 others on the list.
Like millions of Palestinians, Colonel Mohamed Dahlan was born in a poor refugee family in Khan Younis refugee camp, 4 years before the outbreak of the Palestinian revolution in 1965 and 9 years before the incidents of the so-called black September 1970. No sooner had he became 6 years old than demonstrations erupted in his camp in 1967 against the Israeli occupation of the whole Palestine.
Some classified him as one of the middle generation who represent the reformist trend which has an agenda enjoying the support of the Palestinian street. With the emergency of every internal crisis a question is raised usually: where is Dahlan? During the last crisis some accused him of involvement in a "dangerous plan" targeting Arafat leadership!
He is the smart Colonel as the Hebrew newspapers call him. He has a wide network of relations with different Palestinian trends.
Those who are close to this controversial leader point out that Dahlan move towards arrangements for an open political scene that prepares him for a new role in the coming stage.
What happened in Najaf will recur elsewhere in Iraq so long as the above-mentioned regional powers, in harmony with some international powers even through mere talk and encouragement insist on pushing Iraq to the same fate which Afghanistan had been pushed before and so long as the main objective is embarrassing the Americans and forcing them to quit regardless of what would become of that country later on even if the result was one like that of the Afghanistan's experiment.
Let's imagine what would become of Iraq if Iyad Allawi's government which, though its negative points are numerous, is the sole and last life straw, collapsed at any moment before it has done its job by handing the country over to a permanent democratically elected government!
NAJAF BATTLE IN REAL PERSPECTIVE!
Neither the existent authority nor the other Shiite categories put forward any appropriate ideas to be invested in a peaceful solution.
In spite of the historic record of other Shiite trends and their organization, discipline and relations outside Iraq, their grassroots do not seem wide or weighty.
They have already entered Iraq having their eyes on power. Preoccupied with their potential gains, they could only be blind to the people's emotions or the street's anger.
The "Neo-Iraqis" coming from abroad could hardly take note of a multiplicity of Iraqi truths and events or rather they both ignored and called the Americans to ignore them, too.
Such a subtle line self imposed by the authority can cope with a situation void of strife, but in the current state, it seems to give each party a pretext for simply ignoring it.
Such security and military conquests have never managed to disperse hatred. They rather keep them alive and even makes it more intense!
The Ministry of Industry will put forward a privatization programme to bolster the Iraqi economy, a source with the Ministry of Industry said.
WITH UNIFIED CURRENCY ...
The main fruits that will be reaped by the GCC from the monetary union and the unified currency are represented in saving the costs of dealings, resolving the problem of different exchange rates, let alone financial markets gains of using unified currency as there will not be any need of exchanging currencies, which will lead to the disappearance of the cost of such dealings.
Unprecedentedly, the Kuwaiti government granted a license yesterday (22nd August) to a popular association interested in defending human rights. This license gives this association the right to practice this activity as a non-profit making association.
The Kuwaiti Association for Human Rights is headed by the veteran Kuwaiti politician and parliamentarian Jassim Al-Kattami who was serving as director of public security during the 1950's and member of parliament during the 1960's. Al-Kattami is a well-known international and Arab personality in the field of defending human rights.
He accused the liberal association of never lifting a finger regarding tens of citizens complaints against the violations committed by security bodies against them during the last campaign of detentions witnessed by Kuwait due to what was called Jihad ring in Iraq. This reveals the political rather than the human orientation of the association, Al- Tobtiba'e added.
In mid-September next month, Kuwait will receive the new American ambassador Richard Libaron amid objections from Kuwaiti Islamic deputies to Kuwaiti government approval of him because he had worked as a deputy to the American ambassador in Tel Aviv before being nominated for Kuwait.
He went on to say that regarding his previous job in Israel, he had also worked in Egypt as both Israel and Egypt are among the most important countries in the Middle East to the USA. His choice for Kuwait now reflects president Bush's Administration to choose diplomats who are well versed and experienced in the region especially Kuwait, key ally to the USA, he added.
The appointment of Libaron as successor of Richard Jones who was appointed last year -in addition to his work in Kuwai- assistant of former American civil administrator in Iraq Paul Bremer.
NAJAF PRELUDE TO WAR ON IRAN
Iran now is doing its best to keep the war with the USA on the Iraqi territories, which are prone to any developments. It strives to keep itself distant from that war because it knows well which way the wind blows.
It thinks that as long as this development serves the anti-American trend in Iraq, it would be difficult for the Americans to repeat that mistake in Iran.
Anyway, the American troops are now stationed near Iranian borders. The situation now is not only related to imperial powers dreams in the region, but similar to a military blockade, particularly in the absence of a similar force.
Once upon a time, former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said he would destroy half of Israel if it attacked Iraq and the Iranians are now doing the same thing after test-firing Shihab-3 missile.
NEW INDUSTRIES FEDERATION HEAD SUPPORTS COOPERATION WITH ISRAEL

The association has been, and will remain, a powering citadel of freedom, he said.

Q: Truth is always useful, why do you refrain from telling it then?
Q: How can you analyze the case politically? Why did you announce that you wouldn't claim compensation?
Egypt is now more prepared than ever for a reform agenda. Now that President Hosni Mubarak's era is marked by relative stability, it becomes fit to carry out major reforms, favourable about-turns and constructive shifts. The year 2005, I think, will be a final test for over two decades of laborious work. Therefore, the Egyptians, including the President, the people, political parties and the government, hope that the coming year will be a major turning point in the national action march.
Fourth: the prescription for political and constitutional reform in Egypt includes a breakthrough required for the way the political parties exercise their activities, and transparent and fair parliamentary elections.

EGYPTIAN BANKS LIKELY TO RESUME SHEKEL DEALS SOON, ISRAELI BANKS TO ENTER LOCAL MARKET
Meanwhile, the Commercial International Bank-Egypt (CIB) broke the boycott against Israeli banks and hosted an Israeli bank representative late last year at the Mediterranean Bank Forum, which was hosted by Banque Misr in Cairo. Sahar el-Sallab, managing director of Banque Misr defended such a step towards the normalization of economic and banking cooperation with Israel. At the same time, she did not rule out possible deals between both sides.
As the CBE's late June deadline for money exchangers to raise their capital up to 500 million pounds as a maximum is closing, bank leaders are presently stepping up efforts to find approaches whether through merger or possession instead of liquidation. However, there are fears of possible cooperation with Israeli partners with whom there will be large trade deals in the coming period, as predicted by bank presidents.

Egyptian cotton exports contracts in three weeks hit 2.200 million kantars at a value of 200 million dollars, said Mohamed Al-Shiwi, the government's delegate with Cotton Exporters Union, adding that 42% of total contracts were shipped.
The mission welcomed Egypt's participation in the IMF standards relative to publishing data, describing this step as a positive step towards transparent information.
The mission noted that the mechanisms the CBE intends to use to ensure the continuity of regular performance of the market were also discussed.

Some international major banks started important steps to buy Egyptian banks or even big shares. In the forefront of such banks are Societe Generale - the second biggest French bank - and Barclays, one of the biggest British banks. Some other banks, including the French BNP Paribas, consider supporting their presence in the Egyptian banking sector, where there are growing investments, the possibility of making high profits, and the large number of customers that could be attracted, as Egypt is considered the biggest market in the region and includes more than 70 million consumers.
In reply to a question about the banks that Societe Generale considers to buy on the Egyptian market, the sources emphasized that the French bank aimed at buying strong Egyptian banks that have many branches nationwide. However, the source ruled out the possibility of the French bank purchasing Bank of Alexandria, which is currently put up for sale within a state plan to sell 3 public banks.

Indeed, misfortunes sometimes arouse laughter!
What was really exciting was that Israel, in particular, had a spy in an American strategic position even though all American secrets are available for and offered to that rogue country without the least trouble on a silver plate, so to speak!
In response to Israel's wish, Washington is leading an enormous campaign and exercising heavy pressure on Tehran to prevent it from enriching uranium for peaceful applications with the Soviet help.

Yesterday, Israeli sources announced that the settlement campaign which started in occupied Syrian Golan Heights two years ago is receiving unprecedentedly great momentum.

The Americans launched war on Iraq for Israel's eyes.
This was what they were plotting against Iran after their strike against Iraq.
Finally I'd like to appeal to the Arabs to invest what happened for exposing Israel's truth before the international community so that they may understand in the end that Israel is not the "faithful sister" as they might imagine and that their interests would never lie with Israel because the Jews believe that hegemony and control would inevitably be theirs in the long run!
CENTRAL BANK, GULF UNIFIED CURRENCY MID 2006
Within the framework of indirect Israeli interference in the crisis of Darfur, an Israeli medical mission paid a recent visit to Chad secretly under the pretext of treating some Sudanese refugees from Darfur.
50 MILLION RIYALS ISLAMIC AID TO DARFUR
The May 1983 rebellion led by John Garang was different from the August 1955 one as the former was not aimed at separation, unlike the latter which was launched months ahead of Sudan's independence. This was shown through ideological claims by Garang that Sudan is an "African country that should be liberated from the hegemony of Arab minorities."
Three political groups tried to overcome such a "societal non-integration". They are Arab National Movement by Sudan's former president Gafar Numeiri, Free Officers supported by late president Gamal Abdel-Nasser of Egypt and Abdel-Khalik Mahgoub and his communist party, who sought to succeed Numeiri, but when he failed to do so he led the failed July 1971 coup, and the National Islamic Front led by Hassan Turabi, which tried to enforce Islamic Sharia' in Sudan thanks to the sway of Islamists over Darfur Africans, which they inherited from the Ummah (Nation) Party, which used Darfur as one of its strongholds to the extent that the October 1964 October 1st coalition government formed following the unseating of General Aboud was toppled through the use of help of Mahdia supporters from west Sudan to Khartoum streets in 1965.
Now that the Darfur crisis has run deeper and has been internationalized, Garang's position appears to be stronger before the government of Khartoum, and his recent call on the international community to impose whatever pressure he sees necessary to create a just peace in Darfur did not only spring from his feeling of the necessity of unity with his "African brethren" there against Arabs, but also from the possibility of forcing his old agenda to Africanize Sudan under the current circumstances that have sent Sudanese Arabs into their worst situation in half a century.
According to a source close to the official Iraqi delegation currently visiting the Iranian capital of Tehran, "open" negotiations were held with Iranian officials especially regarding the security file.

He pointed out that there were Iranian parties sought to undermine good bilateral relations.
The extension issue was so rapidly determined in just a few days because the meal had been simmering on weak fire for quite a long time and so it was completed before any talk about sovereignty and Lebanization and is already waiting to be announced!
If Maronite Patriarch Cardinal Nasrullah Safir, who has turned into the voice of Christians in Lebanon, could only reject the amendment of the constitution and demand sovereignty without too much illusions about an attitude affecting the Syrian decision, politicians have already fell into the small bog dug by the Lebanization theory.
In light of the unanimity shown by America, France, Britain, and other Western countries that the Lebanese constitution should be respected, which means the necessity to cut down to size the Syrian influence in Lebanon for reasons related to the Syrian role in the region, the battle talked about by Damascus may be expected to be really tough!
The extension granted to Lahud in that way confirms such inclinations.

The real estate market in Egypt has recovered with the decline of the dollar's exchange rate against the Egyptian pound, Shihab Mazhar, a real estate expert affirmed. Investment in the real estate has been always correlated with the increase and decrease of the exchange rate of the US dollar, he said, noting an increasing purchase movement on the real estate market in Egypt, especially in tourist resorts and villas on the outskirts of Cairo, since late last year and early this year.
The number of those willing to purchase housing units on the outskirts of the capital is increasing due to overcrowdedness inside the capital. They compare between an "apartment" in downtown and a villa surrounded with a green area and clean air outside the capital and they prefer the latter, Mazhar opined.

SYRIA ... . THE REGIONAL ROLE PRICE
The American administration most likely considered giving Lahud an extra term in office a suitable chance to unearth its real differences with Damascus, capitalizing this time on a French desire to curb its role. France witnessed over the past months bilateral and trilateral summits to discuss that issue.
Washington most likely betted on the recession of that role after the death of former President Hafez Assad, however, it was taken aback by Bashar Assad's political prudence and ability to maintain that role even after the terrorist attacks on the United States, war on Iraq, Arab collective collapse and threats launched by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.

The Egyptian home has been dominated by superstitions after a period when the Egyptian imagination especially in the countryside could create hundreds of stories and talks which started at first as means entertaining or scaring children.

Egyptian exports have begun to grow up at markets where the demand is increasing such as America, France, Italy and Britain, while exports have dropped at markets like Tanzania where the demand was also high.
If that was true, it would definitely pinpoint a complete fiasco on the part of the government financial policy whether with regard to the current government, now in power for nine months, or its predecessors.
The real size of the disaster may be realized, as only 3% of that GDP is allowable for the budget deficit.

HAMAS LEADER: HAMAS IS ONE UNIT AND ITS FORCES ONE NOT IN ONE PLACE
Al-Zahar criticized the calls for return to the negotiating table or stopping resistance through stopping Al-Qassam missiles or martyrdom operations, pointing out that resistance was the main reason behind the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza Strip.
Former chairman of the Palestinian National Council, Khalid Al-Fahoum told Al-Hayat that the Palestinian organizations offices in Damascus were closed down and their telephone lines were cut. Arab sources in a European capital told Al-Hayat that an Arab intelligence department had presented the Mossad with a full file on Hamas structure and leadership abroad.
High-ranking Syrian sources told Al-Hayat that the organizations' leaders were outside Syrian territories, adding that Damascus had informed the American assistant Secretary of State, William Burns that the organizations were involved in the Palestinian dialogue.
Arab sources in a European capital said that the Mossad wanted to form a complete picture about Hamas leadership structure in order to carry out assassinations against its active leaderships in a bid to undermine its leadership abroad which Israel considers a basic supporter of the movement in the Western Bank and Gaza Strip. Besides, the movement officials think that the leadership abroad was a guarantee and safety valve to ensure Hamas' survival despite the hard blows launched at it in the interior especially after the assassination of its founder Ahmed Yassin and leader in Gaza Abdel-Aziz Rantissi.
What Ya'alon said quite obviously was that the Hebrew state's arm was long enough to reach the heart of any Arab capital to achieve its goals.
The Damascus blast operation comes in the context of Israeli attempts to give the lie to Hamas' departure from Syria.
It simply wants to strip Syria of all cards, including the Palestinian one because this stage may be on the part of Israeli called turning over the leaf of resistance in Palestine and Lebanon and elsewhere and even forcibly pulling their teeth out.
The Palestinian, (as well as the Lebanese experiment during and after the civil war) prove that Israel have never been suffering from a dearth in agents or in audacity to violate any country's sovereignty.
Four years after the outbreak of the Palestinian Al-Aqsa Intifada, the ideological contents of Fata movement's political discourse are now similar to those of Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Any statement released by Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, which is supposed to use political actuality in its discourse, now links resistance to the liberation of all occupied Palestinian territories, the same demands of resistance movements on religious grounds.
This development was mainly due to a major incentive in the milieus of young men to carry out such attacks.
Such a sort of operations was initiated by Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades. Four years after the outbreak of the Al-Aqsa Intifada, over 30 infiltrations were launched, killing scores of occupying troops and Jewish settlers.
Each resistance organization has its respective engineering section to manufacture rockets and missiles, according to their statements and websites.
All Palestinian martyrs from diverse factions appeared in memorial videotapes, recorded ahead of the attacks, while holding copies of the Holy Qura'n.
Some excerpts of the interview came as follows:
Q-What are the mechanisms through which you think there could be a way out? A-Any mechanism needs two parties. The first is the Israeli part, which is required to stop all violence and serious aggression launched against the Palestinian people on a daily basis.
Q-Determination from who?
Q-Who aborted this determination, intentions, and will?
Q-Specifically, who obstructed the performance of the government?
A-This is a big question. If you ask me whether Sharon wants peace or not, I would say no.
Q-Does not the talk about reform and fighting corruption as a priority for the Palestinian street rule out the other option of resistance?
Surprisingly, all the talk about reform came in the address of Abu Ammar (Yasser Arafat) before the Legislative Council recently.
A-We should understand the plan totally. It is the outcome of an American-Israeli agreement. We have nothing to do with it. Nor does any Arab country have anything to do with it, neither Egypt nor Jordan.
Q-But, the supporters of the resistance option say that the withdrawal from Gaza is the result of the resistance option and martyrdom operations?
Q-Then, you drop the option of resistance totally?
Q: How do you see the Palestinian security situation in light of the current condition of laxity?
Q: Does this mean that the Intifada will be announced as terminated as soon as a security plan starts?
Q: What is the Egyptian role within the framework of the unification of Palestinians security bodies?
Q: What are the executive steps to that end?
Q: Does this mean that Palestinian security bodies will act against resistance activists?

The government started to take serious steps to sell Egyptian banks within the framework of the privatization programme contracted with the International Monetary Fund IMF and the World Bank as a condition for getting further loans from the World Bank. Such steps mainly include having preparations for selling the Bank of Alexandria almost completed.
In September 2003, the World Bank had shown readiness to grant Egypt one billion dollars provided that the Egyptian banking system is modernized through a definite plan approved by the World Bank. The plan included financially and administratively restructuring Egyptian banks and increasing their capital so that each bank might reach the capital minimum, i.e. 500 million pounds by June 2006. This would also apply to foreign banks branches, which should reach the 50-million-dollar capital rather than 15-million-dollar capital minimum.
Experts warn against a disaster as a result of the selling operation, which would violently shake the banking sector that claims the main part in financial activities: about 62% of market structure in terms of financial assets in 2003 according to the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) reports compared with about 78% in 1993.

However, can such coercion and administrative decrees lead to a fair exchange rate which all organizations on the market may be forced to abide by?
Is the 3-month period enough to adjust the positions of such companies and increase the companies paid capital to LE10 million?
Is it a continuation of the exchange rate policy that started in 1991?

Dr. Wasel also considered Haj and Zakat of both users of and dealers in tobacco, wine and drugs as utterly unacceptable. If the money is earned through a haram (religiously impermissible) means, no good act including Haj and Zakat will be accepted. Only if the money was earned through halal (religiously permissible) activities, will such good acts be accepted by Allah.

CAIRO WOULD DEAL WITH SHARON, THE PRIME MINISTER, "IF HE DID ANYTHING USEFUL TO THE PEACE PROCESS"
He added that on the heels of Taba negotiations, Cairo refused to arrange a meeting between Palestinian chairman Yasser Arafat and Barak simply because "we realized that such a meeting would bring about no tangible results in favour of the peace process but would only offer an election cover for Barak."
He added, "Sharon's black record and notoriety might weigh him down and drive him perhaps to take positions that would ameliorate such notoriety." He pointed out that all Arab wars against Israel were caused by Labour Party leaders, whereas the peace accords were signed by hard-liners such as Menachem Begin.
Yet let it be known too that Egypt is capable of deterring aggression. When she voted for peace, she knew quite well that peace needed to be protected by force.
He emphasized that "it is out of the question, for the time being to return the Egyptian ambassador to Israel as his return would depend on the practices of the coming Israeli premier."

The recent report, no. 160 for January and February 2001, of the specialized national councils under the chairmanship of former prime minister Dr Atef Sedki showed that the situation of science and technology in Egypt at the end of the 20th century had two important features.
The government and the state are the first to blame for the poor level of technological and scientific progress in the Egyptian society as this question is a strategic one that has to do with the society and its entire entity.
The report indicated a contradiction in government data on the value of deals that have been concluded, foremost of which is Pepsi Cola sale deal. To illustrate, the report indicated that it had been sold for LE156 million while another one indicated that it had been sold for LE131.1 million.
The strategic economic attitudes report pointed out that the turning of the company into a loss-maker aimed at paving the way for cutting the value of the sale deal of the company, which was an affiliate to the Holding Company for Engineering Industry whose board chairman at that time was Abdel-Wahab Al-Habbak.
The privatization process obstructed the implementation of new private investments which the economy needs as the money paid in return for buying the public companies could have been partially or totally used for generating new investments, the report affirmed.

THE INTIFADA AND THE BOYCOTT REMAIN THE WEAPON OF THE WEAK!
This urged President Mubarak to reply in firm curtness or curt firmness!
What positive and negative points did that bring about? What are the gains and the losses? Should we carry on with that march or try hard to find an alternative, a new track or legitimacy, or new techniques to reach the strategic goal - comprehensive just peace that would restore usurped rights and legitimacy!
Lawyer of the Coptic families that lost some of their members in the second Kosheh incident said the families would challenge the verdicts handed down by the court on 5 February 2001against the case defendants. They would mainly ask for compensation from those acquitted.

EGYPT'S AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL: SHARON SEEKS TO HAVE MILITARY SUPERIORITY
The first will provide for a long interim period during which the issues of Jerusalem and the refugees will be delayed.
If Sharon wins, he will have two options, he said. First, he will have to form a narrow coalition without the Labor Party, something that will cause endless problems to him, as the small parties will blackmail him.
The Arab discourse was started by President Mubarak in his recent talk to the Israeli television when he firmly warned the Israelis against brandishing violence and war adding that the 1967 war would not happen again.
It is the duty of the Palestinians to adopt a hardline position rather than accept solutions that would grant the Israeli rightists concessions at the expense of the central issues. It is the duty of the Arabs, on the other hand, to have a unified tone which would not let Sharon and the Israeli rightist understand that they could get away with their political and military hooliganism!
The Egyptian Ministry of Justice has decided to amend the judicial power law so that the judiciary would be fully independent of the executive power.

Sharon is expected to develop sea weapons and nuclear capabilities, and concentrate on strategic cooperation with the United States, said the ambassador.
As for the third step, Sharon will maintain a western security zone at a depth ranging from five to seven kilometers along the green line. He will also divide the West Bank into small isolated cantons and maintain Israel's control of the subterranean water without evacuating any settlement.
AK/ Al-Akhbar, 7/2/2001
We expect Sharon, in pursuit of his goals and objectives, to resort to further excessive violence to keep down the intifada, entirely devastate the Palestinian National Authority structures, assassinate its leaderships. He will in all likelihood do so following in the footsteps of Ehud Barak who has paved the way for him through sheer violence over the last months. Sharon might also be tempted to expand the circle of violence, export feelings of concern and tension to other Arabs beyond the borders, which he himself announced when he threatened to launch a regional war against Lebanon and Syria and perhaps Jordan. He even went to the lengths of threatening to destroy Egypt and the High Dam!
A decade has already elapsed since the Arabs showed commitment to peace in Madrid conference in 1991 under American pressure and European temptation. Only a few days ago, we made the latest settlement attempt in 2001 in Taba, but to what result?

The 5-scientist team includes Egyptian scientist Essam Heggy, who told Al-Hayat that the scientists would experiment a model of Net Lender spacecraft which consists of 4 geological probes that would be embedded in Mars planet at a depth ranging from 100 - 1000 meters.
HAH, Al-Hayat, 8/2/2001
This is the paradox that represents the core of the current situation. In other words, the "bulldozer" is now in power, but it has little fuel in its tanks.
Sharon wants to redeem himself to avoid going down in history as a mere mastermind of massacres.
The third one lies in his political agenda.
While the large majority of the Israelis want peace with the Arabs, they are also thirsty for revenge against the Palestinians, and Hizbullah as well, for boldly challenging Israel's might and dragging its famous "power of deterrence" that they regard as the mainstay of their national security through the mud.
To say that the Likud Party under Menachem Begin was the party that made peace with the Arabs and may be able to do it again under the leadership of the assassin Ariel Sharon is a sort of self-deception. It is like burying our heads in the sand until the Israeli state extending from the Euphrates to the Nile that is described in the Torah is established, for this is the holy religious mission for which Sharon, the modern-age King of Israel, has come to accomplish.
This came in an article by Ahmad Taha Al Nukr
The Pope announced that the Coptic Church would challenge the sentences before the Court of Cassation with all possible legal means.
Pope Shenouda strongly denied that Egyptian Copts were seeking privileges or political rights, declining to disclose the number of Copts in Egypt. Joking with the audience, he said, "The issue of the number of Copts does not concern us, for if we devote our time to counting them, we will become awfully tired from the long effort required by such a task."
Certainly the accomplishment of these three objectives entailed a quite heavy burden, which was, in fact, the impact of the weighty words in which the Wahi (divine inspiration) was sent down: "Soon shall We send down to thee a weighty Word" (S73 A5), the weight of the civilization whose ingredients came to completion in record time and the weight of the influence that this Quranic statement had, and still has, on the human soul. This did not happen for any other prophet before Mohammad, which is the core of civilizational giving.
As to monotheism, it is the foundation of the universe and life. Belief in monotheism means landing on the shore of stability in the psychological field and getting rid of the gods that had been made equal with Allah but were fake and unreal.
Failure to discharge this duty means losing the Ummah in such a way that will taint every individual and denounce every community. However, this duty is the one that is really missing in the real world of Islam.
We wish that all the muftis of the Muslim World would give us fatwas (legal opinions based on sharia, or Islamic law) on the legality of existence of borders among the countries of the one Muslim World.

Although no official reactions were voiced regarding the call of establishing this party, the Tamazight movement witnessed sharp inner divisions, as some leading figures rejected this idea frankly.
As this issue turned from being a cultural problem into a political one, matters were complicated. Moreover, many forces of the society started to cast doubt on it. However, from the practical point of view, some requests of the advocates of this issue were met.
Another trend inside the Tamazight itself is of the view that this movement is part of the international movement at original population. This may form a nucleus for the Tamazight nationalism. In this context, the Tamazight world congress was formed as an international body despite reservations expressed by Moroccan Tamazight societies about that.
COLLABORATORS?
In their communiqué, the liberated prisoners say that they are proud of their pioneering experiment of struggle throughout the long years of captivity under occupation. However, the frustration is apparent in their protest against the government's neglect of their rights and ignoring of their demands that have remained unanswered for long. The flimsy promises of government officials have not succeeded in keeping hunger, disease and poverty away from these people and their families.
Mohammad Kassim, another liberated prisoner, ran into one of former jailers from the days of Al Khiyam Jail on the street. He could not bear the pain of seeing his tormentor in the same place with him, so he attacked him in a frenzy, driving his fists into his face several times in an attempt to even the score and vent the rage and pain that had torn his weak body apart for years.
Lebanon remains the only exception in the world, for its government has done nothing so far to set things rights for its released prisoners of war.
First Undersecretary of the Ministry of Health for Preventive Medicine, Dr. Mahmoud Aboul-Nasr said no decision had been taken to ban the importation of plasma and blood derivatives from Britain despite the scandal that took place regarding the importation of albumin medicine that was contaminated with mad cow disease.

EAPC'S FUTURE VEILED IN OBSCURITY
The sensitivity towards the EAPC is not new as Shafik Gabr and Tahir Helmi, both businessmen among the EAPC membership, were censured for their statements carried by US newspapers on Egypt's economy, which led to an official intervention on the basis that they were not Egypt's spokesmen.
It seems that the US side has lost its enthusiasm about the EAPC even Al Gore has not attended EAPC's meetings for a couple of years and some US businessmen sent representatives to Egypt to attend meetings including the recent one with President Mubarak in Washington.

It is also important that the curricula of sex education be appropriate for each age group or school stage and be inserted into suitable curricula, such as biology, science, religion and Arabic."
Dr Said Ismail Ali, Professor of Education, said, "I am somewhat reserved on the talk about teaching sex in schools today, because it is built on a reaction at present. When we plan for school curricula, we must do that on the basis of a futuristic strategy and a futuristic plan, not because of some 'row' that went up as a result of some literary works, or those so-called literary productions they were talking about.
Dr Saadia Bahadir, President of Children Lovers' Society, said, "I believe that teaching sex in schools is a must at present. We live in a world of open skies, or in a small village as they say. Children watch and listen to everything related to sex in the media, particularly television, which puts each and every kind of information at their fingertips."

The observers are of the view that a coalition government will be a temporary one, but such a view is subject to speculations about the volume of representation in the Knesset, and may pave the way for a new Israeli generation assuming power. This new generation is expected to mostly belong to the extremist trend.
About the features of a Likud government, Al-Baz said that the Likud Party is keen on annexing as many Palestinian lands as possible, but the Labour Party does not consider Israel to rule another people as favourable to Israel. This, however, does not preclude common grounds between the two parties regarding some issues such as returning of the refugees, Jerusalem, water, security arrangements and the Palestine State's relation with other countries in the region.
Al-Ahrar newspaper published a feature on Sharon's win and his call for forming a coalition government, and the prospective impacts of that call:
Sharon might seize any chance to deal military blows to assert Israeli military superiority and force the Arabs to negotiate with complete submission to Sharon's conditions, says Nabil Abdel-Fattah at Al-Ahram Strategic Studies Centre. He might introduce himself as a man of strategic deterrence against the Palestinians and the Arabs. Major General Talaat Mussalam, a strategic expert, affirms that Sharon's accession to power in Israel is a call for war. The Arab nation, therefore, should, by no means, wait till matters clarify.

In a lecture organized by Egypt's Society for Culture and Dialogue under the theme of "the culture of the new generation," Dr. Al-Fiqi said that King Fouad brought about a scientific awakening.
"There are 50 persons who govern this country. Will young men have hope, then?" he asked. Al-Fiqi agreed to what Imam said, pointing to a study, which showed that two thirds of Egypt's population are under 35 years of age. However, their role in decision making does not exceed 5%.
On the other hand, Al-Fiqi pointed out that Egyptians spend much on the religious occasions, including pilgrimage. Money spent on these occasions is estimated at LE6 billion yearly!

ADMINISTRATIVE JUDICIARY UPHOLDS DECISION BANNING NOTARIZATION OF EGYPTIAN ISRAELI SOCIETY
M.S. Al-Akhbar, 12/2/2001
The statement, which promises a comprehensive plan for upgrading textbooks according to world specifications and says that texts will be printed on CDs, tells us that the minister's advisers who had concocted that dazzling plan must be the offspring of Marie Antoinette, who was told just before the outbreak of the French Revolution that the people were demonstrating because they could not find bread to eat, and she exclaimed innocently, "So why do not they eat brioche?"
The funny part of the statement is that part about books on CDs.
This came in an article by Dr. Hassan Ragab.
The total amount of money spent by Egyptians on that drug did not exceed LE600 million simply because that production of US does not exceed LE5 billion annually, 65% of which are consumed inside the US itself. The quota at developing countries does not exceed 10%, he added pointing out that the study published by some newspapers about the total consumption of Viagra hitting billions was not accurate.
Na'el Al-Dorra, brother of Gamal Al-Dorra father of Palestinian young martyr Mohamed Al-Dorra who was killed by Israeli troops in the arms of his father at the start of the Palestinian uprising, was quoted by Asharq Al-Awsat daily as saying: "We were given access to cheques from the Ministry of Social Affairs belonging to my injured brother Gamal Al-Dorra and his martyred young son Mohamed Al-Dorra. Having our cheques reviewed at the bank, we found out that they were dud cheques. Unfortunately, the same thing happened to all other affected families. The Ministry of Social Affairs offered cheques to the deservers in the hope that Arab donations aiming at supporting the affected families might turn up. The ministry was consequently forced into tight corner as thousands of these families were waiting for these Arab funds to cater for their needs."

This quantity will be mainly exported from the short and medium staple kinds to make use of price margins of exporting big quantities of Egyptian cotton of supra- long and long staple at low prices, on the average less by 40% than the Egyptian cotton, Abdel-Maksoud said. This will achieve a big rise in cotton exportation proceeds, and, at the same time, will achieve the maximum possible benefits for Egyptian cotton.
The Czech companies ascribed their rejection to the high prices of these exports, which also did not meet standard specifications.
Minister of Telecommunications and Information Technology, Ahmed Nazif has emphasized that there is a tendency to invite private sector companies to join Egypt Telecom in providing phone lines through BOO system, which is based on assigning and providing phone lines to private companies which would then share out profits with Egypt Telecom.

The question is: why was the normalization of relations so delayed even though the announcement of intentions give the impression of a strong tendency to such normalization?
Iranian penetration of the Red Sea area besides reports of the Sudan granting military facilities to Iran in Port Sudan, which are areas of high sensitivity to Egyptian national security due to geographical proximity factors.
There is, however, a very positive look at Amr Moussa who is seen by many as the most creditable skipper of the normalization boat with Iran.
So, why has Al-Khober file been opened particularly now? Who is targeted by such a declaration? The declaration can be interpreted in sundry ways.
Does the declaration imply an imminent trap for Iran to be drawn to the same track that had been trodden by Iraq and Libya?
Who has used terrorism a revolutionary means"?

The paper discusses the Arab boycott against Israel at all levels and from all angles, starting with Arab League resolution no 357 for 1951, which stipulated the establishment of an apparatus that would lay down the necessary plans and procedures for boycotting Israel.
The liaison offices in Arab States should be reactivated, so as to prevent any dealings with companies that deal with Israel and advise such companies that they should adjust their positions. Besides, the provisions of the unified boycott law should be applied, including deterrent penalties on those who have dealings of any sort with Israel.
-A web site should be established for the Boycott Office on the Internet, so as to explain the reasons, objectives, principles and even legitimacy of the boycott in defence of Arab rights in the face of Israeli policies and intransigence. On this site, affirmations should be made that the boycott is not a precedent by Arab States, nor is it something that the Arabs have invented, but is a legitimate tool of self-defence, so as to demonstrate the legitimacy and justice of the Arab attitude.

While he praised the government's refraining from interference in the Bar Association elections, Al Hudaibi denied the existence of an undeclared deal between the Muslim Brotherhood and the government.
Egypt had such elections, and it was her right to see elections respected because it is a country with ancient traditions, and the Bar Association is one of the oldest syndicates in Egypt, not to mention that it is one of the most active ones in the political field.
How could the Muslim Brotherhood make a deal with such a number in public elections that were in the limelight even before they took place?
A: What exactly do you mean by tactic? This term is sometimes used to imply opportunism, some sort of climbing or deception, which is untrue in our case.
All professional syndicates are paralyzed, under receivership and suspended, and many of them have gone bankrupt. If those who care about public affairs seek a way out of this mishap that afflicted the country, this should be a point in their favour, not against them.
We are now saying to the government, which has the power to approve the establishment of parties, that it must recognize the Muslim Brotherhood as a reality that cannot be ignored by any means. There is no way that a large segment of the people at all popular and professional levels can be left out of the legitimate context.

Such an act is a kind of helping one another in sin and rancor, and of eating up people's property for vanities."

However, increasing opportunities of growth and the great investment attraction of the Egyptian market have made several specialized international companies invade the Egyptian market with several billion dollars in investments.

"Therefore, there is no need to fear the arrival of the multinationals, because the people on our market are aware of what is happening. However, reality may impose some apprehensions because 80% of Egyptian merchants are small grocers in city alleys, villages and hamlets. According to studies that were made in this respect, these people will not be affected by the competition before 20 years, as their businesses depend on the personal relationships between the grocer and his clientele.

THE FATWA, THE BOMB
Palestine is an occupied land and its people, from the religious and legal point of view, are in a state of self-defense that is permitted by Islam, says Dr. Imam. Thus, their souls and expensive objects, which they offer as a sort of sacrifice in the cause of God, are considered Jihad from the Islamic Sharia point of view. They should fight the enemy wherever they find it. If they fall in the field of Jihad, they will be martyrs "finding their sustenance in the presence of their Lord (God)," he adds.
Self-defense is a legitimate act from the human, religious and national points of view." Regarding the statement that these commando operations are not based on any Islamic Sharia principle, Dr. Fayomi says self-defense is legitimate, and its legitimacy stems from the right to defend one's soul, honor and homeland, especially as these operations are aimed at achieving stability and security vis-à-vis Israel's tyranny.
For his part, Dr. Mohamed Roshdi, member of the Islamic Research Academy, asserts that commando operations are the most prominent form of sacrifice, as a commando goes to death willingly. However, the permissibility or non-permissibility of such commando attacks is contingent upon the intention of the commando himself, says Dr. Roshdi. If the commando intends to fight in the cause of worldly target or money, he will be committing suicide. But if he intends to fight in the cause of God to liberate the land and defend his religion and homeland, he will be a martyr, he points out."

Egyptian former Minister of Defence and head of Intelligence Department, Amin Heweidi. surprised the audience by asking the state to subject the budget of the Armed Forces, the Minister of Interior and the Intelligence Department to public discussion.

17- Q: Mr. President, there is a multiplicity of referentialities in the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) territories - Arafat, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Syrians and the Iranians.
If the current PNA went, some other authority would take over and the Palestinians would never tolerate humiliation and occupation. Anyhow, under present conditions, Arafat won't be able to stop his people's uprising. If he asked them to stop violent actions no body would respond to him.
21- Q: Mr. President Where is the American role towards that?

The market moves from worse to worst and is dying, said Radwan Fatehi, sales manager of Al-Mas'oud company. All companies went into debts and default due to price-cutting as the companies do not buy in cash but by cheque, and sells in cash at a price less than that of the purchase.

-	The forces of counter pressure and the groups of interests.
Such writers beautify persecution, defend suppression and constitute a stumbling bloc to democratic development.
This institution seems to be working alone and running itself individually without paying heed to the political conditions.
Mohamed Abdel-Hakim Diab, a writer and journalist, dealt with "the impact of internal conditions on Egypt's external role." To begin with, he asserted that it is difficult to separate internal from external policies in any country in the world. He believed that the internal policy has several points of concern, foremost among which is the economic one.
Armed and terrorist operations witnessed by Egypt are the outcome of the Egyptian economic, social and political reality, he said. He also ascribed these operations to joblessness, poverty, and negligence. He spoke about crimes, dividing them into two kinds - the crimes of the new classes, described by him as corrupt, and the political crimes.
Regarding armament, Diab said Egypt obtains its weapons from a single source - the US.
-	Egypt should not possess a strong army.
Late president of the US John Kennedy imposed a condition on late president of Egypt Gamal Abdel-Naser that Egypt should not come out of its borders. According to Shafiq, Britain's plantation of the Hebrew State in Palestine was aimed at banning Egypt from coming out of its borders.

SHARP DIFFERENCES IN WAFD PARTY
"These developments threaten the Party with collapse," Badrawi told Al- Hayat.
Dependence on agriculture as a main craft of villagers is vanishing. Joblessness is dreadfully spreading among its youths, constituting a time bomb that may explode at any time.
Dr. Al-Saeed Ibrahim Al-Badawi, professor of human geography in Cairo University, said disguised and blatant joblessness is a time bomb in the Egyptian countryside. His applied study on a village in Gharbiya Governorate showed that 64% of the villagers suffer from disguised and blatant unemployment. Meanwhile, the pattern of farmers' life has changed. They started to stay awake at night and sleep till noon, something that affected their productivity and increased their consumer tastes.
-	New types of conducts that contradict good values have invaded the countryside.
Dr. Mirvat Ahmed Khallaf, assistant professor at Mansoura University's Faculty of Arts, said there are destructive defects in the distribution of educational services in the Egyptian countryside. All different kinds of schools can be found in some villages, at a time when other scores of villages are deprived of the establishment of a primary school that protects their sons from traveling to another village to be educated. This leads to the aggravation of illiteracy.
Despite these problems, all participants in the symposium said there is hope to achieve a better future for the Egyptian village and avoid the negative aspects, provided however that a set of important steps are taken. Dr. Fatehi Abu Eiyana asked for the necessity of combining the arable land and establishing agricultural companies to be run by villagers who will contribute to them according to their shares, so that the problem of fragmenting arable land possession might be overcome and the village might be liberated from the new usurer - the Agricultural Development and Credit Bank. The participants also asked for the necessity of reconsidering education to treat such a big educational imbalance from which more than half of Egypt's population suffers.

Meanwhile, they asked for devoting parliamentary sittings to discussing this issue in detail and passing decisions, approved by the government and the PA, on how to deal with the Jewish capital in the investment and economic arena in Egypt.

The Egyptian PA members welcomed the government's tendency to liquidate the Israeli investments and contribution to some investment projects in Egypt.

Head of Exchange Section at the Federation of the Egyptian Chambers of Commerce Mohamed Hassan Al-Abiad said the Central Bank of Egypt's raising of the pound exchange rate against the US dollar by one piastre will have a very poor effect on the market as one piastre only is not sufficient for raising the rate in exchange firms where the dollar will stand at about 390 piastres after this rise within the framework of CBE decision allowing 1% rise or decline per day.

COPTIC LAWYERS SEEK TO SET UP COMMITTEE ON CHRISTIAN LEGISLATION AT BAR ASSOCIATION
Even though Ramzi's plan triggered arguments inside Coptic milieus, some figures like Naguib Gibrail, emphasized that the concept should be rejected as it may cause a conflict between religious and Christian committees. The concept should not be implemented, as no parties should be set up on religious basis. This trend has, however, been rejected by others like lawyer Milad Saroufim, who emphasized that "Coptic lawyers have the right to set up such a committee on par with the Islamic Sharia Committee. No Muslim or Christian may object to such an idea just as no Coptic lawyer may object to the Islamic Sharia Committee!"
He also embodied the Palestinian insistence on not abandoning any of the Palestinian rights in the city of prophets. Hence, Al-Husseini was frequently exposed to barbaric assaults at the hands of Israeli soldiers. He was insulted, reviled, and impudently threatened during his participation in peaceful demonstrations against the Israelis, and in the course of his confrontation of the continuous Israeli attempts to profane sanctums in Jerusalem.
Certainly, Al-Husseini was killed with a Kuwaiti dagger held by some Kuwaitis who insisted on insulting him, and the Palestinian leadership and Arafat himself. They issued the most offensive statements, horrible accusations, and the worst swearwords without regard to the current bad conditions of the Palestinians due to brutal bloody Israeli massacres. They saddled Al-Husseini with too heavy a burden even though he was known for his high sensitivity. He steamed up and his blood pressure shot up bringing his heart to a sudden stop after he saw the look of hatred in the eyes of some Kuwaitis around him.
Al-Husseini could hold out against the Israeli hatred and Zionist barbarity for more than 50 years, but he could not bear the Arab hatred for even one day.
It was discovered that Indyke, the American Ambassador to Israel and Deputy Chairman of the American-Israeli Relations Council, worked in favor of Israel at the expense of his country's interests. These expectations were also based on the loss of the Democratic Administration under the leadership of Al Gore and his deputy Libermann, the hard-liner. Both men were known for their bias in favor of Israel. The success of George Bush, the son, and his vice president Dick Cheney boosted these expectations too.
Blatika is one of the Jewish lobby members and adopts pro-Israel and anti-Arab stances. She has racist attitudes towards them.
Robert Stalov, Head of Washington Institute for Middle East Studies, and Daniel Blatika, member of the Congress Foreign Affairs Commission, are the most prominent faces coming to the American Administration and siding with Israel. However, Stalov is the first nominee for joining the National Security Council under the chairmanship of Kondo Leizarais. Stalov will be responsible for the Middle East file. As for the Egyptian side, Stalov has unjust or biased opinions. All studies issued by his institute accuses Egypt of aborting the peace process!
Concern about the nomination of Stalov for this post is attributed to the fact that he will be the American liaison channel between the Arabs and Israel. Danger, at this very point, lies in the fact that he might give precedence to his views and stances over messages he conveys from Arab parties to the American Administration.
He considered that the initiative was not issued by the Salvation Front. "We don't agree that a conference is organized in the name of the front because its known historical leaders live inside the country not abroad," he said.
M.Sh. Al-Ahram Al-Arabi, 2/6/2001
The conference decided to donate 2% of the university professors' salaries to support the uprising, and open the door to (other) donations to back the Palestinian people in their struggle to restore their territories and expel the occupation forces.
Egypt's Mufti Dr. Nasr Farid Wasel asked the Islamic nation to open the door to jihad for liberating captured Jerusalem and ridding it of the Zionists.

He went on to say that he would like to emphasize that only the understanding of concepts rather than the fundamentals of religion are subject to such innovation ideas. Islam, he stressed, had constant fundamentals that are not amenable to change as they have come from God Almighty.
Hence, the Pope added, comes the importance of the conference on which the world pins so much hope to generate a genuinely religious view to scientific technological, economic, cultural and artistic aspects of life.
RETURN TO SINAI,ISRAEL'S NATIONAL DREAM
When the Likud Party under Ariel Sharon took over, the Infrastructure Minister, who is of Russian origin, threatened thrice that Israel would not only occupy Sinai, but also bombard the High Dam with Israeli fighters and missiles to sink Egyptian cities. This expresses a tendency at Sharon's government towards Egypt. It adopts a provocative aggressive policy against Egypt that aims at dragging Egypt to a sixth military round, through which Sharon aims at re-occupying Sinai.
The danger of these schemes lies in the point that the ruling elite in Israel, politicians and military alike, adheres to the same supreme national target of Israel that has an expansionist aggressive nature. This target is represented in the establishment of Greater Israel as a supreme regional power that imposes its hegemony on the Middle East and maintains such a goal whatever different the strategic methods and tools used for its achievement might be.
Thus, strategically speaking, Sinai has become part of the Canal and an important pillar of Egypt's security and defense. In light of this strategic principle, one can say: "By defending Sinai, one will be defending the Canal and consequently Egypt in its entirety."
Fahmi Howeidi, an Islamist writer, writes an article under the above heading. Excerpts run to the following effect:
It moved the battle into Israel, as operations are now being performed inside the Israeli house, which has caused impacts that cannot be trifled with.
Through their own blood lavishly shed and sacrificed, the Palestinians could break the "taboos" falsely set up by Israel, especially regarding the closure of settlements and refugees files. Whatever they excluded as final and irrevocable turned out to be amenable to reconsideration if the pressure went on unabated and were exercised with the utmost degree of firmness and determination simply because whatever was declared as irrevocable taboos turned out to be mere allegations and muscle flexing!
Salama Ahmed Salama, Deputy Chief Editor of Al-Ahram, writes his daily column under the above heading. It runs to the following effect, only in part:
He also kept saying that Egypt's sincere desire for just peace and continuous efforts to find a peaceful settlement to the Palestinian cause and the Israeli occupation of Arab territories in Syria and Lebanon would not preclude it from going to war, if it was compelled to do so in defense of its land and people.
However, what is more important is that our Arab peoples should be aware of the dimensions and possibilities of the current situation and prepare themselves for that before it is too late.
He who watches satellite channels or reads columns in Arab newspapers, without exception, notices unanimity in criticizing the Arab regimes and governments and accusing them of standing hands-folded watching massacres perpetrated against the Palestinians. Those channels and columns say the Arab regimes content themselves with issuing fiery statements that did not halt violence, or deter the Nazi Zionists!
We have independent offices and institutions that can make questionnaires. These offices can be entrusted, in all Arab countries that are members of the Arab League, with making an opinion poll on the issue of war or peace vis-à-vis the brutality practiced by Israel in its dirty war against the Arab Palestinian people.
-	Egypt, Syria and Jordan, as was the case in June 1967 War?
Participation in this war should not be confined to moral support or financial assistance. Rather, it should be total participation with personnel and weapons.
AM/ Akhbar Al-Youm, 2/6/2001
The PA members, who signed the motion, said security and control checks should be made for the companies that would apply for promoting the Egyptian bonds before approving them. The participation by such companies in promoting Egyptian bonds will give room to speculation that may impede Egypt's benefits from the issuance and sale of dollar bonds on international markets.

The assembly meeting which was attended by more than 700 figures representing travel agency owners and agents, said the demands declared by the Travel Agencies Chamber for ensuring the rights of its members and pilgrims do not constitute any interference in Saudi affairs. Such demands come within the context of organising tourist activity in Egypt.
The general assembly also demanded that an agreement be reached by the Egyptian Tourism Ministry and the Saudi side on forming arbitration and reconciliation committees where the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Travel Agencies Chamber would be represented upon bilateral agreement in compliance with provisions of article 22. paragraph 4 of the Saudi executive statute on Umrah organization. The assembly also stressed the necessity of the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism having the competence to settle any dispute that may crop up between the Egyptian side and Saudi companies, in compliance with law no 38 for the year 1977.

ANNUAL GRAIN WASTE VALUED AT LE456 MILLION
As for the impact of waste on the prosperity of consumers, the study said, waste costs final consumers some LE359.5 million in the case of wheat, LE53.2 million in the case of corn and LE44.1 million in the case of rice. Consumers of the three types of grain have thus spent about LE456.8 million on the quantities wasted from the three types in their final shape in the final consumption stage without drawing any benefits.
The Economic Affairs Sector stressed in the study that if waste was cut down, the income of wheat producers would go up by LE83.9 million and wheat consumers expanditure would also be reduced by LE179.75 million.
M.E. Al-Alam Al-Youm, 3/6/2001
Helal Sheta, Deputy Chairman of the General Exporters' Division at the Chambers of Commerce Federation, says during the past ten years Egyptian exports plummeted sharply. The volume of Egyptian exports did not exceed $5 million last year, while that of the Russian exports to Egypt reached $343 million. This is an unequal rate between the two sides, he says, adding that this runs counter to the conditions during the Communist epoch in the Soviet Union, which was the first trade partner of Egypt. At that time, Egypt's exports to the Soviet Union were valued at more than $400 million.
Under Communism, they lacked individual property. Their income was spent on the consumer goods of the State, which determined the price and quality of goods in light of the capabilities of the low-income categories. Therefore, following openness of Russian market with its big volume of consumption, it started to attract the main Western countries, such as the European countries, Japan and the US after it had been controlled by three countries only; India, Syria and Egypt under Communism, Sheta adds. These main states started to compete with one another to eat up the biggest portion of the Russian bear's cake, he says. Their companies and goods entered the Russian market with all their weight.
Under former Communism, there was no problem, as Ukraine was a republic inside the Soviet Union; i.e. it was subject to the central government. However, after the dismantling of the Soviet Union and independence of Ukraine, a problem started to appear. Goods are stolen at Ukrainian ports that have become controlled by port robber-barons due to absence of government control, which used to represent the supreme power in these countries, he adds.
Exporters should reach an agreement with the Mafia whereby they pay a commission to it to guarantee the integrity of their commodities, he says.
Irrational acts by some exporters, to which we should admit, made Russian importers refrain from dealing with us, he says. A small number of exporters fake some products that have become unaccepted in light of the free market policy and the openness of the Russian market to the foreign ones, particularly the near ones, like Turkey and the EU countries. These acts have affected the reputation of Egyptian products, he says.
A center should be set up to include a number of companies, he says, adding that this center should be jointly financed by the exporters and the government. The government established two companies only in Russia; one for industrial products and another for agricultural ones, he says. However, these two companies could not keep up competition on the Russian market due to several reasons, foremost among which was the point that they were set up according to an agreement between the Egyptian and Soviet governments. Under this agreement, these two companies used to import Russian weapons and export Egyptian commodities, he adds.
This was stated by Major General Mansour Abed, the Managing Director of the Land Transport Companies at the Holding Company for Transport. He added that the company had a chance to increase its paid-up capital at a big rate within the vicinity of the authorized capital of the company, which amounts to LE200 million.
The company will contribute 15% only of the project, he said, adding that the private sector will carry out the remaining rate. The project will be implemented in three phases and it will be put up for the companies late this month.
Pressure exerted by the companies operating in the field of poultry and animal feeding succeeded in releasing consignments of fodder mixtures containing a slight ratio of selenium whose importation is banned.
PLANNING MINISTRY ASKS FOR LINKING TRADE PROGRAM TO INDUSTRY MODERNIZATION PROGRAM

EGYPTIAN BANKS INVITED TO CONTRIBUTE TO A PROJECT IN GERMANY
Selim added that the project was highly hailed by the German government especially in light of the rise of the number of the Arab community in general and the Egyptian one in particular on the one hand and the non existence of any commercial centers in Germany displaying the Egyptian product on the other.
SA, Al-Ahram, 3/6/2001
This is not the first slip of Peres, who told a Hebrew Radio network "we are not in need of a certificate of good conduct to become good in his eyes," alluding to President Mubarak, the PA members asserted.
The members said the next step would be a new motion to expel the Israeli Ambassador and the staff of the Israeli Embassy in Cairo from Egypt, close down the embassy headquarters, lowering the Israeli flag and burning it. They said this motion is being considered at present. The PA members said they, for the first time, support the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Aharonoth in its request for having the Israeli ambassadors recalled from Egypt and Jordan. The Israeli newspaper's request is highly welcomed, they added.
Sheikh Sobah Al-Ahmed, First Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister, described the Palestinians, who burnt the Kuwaiti flag during the funeral of Faisal Al-Husseini in Jerusalem, as being "riffraff that do not represent the Palestinian people." "This act will not change our constant attitude towards the Palestinian cause and our support for it," he said, describing the operation of Tel Aviv as "struggle," and "struggle is legitimate."
Egyptian Nubian leading figures told Asharq Al-Awsat that they had confronted several attempts by human rights organizations to classify them as one of the persecuted minorities in the world. They said that from the beginning they had been aware that such a move would serve foreign forces' interests and destabilize the country. They described this move as "a mere lie," pointing out that the number of Nubians in Egypt exceeded five millions and they all practice their political and civil rights freely without any discrimination.

7 BUSINESSMEN OBTAIN OFFICIAL APPROVALS TO EXPLOIT TWO ISLANDS
Yet, Giza Governor Mahmoud Abu al-Lail knew nothing about this matter, they added. The sources said what shows the government's bad intentions is the fact that the government granted those investors preliminary consents to control large areas as a prelude to selling them to investors in the coming period after canceling the public utility decree and allowing the two islands to be privately exploited so that the government may sell them to investors later on.
The People's Assembly (PA) Committee on Foreign Relations has turned down a proposal by an opposition PA member to wage war on Israel, saying that Egypt has international agreements with Israel and is seeking to have the Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiation table. The PA Committee only issued a statement, condemning the Israeli aggression.
Al-Fiqi proposed that the PA Committee on Foreign Relations prepare a statement to condemn the Israeli aggression on Palestine. The Committee supported Al-Fiqi's proposal and rejected the PA opposition member's motion.

KING FAHD: ZIONIST PRACTICES IN PALESTINE IS REAL WAR!

Second, since the conclusion of the accord, neither Israel nor Egypt has assaulted the Egyptian-Israeli borders. No threats of war have been made. This means that peace between Israel and us enjoys stability.
Such voices should know that Egypt would not fight for the sake of Palestine once more.
They are in a permanent state of war with Israel through the successive uprisings. These uprisings make the Israelis spend sleepless nights, and convince them that there is no hope in peace or security, unless the Palestinians obtain their legitimate rights enshrined in International Law, the UN Security Council and human rights covenants.

The items covered by the study included education, housing, marital status and age.
The age brackets of 64% of them ranged from 18-23 and 36% from 24-30.
The operation of the sailplane carried out by the popular front (general command) in 1986 should also be highlighted.
The mentioned movement has undoubtedly its own view and programs on the operations it carries out. Martyrdom is not subject to the demands of some of the movement members willing to get rid of the burdens of life.
The question of despair has become pretty excluded due to the fact that 47% of the martyrs had high certificates or were university students.
The question of the role of education in producing martyrs cannot be over-exaggerated.
The best evidence of this may be seen in the rise of martyrdom operations carried out during the post-Oslo years.
Martyrdom operations are characterized by the capability of creating threats and exhaustion in a short-winded society, according to a statement by Dav Gholdstein in Maariv newspaper on 23/5 who admitted that "prolonged wars exhaust our power and weaken our steadfastness."
Dean of the Research Center of Sadat Academy for Management Sciences, Dr Hamdi Abd Al-Azim, leveled a biting broadside against the European Program for Modernizing Egyptian Industry which is financed by the Aid Program of the Mediterranean Dialogue between the Mediterranean South and North Countries.
He also requested that the administration of the program on modernizing insustry and transferring advanced technology be assigned to the Egyptian party whose decisions and actions are subject to the Egyptian control bodies and the Higher Committee on Modernizing Industry under the Minister of Industry.

The Minister of Industry, Moustafa Al-Refai said that the modernization program includes institutions operating in foodstuffs, textile and hide sectors which the government has paid heed to in the last period as these industries have relative advantages qualifying them for occupying a highly distinguished position on the international markets.

MINISTER OF ECONOMY EXPECTED TO BE SHAKEN OFF!
AL-RANTISI: NO CEASE-FIRE WITH OCCUPATION
Even France, though known for its sympathy with the Arab stance, said: "Arafat's attitude is ambiguous and his acts are incomprehensible." However, it asserted that it is not in the interest of anybody to destabilize his power.
This resistance uses its own methods to liberate Palestine. It will not stop till Palestine is freed."
There is nothing called cease-fire.
Hamas cannot accept it. Question: The PNA agreed to the cease-fire. Why don't you abide by it out of public interests?
Occupation is the worst form of aggression. The Zionist side does not abide by halting of its aggression on the Palestinian people. Therefore, resistance should continue, and of course there is no contradiction with the PNA.
Answer: The Zionist enemy only understands the language of force. When resistance was confronted after Sharm Al-Sheikh summit and obstacles were placed in its way, what did the Zionist enemy do?
Question: Frankly speaking, aren't you exploiting the condition of the young men who carry out the (martyrdom) operations?
What you said is untrue. Sons of five Hamas leaders at least, who are not poor, fell martyrs.

"Although all forms of support for the uprising were subdued, contrary to the violent wave of enthusiasm during the first months that followed the Aqsa uprising, restaurants like Macdonald's are still suffering heavily due to insistence by many people on boycotting them," Ahmed Bahaaeddin Shaaban, member of the general committee on boycotting the Zionist and American commodities and companies, told Al-Wasat.
If "lord Mac of falafel" manages to restore part of the sales lost due to the boycott, will it succeed in pulling the rug from under the feet of the founders of beans and falafel in Egypt - Al-Tabi Al-Domyati, Akher Saa and Al-Gah-sh?

UPRISING PRICE,NEGOTIATING FROM SCRATCH!
All those who betted on the scenarios were surprised by the size and courage of the Tel Aviv operation. They were panicked due to its possible results. Each one of them quickly tried to re-devise the scenario, which he was expecting, despite the fact that the sole scenario, which was expected, was the new "hell" that Sharon would launch at the Palestinians in revenge for the Tel Aviv operation and in order to deter and suppress the uprising, and oppress the PNA of Arafat by re-occupying cities and land controlled by Arafat.
All Israeli, Arab, American and European guns are directed at the uprising "head." All accusations are leveled at the necks of Hamas, Jihad and Fatah. All efforts concentrate on the acceleration of bringing about a cease-fire, burying the uprising, and silencing stones, mortars and booby- trapped cars, so that Sharon may take his breath, something that he has not done since he came to power. These efforts are also aimed at achieving the target of this phase (cease-fire), after which the Arabs, Jews and the foreigners aspire.
Will we take part in the game and dance to the tunes of Sharon and Bush, and sacrifice the head of the courageous uprising as a price for the panting for the cease-fire?

In the same year, Israeli newspapers reported that Israeli investments in Egypt hit 30 billion pounds and that there were 9 spinning and weaving factories, where Israelis were shareholders. An Israeli garment plant was also set up in Nasr City, with its exports having amounted to 1.2 billion pounds, the Israeli press said in 1997.

The housing crisis exacerbation might be attributed to the fact that most banks refrain from lending new housing projects in contrast with previous flexibility in extending finance to real estate investments, which led to a liquidity shortage coupled with a retreat in demand for the units put up for sale.
The law, nevertheless, is much looked forward to by money market dealers as it would boost various economic sectors, whether directly as is the case with housing and contracting sectors, or indirectly with cement, building materials and metallurgical industries' sectors.
Within the framework of the law, the monthly payment is unlikely to exceed one quarter of the buyer's, rather than the family's monthly income. The law also makes it incumbent upon the government to build about 300 thousand units annually and to increase its subsidy for low- income housing that claims a total of LE1.3 billion in the new budget.
In the first year of the law enforcement, the loans required for buying housing units are expected to hit about LE9 billion in light of indicators that the effect of the law, particularly on posh housing market, would be very weak, definitely falling short of a boom or recovery. Nor would it help provide the low-income classes with housing units. This means an even more emphasis on the State role in protecting them.
Chairman of the Egyptian-British Chamber of Commerce, Mohammed Farid Khamis said that the private sector is mainly responsible for implementing the Egyptian industry modernization program and the state plays only an assistant role.

As regards low industrial investments, he pointed out that despite the fact that there is some encouraging factors such as continuous increase in demand and the availability of a suitable economic ambience and transfer of factories to new cities which helped in raising industrial investments, the level of investments to the gross domestic product is not high if compared with international standards.
Despite all that foreign aid, the Egyptian modernization program is a national program as it uses all the government resources, aid and income that comes from partial covering of the costs of the private sector that will benefit from the program, he included.

1- The narrowness of the tax base which is still restricted to industrial commodities, imports, and some services.
This underlines the neutrality and efficiency of that tax while current application of the sales tax does not allow any tax deduction for capital commodities and services. That taxes remain subject to accumulative burden, which leads to discrimination against the capital and asset intensive industries. The non-deduction of the general sales tax on capital equipment leads to the doubling of accumulative effects. The current application which does not allow deduction for capital commodities may lead to discrimination against exports in economic sectors, which may need intensive capital compared with the other sectors.

The Sudanese Constitution does not stipulate that Sudan is a Muslim State; rather it stipulates that it is a democratic one, he said.

Perhaps the example of the Coptic Egyptian politician, Makram Ebeid Pasha, who was nicknamed "The Great Mujahid," and was the secretary general of Al Wafd Party, the then majority party in Egypt, is useful in explaining the view of the Copts on the issue of Arabism.

He went beyond that to making a call for establishing the Arab League many years before the idea of creating that organization was considered.

This, in my view, is a testimony for Arab Christians within the context of their nationalism that puts them in their proper place where Arabism, to which they belong and for which they work, is concerned.
