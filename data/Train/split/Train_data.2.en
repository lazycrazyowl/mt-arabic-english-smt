It defines corruption as an immoral and prejudicial act in the use of power or position, giving preference to some over others.
On 06/06/1996 the Chamber of Deputies passed the Law Developing the Finance Market and Credit Agreements.
At the time we wrote an article strongly criticizing this arrangement under the title, Call to the Chamber of Deputies for the Moveable Value Collective Investment Organizations Law, which is published in our book "What is New in Lebanese Trade, Banking and Arbitration Laws in Light of Jurisprudence and Ijtihad" on page 63.
The Municipalities Law promulgated under Legislative Decree 118/77 represented a serious and qualitative shift. Senior legal figures, who have been involved in municipal work and helped regulate and head unions, have been involved in it.
It should have read:
This concluded a visit to Lebanon during which preparations were made for the visit to be organized for more than 100 American businessmen of Arab origin next October to Lebanon, to find out about the country and investment areas, and to establish commercial relations with Lebanese businessmen.
Farah then introduced the Lebanese Trade and Information Office, noting that it was "a non-profit making institution for public benefit with headquarters in California, and a full member of the American Chamber of Commerce and of the American International Development Consortium, which plays a fundamental role in assisting the American government to achieve its mission of promoting international development".
Farah said, "Tackling this problem via official channels takes much time. The patient solution lies in establishing mixed Lebanese-American companies in which the American partner applies for a loan for the mixed company and receives it within three weeks at appropriate interest rates.
Farah and Deputy Sakkaf also visited the town of Zahlah - Muallaqah.
1336 engineers voted out of a total of 3032 allowed to vote, i.e. 44%.
There are two pillars to the Beqaa economy, which will only make progress when they are healthy. They are agriculture and the food industry, which complement one another. What ever happens to one is inevitably reflected on the other.
President of the Food Industries Syndicate Atif Idris answered these and other questions saying, "The food and agriculture industries have bee through a very difficult period over the last seven years as a result of illegal competition from the state and development programs.
The arrival of American Secretary of State to the region and his initiating contacts with the leaders of its state as part of a serious attempt to find a settlement to the dispute between Israel and the Palestinian Authority had only limited effect on the activity of the local market, but not on its direction. The same could be said of the calls from more than one regional, international and local party to reduce tension on the southern front and not to give Israel a pretext to expand its war against Palestinians to include Lebanon and even Syria.
Fierce Battle Sees Professional Consideration Triumph Over Political Decision; Al-Bassat Breaches "Al-Hariri List"; New President of Syndicate for Engineers; Long Day.
The results show a notable difference, namely that Al-Bassat penetrated the list of Hamad Fusat Al-Akhir with the five members of his list winning. The results were as follows:
* Branch 7: Lutfi Salum (Baath Party) 2686 votes against 2126 votes for his rival Ibrahim Abu Sawan.
Bashir Abi Akr (Progressive) 2543 votes.
It was also noticed that the "Free Patriotic Current", which took about 1200 votes for Al-Bassat, lost their candidate Abi Aql in Branch 1, as a result of the votes being shared between him and other candidates.
It was a long election day, which began calmly in the morning thanks to the internal security forces, who had deployed at the entrances to the syndicate building in order to guarantee that the election process was sound.
Al-Bassat could not hide his annoyance at the focused political intervention for the benefit of his rival's list, noting that the pressures on votes had led them to be exploited for private benefit and some had been tempted by the promise of work.
"They either want me imprisoned, expelled or dead. I say to them that I will only be a martyr, a martyr, a martyr."
The media arena that "Aljazeera" has put at the disposal of the viewer thus seems to be a small window by which the Arab street can penetrate the wall of silence, as an outlet for it and as a way of expressing the degree of frustration and the siege which the peoples are living under the authority of these regimes, which can do nothing but tame their peoples and promote their defeatist policies. This was clearly evident when a female citizen of the Gulf came out from the bottle of royalty and principality to warn the rulers that the policy of Americanization will be to no avail and will not last long, and that the frustration created by the bans on demonstrations will lead to an explosion with dire consequences.
If "Under Siege" started from the circumstances in which Chairman Arafat finds himself, the title, by means of the daily contacts, has come to apply to most Arab leaders, who are now also "under siege".
Film production stopped and the workers who dared to protest at the tyranny were dismissed.
It was difficult to find innovative staff, because a number of professionals had transferred into other areas during the difficult years, or left the country to work in foreign studios, given that the Russian film school has always been appreciated.
According to Shilobriev, Vidov obtained the right to distribute the films, which represent a Russian national heritage, by making a prohibited agreement with the former director of "Soyuzmultfilm" Serge Skulyabin. There is no need to point out that "Soyuzmultfilm" got nothing in return.
The third and final series of the popular animation film championship renewed the Russian heroes with stories about: fox, wild rabbit and bear.
The Chamber of Deputies laid the foundation stones for eight educational projects yesterday in the areas of the Western Beqaa and Rashia under the patronage of Minister of Education and Higher Education, Abd Al-Rahim Murad, and the leader of the Council, Qablan Qablan. This took place in the presence of Deputies from the region, the district leader of the Western Beqaa, Mani Al-Maqdad, Rashia Dhiab Salum, head of the Education Area, Emil Maakarun, head of the Al-Laitani Water Utility, Nasir Nasrallah, and social and educational figures.
Murad praised the Council and its leader, which had endeavored to provide the schools' requirements and all the other social needs in these areas."
At every major general political event in the Arab states, specifically in connection with the Palestinian issue, there appears a major contradiction and massive gap between the stance of the Arab masses, the street leaders and the organizations of civil society, and between the official political regime represented by Arab governments, presidents and royalty. The fact of the matter can be abbreviated thus: the Arab street accuses the ruler of being weak and of failing to respond to the aspirations of the peoples, of only ruling by the power of its authority and apparatus, not by the confidence of the people. In many cases the charges go further and accuse them of betrayal, of being linked to America or the Israeli enemy, and other similar epithets with which the rulers, their families and children are branded through exploitation of their position and the consequent acts of theft and corruption. The ruler responds to this accusations by saying that the people does not possess the truth or hidden reality of these affairs or understand the passage of political relation and economic interests between states, and that these peoples are led by a flood of emotional impulses that rise and fall depending on the season and the subject, but which are no more than impulse and agitation before they wake up to reality. The ruler gives an example, saying that most demonstrations taking place in the Arab capitals bear the pictures of their leaders and rulers and raise banners praising them. We almost never find a dispute between an Arab ruler and his people, especially in demonstrations, which are often led by official figures if not the leaders themselves.
Who is responsible?
Students Biya Zinun, who is in the Formation Stage at Sayyidah Al-Luizah University where she hopes to study psychology, and  Maya Madi, who is studying translation and Arabisation at St Joseph University, won the English Language Speakers Federation - Lebanon Branch competition.

Conclusion to Book Cultural Festival Lecturer in Zaghrata; Qirdahi: No Way To Freedom of Life Without Freedom for the Other; Masarrah: Culture of Citizenship Must Be Lebanised and Arabised.
He then noted that there was no contradiction between citizenship and membership of a sectarian group provided that the area of common ground was expanded because common action was important.
He concluded by answering the sixth question - what is needed for the future?
The principles of democracy and international human rights, these must be commended. But educating for citizenship drowns in the particular details."
He noted, "The freedom of every person ends where the freedom of the next person begins. If the other's freedom is not respected, there can be no opportunity for a life of freedom. We must also not cast the responsibilities on to others because we are all responsible."
The meeting was attended by the Chairman of the Ecclesiastical Education and Cultural Committee, Archbishop Ghi Bulus Najim, former Director of the Association, Fr. Malik Abu Tanus, Director General of University Pastoral Work at the Holy Spirit University in Al-Kaslik, Fr. Shirbil Kiruz, a group of priests, Dr Antoine Musarrah, Deputy Director of the Association, Marcel Ishaq, and the members.
He noted that many people used the term state in order to throw responsibility on its shoulders.
He continued, "If in reason I am a believer, I cannot abuse the other from another religion because my faith prevents from this, not because I believe in common living."
He continued, "We should not fear the truth. The truth is man.
He believed, "Practical love is that which encourages people to faith. Christianity is full-time citizenship. Christians today, more so than at any other time, are called to live in open Arab citizenship."
He stressed, "Her role has not come to an end with retirement because people like her do not like to live with nothing to do. It is certain that she has more than one option after she leaves this secondary school to continue her mission and open up a new field of production and achievement."
The statue overlooks the citadel temple and structures. At present the area from the lower part of his knees to the soles of his feet appears a different color after the paint has been worn away and hollow cavities corroded. These are the same parts that were restored after the statue was blown up during the war. It was re-erected on the 27th of August 1995 in a major ceremony that became a forum for the meeting of more than one Arab country by the efforts of the "Oasis of Literature in the Beqaa", which was headed at that time by poet Judat Rustum Haidar.
In the face of this crumbling situation there exists a project study prepared by the Municipality of Baalbak to re-establish the garden and an implementation decision to be determined by the contractor, but no one knows the reason for the delay.
It is not strange that there should be much talk about the step taken by American Ambassador Vincent Patel on the 25th of last March in respect of the Educational Research and Development Center, gifting it English language learning books.
In Lebanon it has been given a new dimension and is distinguished by the relationship between the American Embassy in Beirut and the regional English Language expert John Tork, who lives in Amman."
Teachers' Syndicate Recalls Compulsory Membership of Aid Fund; First Recitation Competition in Sidon.
3- In connection with the draft retirement law and amendment to Article 21, the Council reviewed the meeting held between a delegation from the Council led by Saadah and attended by Deputy Head of Syndicate Jamal Al-Hasami, Secretary General Walid Jaradi, his deputy Tahsin Surur and Council member Yusif Al-Khuri, and Minister of Work Ali Qansu, who expressed full understanding of the Syndicate's ideas and promised to follow up the matter with utmost speed.
"Siege" by Mahmoud Darwish, "Intifada" by Samih Al-Qasim, "They were angry" by Nazar Qabbani and other innovative examples by the poets on the subject of the Palestinian issue and the Intifada were tantamount to a salute given by 16 male and female pupils from the Sixth Year Basic of the government and private schools in Sidon and Al-Jawar to their colleagues as they wore the Palestinian headscarf. It was attended by President of the National Authority for the Lebanese Child - Southern Branch Maha Shafiq Al-Hariri, the Secretary-General of the Authority Nazar Al-Rawwas, and members Muhammad Makki, Faiz Daghir and Asma Dirani, Hikmat Abu Dhar and Nabil Bawwab from the Sur Committee, alongside the heads of the participating schools.

He said, "I feel anxiety at the slow progress of the talks, as do the Member States of the Security Council (...) there is a need for decisive progress in the next stage."
Yesterday morning the two leaders held a meeting to examine the possibility of a rapprochement in their stances shortly before the arrival of the Secretary-General.
Denktash is insistent on full sovereignty for each group within a framework of two independent entities, giving a central authority limited powers. The Greek side, by contrast, stresses implementation of the 1977 and 1979 agreements under UN supervision, which provide for the establishment of a federation comprising two groups and two areas.
The possibility of one side joining has seemed more likely recently given the impasse in which the talks between two sides find themselves.
Jewish Lobby in America in Strongest Position; Gains Republican Allies and Widespread Support for Israel.
Congress is moving towards increasing aid to Israel after associations were able to mobilize about one hundred thousand people, some of whom had come great distances, for example from California, to participate in a mass demonstration in support of the Jewish state, which was organized on the 15th of April in front of the headquarters of Congress in Washington.
American Jews represent one of the most powerful and most influential interest groups in the country. Their numbers are estimated at between four and six million in the United States, the population of which is reckoned at about 280 million people.
The Senate approved a similar decision with a majority of 94 votes against just two.
An opinion survey conducted by the "Gallop" institute has shown a slight increase in the number who believe that the United States should support Israel, although the total number of such people is no more than 25%.
Secondly, there are the conservative religious republicans, who from a substantial political force. They have joined some democrats and AIPAC in stressing that the Bush should not put pressure on Sharon.
President of the American Arab Institute James Zughbi notes encouraging trends for the pressure groups that it represents. He notes that 82 members of Congress voted against the decision supporting Israel, which is a record, and that 35 members of the chamber criticized the lack of balance in the decision.
In an interview with the Saudi Okaz newspaper he dealt with his first meeting with Bush last month saying, "I saw a completely different man to the one I had imagined prior to my meeting him, in fact he was not what I was expecting at all. He has human feelings, he listens, discusses and talks cogently, but he was not wholly aware of the reality of conditions in the region, especially the conditions of the Palestinian people."
Asked about Bush's response he replied, "I saw in his eyes surprise and astonishment as well as deep sadness after he was shown these terrible and upsetting pictures."
Prince Abdallah was asked about bilateral relations between the two countries. He answered that he had not wished to discuss this matter but that Bush had himself raised it. "He told me that the Saudi people harbored feelings of hatred against me (...) I told him that this was the case with all peoples of the world."

At the same time, Afghan government forces are preparing to engage in a major battle against the forces of rebel tribal leader Padsha Khan near the main town Ghirdez in the east of the country.
Hours before the meeting of the American Deputy Secretary of State for South Asia, Christina Roca, and Indian officials including Minister Foreign Affairs Jaswant Singh, whilst she was in New Delhi on Tuesday as part of efforts to avoid another war between the nuclear enemies of India and Pakistan, armed men, believed to be Islamic extremists, mounted an attack on a military barracks in the Indian-controlled region of Kashmir. 30 civilians and soldiers were killed in an exchange of fire, including the three attackers
The army detained three Palestinians in the attack, which continued for several hours.
He added, "We have many appropriate and safe dedicated reception centers."
He said, "We must turn directly to the final solution" because that is the only way to push the Israelis and Palestinians to commit to the political process and end the crisis.
He believed, "The ending of the violence requires a solution to the dispute not for it to be managed. This, in turn, requires that we focus on final solutions and peace principles". For this reason, "What is required is a detailed timetable and plan of action to restore hope and turn it into reality."
The Algerian news agency (WAJ) has quoted the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs as saying that the summit of the Arab North African Federation, which includes Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Mauritania, will be held on the 21st and 22nd of June in the Algerian capital.

Elsewhere, a judicial source in Cairo said yesterday that 21 people will, with effect from 29 May, appear before the State Security Court on charges of "exploiting the Islamic religion and promoting extremist ideas with the aim of creating discord and disparaging the Islamic religion by promoting beliefs contrary to the established principles of the religion."
Cairo - WSF - Huda Abd Al-Nasser, the eldest daughter of the late Egyptian leader Gamal Abd Al-Nasser, has announced that the British Foreign Office has released documents relating to the 23 July revolution.

Israeli officials have inspected the area of the line dividing Israel from the West Bank, where a dividing barrier is supposed to be built with the aim of preventing penetration by perpetrators of suicide attacks.
Meanwhile, Israeli radio has broadcast that the Supreme Court of Justice in Israel rejected a request by the Secretary of the Fateh Movement in the West Bank, Marwan Al-Barghuti, who has been detained by Israel since mid-April, to meet with his lawyer.
He said that his attackers "wanted to attack a number of symbols in the Palestinian leadership to create a state of confusion and chaos".
About 50 Egyptian women assembled near the Israeli embassy in Cairo, seeking the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador.
He said, "If this comes into effect, this will paralyze the activities of our organization and will have a major impact on all agencies working in the Occupied Territories."
In the town of Sari, at the beginning of a three-day tour in the mountainous north, where citizens lined the roads that extend for 15 km from the airport to the town to greet him, he said, "As long as they make threats and direct curses and insults at us, neither I nor the nation are prepared to accept any relations (...) If they abandon their threats and the language of insults, and if we feel that they have good intent, then in this case it will be possible to enter into dialogue with them (...) American politicians must first learn how to talk politely."
He added, "My policy is one of unity.
However, Reuters asked Khatimi whether prominent conservative relatives had held unofficial talks with American officials. He responded, "No, I do not believe something like this has happened (...) our relations with the United States are always characterized by bitterness (...) America is responsible for that."
But it appears that the legal authorities, which are dominated by conservatives, withdrew this permission.
The United States' Ambassador to Thailand, Darryl Johnson, said at the ceremony of the start of the maneuvers at the Utaphao Sea and Air Base that these maneuvers include counter-terrorist training for the first time.
Amongst those involved are 14 thousand American, 7700 Thai and 70 Singaporean soldiers. This is in addition to 105 aircraft (73 American and 32 Thai), six American battleships and 11 Thai naval vessels.
Mahathir was an eloquent critic of the West a few years ago.
In Washington Indonesian Minister of Defense Matori Abdul Djalil confirmed that Indonesia would not allow the deployment of American forces on its territory to help combat terror. But it was keen to repair military relations, which were cut in 1999.
Rumsfield said that human rights violations had led to these restrictions and "we now believe that it is time to reform them fundamentally".
In a defense submitted by her to the Jordanian State Security Court yesterday, former member of the Jordanian Chamber of Deputies Toujan Faisal criticized Jordanian Prime Minister Ali Abu Al-Ragheb and accused him of "distorting Jordan's image at home and abroad" and confirmed that he had offered her "a bribe in return for her stopping the criticism directed against him" in the sitting preceding the ruling in this case, which will be announced tomorrow.
Faisal has been on trial since the 16th of last April for criticisms she directed at the government via the Qatari Aljazeera satellite channel and e-mail. She called on King Abdallah II bin Al-Hussein last March to dismiss the government and accused it of corruption.
In testimony given before the court at the beginning of this month, Former Jordanian Prime Minister Abd Al-Karim Al-Kabariti believed, "What Toujan has brought before the court amounts to constructive criticism - it should not be counted as an insult to, attack on or distortion of Jordan's reputation."
She explained that she had resorted to making statements to the satellite channels and over the Internet because she was banned from writing in the Jordan press.
Following the difference of opinion between him and the American administration in respect of the American accusations that Cuba is trying to acquire biological weapons, which Washington reiterated yesterday, former American President Jimmy Carter found himself contradicting Cuban leader Fidel Castro in terms of the concept of democracy and human rights.
He noted that the "Carter Center", which is based in Atlanta, "helps (countries) to conduct fair and just elections" and that "Americans are proud of their freedom, which allows them to criticize the government and to change it when they believe it necessary by voting against it."
He added, "Cuba is striving to achieve this dream with justice, true freedom, true democracy and true human rights."
He hinted that the American administration had tried to complicate his visit by means of the accusations made in this respect, saying, "These accusations were made, and perhaps it is no coincidence that they were made immediately before my visit to Cuba."
Without directly criticizing Carter, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer stated yesterday that the issue of biological weapons had not been discussed at all during the dialogue between the former President and the American President's National Security Advisor, Condoleezza Rice.
49% of Americans expressed a desire to lift the restriction imposed on traveling to Cuba, compared with 45% who opposed it.
Nor is it a mistake when, in response, we reject the logic that sees in the results of the Intifada a catastrophe by all standards.
There is no economic facility that can stand on its own two feet.
The army has seen no major divisions.
But the purely security treatments have proven to be fruitless.
But Islamic-Christian unity in Palestine has been consolidated.
Secondly, we need a new Palestinian Charter, one which defines the phased program for the struggle: Israeli withdrawal to the borders of 4 June 1967, the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with its capital in East Jerusalem, establishment of the right to return and the dismantling of settlements.
If the call to "reform" the Authority comes from the American administration, and for its own aims, this does not mean that no reforms should be carried out, in fear of being seen to submit to "American pressures".
But Palestine has entered the world's heart.
...Even the Opposition!
Thus the religious authorities driving in this direction, albeit with good intent, expose the oppositionist camp with their provision to some of its wings, to a dangerous error, one that cannot be tolerated.
What applies to oppositionists who lie under the roof of the "Qarnat Shahwan Forum" applies equally to more fundamental oppositionists, such as Brigadier Michel Aun.
For principles are not to be played with except in light of major changes that permit a review.
In no case can the opposition agree on major principles and then drop them for a by-election battle, for if they do the meaning and purpose of this battle will be lost as a result of selfish and self-centered passions.
Men of Religion and the Government.
But what Al-Mirza Al-Shirazi did was the first public clash.
In fact the legitimacy of the political authority was, to a great extent, linked to the support of men of religion and their backing of it.
However the revolution in February 1979 embodied the rise of those calling for the establishment of Islamic government. A republican regime was established based on the clerics and supervised by a religious authority known as the Al-Wali Al-Faqih, which increased radiance of this group and thereby raised their social standing and the respect offered them by the majority.
For he could not remain as he was and nor were the people prepared to forgive him when he slipped up.
A Horizon Narrows and a Circle Widens.
In turn, Abu Mazin, the number two in the Liberation Organization and in power, called for immediate and urgent reforms to the political and administrative structures.
In politics there are many possibilities and the facts are complex.
Any time, no matter how hard or cruel, is fit to put an end to internal corruption because it is the most destructive and dangerous enemy.
His previous trials and tribulations were with Israel, America, the Arabs and Arab interactions. Now, however, he is confronting his leadership.
The historical leader found that two years of maltreatment, genocide and Sharon had attracted the people to Hamas and the notion of salvation by means of more death and more destruction.
Given that Arafat is the one central figure in the issue, it is natural that the movement of general Palestinian feeling should be reflected in his breast.
"Hamas" and "Jihad" had more than 10% in the past and Arafat retains more than 20% now, because such a figure would mean a coup.
The situation is also that no one can say the words of condolence over the rubble of Jenin, even if it is the "old man", who appeared for the first time on the tour of Palestine truly to have a head of grey hair.
Legal sources reported that the chamber will not take any decision on this matter before a month, under a controversial law promulgated in 1993 which allows Belgian courts to examine cases against foreigners accused of violating human rights wherever they occurred.
Over the last ten months the lawyers have tried to persuade the Belgian court that the criminal investigation against Sharon must proceed to his role in the massacre.
He added, "Belgium did not have competence.
The debate today will center on the extent to which the decision of the Court of Justice in the case of the Congolese minister applies in the case of the Israeli Prime Minister.
(Reuters, WSF)
Patriarch Abd Al-Ahad gave a speech in which he said, "Your presence here, if it is evidence of something, then it is evidence of a popular and official Arab stance with the Palestinian issue. The Arabs have never been united and spoken with one voice as they have been united by the Palestinian issue. The Palestinian issue has several aspects: political, social, civilization, humanitarian and religious.
I did all of this feeling that I was fulfilling a patriotic and religious duty."
The appointment of a committee to examine legal matters comprising people of knowledge and inhabitants of the House of Justice, which forms the basis of government, has been announced.
I do not excuse the ignorance of the ignorant, but I stress the crime of the criminal perpetrators and instigators, who drag the people to criminality and war "who make them carry heavy loads, which they do not touch with their fingertips".
The people are peaceable.
Despite the explicitness of the provisions that created just one judiciary, one that does not need the present number.
The expression "take measures" is explicit in meaning. It does not in any sense mean that provisions should be passed "in the name of the Lebanese people" as happens today.
..."The judge in whose competency the basis of dispute lies...".
Article 580 is explicit. It requires that an urgent measure be taken in commercial cases by an individual judge competent in commercial cases.
Article 589 confirms verbatim as follows:
Both articles confirm that the competent judge in the two cases is one in whose competence the basis of the dispute lies.
And the urgent judiciary, which violates the principles, is absorbing a large number of judges.
5- Compliance with the text of Article 580, which establishes one judiciary, corrects the error, secures justice, and make the present number of judges excess, not a shortfall, may God lengthen your lives.
The Palestinian Liberation Organization called for a general strike today and for participation in a central political festival at Al-Rashidiyyah Camp.
Marches set out in the Ain Al-Hilwah Camp in Sidon and there were calls for a strike.
During their regular meeting, which was held at the Hizbollah Offices in Baalbak, the Lebanese parties discussed various political developments and "contemplated the 54th anniversary of the rape of Palestine". They confirmed, "The option of resistance and Intifada that many of the Palestinian forces have adopted practically is the only option capable of recovering Palestine and liberating the land and the people."
Foreign Ministry Discusses Challenges to Peace Facing Work of Arab Initiative Committee.
He believed, "There is a need for caution and suspicion, indeed rejection of the invitation promoted by the international sponsor, the United States of America, especially, and the Russian Federation, the United Nations and European Union to hold a special international conference in the Middle East, because holding such a conference will lead inevitably to revocation of the authority of the Madrid Conference, which is based on the formula of land for peace and implementation of Security Council resolutions 242, 338 and 425."
However this does not bind Israel after the decision taken unanimously by the Likud block to reject the establishment of a Palestinian state."
- The draft law laid down in Decree number 6364 to join the Treaty of Cooperation on Patents held in Washington on 19 June 1970 amended in 1979 and 1984, and the executive regulations thereto as amended on 01/10/1997.
- The draft law laid down in Decree 7547 ratifying a cooperation agreement in the field of land transportation for people and goods on roads between the government of the Lebanese Republic and the government of the Kingdom of Morocco.
No Invoices for 48.5% of Energy; Works Announces Improvements in Electricity.
He said that in relation to production "the differences with the companies on the operation of steam complexes at the Dir Ammar and Al-Zahrani plants have been dealt with" but "there still remain some obstacles facing implementation of the works for completion of the networks."
He said, "Sealing of meters has started to prevent interference. 80 thousand meters have been sealed in Beirut and the suburbs of Al-Shiyah and Antilias, and 5000 in Juniah.
He stated that the Financial Prosecutor General has confirmed that immediate prosecution has begun for reports referred to him and that a representative of the internal security forces has shown the response of the security forces in following up collection work.
- I do not know when privatization will take place.
This is a technical loss that cannot be avoided.
There is interference and some of this interference is technical.
The Director General for Lebanon Electricity, Kamal Al-Hayik, had promised during the session that rationing would end in Al-Minyah and its environs and in Tripoli at the end of this month after completion of inspections of the main Al-Minyah 20 kilovolt transformer and the Tripoli 66 kilovolt transformer.
Elsewhere, candidate Ghassan Mukhaibar insists on continuing with his candidacy and not accepting any other consensus candidate, stressing that he is the consensus candidate.
Mukhaibar conducted a series of other consultations with some prominent people in the area and met in the afternoon with the leader of the Free Patriots Party, Duri Shimun.
He added, "Despite the Ministry of the Interior being neutral there are some agencies in the government interfering."
He asked, "For whom should I withdraw?
"Christian Unions": Disappearance of Airani Serious Setback for Credibility of State.
1 - "The Federation dealt with the dispute that broke out among those in power against the background of the privatization issue starting with the matter of the cell phone. Despite the way out that was found, it believes that it is a dangerous indicator, one that does not give much cause for optimism, if the institutional rules on which the state should be based are not respected.
3- Recently, there have been worrying developments on the security front, which have attracted the attention of the Lebanese. They include the issue of the disappearance of Engineer Ramzi Airani, which recalls the kidnappings that dominated a black stage in the history of their country and one that cost them much.
Kidnapping is prohibited, as are unjustified detentions and arrests, The opening of cases such as that of Kafr Ubaida gives the impression that the war file is still with us, at least for some Lebanese, and this we forcefully reject.
This is one circumstance of the stage following Arafat's liberation from his siege, which leaves him facing two dangers: the permanent Israeli danger and the immediate "Palestinian danger" arising from the complications of the past cruel weeks.
Through his excessive flirtation with the Jewish election balance, Bush hopes to gain control with a clear majority over the Councils of Deputies and Senators, thereby completing the mission of his victory of the executive (the White House) and the legislative (the Congress).
But "Israeli-style democracy" puts the fate of the establishment of the Palestinian state in the electoral auction, and would refuse to do otherwise. Sharon and Netanyahu compete in terms of who holds the greatest contempt for the Palestinians and the Arabs. It is not a competition for equality or how to achieve it - it is an escalation that is pivotal and provides the criteria.
Perhaps there may be more resolutions in the future.
It is not sufficient for Israel to say that it will not seek to try them. There is something more dangerous than that, namely to leave them as prey to Israeli eyes spread throughout the world.
No matter how the two slogans differ in terms of technique and policy, the aim is one.
Situation in South Worries Anan Because It Is Fragile and Could Flare Up.
They added that despite the substantial reduction in tension compared with levels prior to the visit of US Secretary-General Colin Powell to the region, anxiety continues to dominate de Mistura and the staff of the international force command, on account of the daily provocation engaged in by Israel from time to time, with its violation of Lebanese airspace and sovereignty.
Lebanon also protested about the continuing and provocative Israeli violation of airspace to the same command.
However, one of the international officers responded sarcastically, asking whether Hizbollah elements were deployed in Beirut, Al-Shuf, the north and Al-Matan.

This point was a matter of discussion in the last session of the Council of Ministers derived from known facts raised and they were followed by a detailed reply from the President of the Republic Emil Lahud.
In the Civil Service Council there is a vacant Maronite position and a proxy member (Orthodox) to the President naturally.
Sources in the Civil Service speak of thousands of transactions held up as a result of the current situation.
Ministry circles speak about "a blow" sustained because of this situation; however, they point on the contrary side to the fact that a search is underway for administrative - financial solutions to legitimize the position in the event that the anticipated appointments to the Civil Service are delayed.
Based on prepared tables, it is clear that a hundred of those who have so far been transferred to the surplus list have not been distributed among the ministries.
It is reported that the Civil Service Council has expressed no negativity towards the move.
Today, we bring to the attention of Beirut's excellent Municipal Council that a large hole has appeared on the pavement parallel to the Ministries of Tourism and Media, to hold a parasol for the traffic police. The parasol was put up more than 25 days ago but the debris from the hole still covers the pavement parallel to the glass structure where exhibitions and celebrations are held.
An area of low pressure dominated the area. It was accompanied by cold air blocs that changed into storms and rain in the different areas surrounding the Mediterranean.
The speed of surface winds in Lebanon will today reach 50km. The expected temperature on the coast is 16-22 degrees and in the mountains from 9-14 degrees, as in the Beqaa.
As a result of the works to prepare the road, which is 35 km long, to the Sir-Al-Safirah road, which extends for tens of kilometers.
The lady supervising the landscaping and planting, Eng. Ghanwah Al-Aris Zantut, representative from the "Jinico" company, noted that about 100 palm trees were being planted along the two pavements of the boulevard, in addition to 55 mullein, cypress and pine trees in Al-Wastiyyah.
Azar was quoted as being prepared to follow up the matter with those concerned in the government, calling on the heads of municipalities to move towards the executive authority, which will take the decision to dispense the municipality dues.
Syndicate Head Baalbaki thanked the Al-Damur Municipal Council in the persons of Mr. Ghafri and Mr. Aql for this initiative, hoping that the project would be completed at the earliest opportunity.
As a result of the works to prepare the road, which is 35 km long, to the Sir-Al-Safirah road, which extends for tens of kilometers.
If the work continues like this.
Instead of preparations, a large part of the road, and at various points, have been turned into some sort of planted fields on which citizens break their cars every day."
- The contractor should be forced to abide by the schedule signed on 30/03/2002, which requires that the works of the first section (up to Irdah) be completed on 30/04/2002, up to Kafrhabbu by 30/05/2002 and up to Bakhuan by 30/06/20002. Of course this is unlikely for one reason, namely that the contractor has not made available the equipment and machinery necessary to carry out his commitments.
- Remove the direct and indirect corrupt controllers and their political cover over the project, because the company, when faced with every crisis, fears resorting to the security forces and prefers material approaches, which imposes on the project major additional burdens that affect the quality and period of implementation.
The slogan of some officials is "Starve your dog and he'll follow you". This is a clear fact, for no project is implemented unless the people of the regions crawl to the important officials first.
Merchants and vegetable shop owners in the area of Ain Al-Ramanah have complained of roaming vendors, who stand at the doors of their shops and take their livelihood. They asked, who is responsible, especially given that they are not allowed to wander through the streets?

Beirut 29 April 2002.
The President of the Republic won in media terms (but not politically or "economically").
The recent second installment of Dr Huda Rizq's study of the relationship between the state and the Lebanese university (Social Sciences Institute Model):
During the war the militias exercised their authority over the branches on issues of appointment and acceptance. The branches in the regions also reflected the balance of political powers prevalent there.
The process of branches has increased costs; for example the leasing of university buildings, in addition to the loss of service offered to students and the absence of university grants, poor capacities and the failure to equip libraries, etc...
It announced that the workers and employees are standing beside the new management, in order to make the rescue and development plan a success, which will have a positive effect on the continuation of the Organization and will guarantee work for those employed in it.
Having examined the reasons for the two aforementioned decisions.
Whereas the specified decision of the Council of Ministers number 4 introduces a burden on the utility that was not originally present in return for very small contributions from those no longer in service.
Whereas the result of the meeting of his Excellency the Prime Minister and His Excellency the Minister of Energy and Water dated 12/05/2002 has led to approval for the opening of the required credit in full and the provision of medical care and treatment to the employees of the utility in service and those no longer in service, until such time as the subject is reviewed by the Council of Ministers, on the basis of its decision number 25, dated 27/09/2001, and the Voluntary Social Security Law for Elderly Lebanese in the National Social Security Fund shall enter into effect.
Minister of Public Works and Transport Najib Miqati and his Syrian counterpart Makram Ubaid signed two agreements for cooperation between the ports of Beirut and Al-Ladhiqiyyah and the ports of Tripoli and Tartus. They discussed technical, economic and commercial cooperation and coordination in the exchange of information, studying ways to make these ports capable of competing with those of neighboring countries.
Miqati said, "Our visit to Tartus and Al-Ladhiqiyyah is part of a series of meetings to develop transport arteries.
Jordanian Minister of Transport Nadir Al-Dhahabi attended part of the signing.
The Jordanian Minister said, "Our permanent aim is to achieve integration between our countries and not competition."
At the end of the visit, Miqati, Ubaid, Al-Dhahabi and Khuri visited Al-Qardahah where they laid wreathes of flowers on the tomb of late President Hafiz Al-Asad. They read the fatihah over his tomb and that of Maj. Basil Al-Asad.
He explained that the campaign, which began yesterday, would continue until the end of next September and includes the distribution of about 290 thousand Visa cards through the banks, 50 thousand of them to be distributed in Lebanon with the remainder to be distributed elsewhere in the region, thus targeting tourists who have high spending power that allows them to travel and spend in the tourist destination country.
He noted that Visa International expects, by launching this campaign, to increase the spending of Visa card-carrying visitors to Lebanon by 25% during this year.
He drew on Visa International statistics, noting that travelers around the world prefer to use Visa cards to pay instead of cash "and this trend has reached many countries of the Middle East as well".
Banking Business Horizons Conference in Syria: Banking Reform Part of Administrative Reform, Legislation Must Include Protection for Deposits.
The discussions, which focused on a number of subjects put forward in banking work, were tantamount to recommendations, especially given that they dealt with delicate issues directly. They believed that banking reform in Syria was part of a large and more comprehensive process, which included reform of the administration and other production sectors.
- Interest rates in Syria and the possible options in this respect: Should the Central Bank set them in an inflexible way?
- The obstacles confronting the development of the banking sector in Syria and the legislation and regulations required by it, especially given that the reform process cannot be limited to one sector because banking reforms form part of a larger and more comprehensive process, which includes the reform of the administration and the rest of the economic sectors.
- The submission of monetary authorities in Arab states to the authorities of the Ministries of Finance or Economy, which results in a lack of independence on the part of the Central Banks and weakens their role in pursuing and determining a monetary policy, the role which the Central Banks are supposed to play to increase the effectiveness of the banking sector to finance the requirements of the economy, secure competition between the banks and offer advice to the government on the liberalization of the economy and financial and monetary procedures.
- The experiments of Islamic and investment banks and the relationship between them and commercial companies and banks.
The author has been invited to literary seminars in Geneva, Laussanne, Berne and Zurich for the occasion.
This movement is an original Lebanese phenomenon, which had lessened over the past decades, but returned to its peak during the war.
The translator believes that a rapid review of the development of Arabic literature in general since the Second World War will help us "categorize" the works of Hasan Daud, which have a special pathological concern.
The translation explains that these examples of change dominated the Arab world generally, but Egypt and Lebanon in particular.
From time to time successive activities surface in the city, and invitations to exhibitions, lectures and films increase.
As soon as I enter I feel that I have once again met Shahfah, whose workshop I visited in Montreal.
Robert Munsif wrote in Montreal about Joseph Shahfah, "A fabric that hints, an elegant body at the beginning and end of places, at the end and beginning of the seasons.
A look above to seek spiritual inspiration according to what is expected in this instance, but what surrounds us and is before our eyes denies such existence and underlines the material nature of things and their complete separation from the spiritual plane.
Joint exhibitions do not usually create the impression of being new or serious.
They are not all of the same standard. Our attention was grabbed by the miniature pictures, stuck on wood, with projecting faces beneath thick and thin lines, scattered by red spots giving them their warm life, especially as an elegant script had delineated some of the areas forming the depth of the white space, waiting futilely for an audience that had not come.
Rita Aun does not stop simplifying this flourishing, naked body, returning to some childhood, standing on two legs extending to almost swallow up the body.
We do not know why Hussein Madi became involved in an exhibition that appears to be for young artists or why Ghufdir exhibited what was previously shown at the "Alice Maghabghab Gallery"! Nor was there anything new from Jan Mark Nahhas.
At no time and for no race has empire been absent from the religious text. Prophets and the metaphysical example they represent have criticized the example of power represented in the most powerful state.
Whether Rome, the Pharaohs or the Persians - they are met by an idealized religious awareness that substitutes material power for spiritual strength, the worship of the individual with that of God, the East with the West!
This was all due to the tyranny that characterized the power of the state, although the cover was the propagation of religion or something similar.
The terrible structural error committed by the Arabs was that they viewed the Ottoman occupation of their countries as a conquest. For just as they occupied Spain under the cover of the propagation of religion, they also believed that the Ottoman occupation constituted protection for their religion. This occupation continued for over four centuries.
The meaning is the same, whether one is propagating a religion or a pack of cigarettes. But the key problem is the message.
The second relationship with the West, the broad relationship, is the individual trend represented by people who were original religiously educated (Al-Afghani, Muhammad Abduh, and the many others as is well known) and others with the entry of the nineteenth century.
Great slogans and great literature from the whole West, all of Rome.
How can some come and think that not buying a packet of cigarettes, a pair of jeans or some type of food is a good way of dealing with Rome/America?
Everyone dreams of power, of empire.
Only the prophets can deal well with Rome...
At this meeting we can only welcome with pleasure the members of the Beiteddine Festivals Committee, at the forefront of whom stands Mrs. Nura Junbalat, head of the festival.
Nura Junbalat then spoke about the program of the Beiteddine festival and the nine performances.
A combination of piano, lute, drums and singing, making a warm atmosphere and reflecting a new dimension to his art.
On this night Zakir and Laswell will also join Ustad Sultan Khan and Karsh Kale, in addition to guests specializing in electronic music, alongside Iranian singer Susan Dehim.
On the first of August: Africa will enter the festival via " Youssou N'Dour ", the artist who has innovated a new African style.
Whilst we believe in the candor of the positions adopted by Honorable Deputy Najah Wakim on Arab issues, nevertheless negative actions will not serve us, nor will they dissuade the Americans from supporting Israel. So let us look to more beneficial actions towards them, especially in the wake of 11 September and their views on the Arabs and Muslims.
Our long struggle with Israel has moved from bad to worse, bringing us to the situation that we now face. Our civilized dialogue will not be from a position of weakness, but one of strength. By means of it we can prove that we are not, as the Zionist propaganda portrays us to American and its people, along with some European countries, backward peoples. This is the opinion of many intellectuals and educated people whose opinions we follow in the media, namely that civilized dialogue is the best way to achieve one's goal, if not immediately then in the near future.
The prevailing belief on the part of the ordinary American, which has distorted his mind, is the propaganda that Israel is the most civilized and democratic state in the Middle East, and they empathize with it on this basis.
Even that Syrian lady who threw the American consul out of her restaurant, had she taken the opportunity and invited him, gathered the visitors of her restaurant about him to express their vexation at the policy of his government, then her position would have been stronger and more powerful.
We must not leave any means, but use it with all the capacities that we possess.
Marguerite Yourcenar: Last Journey Major Event in Francophone Year.
The meeting was opened by Alan Fukih, cultural advisor to the French Embassy, who said, "The photographs are of prime importance in the Francophone Year of 2002.
Fareer was then given the opportunity to speak. He started his speech with a glance at Beirut where he had just arrived, but he still felt hospitality, a welcome and warmth immediately.
"In 1968 I left Rio de Janeiro and traveled to Paris.
And with every artist or sculptor or author it was as if through my pictures I were drawing a book of life."
During my first meeting with her she asked me: "Mr. Farrer, where are you from?"
We did not speak about literature, even though I was in front of a major writer with her unique status.
In 1988 I had to meet her at the beginning of the year in a hotel in New Delhi, her station before she went to Nepal, but she died on the 17th of December."
She refused not to pay me the small sum.
"It includes 32 pictures and was welcomed for the first time by the Pompidou Center in Paris where it was visited by five hundred thousand people.
Book Exhibition in Al-Batrun; Al-Sharaa Intellectual Forum; "Jubail in History" Exhibition.
He insisted that a country that does not concern itself with culture and does not encourage the educated is no longer to be reckoned a nation accepted among the nations.

It also issued an invitation to meet the Amnesty International Organization and the United Nations on their activities and objectives, including a display of a number of photocopied documents and a video film, at one pm on Thursday, the 16th of June, at the university.
The exiles responded with one voice, "No matter how beautiful the country to which we are being exiled, nothing will compensate us for the homeland."
Perhaps history is repeating itself and confirming the link between the catastrophe of the Lebanese and Palestinian peoples.
It is the "Hotel of Lebanon" and the Lebanese.
A large number of Lebanese used to resort to it to take refuge from the fatigue of travel before leaving for the countries of the world. It was also a waiting stop for those returning by steamship to the homeland.
If the "Flamingo" Hotel was a place of temporary residence, the "Terrace" restaurant  opposite "Scotch Corner" was the venue for discussions, meetings, contacts, thought and planning for the future. The great question was:
What is this distinguishing mark?
"Good trip to Lebanon" was the last phrase I heard from one of the Flamingo's staff in the summer of 1994, saying goodbye and waving his hand.
Wales beat Germany 1-0 (first half 0-0) with Robert Earnshaw scoring in the 46th minute in an international football friendly game between the two sides conducted yesterday at the "Millennium" stadium in Cardiff as part of the preparations of the German national side for the 17th World Cup finals. 35 thousand spectators attended.

He consulted a specialist in Belgium on Monday and the X-ray confirmed that he needs an operation, which will be conducted at a later time this week.
Wenger, aged 52, who took over at Arsenal in 1998, and led it in his first season to a similar achievement, was selected by "Barclaycard", the company sponsoring the English league and the Association of League Team Coaches.
Since George Bush declared on the 4th of last April his vision for the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel as the only point of entry for settlement in the Middle East, many await an objective translation to implement this vision in the form of a solution, when Ariel Sharon is bent not only on destroying Palestinian towns but on destroying that vision specifically.
Thus, as Powell announced a few days ago that it was certain that there would be an "international conference" to study the establishment of a temporary (!) Palestinian state as a step towards the establishment of a Palestinian state, Ari Fleischer, spokesman for the White House, hurried to clarify that this was not an American proposal but one of many ideas being discussed between Bush and the leaders of the region whom he had visited.
There is nothing to clarify this. There is nothing in the history of establishing states, nor in the history of international law, that can offer an answer to this nonsense.
Despite the fact that the translation available to date of Bush's vision for the Palestinian state, recalls the story "What wonders I saw in Aleppo", the refusal comes not from the Palestinians, which would be understandable, but from Sharon as well, who does not want them to see the state even in their dreams... or in the American nightmares!
There is no need to advise a careful person.
Such a situation means that any communications with Israel regarding the settlement are paralyzed for at least six months, during which time it will be pre-occupied with the Likud and Labor party elections and then the general elections.
However, with the restrictions imposed by the two dates, the one fixed and the other probable, and with the contradictions we have seen in Washington in recent days - such that Sharon will come out of his meeting with Bush very relaxed, indeed victorious, and the Saudi Foreign Minister, Saud Al-Faisal, will come out of the meeting also "very happy" with what he has heard - caution against the content of the anticipated Bush plan and the possibility of implementing it increases.
Opinion is unanimous to call on the Christian churches in Lebanon, Catholic and non-Catholic, not to show any leniency in the face of the disease of alleged fundamentalism, and take severe and speedy action to combat it by all means of awareness, enlightenment and explanation of the dangers of this disease.
It was clearly apparent that there was negligence on the part of elements of the internal security forces who were engaged to protect Bishop Haddad. The police command suspended ten persons last night as a procedural arrangement.
A declaration was issued by a large number of prominent figures including members of the Supreme Council of the Roman Catholic sect and members of the "Qarnat Shahwan Forum" and independent figures who considered that the perpetration of the crime witnessed by a number of security personnel "was more painful and abhorrent than a crime" and they were appalled by "the appearance of new sick personalities in our society, which knows only tolerance and a recognition of others".
They condemned the incident and called for "the spirit of love to overcome every violent action".
It is the duty of all of us, as Lebanese, to find a way out of this suffocating atmosphere, which resulted from these elections. We must exploit all our strength in contributing to preventing this from being the only victory, i.e. to make Lebanon the victor, that the free victors be in Lebanon, the democrats in Lebanon and those who adhere to their sovereignty, independence and free national decision, that this victory be transformed in the service of all Lebanon. The great fear is that some may not understand and that some may try to hide the truth of this victory, meaning that they may try to portray it as a bigoted, suffocating sectarian reaction in the face of another group of Lebanese, as if this group were a group from another sect.
Of course, it is the duty of the victor not to think that this victory in itself represents the desired goal.
Qablan: Existing Treatments Do Not Reassure; Fadlallah: Poisoned Policy Threatens Country.
In his sermon scholar Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah said, "Following agreement between officials to stop vehicles running on gas oil, the people are left to ask about the political consensus which must be followed by an economic plan to tackle the many problems. It is insufficient to say that they shouldn't pollute the air in Lebanon, above the capital to be specific, because most pollution lies in the political climate that encompasses everything and which has begun to threaten the fate of the country.
Following Cancellation of Serbian Presidential Elections, Kostunica Vows to Defeat Djindic and Next Round on December 5
Kostunica and Djindic had formed an alliance that led to the overthrow of Milosevic from power in 2000. However, they rapidly turned against each other because of disagreement over a number of issues, among which was how quickly reforms should occur.
On the other hand, Djindic believed that election problems will not worsen the political situation in the country, stating that citizens have lost interest in politics. He emphasized, "There is no crisis. (...) The elections are no more than a natural assessment of our political background, not more than that."
The lasting dispute between Kostunica and Djindic has led to slowing reform in Serbia, which has been impoverished by ten years of Milosevic's rule.

League Chairman Miyan Muhammad Zahir stated, "We are willing to form a coalition government with the United Action Front, but we are keeping all options open."
In a press conference he held in Islamabad, he said, "We do not need U.S. support."
"We will show flexibility and will take all necessary measures for the benefit of the nation."
The U.S. embassy in Islamabad stated that the exercises, which are titled "Driving Force Maneuver" will focus on light weapons exercises and small units tactics. They will last for three weeks.
Meanwhile, chances of forming a coalition government between the opposition Conference Party and the Democratic People's Party in the Indian sector of Kashmir have vanished following a dispute between the leaders of the two parties, who disagreed on who would assume presidency of the province and whether talks should be held with separatist Islamists.
Senior officials in the National Conference, including the conference's leader Umar Abd-Allah, lost their seats.
The Turkish Minister of Defense Sabahattin Cakmakoglu announced yesterday that Turkey intends to establish a "security zone" in northern Iraq to safeguard the security of its borders in case an American military operation is launched against Iraq.
"If we find it necessary, we will use a show of force and will intervene if the situation demands such action."
Ankara has recently expressed concerns that American military intervention in Iraq might result in establishing an independent Kurdish state in the north of that country.
Anti-U.S. feelings burst out in anger at yesterday's electoral meeting held by Ecevit for the Democratic Left Party in the city of Qaris in northwest Turkey. The meeting turned into an event to protest the war and to condemn U.S. policy.
"We want them to hear from where they are on the Atlantic shores, 'No to war.'"
Repeated Objection to Any Single Action; Tehran Denounces American Plans to Appoint American Ruler in Iraq
He stressed the importance of the role that must be assumed by the U.N. in such issues. He also highlighted the necessity of working toward protecting Iraq's territorial integrity and sovereignty and respecting the decision of international legitimacy.
He mentioned that Tehran "informed British Foreign Minister Jack Straw (during his visit to Tehran on October 9) that Iran is against war. (...) But at the same time we would like to ensure that Iraq does not possess chemical or biological weapons, or any other WMDs." Approximately one hundred thousand Iranian soldiers were attacked with Iraqi chemical weapons during the Iran-Iraq war from 1980 to 1988.
Encouraging Talks in Ukraine; Kuchma Denies Radar Sale to Iraq
Yesterday, Kuchma reconfirmed to the independent Russian news agency Interfax that he did not transfer such advanced technology to Iraq. He said, "Ukraine totally denies the transfer of any military technologies to Iraq. (...) Ukraine denies the accusations against it."
Ukraine officials had confirmed that they can identify the destination of every single Kolchuga system sold previously. They said that three Kolchuga systems are operational in Ethiopia, while the fourth is reserved for "a major country that is not subject to U.N. sanctions."
The U.S. State Department confirmed that it has verified the tapes recorded by Kuchma's personal guard Mikola Melenitcinco two years ago, in which the Ukrainian president approved the sale of the performance system to Iraq.
In an article published in the Indian "Statesman" newspaper, he said that the war will not benefit the U.S. economy.
A source close to the investigations of the explosion of the giant French oil tanker "Limpor," which is most likely to be deliberate, reported that French and American investigators continued their search on board the vessel yesterday.
French authorities in Paris confirmed that traces of TNT and glass fibers belonging to a small boat were identified on the tanker's body.
He added that the body was found 80 kilometers offshore.
He reported that he took the piece from the vessel.
One of their Bulgarian colleagues was killed in the blast.
Major and Minor Issues
We might not wait long to see a nuclear weapon used in future regional conflicts.
The formula that was happily used by Arabs in past years, which was based on exchanging tension in Iraq with calmness and settlements in Palestine, has been replaced by another policy based on striking both Iraq and Palestine.
To us, protecting our neck means maintaining a calm, internal political scene, featuring maximum political harmony even between parties that disagree with each other.
20 Films Competing in Cairo Film Festival; Actors and Actresses Will be Honored; Egypt Will be Honored
In this Festival Round, tribute will be paid to a group of international actors and actresses, including British actress Vanessa Redgrave. Redgrave will hold a press conference in Cairo.
A review of African films, including a show of eight films produced between 1990 and 1999, will be held. A special documentary "Nisaa Khalfa al Camera" will be shown. The documentary reviews films that dealt with women's issues around the world.
Eight movies are participating in the formal competition: "Asrar al Banat" by  Egyptian director Majdi Ahmed (2001), "Lamma Hekyet Mariam" by Lebanese director Asad Foldcar (2001), "Nagham al Naoura" by Tunisian director Abd al Latif Bin Ammar (a joint French-Tunisian production, 2002), "Al Saher" by the late Egyptian director Radwan al Kashef (2001), "Yad Elahiya by Palestinian director Eliah Suleiman (2002), "Hermanoco, or Awaiting Happiness" by  Mauritanian director Abdel Rahman Spasco (a joint Mauritanian-French production, 2002), "Hisan El Rih" by Moroccan director Daoud Awlad Sayad (2001), and "Kamaren Wa Zaytounah" by Syrian director Abdel Hamid Abdel Latif (2001).
"The Red Dragon" film starring British actor Anthony Hopkins brushed aside a large number of new films and remained on top of most profitable films list in North America. Meanwhile, it was confirmed that Madonna's film "Swept Away" is out of the competition.
The action movie "The Carrier" starring British actor Jason Stanley was ranked fourth, generating USD 9.7 million in the first days of release.
It broke the previous record estimated at 5.68 million Euros earned by "Lord of the Rings."
The movie will be shown in American movie theaters during Christmas.
He also challenged them, saying, "Change the tyrannical regime that is leading you from one failure to another and from one tragedy to another."
It is true that since Bush's invitation to Sharon was announced, it is being said that the American President will exercise pressure on his guest to avoid doing anything that might escalate the Palestinian position at a time when the U.S. is close to starting its military campaign against Iraq.
One of the fundamentals of Bush's policy in justifying Sharon's violations of his commitments is to say that Israel is defending itself, and that it has the right to do so.
Everything he does falls under the statement he made one day, that he is continuing the war of 1948.
So what about now, at a time when Bush and Sharon are power twins?
This came in a statement issued by Abi-Nasr yesterday. He was responding to Junbulat, who was interviewed by the Lebanese newspaper "al-Nahar" last Friday and who accused Abi-Nasr of "racism," because of his position regarding the issue of granting Lebanese citizenship.
"We did not want to reopen the issues of the past. But the excessive denial of the truth hurts the dignity of the Lebanese people. It was more appropriate for Mr. Junbulat to think before launching false accusations in his recent interview with "Al-Nahar" newspaper on Friday, 10/11/2002."
"He was never ashamed to describe himself as one of the imperialists who suck up people's money. Perhaps he was counting on people to forgive those who confess their sins."
"that accepts only their sacred right of return?"
"We enjoy neither the gift of carrying the socialist standard while teaming up with American capitalism nor the talent of practicing feudalism while calling for social justice."
"We do not have the talent to claim to care for homeland sovereignty while publicly calling for sharing it with others."
This is what French diplomat and journalist Eric Rolo tried to answer in his talk titled "American Strategy in the Middle East" at a meeting convened by the Meeting Club last night.
The other two documents date back to 1997 and September 2000, a few months before George W. Bush was elected. The two documents are signed by Wolfowitz, current U.S. Vice-President Dick Cheney, current U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and some hawks in the U.S. administration.
- Insisting on confronting anti-U.S. regimes. Here, the reports mention Iran's name before Iraq, because to them it poses a greater threat than Iraq to American interests.
- They grant the U.S. the right to act individually without approval from the U.N., "regardless of its opinion."
Specifically, those who have become known as the Neo-Conservatives (hawks) and the right-wing Christians as the Extremist Protestants.
Rolo summarized the objectives of the war against Iraq as:
- Reinforcing U.S. power in the entire region to curtail the role of oil-producing Arab states and to apply pressure on those states.
In spite of this dull atmosphere, the ninth Francophone Summit is being held in Lebanon (the first time in an Arab country) to confirm that country's ability to surmount the challenges invented by Israel to strike at the international vitality Lebanon has restored with momentum and determination, to stand once again among the prime countries shining in the world of money, business, culture, and civilization.
Having had such achievements, we have to always consider their moral and political results in order to consolidate Lebanon's civilized image among the countries of the region and the world. Meanwhile, Israel is making every possible effort to fabricate and attack its life, sometimes through venomous media and sometimes by contriving water problems, although this is in fact a Lebanese right legitimized by international law and void of any sort of piracy.
Lebanon's constant refusal of the Israeli conditions secured for it an international immunity against Israel's water and territorial ambitions.
Were not all wars economic by reasons and causes?
But other than the expected confrontation, there is something more tragic.
The Arabs are blaming everyone in the world except themselves. They consider that all states are responsible for recovering the Arabs' rights on their behalf.
Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa, the last of the optimistic Arabs, is trying to save what remains of Arab positional esteem. He told British Foreign Minister Jack Straw a few days ago, "The guarantees given to Arab states have been nothing but deception. We do not want any more of those."
Those waiting for the war are still unaware that a war has actually occurred and has actualized all its accompanying threats.
The U.S. President will never run out of ways to surprise the American people and the world with the change in Baghdad.
At that time, Washington will not hesitate to declare the Security Council's failure to meet what is expected of it and will concentrate on the Iraqi regime's attempts to keep the mentioned weapons away from the eyes of the inspectors, perhaps because the secrets of Saddam's regime remain in his sole possession since he suspects everyone, near and far. He might even go to the extent of placing the last of the ammunition under, or even inside, his pillow.
That is one rule of the big game.
There is an obvious, deep disagreement that has become more severe over the past few days about formulating the ruling method to be employed after toppling Saddam's regime.
Mr. Tarek Aziz said, "All Arab leaders have abandoned us, except for the Syrians." (He was speaking from Damascus.)
We were asked about our opinion of the issue, and our response came in the form of examples we presented:
And if our prayers are answered with a miracle, then all praise will naturally be due to the "state of institutions."
Finding this statement strange is ultimate extremism, whereas finding that resorting to the visitor's services is a natural matter and represents the very essence of moderation.
As to meetings between Arab officials and the enemy's leaders and the exchange of correspondence between them, then keeping silent about that is the peak of required moderation.
Let us all return to our previous norm of accord and cooperation as free people as we restore our emigrant sovereignty, because the heart of a true Lebanese knows not grudge or rancor.
You were born renouncing the worldly pleasures.
The summer of 1944. A few months after Emil Eddeh was dismissed from the parliament and his membership was cancelled, due to his cooperation with French mandate authorities; these events were followed by his political isolation. Yomna, sister of Sheikh Beshara al-Khuri, was seated in the spacious garden of the Grand Sofer hotel, in that summer town on the Beirut-Damascus highway. She noticed that the people passing by Rimon Eddeh's table at the center of the garden were ignoring him and not shaking hands with him.
"Would you like to dance with me?"
She repeated, "Don't you want to dance with me near the band, over there?"
The president called his brother, Sheilh Fuad and told him about what Yomna did, asking him to talk to her about that behavior at a time when Sheikh Beshara was fighting a political battle against Emil Eddeh to end his political role totally.
"We know that and will not object to it."
"Have you forgotten that you are the president's sister?"
"All of us make mistakes."
She added, "Large political families cannot be humiliated."
After reading this chapter, dear reader, don't you feel sorrow creeping into your heart and grief over the previous ages when nobility, honor, and values had a place in the politicians' life and mind?
Sorry.
on 10/11/2002 made local observers wonder whether the young Jordanian king hurried to announce the new political theme of the fourth kingdom, especially because contrasting scenarios are circulating in political circles regarding Jordan's future and regional approach.
For the Jordanians, it is because they are concerned that it might be an attempt to incorporate them in a state where they will be a minority. The Palestinians have their concerns because they are afraid that the solution might be an attempt to strip them of their dream of an independent Palestinian state.
"Our borders will be impregnable against any attempt to displace our Palestinian brothers or expel them from their land."
The typical Jordanian position regarding this is to consider them citizens until they decide to return, once that option is available.
He postponed the Jordanian administration of the West Bank in 1974 (when the Arab Summit decision was made in Rabat to deem the P.L.O. the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people) to 1988.
Perhaps we are a day ahead of its finalization.
No politician less formidable than the late king can play it. Second, because it would not gain support from the Jordanian people or approval of the Jordanian government. The late king's persistence with it was a source of constant internal tension. Third, because it is a typical "Hashemite" game, but Abd-Allah II belongs to a generation of Hashemites that sees itself as Jordanian.
The Fire Of Baghdad
Anyone who does not believe that can ask the Palestinians about the state that the Americans had promised them, and how things are progressing to fulfill that promise faster than was expected.
Hence, he will spare no effort to meet the Iraqis' humanitarian needs and fill the shelves of pharmacies and shops with commodities that the Iraqi regime had not allowed Iraqis to have!
Let every Iraqi be prepared to buy a house suitable for a citizen belonging to a rich country, from the revenues of that oil.
Caring about the Iraqi people's interests and to ensure that the promised democracy in the new Iraq is not exposed to an early relapse, Washington will not risk handing over the rule of Iraq to Iraqis after the fall of Saddam's rule, in order to prevent revenge actions after a long period of injustice and tyranny and so that the country does not plunge into chaos.
Why not to give it another try after the third one?
Crowds of soldiers and fleets are coming from every direction to save Iraqis.
Poor Iraqi people.
This time, the triumph of any party will mean a new loss for the Iraqi people.
First: There are certain things that I find indisputable; faith is one of them.
Accordingly, a non-believer who denies the existence of God may not say: I am an atheist because atheism is a scientific stance. On the other hand, a believer in the existence of God may not say: I am a believer because belief is a scientific stance.
A new thinking style, decisiveness, and determination in the statement of King Abd-Allah II to the MBC satellite TV channel
The Jordanians fear becoming a minority in the new state; and the Palestinians also have their fears that the new state will be the first step toward forgetting their goal of independence.

Fifty Years After Dividing Palestine (1947-1997)
They are not driven by particular injustice. Their society is a democratic society open to opinion and other views. They enjoy the freedom to discuss what is going on and to express their thoughts. Talk about their dissatisfaction with what is happening in Palestine is a pretext not to be accepted by any sane person and is a justification that can only work with simpletons. What is happening in Palestine now did not start yesterday, the day before, or last week. It has been happening for the past two years, at least. Why would someone be driven by ardor only now for what is happening over there. Also, this dissatisfaction and pain for what is happening is common among all Kuwaitis. The response to that came, within limits of ability, from all sects and currents of Kuwaiti society, but it did not take the form of carrying lethal weapons and going to the island of Failaka after lurking for revenge against individuals who have no direct relation to what is happening in Palestine.
And any case, "Israel will not permit diversion of al-Hasibani water."
It also knows, in particular, that the current status of constructed facilities cannot accommodate Lebanon's entire share of water.
As part of the answer, the timing of this Israeli position must also be questioned, as well as why Sharon slept for many weeks after Lebanon started the al-Wazzani project, only to wake up again in fury and rage?
For Sharon, who assumed office on a biblical chariot as a "legendary national hero who will save the people of Israel," still has not forgotten, and has not forgiven, that he was forced out of the South of Lebanon, leaving his "allies" to be punished by imprisonment, vagrancy, and humiliation after promising them a glorified return to their villages. The promise was never fulfilled.
The person who has almost succeeded in destroying the Palestinian Authority amid international silence, who directly rejects the Security Council resolution requiring him to break the siege on its president and cities, and who gives the cold shoulder to the American request to lessen that siege and those massacres... must be encouraged by this silence, especially from Arabs, to realize his desire for revenge and rehabilitation of the legend of the "invincible army" that waits but does not forget its enemies.
The Minister of Energy and Water, Muhammad Abd al-Hameed Baydoon, and the Lebanese University President, Dr. Ibraheem Qubeisi, signed an agreement yesterday to organize the geological map of Lebanon at a scale of 1:20000, study the geological formations, classify subterranean basins, and study the relationship between them with a view to improving the process of investing in them.
With regard to existence of other projects with the University, he said that the future concern is to protect ground water, and that it is most probable that joint projects will be prepared soon to determine the use of ground water and to survey and treat sources of pollution.
According to the agreement, the Lebanese University committed to carrying out the project of contributing to the organization of the geological map of Lebanon at a scale of 1:20000, studying the geological formations, and classifying basins in accordance with specifications and terms stated in the book of terms and the price list.
It is still too early to judge the results of Prime Minister Rafeek Al-Hareeri's visits to Malaysia and Japan as part of his intended Asian, European, and Arab Gulf tour to invite donor states to participate in the Paris 2 conference, on the premise that these visits are part of preparations for the conference and to explain Lebanon's reasons for inviting these states to participate and for requesting them in particular to support Lebanon's efforts to solve the problem of growing general debts and deficit. This will be based on a detailed presentation prepared by the Ministry of Finance, which the Prime Minister uses to explain the government's policy at the economic and financial levels, and the procedures it will carry out or has carried out so far to reduce the deficit and amortize part of the debt service.
Among the attendees were Association Director Subhi al-Bisat, Water and Electricity Sources Director General Dr. Fadi Qumeer, FAO Representative in Lebanon Dr. Nur al-Deen Qadira, and a number of concerned figures.

He explained that the insurance and hospital sector is studying the establishment of a partnership to develop a special insurance contract that would secure basic consumer requirements at low prices, "which would reduce the cost born by the Ministry of Health."
He considered that these figures confirm the strength of the sector, good capitalization, and the distinguished position it occupies among other economic sectors, "as it has come to represent 3% of the GNP, and we are attempting to raise this percentage."
He considered that there is an opportunity to expand cooperation between both countries "to benefit from the preferential characteristics they have." He emphasized that Cyprus is capable of benefiting from Lebanon's experience in the therapeutic tourism sector "because the Lebanese private sector invested well in hospitals that are considered international, while Cyprus made agreements with Britain regarding medication."
He also suggested the establishment of a Lebanese-Cypriot assembly of businessmen to encourage close cooperation between the two countries.
"The Uncircumcised," a Novel by Abd-Allah Khaleefa; A Narration Overflowing Beyond Its Events and Characters
Here, the novel assumes an Indian melodramatic course, or something reminding one of Egyptian films of the sixties where a rich girl falls in love with a poor boy, or something of the sort. However, the novelist makes no use of the brevity of that cinema (where each film would be no longer than 90 minutes or two hours), but rather agonizes through both lead characters in attempts to bring them closer to each other. As to the reader, the result is settled: love wins! The more we delve into the pages of the novel, the heavier its stuffiness gets. The writer resorts to language that takes no account of the novel's lead characters, who start simple in the beginning and end up cultured by its end. Yahia, the novel's major character, transforms into a writer for a newspaper run by the occupiers and his only boyhood friend Ishaq, and into a leader who endeavors to get rid of the English and gain independence.
Therefore, he enrolls secretly among the resistance, and his end comes together with that of his wife and of Ishaq.
Guitar by Jihad Azkol Solo Among the National Orchestra Harmonies from a Body
The folklore remained his tool and drove to compose his music, like "Bent El Chalabiyah," "Ya Ghzayel," "Al Yadi," and "Al Rosana," the orchestral distribution being sensitive and delicate on each stringed or wind instrument, which allowed the Mediterranean-Lebanese identity to extend and spread out of the limits, root in its soil, and expand in the world.
Some moments of high harmony characterized the ambiance of this concerto with elegant expressions and nostalgic folklore played by Azkol, along with other moments of confusion because of the guitar chord influenced by the heat of the hall.
In St. John Cathedral, the sensitive instruments went from diminuendo to crescendo and so on, orchestrating the melody according to the cathedral's size and its technical complications.
before the Sole Penal Judge for mistreatment and the use of violence against a manager in the Lebanese University last September, while on duty. He also requested a trial for the defendant's partners S.
Upon their arrival at the building on the morning of 9/10/2002, the first defendant requested to meet the dean. When he found him absent, he went to the office of the manager, Sameer Tannous, who is the claimant. He entered the secretary's office, while his companions waited for him outside the office. He asked the secretary about the manager, saying that he wanted to meet him. She asked him to wait for a few minutes for her to inform the claimant college manager and for a visitor to leave the office. The secretary then went to inform the manager, but the defendant followed her. As soon as he caught sight of the college manager, who was seated behind his desk, he blurted out: "Minister (...) owns Al-Ashrafiya, and no one can hang up on him." The manger responded by saying: "Minister (...) did not call me, and I hung up on no one (...)" and asked him to leave the office.
continued to shove the manager with his hands, until students and employees came from the outside, as did the two other defendants during the fight to support their companion. The manager asked his employees to close the door of the office until internal security forces arrived, but the two of them prevented their companion from continuing to assault the manager and managed to take him out of the office, then run away.
Sources close to the investigations reported that the investigations will be intensified. Three internal security personnel who were referred to the investigation group to clarify the nature of their relation with the disappeared will be interrogated.
It was understood that work is being done on a number of recent calls received or made by Abi-Rashid using his cell phone, which was found discarded in the town of Roumia.
Attorney Yusuf Lahud filed a memorandum with the Justice Council in which he requested, as proxy for seven claimants in the Onesco massacre case, combining his principals, the claimants to the public lawsuit. Those claimants are Claire Abd-Allah Al-Shiryaq, Fuad Haleem Al-Faghali, Nazik Boutros Suma, Wafaa Dawud Abu-Ezzi, Ziyad Sulayman Al-Jamoos, Bassam Sulayman Al-Jamoos, and Reli Sulayman Al-Jamoos.
They picketed opposite the U.N. Commissioner's Office for Refugee Affairs-Al-Adliya before noon yesterday. They exclaimed objections against "the Commissioner's Office's 14-day-long evasion of its duties toward Muhammad Ali," as was mentioned in the statement. They held it "fully responsible from the legal, moral, and humanitarian standpoints for the health condition of our son Assad."

Traffic accidents have recently increased on the Zaghrita-Ahden highway because of speed.
A third accident happened in Sahl Al-Jadeeda, where the collision of two cars resulted in several injuries. The cause, according to Expert Boutros Franjiya's report, is due to excessive speed and inattention.
for charges of forging a power of attorney to receive decree-approved  financial compensations against constructing the Arab freeway on the location of buildings owned by Jewish individuals belonging to the Darweesh family in the area of Sofer.
In this context, he started to gather information and lay a plan with forgery at its core. He then switched to the execution phase, and because he was acquainted with one Kamal El-Seyoufi, owner of a stationery shop in Corniche Al-Mazraa, which he frequented to photocopy maps and documents, and also because he is acquainted with a number of attorneys who are customers of the stationery shop, he started to complain in front of its owner about following up dealings with official authorities, and that he had a dealing for which he needed an active attorney to complete. He asked him whether he knew an attorney for that purpose, so the latter suggested consulting an attorney he knew by virtue of the neighborhood and gave him his telephone number and office address.

No longer will forums, conventions, and conferences host that thin, complacent, and fresh as morning dew face in which drive chases wrinkles of age, and from the eyes of which truth radiates to conceal that blackness in the irises, etched by years of troubles.
That beacon of Beirut was extinguished as she was preparing to participate in the Arab National Conference emergency session. When I tried to find absence excuses for her, she said sharply, "How can there be an Arab meeting of such magnitude for Palestine, Iraq, Syria, and the resistance without my attending it?"
For example, ahead of the pioneer of the women's movement in Beirut and one of its pioneers in Lebanon and the Arab world, namely her aunt Ibtihaj Qaddura, she managed to give the women's movement its cultural and national dimension.
As much as Zahia Qaddura was full of affection and love for her family, attached to each member of it, she also had her own private family, who were assembled for her by the days and who gathered around her at crucial times. This family was comprised of some of her university graduates who refused to graduate from her council, where they learned something new every day. It also included some of those she knew along the tracks and paths of life, who joined her open university indefinitely, drawing values, a model, and loyalty from her.

Ridge said that the voice recorded on the Al-Jazeera tape belongs to the Al-Qaeda leader and that the alert degree in the U.S. to encounter terrorism activities remains at "High," and mentioned that the issue "does not need recalling to memory after Bin Laden's own statements 24 or 28 hours ago."
However, he mentioned that Paris has no specific information regarding the nature of these threats and that 200 intelligence personnel will be deployed in airports and railway stations.
And in Berlin, German intelligence authorities confirmed the authenticity of Bin Laden's recording. One of the experts said, "The message is most probably genuine and raises extreme concerns" and that "the fact that it was broadcast by Al-Jazeera network is in itself a certification of its authenticity."
The Australian government warned yesterday four groups it considered terrorist and reinforced its juridical authorities with cooperation agreements with the U.S., U.K., and the major police forces in Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore.
They said that an agreement has been made between some Gulf figures possessing huge deposits abroad and the channel supervisors that those will receive the amount in partial payments, each not to exceed 300,000 dollars, from the accounts of Arab companies in Europe as advertising fees.
Luigi Mazilla (70 years old), who is a man of law with no political affiliation, will replace Fratini as assigned minister of justice in addition to his management of the Italian intelligence authority.
Agagari's wife, Zahra Yahnudi, who visited him in his prison in Humthan, said that her husband thanks the students for their support, and that he said, "It is better for the students to present their demands in a civil movement and within the limits of law, and to work toward preventing those who attempt to deviate the movement off its track through violence and disturbance."
Iranian Minister of Interior Abd Al-Wahid Mousaoui Lari called on authorities and judges to "refrain from behavior that may distort Iran's image around the world."
French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin announced yesterday that issues related to Middle East and terrorism occupied a large part of the talks he held with Tunisian officials.
With regard to terrorism, he noted that the September 11 attacks "altered the perception of the extent of the challenges," and as such, "caution is imperative to face this threat."
"Our concern today is to work so as to enable the inspectors to accomplish their mission actually and quickly."
He was asked whether he discussed human rights and responded, "When we hold talks, we discuss everything, including human rights."
Amman-From Omar Assaf:
However, the Jordanian News Agency Petra reported, "The citizens' living conditions are normal, shops are open, and provisions are available. Citizens expressed satisfaction with actions taken."
Petra confirmed that security forces arrested six of the gang members, and that they seized "large quantities of automatic weapons, machine guns, grenades, and explosive-producing materials."
In a statement carrying his name, the university administration said, "I decided to close it immediately and for further notice for the safety of students and to protect its facilities."
College of Education Aid Fund Manager Hussein Sulayman said that the disagreement between the students and the Fund was based on political motives.
On November 4, the government ordered an investigation into the entry of the campus by the police.
At the end of his meeting with Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa, he stated, "Relations are normal, and no one should be disturbed by non-positive statements in this regard." He expressed his hope for "overcoming anything that would impede building strong relationships" between the two countries.
Moussa announced that he sensed during his talks with Afurqi a will to "establish positive relations between his country and Yemen and Sudan."
The Pope's visit to the parliament bears historic indications with regard to the relations between the Vatican and Italy. It also expresses the depth of emotions borne by Italians toward John Paul II, of Polish birth and the first non-Italian pope in 455 years.
However, Pope Pius IX refused to recognize the government and described himself as the "Prisoner of the Vatican."
However, this historic event did not pass without objection. Some MPs refused to attend the session to emphasize that Italy is a non-religious state. Also, ten homosexual men demonstrated in a nearby plaza.
He called on Christian countries to work toward achieving peace and not to fall "captives to the logic of confrontation, which never introduces real solutions."
He urged the government to assist that by following family-supportive policies and by creating "political initiatives to alleviate the social and economic burden of giving birth to children and raising them." He also urged parents to instill ethical values into children "for them to grow in a healthy atmosphere of freedom."
The Pope also touched on the problem of unemployment and expressed his regret for what he considered to be ethical decadence that is being spread further with the help of the media.
She said, "It is a political event, for he is not only the head of the Church."
16th Chinese Communist Party General Conference Ended; Jiang Abdicates and Hands Leadership to Hu and Charter Amended to Include Emerging Classes and Capitalists Charter Amendment
As expected, Hu Jintao is the only surviving member of the current central committee in the party leadership.
This shift from the "third generation" of Chinese leadership, whose members are now in their seventies, to the "fourth generation", who are in their fifties and sixties, is considered the most significant political change in China since 1989, and the first orderly transfer of authority since the Communist system was established in China in 1949. Previous transfers of authority in the Asian giant witnessed cleansing and bloodshed, including the appointment of Jiang as secretary-general of the party after violent protests in the Tian In Min plaza in 1989.
The formation of the new leadership team will be announced today (Friday) after the new central committee's first plenary session. This will reveal the influence Jiang will maintain in the coming years.
The final day of the conference witnessed another event, which was the historic amendment to the Communist Party charter so as to allow for admission of capitalists. The wording "The Chinese Communist Party is the forefront of the working class" was changed to "The Party is the forefront of the Chinese working class, the Chinese people, and the Chinese nation."
He had started to promote this "idea" approximately eighteen months ago. Its major aim for the party is attempting to incorporate in the party emerging classes, among which are capitalists.
U.S. Senate Democratic Majority Leader Tom Daschle criticized President George Bush's administration for its obstruction to forming a committee to investigate the September 11 attacks in New York and Washington. He mentioned that an independent inquiry would help the country deal with future threats.
He added, "The Al-Qaeda organization remains a threat."
He said, "They want to be able to pick the committee. They do not want the Congress to intervene. (...) You will not be able to get an objective review. All you will get is a subjective review" if that happens.
He said, "This matter concerns protection of the American people and assigning the President necessary instruments he needs to better protect the American people."
Daschle said, "I am inclined to support the final text," explaining that the Democrats want to proceed with the law in spite of escalated concerns about articles related to the staff.
Recent polls in Israel indicate that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon leads his rival former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Likud bloc elections scheduled to be held next November 28. Meanwhile, Haifa Municipality Director Amiram Mitzna leads his competitors, former Minister of Defense Benjamin Ben- Eliezir and MP and former Minister Haim Ramon in the Labor Party elections scheduled for Tuesday the 19th in preparation for general elections scheduled for January 28, 2003.
"This man enjoys a great deal of credibility, and it seems he cannot be defeated."
However, the recent polls show that Sharon might have no need for Netanyahu, as he came in ten points ahead, in addition to predicting that he will win the general elections.
The secular Shinui Party will also double its number of seats to 12, and Arab parties will win 11 seats compared to ten. The extremist Eastern Jews Shas Party will be a big loser too, as its number of representatives will drop from the current 17 to 9.
Levy, who is a member of Gesher Party, had resigned last April from the national unity government presided over by Sharon, in which he was a minister without a portfolio, in protest against reduction of the social affairs budget.
It is Paris 2, which seems in its objectives and incentives to be out of the current regional and international context. In fact, it even introduces a contradictory context to the political atmosphere that is dominating the momentum of international relations since September 11 of last year.
In saying this, we definitely do not intend to give the Paris 2 convention the status of a coalition, nor even of axes, although supporting a country such as Lebanon, with all its characteristics and uniqueness, does deserve an international coalition, at least because it presents the world with a formula for creative coexistence among multiple sects and ethnic groups at a time when the world is slipping toward struggle between ethnic groups and civilizations and toward primitiveness in relations between states and ignorance in dealing with societies.
On the other hand, holding the conference coincides with a politically indicative turn in terms of the French political position against the global policy that Washington is trying to dictate in an imperialistic style that is not free of arrogance. This doubles the significance of Paris 2, which is further increased by the American participation in the conference.
Those who are going there are keen on giving their attendance an indication more than the souvenir photograph.
Christians of Principle and Realistic Christians
The reasons for the mentioned division range from the basis of the political discourse of each of the two camps from disagreement over the period of Syrian military presence in Lebanon and Syria's extensive role in running its affairs, to respecting Lebanon's sovereignty, independence, parliamentary democratic system, and freedoms, the application of Al-Taif agreement, establishing a true national Christian-Islamic balance in the Lebanese state on basis of a national dealing that would secure the end of war by eliminating its political reasons, and also between private and occasionally personal political interests of a large number of members of the two mentioned camps.
Personal interests and important details, considered to be the devil's hideout, might play an important role in the mentioned agreement.
However, reference may be made to the actual currents that are pulling between them at the Christians of Lebanon today, and that are pushing them toward division, discord, and perhaps fighting. Those currents must be researched in terms of roots and components in the past decade and part of the decade that preceded it, with all the events that took place then, particularly what was then termed the Eastern Issue, for which no effective and permanent solutions have been found until the present.
It also means standing against transforming Lebanon into a police state where there is no room for democracy and freedom,
Its actual implicit, and perhaps explicit, objective is to keep Christians inside Lebanon and protect their political, economic, and social role that is, in its view, threatened by various factors such as the gradual transformation of Muslims into a majority and the growth of Islamic fundamentalism in the Arab and Islamic world and the negative impact that has on Lebanon.
What is each of the mentioned Christian currents view of the other?
This means that the current and perhaps the forthcoming stages will be loaded with difficulties for the principle-based current, as the realistic current is currently "dominant," if that expression may be used.
Egyptian Intelligence Director General Omar Sulayman arrived suddenly in Ramalla and met with Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat, in an attempt that Palestinians say aims at evaluating the results of talks held in Cairo in the past four days by the two movements of Fatah and Islamic Resistance Hamas to stop suicidal operations inside Israel.
From Ramalla, the Egyptian intelligence director traveled to Jerusalem and held separate talks with Catsaf and Sharon.
Hamas asked for time to consider the proposition without rejecting it.
Arafat's advisor, Nabeel Abu Redeina, said that success of the efforts to stop suicidal operations depends on Israel stopping its attacks against Palestinians and ending its occupation of Palestinian autonomous territory in the West Bank.
He said, "The President expressed his view clearly, which is that Israel is entitled to self-defense, provided it keeps in consideration the results of its actions. This opinion is well known."
American officials noted that Washington reluctantly accepts the sluggishness of peace talks in the Middle East because Israel is unable to make important decisions before the general elections are held.
They also focused on the importance of dedicated traffic police and not detaching it for any other tasks.
After the session, Committee Chairman MP Sami Al-Khateeb said, "We promised hunters that this law will be ready before the end of this month."
"Young people will have access to a modern law allowing them good practice of their hobby."
It is a media miracle in Lebanon.
The petition was sent to most newspapers and radio and television stations. In every firm, one of the colleagues circulated it by hand around his colleagues. Ninety-five percent signed (or wanted to sign). The issue is thus humanitarian, social, and professional. Everyone wanted to raise their voices and say: It is unacceptable that 453 families be made homeless. We people of the press and media do not accept paying the price every time. We do not want solutions at our expense.
Otherwise, why were mitigating factors invented?
We are mothers and fathers, and it is the school season. Living conditions were difficult in the first place for those who have jobs, let alone the unemployed.
However, no one accepted us: the Editors Association, the Press Association, the General Labor Union, and even the Journalism Club.
When we proposed it to colleagues, the response was wonderful. Some of them said, "I will sign blindly." However, we insisted that everyone read it.
1- The media body is one cohesive whole, starting with the top of the pyramid, the owners and presidents of newspapers and media firms, all the way down to journalists, media staff, passing through technicians and laborers.
Finally, if journalists and media personnel do not act and defend their rights, families, lives, and firms, then how can they defend the rights of people and country?
The Meeting held its periodic convention in the Hezbollah Political Council headquarters and discussed the local, Arab, and international issues and developments. The conferees issued the following statement:
- "The Meeting discussed developments of the Iraqi issue after Security Council Resolution 1441 and noted that the American position is working toward marketing its own understanding of the new resolution that it gives Washington authorization to attack Iraq without referring to the Security Council. This contradicts the resolution, which explicitly stipulates that any strike against Iraq cannot be automatic, allows the inspection teams to carry out their task in Iraq, and then submit their report to the Security Council, the sole decision-making authority."
"On the anniversary of the reform movement lead by the late President Hafez Al-Assad, the Meeting addresses congratulations to Dr. Bashar Al-Assad and the Syrian leadership."
The vanguards of international forces arrived in Lebanon on March 23. Resolution 425 called for, first, strict respect for the integrity of Lebanese territory and the sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized boundaries. Second, it called on Israel to stop its military action against the integrity of Lebanese territory immediately and to withdraw at once its forces from all Lebanese lands.
Its history is considered part of the history of the South.
Combat operations continued between Israeli forces and its cooperating Lebanese forces on one hand, and Lebanese groups that declared its determination to resist Israeli occupation on the other hand.
Also, U.N. legal and military specialists studied the legal issues that could be faced within implementation of Resolution 425.
The U.N. team on the field worked toward demarcating a line to confirm the Israeli withdrawal.
The operations of the force remained focused on the blue line and its adjacent area, where the force continued exerting its efforts to maintain the cease-fire through patrolling, fixed-post surveillance, and close contacts with the parties.
The relevant incidents are latitudinal violations of the blue line in the Shiba farms area.
The Secretary-General recommended that the force make-up should be settled at 2000 by the end of 2002.
The President is aware of the ability of "  " to simultaneously report and receive messages and therefore says a final opinion that the Lebanese state strategy is facing  an American-Israeli war mounting the horse of cyclone winds.
Much has been said in the few past years about coordination between the government and the resistance and about an integration between them against Israel when it was on Lebanese territory, and even after its withdrawal. However, eyes beheld, in addition to political facts and information, that such coordination passes through Syria, which represented the intermediary position in the balance and as such was pulling the pans to meet at an equal distance from it if face to face meeting is not possible!
Silence Toward Iraq's Acceptance Despite Official Concern With the Issue
Highly informed sources noted that the first American reaction to Iraq's acceptance was "cautious and skeptical," and that Washington wants "deeds to match words," although the acceptance was unconditional 48 hours before the expiration of the time limit given by the Security Council.
They found that this second step is the true test and is crucial, sensitive, and packed with risks of the return of the war phantom after being dismissed by the acceptance of Resolution 1441.
This is construed differently by the U.S. on one hand, and France, Russia, and China on the other hand.
And the question this time is whether that would lead to launching a strike, or a general and partial strike, or acknowledging the discrepancy and requiring the inspectors to destroy it.
They noted the "provocation" phrase of the decision, as it led to their expulsion.
Solidarity With Sudan Meeting; Bomb in Fatah Center Wounds Member in Ein Al-Helwa; American Delegation Visits Baalbak Castle under Tight Security Measures; Qowati in Solidarity With Almir Today
Sayda-"Al-Nahar":
PLO-Fatah Movement Factions Secretary in Sayda and the South, Colonel Khaled Aref, made a statement in which he said: "The attack that targeted the Fatah Movement premises this morning is a continuation of the same series that has been going on for two months, targeting organizations and individuals of all forces and factions in Ein Al-Helwa camp. The most recent incident was the targeting of the Commandos facility in the camp, imagining that with this series they can meddle with the security of the camp and drag the national and Islamic forces and factions into internal conflicts."
Away from the media, working groups of U.S. Congressional members of the House of Representatives and Senate visited yesterday the Baalbak citadel, amid security  measures of unprecedented tightness.
The visit lasted approximately 90 minutes.
Days, months, and years passed, and I lost track of that self-reliant man, until I read his name in a newspaper as the Chairman of the Muslim Scouts Society, which is a society having among its most important principles "reuniting boy and girl scouts, preserving the scouting spirit in them, promoting the scouting movement in all societies of Lebanon, respecting human rights and feelings, and promoting peace based on truth and justice."
A power generator in the town of Ghazeer is placed six meters away from the window of a nearby house. Its noise disturbs the neighbors, and its smoke entered the bedrooms.
The complainant did not specify the name of the owner of the generator nor the name of the district in the town of Ghazeer, which is quite large. There is also no reference to the process with the concerned authorities. This information is necessary to follow up on the complaint and deal with it.
For example, the continuation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can be construed as the willingness of Arabs, and the willingness of Israelis as well but to a lesser extent, to mobilize on the basis of conditions imposed by the social affair. Those are conditions that stipulate that external bets are more important than bets pertinent to each society and each individual.
Subsequently, the Arab world's economic, social, and communal failure is construed as its inability to protect the "self" against the "us," which has superlative existence even in the media.
Modernity, which is supposed to guarantee for every individual the right to live in accordance with his private will, rather than with the conditions of the group, has been exposed to repression in this world and was presented as a European promotional instrument aimed at guaranteeing European hegemony.
There is no doubt that the contribution with most depth to the book is the one presented by Hussein Ahmad Ameen under the title "The Crisis of the Individual in Egypt."
However, the sole positive point amid a general atmosphere of pessimistic tendency is Hussein Ahmad Ameen's belief that globalization and the fact that states, even the overly repressive of liberties among them, are increasingly losing the ability to fend internal sabotage schemes are two factors stirring hopes that democratic revolutions may erupt, and that would be no more than the seeds of releasing the Arab individual from the bonds of "his tribe."
Abu-Juda: Quality ISO Qualifies Our Emergence Into International Markets
In the beginning, Sadir spoke about the occasion. He considered that it is not only important to the Lebanese-Canadian Bank but also to the entire banking sector.
On his part, Abu-Juda emphasized that "this step was accomplished within the framework of restructuring the bank over the past years so as to cater to customer needs that are no longer limited to traditional transactions."
He said that this event is the start of a more crucial and difficult phase. "As such, we will involve everyone, particularly those dealing directly with customers, in collecting information, expressing opinions, and solving problems."
There are 520 institutions around the world applying ISO 2000/9001.
The Turkish delegation emphasized the necessity of promoting cooperation in a number of fields, particularly banking, tourism, and trade. Meanwhile, invitations were given for signing several agreements, most prominently on duality of taxation and transport.
The discussion touched on means of promoting economic and trade relations between Lebanon and Turkey.
The Turkish Ambassador spoke and in turn emphasized the importance of joint cooperation, thanking Al-Qassar and members of the Beirut Chamber for their care of the delegation.
He wondered: "Would it be reasonable that no serious attempt be made to build economic and commercial relations between the Arab Orient and Turkey, particularly since Lebanon, which is characterized by its composition and the quality of its businessmen, is able to utilize what Turkey can provide from its market and Asian markets that were formerly part of the Soviet Union?"
Al-Bezri noted Lebanon's distinguished location, specifically in terms of geography.
He called for joint cooperation on the banking operations level, emphasizing the necessity of benefiting from the expertise of Lebanon, which is considered a pioneer in this field, in addition to encouraging tourism exchange and developing its relevant marketing policies.
The agreement was signed by the Fund's Managing Director Badr Al-Hemeidi and Construction and Development Council Director Jamal Eitani in the presence of Minister of Finance Fuad AL-Senyora and Kuwaiti Ambassador Ali Sulayman Al-Saeed.
He emphasized "Kuwait's continuous willingness to offer what it can to our brothers in Lebanon. The ties between the Lebanese and Kuwaiti peoples are in fact an exceptional relationship in the Arab world."
He also said, "This new, vital project expresses the government's policy aimed at reviving the educational sector by providing and equipping required school facilities." He revealed that the Council recently announced two tenders for the construction of Al-Museitba School and Ras Beirut School at a capacity of 4,000 pupils and is preparing the assignment and ownership files for the other twenty schools.
The term of the loan signed yesterday is 40 years, 5 of which are a grace period, at an annual interest rate of 2 percent.
A delegation from the Union of Growers and Farmers Associations, accompanied by Southern Olive Growers Association Chairman Hassan Salami, toured some olive production areas in the South and Al-Nabatiya. They viewed the suffering of growers and their inability to sell this season's produce, in addition to the low prices, at a time when last year's produce remains in storage.
"The production cost of olives in Lebanon is the highest in the area: While the cost of a kilogram of olives in Lebanon is 966 pounds, in Syria it is only 565 pounds, and in Jordan it ranges between 163 and 412 pounds."
"- That olive oil exports be subsidized with an amount no less than 600 dollars per ton as part of the Agricultural Exports Support Program, particularly since oil is one of the commodities eligible for this subsidy upon approval of the Finance and Budget Committee in its session dated 5/2/2001 to add olives and olive oil to commodities eligible for the subsidy to promote export activity and increase it above the current rate of approximately 650 tons."
In 269 medium-size pages, the author documents an essential saying, suggesting that the colonial West saw in the Arab Orient from Iraq eastward to the Syrian coast westward a "casual incident," that Arabs are invaders, and accordingly that this "historic disorder" must be corrected by expelling Arabs from the Orient.
This was known by only a few of his generation who started their lives in remote villages, as he did, and insisted on finding room for themselves in the city. The least of those few are those who possess the talent of that refined man in gathering people around him and all their love in sincerity and without discrimination on the basis of sect, party, area, village, or foreign urbanity.
We have gained immense honor as that ancient lineage race inhabited our country and left the "genes" of its lineage latent in the blood of some of our compatriots.

O Saint Therese, heal all our patients and console all the broken-hearted.
How can we allow ourselves to get stuck in such nooks, while predictions around us forecast a great quake?
Or perhaps some regimes understand them but demur in concern for their seats, which are already shaky even before the expected quake that is predicted by all observatories.
We also cannot miss Israel, the cancerous lump nestled in the heart of the Arab world.
History will undoubtedly dedicate a luminous page to him for saving his people, land, dignity, and the dignity of all Arabs.

Strengthening The Partnership Relations In The Textile Sector Within The Euro-Mediterranean region.
The President of the country emphasized the need to strengthen partnership relations in these sectors within the Euro-Mediterranean region and to use all available resources at the bilateral and multilateral levels in light of the Euro-Mediterranean ministerial meeting that is set to begin today in Tunis on the future of the textile sector. This meeting will center on examining the status of the textile sector in this region and the means to ensure that it is kept up-to-date with recent developments, and specifically on considering the execution of the polyfiber agreements.
The larger share
Up until yesterday, the Progressive Democratic Party (PDP) had received only 6 receipts for the districts of Ariana, Zaghouan, Sfax I,  Kasserine, Sidi Bu Zid and Gafsa.
For their part, the "Democratic Initiative" and the Renewal Movement were able to receive only 6 out of a total of 26 lists that the "Initiative" had submitted within the legal deadlines, and those final receipts pertain to the districts of Gafsa, Siliana, Bin Arous, Bizerte,  Kasserine and Northern Sfax.
It is expected that the roster of candidates in the legislative elections will be finalized by tomorrow Wednesday, the twenty-four of this September , which is the final deadline for submission of candidacies and receipts according to the Electoral Law.
The lack of funding prevents the activation of programs concerning the Arab family
The problems of the Arab family
In his discussion about the status of the family in Tunisia in comparison to the Arab countries, Mr. Mounsef Ben Ibrahim emphasized that Tunisia is considered a pioneer and has made strides in family planning and social care for about 40 years, based on statistics that show that services for mothers and infants are available in about 95% of basic health care centers. Health care supervision of pregnancy is 90%, while post pregnancy care is about 55%. Coverage rates for pregnancy methods exceed 65.5%, and reproductive behavior among Tunisian families is now based on the principle of family planning and birth spacing.
Dubai (AFP)- Five workers were killed and 12 others injured yesterday in an accident involving the collapse of a wall under construction in the expansion of Dubai International Airport, as reported in a statement by the Civil Aviation Department, a copy of which was obtained by Agence France Presse.
The President of the Department of Civil Aviation in Dubai, Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum, described the accident as "a tragedy for all of us", and expressed his condolences to the families of the worker victims.
The child and the donkey
There is no doubt that the assassination of Izzedine Al Khalil in the Syrian capital Damascus following open Israeli threats is not the first, nor will it certainly be the last of its kind. Perhaps, the similar crimes that took place over decades of occupation, from London to Athens, and from Beirut to Amman and Hamam Al Shatt, in addition to what has happened and continues to happen in Gaza and the Strip, confirm the insistence by various successive Israeli leaders on adopting a consistent policy of not only ignoring the legitimate international resolutions, but also calling for mocking and scorning them.
Perhaps, in the image of this Palestinian child whose parents had to carry him to the hospital on the back of a donkey to save his life, after he was hit by shrapnel from an Israeli bomb and after the occupation forces closed all the paths in front of them and prevented them from entering the hospital to be treated, one finds the confirmation that there remains hope generation after generation...
The starting point for the investigation of the matter was a statement submitted by a Tunisian girl to the security officials at Al Murazaqa reporting that she had met a tourist from a European country and agreed to marry him after his conversion to Islam.
As a first step, the aforementioned passport was handed to the technical units at the National Security Administration in the Nabeul District to uncover the evidence of fraud before they agreed to look for the suspect who appears to have found it difficult to accompany his future wife to his country in a legal fashion for lack of time and because of the many procedures to follow in this matter.

And to put into effect what the President allowed in his decisions during the meeting of the Supreme Judicial Council on August 10, 2004, two decrees were recently issued aiming at improving the status of judges, and this is in the context of keeping with a greater provision of care that is worthy of the standing of a judge, and so that the judges can devote themselves to carrying out their duties in the best possible way.
This measure was part of a series of measures announced by the President of the Republic and the President of the Supreme Judicial Council last August 10, and these measures included:
- Review the Penal Procedures Code with the goal of adding a report by a psychologist to the file of every repeat offender to be considered at the trial.
The courts at all levels have also witnessed an improvement in their system of notification at a cost of approximately 5 million dinars, focusing on the set up of 1,400 computer terminals, all used to store case files and judgments, as well as data for use by attorneys and litigants.
Is the era of the kindergarten satisfied with toys and swings coming to an end?
Regardless of the evidence of the coverage index, which requires more support and drive to win the quantitative challenge and spread the services of child care institutions to the largest possible number of our children, this did not eliminate the need to be concerned with the how. In addition, we must diagnose the status of the services provided and evaluate their quality and their ability to meet the needs of today's child, desiring what is better and providing a more effective framework for budding youngsters to grow in an environment that can nurture them and direct their talents and capabilities.
The owners of 860 kindergartens were given deadlines to fix their situations with a notification from the concerned authorities to shut down close to 100 chaotic kindergartens, while 97 institution owners chose to immediately shut down of their own volition.
This is a question that begs itself after we heard the speech by the Minister of Women's and Children's Affairs at the opening session of the National Panel that began its proceedings yesterday on the topic of "Education in Early Childhood", and in which she stated that the needs of today's children have changed...

The Center of Information Science for Handicapped Children is one such pioneering initiative in Tunis.
This center offers education sessions for the benefit of the handicapped children in the area of multimedia computing and modern communications, in addition to developing the abilities of the handicapped children in programming and documentation and strengthening their skills in the area of modern technologies.
In response to a question about the pedagogical programs that are adopted by the center for the education of the handicapped child, Miss Rim Tbini, a speech therapy specialist and in charge of relations with organizations, says, "The programs we follow in educating handicapped children are programs prepared by the center and they consist of educational units. The center determines the educational unit that is appropriate for each child and according to his or her mental and physical abilities. Upon enrolling at the center, each child is subjected to a test aimed at evaluating the child's physical and mental abilities, and the child progresses through the educational units until he or she is able to complete an individual project using multimedia informatics."

What is the status of the project for setting up these parking in order to reduce the pressure controlling the traffic into the capital?
Because of this characteristic feature, the transportation flow that links the area to the capital is very thick and requires continual frequency, especially during the morning and evening rush hours.  Many citizens praised the present transportation flow but expressed in telephone interviews the need to better organize it, especially with respect to the subway during the morning hours.
Tunis - As-Sabah. The phenomenon of inflation is a "disease" that chokes any economy, irrespective of its development, and limits its growth.
Economic schools of thought have differed in their analysis of this phenomenon. The British economist "Keynes" and his followers believe that a moderate rate of inflation can in fact stimulate the economy, which is a "short-term analysis" according to Keynes since a rise in wages will increase consumption, which in turn leads to an absorption of production and therefore encourage investments and contribute to a reduction of unemployment.
The second consists in controlling the money supply such that it is compatible with the size of goods and services that are being traded in the market in order to achieve that stabilization.
Many researchers find the difficulty in choosing between the two strategies exciting.  Some find that the only difference between the policies taken is in the choice of the appropriate timing to pay the cost of inflation stabilization, namely on the short term with respect to the first strategy and on the long term with respect to the second strategy.
Professionals discuss solutions for surviving in the face of China
The conference focused on three principal avenues that aim at liberating the competitive capacity of the textile and clothing industry and support solidarity and partnership between the region's countries, and these are the competitive capacity, the business climate, investments, competition, fair trade and opposing illegal practices, in addition to the avenue of partnerships, regional production, and the development of exchange programs such that the sector's exports from countries of the southern bank of the Mediterranean to the European Union represent 50% of all exports from these countries. This makes the industry play a vital role in attracting direct investments between the countries of the region, and as result, in supporting partnerships and regional integration, considering that the industry currently provides 4 million immediate jobs in the southern Mediterranean countries and about 3 million jobs in 25 countries that are members of the European  Union, while Tunisia is ranked as 6th  on the list of exporters to those countries, after China, Turkey, Romania, and followed by Morocco in the 7th position.
Movie Director Taieb Louhichi
And recently, "Dance of the Wind"...
* You returned to permanently settle in Tunisia...
It is necessary for the director to review his creative life and wonder about how to continue producing, given the personal, production and economic factors, as well as the general predominant view of the cinema in our countries, which has resulted in the cancellation of many movie projects. Since 1994, I never received any assistance from the sponsoring authority until I completed the film "Dance of the Wind".
The producer has to have the courage to present a different presentation of the subject.. We have to give a different image to the cinema that has its special characteristics..
Dream is the most important thing in our life and it is essential and the only means to go on living in these terrible times..
"Dance of the Wind" is a creative biography more so than an autobiography.. And if it were autobiographical, I would have split it with the director who plays the role and also with all the other directors who live through this suffering.
The most beautiful space for the movies of Taieb Louhichi .. All directors have shot in the desert.. It is a beautiful space for the imagination, and I am not hiding a secret by saying that I have an artistic score that needs to be settled with the desert as a space...

In Nabeul, He Fires a Shot... and Causes Himself a Disaster
Security agents were sent to the hospital where they took a statement from the wounded individual after his medical condition had stabilized. He indicated that as he was taking a walk near Tabiet Hindi, a village located in the vicinity of Bi'r Chlouf in the region of Nabeul, a man suddenly shot at him and wounded him in a sensitive area of his body.
Further investigations led them to identify some other suspects and the number of arrests totaled 10, all of whom confessed to the charges against them.  Each one specified the role he played in the incident. It is expected that they will be referred in the next few days to the judicial authorities.

Tunis - As-Sabah: The Ministry of Justice and Human Rights has set up a special program that aims to establish a communications administration whose function is to bring justice closer to litigants and to the legal community in general. This administration consists of creating an Internet portal for Justice and Human Rights, which offers legal services to the citizens at a distance, in addition to posting jurisprudence and legal interpretation on-line. This portal will enable its visitors to learn about the laws and judicial institutions through a number of hubs such as the judicial map which will soon be announced in the courts.

"They treated us with respect and apologized to us before releasing us"
Her companion in detention, Simona Torretta, said, "They treated us with a lot of respect and dignity".
And two Iraqi women hostages were with them in the beginning before they were transferred to another place a few days later.
One of them said, "Our captors taught us the principles of Islam and offered us their apologies and asked for our forgiveness", adding that they offered her a box of sweets before releasing them.

A mediator confirms the two Frenchmen to be released soon
Brett told Agence France Presse , "I met the two hostages and their release is certain beyond doubt".
A spokeswoman for the Ministry, Marie Masdupuy, said, "We are not aware of any agreement concerning the release of the hostages".
The hostage appeared dressed in an orange garment and in a deplorable condition inside an iron cage with, in the background, the flag of the Unity and Jihad Group that is headed by the Jordanian AbuMusab al-Zarqawi .
Bigley also called on Blair to work for the release of Iraqi women prisoners.

Yemen
The suicide attack on the destroyer in the port of Aden in the south of Yemen on October 12, 2000 killed 17 US military personnel, and the leader of the Al-Qaeda organization, Osama Bin Laden, claimed responsibility for the attack at the time.
Maamoun Ahmed Answa (30 years old) was sentenced to an 8-year prison sentence on charges of contributing to "falsifying official documents for the suicide bombers" who executed the attack, Ibrahim Al-Thawr and Hassan Al-Khameri.
For his part, Khaled Al-Qasei, the brother of the third accused individual, said that he will request an appeal to his brother's sentence.
For the Second Time In Three Months:
He added that security forces have arrested "in the context of this criminal plan" a number of individuals in Nouakchott, among whom is Captain Abderrahman Ould Mini who was the mastermind behind the coup attempt of June 2003, in addition to his civilian and military partners who were going to participate "in a criminal act of destruction and deal a blow to security and the regime".
He further said that these weapons were to be used in executing "the criminal plan" this week.
One of the officers of the National Guard in the region of Doulouiya, 30 kilometers south of Samarra, said that 13 members of the Iraqi National Guard gave their resignations because the American forces ignored our opinions and what we had to say.
Other soldiers who submitted their resignations blamed the American forces for the deterioration of security conditions in the city because of their siege around it and their headquartering themselves in the police station located in the city center, which led to cutting off the main road in the city and the side streets surrounding the police station.
Tunis- As-Sabah - The Tunisiana company paid its second and last installment on the value of the license or concession that enables it to become the second operator of digital mobile phones in Tunisia and the first operator in the private sector. The value of the installment is $247 million after the company had made a first installment payment in 2002 of $227 million. For the occasion, Tunisiana held a press conference to provide information on what has been accomplished in terms of the company's horizons, in the presence of Mr. Mohamed Fethi Houidi, Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Mr. Jean-Pierre Roland, General Director.
Mobile phones and their impact on health
As-Sabah Investigation * Service taxis ("Limos")
Many issues have been the subject of much debate. A vicious circle spinning around itself. The number of licenses is greater and thus there are more cars, which has led to the inability of the stations to contain all the cars. That was also a reason for taking crooked measures to provide work opportunities in order to close that circle of unlimited problems.
A chaotic situation ... indescribable
They do not acknowledge the system of registering at stations or exit permits or any... The means are numerous and the goal is one but the causes are quite numerous.
The sector has become a focus for absolutely anyone.
The lack of space was an important point mentioned by almost everyone and in the various stations. The Bab Saadoun station is slated for a change and a transfer to a bigger, more comfortable location. But the transfer has not yet occurred and even the new space has not yet been equipped, which adds to the bewilderment of the professionals especially since the rainy season is coming.
"There needs to be a large, equipped station in the capital".
What is shameful is that there isn't in the capital an equipped station that meets all the conditions for the comfort of passengers and car owners and all parties. This has led to the spread of uncivilized conduct and to the appearance of snack vendors inside the station whose products are consumed by the passengers who do not realize that these snacks are mixed with poisonous substances from car exhaust emissions."
Mr. Jamal Al-Matoussi (Beja line) says: "On any day, I may carry five or six passengers, then take a break and the average wait - and this has become normal - lasts nine full hours. Sometimes I wait even longer than that and the day goes by and I don't make any income". Another car owner (Talat Line) interrupts, saying "I can go for three days without work ... There are too many licenses and the opportunities are becoming fewer. It may be better to look for another way to make a living.." Mr. Hamadi Hamrouni says, "I wait for my turn for 10 hours and it may never come, and I return to Sfax empty.. The "bandits" have destroyed the dignity of this profession and the worst part of this is that we pay the city 20 dinars per month, and my day's services are fixed, and we get no services, except an ill-equipped space. What we have to put up with is indescribable".
The decision about passengers drop off spot is a very unfair one.
One of us, a car owner, dropped off a blind man. The penalty cost him several other passengers.
This question also was of concern to almost all the professionals.. Mr. Mouncef Al-Zaouaoui put it forward, saying, "I want to ask the authorities what benefit there is in defining the route of travel. What is the benefit for a "Limo" whose destination is Sfax to go through Grombalia or Sousse or other places.. and any violator has to pay a 300-dinar ticket and his car will be seized for three days..". This a decision that, in the opinion of most of those involved, was marginal and could be overlooked.
Tunis- As-Sabah. With the growing importance of the "Science of Fitness and Ergonomics" in modern studies of the causes behind work-related accidents and workplace safety, the Faculty of Medicine in Monastir will, for the first time in Tunisia, Africa and the Arab world, create a program of studies at the level of the  third stage in the specialized field of ergonomics, beginning December 2, 2004. This specialized master's degree program aims at supporting the functions of the workplace physician, the safety engineer and all those involved in the sector of prevention, in order to improve healthy maintenance conditions and workplace safety.

Today Is The Opening Of The Twentieth Session Of The Carthage Film Festival
Also, tonight's ceremony is not like previous opening ceremonies...
This film festival has succeeded in establishing a presence in the Arab world, Africa and worldwide and has become, through the years and the sessions, an authority to be seriously reckoned with by directors, producers and the rest of those involved in making movies. Considering that the winner of an award at the Carthage Film Festival indeed wins an audience and attracts people's attention. We will not mention names so we do not unnecessarily repeat them, but there is not one Arab or African moviemaker who, in one way or another, did not begin from this festival. Let us not forget that this demonstration has honored many an Arab, African and international celebrity who feels today that this honor is akin to receiving a big award. And if we were to read the autobiographies of some of the big Arab and African moviemakers, we would undoubtedly find a mention of their passage through the Carthage Film Festival...
that believe in private affairs and work to establish a true dialogue between peoples in order to prevent the collision of civilizations being planned by the big companies in the United States, which cannot maintain their strategic depth in the world without forcing all cultures to their knees and diluting them in the interest of business and the economy in general...
And Tunisia welcomes all of them...

Acts of violence and unrest continued to intensify in Iraq just a few weeks before US presidential elections in November and four months before Iraqi elections scheduled for January. The number of attacks on American Forces has increased to about 80 attacks yesterday compared to 40 attacks a month ago. An officer in the American Army said that resistance fighters had detonated three cars filled with explosives in an attack south of Baghdad that targeted an American military convoy.
They mentioned that about 140 people were injured, most of them children who were hit by shrapnel. Local residents said that a ceremony for the inauguration of a new water and sewer station was taking place when the explosions occurred.
Abu Ghraib is located ten kilometers west of Baghdad and became notorious for the prison in which American soldiers violated the rights of Iraqi prisoners. In the north of Iraq, another car filled with explosives was detonated near an Iraqi police convoy in Tell A'afer, which is a stronghold for the resistance near the Syrian border.
School Massacres Move To Argentina
The spokesman said that the students told the police that their fellow student had entered the premises without saying a single word, then began shooting from a 9-millimeter pistol, and that they hid under the seats.
The incident caused many controversies on the issue of the increasing violence in schools in Argentina, which was considered one of the safest countries in South America.
French radio station "France Info" reported that an armed group consisting of 20 Jewish extremists carried out a raid on this bookstore located in the center of Paris and proceeded to beat up the participants with bats and tear gas bombs, which resulted in injuries to 7 people. The writer Alain Soral, however, was unharmed.
This attack comes at a time when Jewish organizations have launched a campaign in which they claim that the Jews in France are facing increasing anti-Semitic attacks, which however turned out to be false and fabricated.
Ramallah (News Agencies) - Palestinian members of Parliament said that members of Parliament who are angry at the failure of the Palestinian leadership to implement reforms are determined to call for a vote of no confidence that could lead to the fall of the government that was appointed by Palestinian president Yasser Arafat.
Palestinian sources said that Qurei had, over the past weeks, boycotted the meetings of the Central Committee of the Fatah Movement and the meetings of the National Security Council in protest over the stalling by Arafat in approving the decisions for reforms, in particular those reforms in the security apparatus and in meeting the Egyptian demands.
Those pressures are being applied by the Quartet committee, led by the United States and Europe, as well as other parties led by Egypt.

Meanwhile, police officers issued a search warrant in the affair in order to uncover the main motives and causes that led the young man to commit suicide.
After a period of time, one of his relatives noticed his body hanging from the telephone pole, which triggered the security and judicial investigations to uncover the mystery behind this young man's suicide.
A mobile unit of the National Navy succeeded in thwarting an attempt at an illegal border crossing in international waters during the night between last Wednesday and Thursday. The crew arrested ten Tunisian illegal immigrants who were on their way to Sicily in the Italian south.
They also said that they had agreed with an organizer of illegal sea trips to smuggle them, each paying him one thousand dinars, and they gathered at the agreed time near the shore of Kerbat before the trip began and they were subsequently arrested.

No need for panic
82% of consumers do not have the necessary equipment to handle this type of commerce.
And are the means that are required by these types of exchanges readily available to everyone?
And even if some of the other statistical data shows the beginning of an awareness of the importance of electronic exchanges at the present time, particularly since 58% of respondents to the survey, which dealt with consumers, view paying bills on-line as appropriate for this kind of exchange and about 43% see that administrative services can be delivered by these means to gain time and eliminate the crowdedness and waiting associated with obtaining them directly, there is still ignorance by the citizen as to the required steps needed to carry out these operations and also much of the lack of necessary equipment can stand in the way of benefiting from on-line exchange services.

The bodies of two children and a woman were removed from the rubble of one of the houses in the area.
Arafat Urges The World To Stop Israel's "Racist Crimes":
Nine Palestinians were martyred earlier in the Strip in clashes with the Israeli occupation forces, four of whom had carried out an infiltration operation from the Gaza Strip into an Israeli area.
Among the martyrs, three were affiliated with the "Al-Quds Brigades", which is the military wing of the Palestinian movement, Jihad,, and four were from the "Qassam Phalanxes" affiliated with the resistance movement (Hamas).
Reports indicate that the Israeli military operation focused on the Jabaliya camp and Beit Lahia aims at the elimination of the activists of the Hamas movement in particular and the end of the firing of Qassam rockets.
A call from Arafat to the world
Yesterday, the Palestinian government had for its part declared the "state of emergency" throughout the Palestinian occupied territories and demanded the intervention of the international community.
He added that the state of emergency "means that the basic ministries of health, instruction, education, energy and electricity continue to operate around the clock in addition to the operations of the other ministries".

A Letter From America
About 25 museums in Washington alone...
I conveyed my observation to the historical expert of the museum who was busy showing us the chief artifacts of the museum, except that our guide, after delivering to us those historical facts for which he was previously skillful and confident, became embarrassed at this observation and hesitated in answering before concluding "that this map is old and has not been changed in ten years...!"
We discovered this same behavior when we met the most prominent editor at the New York Times newspaper where a female editing manager, in answer to our question whether the newspaper was biased towards Israel in its handling of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and in defending at the same time our implied accusations, replied, "Jewish readers of the newspaper threatened about three years ago to boycott the newspaper and cancel their subscription because they accused us of bias towards the Palestinian cause and sympathy to Arafat..."

Sorry, I apologize for not providing you with services at this time or for the dispenser's lack of connection to the network or for the unavailability of the requested amount at this time. These are some of the excuses that the mellow gentleman, the official spokesman for the automatic dispenser, will offer you. However, we should not expect to see and hear such apologies as we work to improve the service-oriented nature of all institutions, particularly at bank branches within the Republic but also far from the capital. Many people resort to these services in emergency situations that require them to obtain sufficient financial liquidity at that very time, not to mention that these are pre-paid services and banking institutions charge fixed fees on a periodical basis and for every withdrawal activity. Why is it then that the quality of services cannot be proportionate to the many thousands of dinars that banks charge in exchange for financial services.

Huge quantities of bananas
The volumes of stored milk have reached 38 million liters, of which 10 million liters were released to the market during the back-to-school season. In order to cover the needs of the market, 2 million liters will be imported for a period after the month of fasting, as it is expected that 600 tons of butter will be imported in addition to the current reserves estimated at 250 tons in order to avoid all emergencies which may arise. Also, a program has been put in place for the storage of quantities of fish to be put at the disposal of the public.
Contact Lenses
The requirements of the age
It seems, unfortunately, that many female fans of the lenses do not know how to use them. Being medical and health items,  their use requires them to be maintained and cleaned in a specific way and with special medicine, in addition to the fact that not all lenses can be placed in a sensitive location like the eye since these lenses have to be of a certain quality and subject to several international specifications and not like those lenses that can be purchased for 10 dinars and end up causing serious problems like fungi, allergies and redness in the white of the eye. This is particularly so if they are not reserved for individual use, which increases the likelihood of an infection from one person to another. What is strange in this matter is that beyond the artificial and deceiving appearances the trend can lead some to overlook the "multicolored" health consequences of using cheap powders and lenses and subsequently pay an exorbitant tax on beauty.
I welcome the suggestion for Ilham Shaheen... But!
Commenting on earlier statements by Egyptian actress Ilham Shaheen, concerning her desire to have the lead role in a big screen movie directed by Taieb Louhichi, he said, why not a work like this on condition that there is a character that matches her personality and I see that a joint production will facilitate this mission.. It is worth noting that Taieb Louhichi will be present at the twentieth session of the Carthage Film Festival in the context of the "Panorama" section with his film "Dance of the Wind", which tells the story of Youssef who is preparing a film and sets about selecting locations for shooting in the Tunisian south. When his car breaks down, he finds himself alone in the heart of an unknown place and his car becomes his only source of information to identify his location. Youssef then settles in a temporary shelter and continues thinking about his movie, while his assistant and script writer go looking for him so they give the viewer the opportunity to discover many decors, and they live scenes that the director imagine at the same time.
Gaza (News Agencies) - The Israeli aggression against several areas in the northern part of the Gaza Strip entered its successive sixth day yesterday, leaving more Palestinian martyrs and wounded and large scale destruction that comprised tens of houses in the Jabaliya Camp, Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun.
Their assassination came hours after the martyrdom of two field commanders in the Palestinian Resistance Movement (Hamas), Mahdi Mushtaha and Khaled Al- Amreiti , in a raid launched by Israeli Apache helicopter gun ships on their car the night before last in one of the neighborhoods of Gaza City.
These developments come at the same time that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon announced yesterday the continuation of military operations in northern Gaza and the establishment of a security belt there.
Palestinian warning
Erakat also considered "that Sharon's objective is to destroy the Palestinian Authority and destroy the institutions of the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the institutions of the Palestinian people because he wants to re-occupy the Gaza Strip... after converting it into a big prison with forty percent of the West Bank inside the walls.
Intensified American raids on Falluja.. and cautious calm in Samarra after two days of fighting
A statement by the American Army announced that "a large number" of armed militants were killed in the attack.
Another building was blown up on the evening of the day before yesterday in the suburbs of Falluja and was claimed by the American Army to shelter between 10 and 15 fighters who had confirmed earlier to have undergone training of a military nature there.
American and Iraqi forces say that they are trying to uproot members of Shiite leader Muqtada Al-Sadr's Mahdi Army.
And a spokesman for the American Army in Iraq described the situation in the city as great, adding " the city had been living in a state of lawlessness for the past several months".
In this regard, the Saudi magazine "Ash-Sharq Al-Awsat" reported in its issue published yesterday, citing Dr. Bushra Jamil from the Health Education Section of the Iraqi Ministry of Health, that "some families have refrained from vaccinating their children as a result of lingering fear in their minds about the contamination of any vaccine offered by international companies even though these companies are certified by the World Health Organization".
He confirmed that 5 million doses were donated by the UNICEF organization bearing a 2-year expiration date and others donated by the French company Pasteur, which is one of the finest vaccine manufacturing companies and certified by the World Health Organization. On this basis, there is no fear of vaccination, especially since this vaccine is administered orally and in several doses.
For his part, Dr. Nabil Ibrahim, from the Section of Epidemics Monitoring at the Ministry of Health, said that January 28, 2003 was a historic day for Iraqis because Iraq was now considered free of polio. However, experts at the World Health Organization could not come because of reasons connected with security, and he pointed that the Ministry had taken a series of measures to send retired physicians with experience and expertise to attend a training session in Egypt so they could come to Iraq and conduct a verification and inspection to declare Iraq free of polio since the last registered case was 4 years ago.
But the minister did not specify the measures recommended by those attending the meeting and the state of alert was raised around airports, harbors, train tunnels, strategic and military buildings, embassies, hotels, tourist resorts and markets.
Norway participated in the bombardment operations in Afghanistan but opposed the American war on Iraq.
After The Arrest Of A Moroccan Family Suspected Of Ties To "Terrorism":
The same source added that the investigating judge in the city of Rotterdam decided to keep him in jail and not divulge any information about him in order to protect the secrecy of the investigations.
The incident caused a state of tremendous anger among members of the Moroccan community in Holland who considered the incident to be an insult to all Moroccans residing in Holland.
The night before last, nine more deaths were reported, five in the hospital and four in new confrontations according to a police source.
Twenty people were injured in two explosions in Gossaigaon and Baska in western Assam, according to the same source that did not provide further details.
The troubles began on the morning of the day before yesterday with three powerful simultaneous explosions, which shook the bus station and two markets in Dimapur, the commercial center of the state of Nagaland and caused the death of 28 people.
The Nagaland authorities blamed the attacks on separatist rebels who seek through this to halt the ongoing peace process in this agricultural state of 2 million inhabitants.
In a statement published yesterday, the "National Democratic Front of Bodoland" claimed responsibility for the shooting acts in Assam, specifying that they represent "evidence of our strength".
Girl held by 4 perverts
Details of the incident indicate that a married woman went to the security station in her neighborhood in the past few days accompanied by her daughter and she submitted a complaint in which she revealed that her companion was the victim of a kidnapping and assault operation by 4 perverts.
But the suspects insisted on their demand and he had no alternative but to leave, abandoning his friend to the evil ones, and he left the place for fear of being assaulted, especially considering the uneven balance of power to the advantage of his opponents.

The case file documents reveal that a student in a primary school in the city of Sfax went with members of his family to one of the cities in the province of Mahdia and late one night the boy fell victim to a kidnapping at the hands of a drunk, but luckily for him, some neighbors witnessed the event and saved the boy from the unknown fate that awaited him.

Within sight of citizens and attorneys and others who were present at the Palace of Justice on Bab-El-Banat Street in the capital, a young man who works as an attorney's clerk attacked an attorney who is one of the most venerated in the legal profession in Tunis. This led to the intervention of the authorities in charge and to the arrest of the "clerk" who beat up a colleague of the lawyer for whom he worked - according to eyewitnesses.
The matter does not seem easy, particularly since one of the officials of the Tunis branch of the Bar Association asserted to us that "what happened is a precedent that never happened before and no lawyer has ever been subjected to this behavior by the clerk of another lawyer", adding that "skirmishes typically happen between some lawyers and court clerks, but we are not accustomed to hearing of this deed".

A Sea Disaster In The Territorial Waters Of Tunisia
Tunis- As-Sabah: 22 persons died and 42 more were missing. 11 persons were rescued, among them was one Tunisian in a boat crash Sunday evening, the day before yesterday. The incident occurred in Tunisian territorial waters. The boat had 75 illegal immigrants on board, among them were 5 Tunisians.
With continued search by the National Navy Patrol and the National Guard of the area of Jahawiyyah, Nabeul, Monastir and Sousse, and one of the helicopters which later joined the search effort in the area of the crash, it was possible to pick 22 bodies of illegal immigrants before they were examined in the presence of the judicial authority of Sousse's primary court. The bodies were taken to the Sahlool university hospital morgue for examination to verify the cause of death and determine their identities.
On the date agreed, they gathered in a forest in the town of Shatt Mariam before they boarded the boat that was to take them to the Italian island of Lampedusa. Because of the boat's small size and the large number of passengers, the boat split into 2 parts causing 64 people to drown. 22 of the bodies were found and the rest are considered missing. 11 persons were rescued and arrested pending investigation and interrogation that was started by the squad and the Sousse National Guard.
Tunis-As-Sabah. On Sunday afternoon, the day before yesterday, investigators of the judicial police squad of the national security of the Hammamet district uncovered an attempt to cross the borders stealthily near the coast of Sidi al-Mahrisi between the cities of Nabeul and Hammamet. They arrested 126 illegal Moroccan immigrants while they were getting ready to secretly participate in a boat trip towards the Sicily district in South Italy. They confiscated a boat and other equipments.
The preliminary information collected revealed that 126 persons arrested have entered our country illegally. Some have settled in the province of Sousse while the others have settled in the province of Naples, to participate in a smuggling operation to Italy by sea.
We know that the regional intelligence agents of the National Security in "Sidi Al-Bashir" uncovered a number of Moroccan young men who, it seems, were preparing to participate in a clandestine sea journey. They arrested approximately 25 Moroccans in a popular hostel in "Bab Al-Jazeera" in the capital, and brought them to the area's police station.
By bringing them to the police station, it was confirmed, according to the initial information that they, actually, were planning to take part in a clandestine border crossing operation departing from one of the coastal areas' beaches. Legal procedures are expected to be taken against them.

In The Official Contest, The Movie "In The Empty City" (Angola)
There are only a few scenes whereby we see soldiers in their military uniform observing the degree to which the curfew is being followed indicating that the country is in war. We discover the capital Luanda through the eyes of a child called "Indala", an orphan from a village called "Bili".
He believed that this way he could go back to his town to see his parents in the sky.
The director did not need to present scenes of the civil war since the wreckage such wars leave behind is known and not difficult to imagine.
You don't see residents of this widespread city; only some women and men for the purpose of dialogue in the movie, in reference to the spread of moral deviation.  But the director mostly finds an excuse for the film's characters which seem to be deviant or in bad spirit.
Then with much mildness, the director leads us slowly to the tragic end of the movie where the child "Indala" ends up a killer and a victim. This happened after his innocence was taken advantage of and he was used in an assault operation that ended in a tragedy.
Defying International Calls To Stop Aggression
According to the last official Palestinian toll, the number of martyrs since the Israeli aggression on Jabalia refugee camp started has climbed to 76 martyrs and more than 275 wounded, the majority of whom were children and civilians.
A few hours before that, the Israeli tank had showered the body of a young Palestinian man in his twenties by its fire. He was walking, as per eyewitnesses, a few meters away from Israeli tanks. The witness added that the occupying force left him bleeding for 30 minutes before allowing medical teams to get near him.
Two Palestinian rockets were fired at the Israeli town of Sederot. One female settler was wounded. Eye witnesses said that one rocket landed near a college and the other near a sports club.
In its emergency meeting in Ramallah, the Palestinian Legislative Council has called upon all the Palestinian parties and forces to cut the road on all the Israeli plans, and no to give Israelis the excuse to continue their aggression. This is considered a concealed request to stop firing the rocket on the Israeli south.

The Egyptian spokesman was talking at the end of a meeting with the Egyptian President, Hosni Mubarak, and the Deputy Foreign Minister of Nigeria, Abu Baker Tanko and Said Eraiby, the envoy of the Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, who is also the Secretary General of the African Union.
The peace agreement, that was supposedly due to be signed in August or September, stipulates equal sharing of the oil resources between the south and the central government.

The prosecution has inspected the place and bodies of the drowned in the presence of the security authorities. The bodies were then removed and taken to the forensic lab in the Shalool university hospital for examination and to determine the identities of the bodies and the reason of death.

The expansion of the fund's jurisdictions and its interventions.
So what are the most prominent features of the law and what are the developments that the fund's activity is going to witness based on this new law?
Activation of the fund's role by developing its legislations.
But the recent developments that the housing sector has witnessed, whether at the level of infrastructure that benefits from the fund's grants in its previous form or financing mechanisms, have forced the reconsideration of the assigned tasks and to change its name to become "the national fund for residence improvement" instead of the "national fund for housing improvement", as well as clarify its fields of intervention and define it. And to control how to participate in financing programs and operations that individuals or public organizations carry out under the umbrella of preserving the old housing stock which relies on improving housing conditions so that it will be compatible with the changes whether at the level of infrastructure that used to benefit from the fund's grants or financing mechanisms.
Financing the completion of buildings that are prone to collapse as it relates to tearing them down, removing the rubble, temporarily re-housing families that occupy it, in face of the spread of such a phenomenon in old neighborhoods which became a threat to the safety of residents.

Second: The increase of profits and the competitive capabilities for establishments by having more flexibility in dealing and facilitating the transfer of technology. What is noticeable from this perspective (that of competition) is that "Ittisalat Tunis" now dominates the market with about 5.2 million subscribers, given that it is a leading company (a historical employer) versus 880 thousand subscribers to "Tunisiana" which falls next in line.

Tunis - As-Sabah - Tourism in Tunisia is essentially tourism of the sun, the sea, the beaches and the fair weather and on a lesser scale it is the tourism of the desert which is distinctively represented by the famous camel on the postage stamps. However, the obvious question here is why has ecological or environmental tourism not yet entered the system of Tunisian tourism?
And considering what Tunisia possesses in infrastructure and its distinctive image, it will be the destination of the tourist coming for its sun and sea and also of the tourist who loves the magic of its forest and mountains.
Jendouba province: the capital of ecological tourism with distinction.
He also mentioned that in the realm of the promotion of the environmental tourism, some specialists in marketing tourism for this product were hosted this past year and that while all this proved beneficial during this season, the demand remained relatively modest.
In The Official Competition
The film "Gate of the Throne" by the director Moukhtar Lajimi which represents Tunisia in the official competition of the current round of the Carthage Film Festival is of the "incoming film" type. Its producer, Moukhtar Lajimi who graduated from the Institute of Higher Cinematographic Studies in France where he resides permanently, has never previously produced long narrative films and all that is accredited to him is a group of documentary films and his film "Gate of the Throne" is his first long narrative film.
In fact, other scenes and details in the film "Gate of the Throne" make the observer use the description of "incoming films" for this type of Tunisian films that are done by Tunisian directors who usually live in the west.
The film "Gate of the Throne" whose main actors are Mohamed Ali Bin Goma, Fathi El-Hadawi, Mohammed Driss and Zehira Ben Ammar, even if the director tried at the scenario level to include some ideas that succeed to promote freedom and individual freedoms, seems to be a humble film in its form and contents and the way the film is. It most probably made the Tunisian cinema lose one of two possible opportunities for prizes that were to be given to it during the current round of the Carthage Film Festival, considering that the Tunisian cinema entered the official competition for long movies with the film "Gate of the Throne" on one hand and the "'A Man's Word on the other.
And my next movie will be with Hind Sabri.

In parallel with this, officials of the provincial area of the National Guard in Bizerte continued to search for the other two missing ones whose fate remains unknown until this hour. Further investigations with the other participants continued concerning the organizing of this illegal trip and the identity of the organizer and the amounts of money they paid him and if it was not a joint organization as some dreamers of secret emigration to Europe have done, despite the many tragedies resulting from the "death trips"

Representative Mu'awiyah al-Masri (Independent) from the Nablus province, said to France Press Agency, "There is a memorandum that was presented to the Legislative Council that has the signatures of 25 representatives demanding a withdrawal of confidence from the government."
Ahmad al-Deek said, "There was a mistake in blaming President Arafat, because the party responsible for carrying out the reforms and implementing the Council's decisions is the government headed by Qurei and not Arafat."
Occupied Jerusalem (News Agencies): Israel went back and withdrew its allegations yesterday regarding the use of ambulances of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for Palestinian refugees to carry weapons in the Gaza Strip where the Israeli forces are launching an campaign against the Palestinians and this made the agency demand an apology.
And the ambulance driver, Wail Jabareen denied the Israeli allegations and said, "Such a thing could not have happened with us.
Fred Eckhart, spokesman for the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, said last Monday that Annan will start an investigation and ask for clarifications from Israel about the allegations that ambulances were used to transport Palestinian weapons.
Israel arrests 13 of the UN employees and accuses them of terrorism.
These detainees are persons from the United Nations who have been accused of being involved in terrorist activities.

Tunis- "As-Sabah": Despite the procedures taken since the end of last year to avert the phenomenon of selling "adulterated" bleach that does not conform to the specifications, this phenomenon in fact still exists. Violations in this area are many, not to mention the fact that some distributors and traders do not hesitate to sell this dangerous substance on the side of the road without regard to health restrictions. The consumer buys this product even though it does not conform to the applicable specifications and provisions.
T." in the production of bleach and no other company. It is required that these distributors obtain a numbered notebook, signed and stamped by the provincial department of trade.

All companies are prohibited from handling, stocking and marketing liquid bleach without casing, or if it does not have the national seal of conformity. This applies to all means of distribution, including the portable wagons used by street sellers.
When butchers protest against fixing prices of meat?!
By looking closely at these movements, we discovered that it was only a tempest in a teacup. The butchers in preparation for Ramadan have obtained a large number of sheep and heads of cattle to be slaughtered successively during Ramadan at the slaughterhouse, and because of the fixed price agreed with the National Chamber for Butchers, those who were hoping for massive profit found themselves "slinking away." And so, they promoted the "spoiled imported meat" and tried to make a commotion to be exploited for their benefit. However, rules were made to be obeyed, the public's benefit is there to be preserved and the consumer's rights to be protected. There is no way that a group becomes rich at the expense of the residents of a whole city.
Based on the compiled chart of grants, the money could be spent on: demolishing primitive housing (grant), maintenance, renovation, improvement and sanitation, (grant or loan), fitting necessary facilities for housing (loan), demolitions (loan), improving conditions (loan or grant), improving and refurbishing buildings (loan or grant), repair housing struck by natural disasters (loan).
Five months have passed by since the announcement of the increase of the private pensioner payment. In July, the pensioners waited for the announcement of the increase for the lowest insured salary.

This can be attributed to "Astra" whose transactions made 84% of the figure mentioned. They sold 220 thousand shares, 33,956 of the shares were sold in the central market and the rest (186,321) after a currency deal where the share was sold for 23 dinars per share.
This boost corresponds to the good performance of the general movement of prices. The rise included 15 companies while the fall included six of large-cap companies. This has limited the growth of the main index, "Tunindex", to only 10.0 % with 27,1320 points.

People are under oppression by the Palestinian movements and leaders.
He added that all groups should meet and decide together. This is not the case Actually each group decides separately and in my opinion, this is a wrong strategy. It will be a disaster if each group dictates his plan to the Palestinian people and it will be a weakness that the authority cannot afford to face.
Dahlan said that as far as the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza is concerned, Sharon is running away from a loosing battle that has become a heavy burden on the government of Israel. However, Dahlan considers that the Palestinian have achieved a lot from this withdrawal.

In another development, American forces said that they had arrested the person suspected of masterminding a string of mortar bomb attacks against American forces in the Al-Anbar area, and blowing up a bridge in the west of the country.
In return, Ali Samisam, another Sadr aide, asked the Iraqi government to come forward with the requested assurance of legal immunity for the followers of Sadr, and to release prisoners, confirming that the agreement would be settled if the Iraqi government complies.
3 Moroccan fraudsters arrested and 30 pieces of false gold seized
Following the enquiries, signs of worry and tension appeared on the countenances of the three Moroccan passengers, arousing the inspectors' suspicion. They examined their goods and came across 30 gold pieces in their possession, which later proved to be false, along with a quantity of incense. When the inspectors asked for an explanation of the mysterious discovery of these goods, they were hesitant to reply, and were detained in custody for investigation, later undertaken by investigators from the Investigations and Inspections Team for the provincial region of the National Guard in Grombalia. As a result, the three detainees admitted defrauding a number of citizens.

Tunis - Assabah Assabah has learnt from the University Administration for the South that as of yesterday, the Administration was able to house 14 465 students, among them 12 940 students in government hostels, due to the opening of new university hostels in Tozeur, Medenine and Kebili... housing for 1525 students was secured in hostels which are recognized providers. In Sfax there are only 7 hostels of this kind furnishing 374 beds, alongside other similar hostels in Gafsa and Gabes.
These hostels will be capable of absorbing the surplus students from university accommodation, solving this problem.
The Administration has commenced preparations for the events which will enliven the nights of Ramadan in the hostels and university districts. It will also participate in a provincial exhibition of developmental activities, and in a soiree as part of the activities of the Sfax city carnival.

Who was the perpetrator...
But speculation regarding the party which executed this sudden attack is not limited to this angle. According to the words of an Egyptian expert in terrorist affairs, Dia Rashwan, in a statement made to one of the satellite channels, it seems that the Israeli and American governments are those who benefit most by the incident.

News Analysis
Among a broad group of international political experts, orientalists and high level decision-makers in Western Europe and America, a legend has revived during the final two decades of the last century, according to which Iran, and in particular "The Iranian Revolution", represents a political threat and a cultural and strategic danger to the post cold war West. Therefore it is not surprising that Iran should constitute one of the points along the famous "Axis of Evil" according to Bush's foreign policy agenda during his first term of presidency, now approaching its end. The basis of the Iranian "evil" corresponds to that of the Iraqi "evils" - possession of weapons of mass destruction, breaches of human rights, support for terrorism and in particular a link to Al-Qaida -
The same anthem is repeated by both countries' politicians, with Rumsfeld explaining before the Foreign Affairs Committee that Iran has indeed become a serious danger to the future of American strategy in the Middle East region, through its sheltering of Al-Qaida elements fleeing from Afghanistan - this is of course according to official reports, the same reports relied upon by the creators of the Iraq invasion plan. In addition to that, the Iran of today is interfering in Iraq's interior affairs by supporting the Iraqi resistance financially and with ammunition.
Or the Shiite majority, led by Sistani, and observing the course of events in silence?
As the Iraqi "weapons of mass destruction" had constituted a serious danger to American security itself, "Iran with its missiles which could reach London or Paris or Berlin or the south of Russia...
From now on, Iran will increasingly suffer the attempts of the United States and Israel to internationalize the various pressures upon it via the international institutions themselves: the United Nations, the Security Council, and the International Atomic Energy Agency, the chief of which has acknowledged Iranian co-operation with regard to resolving the problems relating to the dossier...
Between confirmation and denial
The American spokesman Barry Johnson said "I can confirm that Tariq Aziz is alive.

Due to Attacks against Palestinians in Gaza:
A meeting has been scheduled in Luxembourg tomorrow for European Union foreign ministers to discuss "a plan of action" for the consolidation of relations with the new neighbors of the enlarged European Union, in accordance with the proximity policy which recently drawn up by the Union.
It is anticipated that the neighboring countries will embark on economic and political reforms in order to meet the standards of the European Union.
According to the source, "The question in the end is how we can best make use of our pressure on Israel... after all, they will achieve everything but (membership of) the institutions."
An Israeli officer approached the girl Iman and emptied his machine-gun into her body...
The newspaper said that the soldiers spoke of the killing of the Palestinian girl, Iman Al-Hams (13), last Tuesday, in the city of Rafah in the south of the Gaza Strip.
The soldiers said that according to instructions they were to open fire on any person entering within a range of 300 meters from the observation post.
Another soldier said, "I saw a head raised and lowered as the suspicious person was running over a mound of earth; everyone opened fire, and in the end the person fell to the ground. At that stage the soldiers at the outpost said they thought that the person was just a girl".
He added that "there was no logical reason for what he did, not for firing the first two bullets and there was certainly no reason for his firing a shower of bullets afterwards. Frankly he maltreated the body."

In Brief
A similar industrial accident was reported on the 7th October at one of the factories in Bir M'cherga, with the fall of a laborer into an industrial cement container, causing his instant death.
Achieving ambitions is the legitimate right of all Tunisians, men and women; and to this end, numerous presidential reforms have been made since the Change, encompassing the various spheres of political, economic, social and cultural life. The starting-point of these is the firmly-established presidential conviction that progress to a level of prosperity in the life of the individual is the legitimate right of every citizen demonstrating his aptitude to progress for the better.
This wealth-creation program of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali caters for an easing of the fiscal pressures and burdens imposed on companies, and the realization of a gradual harmonization between the system used for companies exclusively exporting and the system for companies aimed at the interior market.
Ali Attlili
The majority of citizens are unaware of the issue of a number of these laws (by the official guide)... the ordinary citizen is the last to learn of them... and no sooner has the awareness-raising campaign ended that many people regard them with indifference. Amongst these laws are: - a law prohibiting smoking in public places and on public transport; a law regarding the use of seatbelts - a law particular to cassette piracy issued in the official guide of 1994 - a law concerning car exhaust and that of other forms of transport - unplanned constructions - and disorderly building. And, after all that has been said, one has to ask : why do some people commit "infractions" of the law, under the title "all that is forbidden is desired"?
There are several factors which lead citizens to commit infractions... in many cases, one encounters a reluctance or slowness to comply with the law out of human, social motives...
As a consequence, let us note that in 2003, 1,532 rulings were issued for the demolition of unplanned buildings, 597 of which were carried out in the department of Tunis; and in the same year, 608 demolition rulings were issued in the department of Ariana and 475 in the department of Ben Arous, of which 277 were executed.
Disorderly construction
Why do some people break the law?
Among these behaviors is a lack of respect of some individuals for the Highway Code and their infringement of its signs and limits, which is called "uncivilized behavior"... those who carry out such infringements in our society are of many kinds. Among them we see some fastidious young men, some irresponsible adults, and also some lawbreaking "officials" under all kinds of pretexts, those in error and those lacking traffic politeness... etc... regardless of these people and their justifications, these are behaviors which society rejects and the state considers to be harmful to others and to constitute a threat to them. The traffic laws were originally laid down to protect the Other and "the I" also... breaking the speed limit laid down by the law for inhabited areas and outside built-up areas is considered an infringement of an agreement upon which specialists concur and which is sanctioned by the national community, out of consideration for a number of factors such as the nature of the roads and their surroundings and the nature of the vehicles and spaces and so on...
It seems that excessive selfish desires, which have penetrated our societies through the consumerist pattern and the rise of greedy globalization, influence the spreading of the symptom of a lack of respect for traffic laws; and, what is more, they often lead to the occurrence of traffic accidents. The increased concentration on individual space, and the values which spring from it, may in part explain these problems to us. Due to the spread of the individualist whim and an excessive desire to further individual interests within the public space, which this individual shares with others, and fuelled by some flaws in awareness or control, he competes with them or chafes against them, leading him in many cases to violate the rights of others and break the law. This is what leads to the violent type of behavior at which we may hint in our style of car driving, excessive habits, and manner of using the horn...
Professor Khadija Madani (Lawyer)
Examples of that include the owner of a car turning into a narrow two-way street, and trying to drive forcibly up the opposite lane, blocking the road in front of the oncoming cars and thus completely stopping the movement of traffic ...
The authorities must attend to the enforcement of the law, by ensuring the constant presence of officers on patrol to prevent all infractions...
So how can we, with the situation thus, ask the ordinary citizen to uphold the law?

Cairo - Occupied Jerusalem (News Agencies) Cairo confirmed yesterday that the explosions in Taba had targeted "the security and stability of Egypt" rather than Israel, and that their perpetrators would be pursued "in any corner of the world".

Tunis - Al-Ousbou'i "Stand for the teacher and offer respect, the teacher could be a prophet". This saying, which we memorized by heart, confirms that the relationship been pupil and teacher must be founded on mutual respect. We have been given cause to mention the relationship linking pupil and teacher following an incident in the past week in Sidi Ali Ben Oun, in the department of Sidi Bou Zid.
However, some students became aware of the incident, and, overpowering and restraining him, brought him to the educational institution's administration.

As the Mahdi Army Began to Disarm:
Press correspondents in Mosul said that the car had been parked on one of the subsidiary streets before storming the convoy, which led to the destruction of one of the American armored vehicles, and scattered the victims' bodies at the site of the explosion.
A booby-trapped car exploded near the Oil Ministry and the Police Academy in Baghdad. A spokesman at the Oil Ministry said that it had caused the death of 17 Iraqis and one American soldier, whilst Iraqi medical sources indicated that that the death toll represented 11 Iraqis.
These developments came as the Mahdi Army, under the Shiite leader Moqtada Sadr, began to hand over their weapons within the framework of an agreement with the Iraqi government in Sadr City.
The Iraqi government announced via the Minister of State for Security Affairs, Qasim Dawood, that there would be a suspension of aerial attacks on the city for three days for the negotiations to conclude.
Last Thursday the American army released 234 detainees from the Abu Ghraib prison and the jail at Camp Buka.
Blix wrote in an article for the British newspaper "The Observer" that inspectors dispatched by Bush in order to prove the American president's assertions concerning the forbidden weapons "were forced to admit that the reality on the ground was entirely different to the imagined state of affairs that was universal currency."
Ritter was an inspector in Iraq between 1991 and 1998, before resigning in protest at lack of support from the United States and the United Nations for a hard-and-fast means of disarming the weapons.
The Criminal Bureau at the First Instance in Tunis recently investigated a case of murder involving 7 young men whose ages range between 17 and 32.

The official spokesman for the President of the Republic said that these discussions concentrated in particular on the progress of bilateral relations between Tunisia and South Africa and the continuing impetus they experience. In relation to this, the two presidents expressed their pleasure at the mode of consultation between the countries, and a common desire to provide a new impetus for economic and commercial co-operation according to the conditions furnished by the favorable legal framework. They confirmed the exploitation of significant opportunities for the two countries to set out programs of partnership and investment and to increase exchange, especially with a view to encouraging businessmen to take on a vigorous and active role, in the light of the opportunities furnished by the Congress of Businessmen which is currently taking place in Tunis.
Developments on the regional and the international levels, in particular the dangerous events seen in the Middle East and the situation in Iraq, were an issue of discussion for the presidents who exchanged points of view in relation to these developments.
For this occasion an official reception parade was organized, at which His Excellency the President welcomed his guest. The two presidents saluted the tunes of the countries' official national anthems and inspected a guard of honor from the Presidential Guard, which saluted them.

The status of the "Timbre" and its role...
Observation of the Ramadan Crescent Tomorrow
If the crescent of Ramadan is not sighted tomorrow on (Thursday), the moon's age will have increased to around 37 hours at sunset on Friday over Tunisian cities... the sighting at sunset on Thursday will remain conditional on a number of climatic and astronomical circumstances, among which are the state of the weather and the degree of dust and also the angle between the sun and moon...
For greater clarity, we may note that a sighting is all the more probable the further one's positioning toward the west, since the period separating the conjunction from the sunset is greater, rendering the longer the period of time for which the moon remains. In addition, the angle between the sun and the moon and the degree of elevation is improved, so that the circumstances for sighting in the west of the African continent will be better than in its east and further west one goes, the better the circumstances for sighting, since over Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, for example, the moon will remain for 40 whole minutes.
The task has been assigned with regard to the first committee, the National Committee for Physical Training and Sports Activities, to study and propose best practices for realizing national orientations, supporting the reorganization and development of the physical training and sports activity sectors belonging to the system which is currently in place.
The various committees are characterized by the variety of their membership, including representatives of the ministries and various structures by which the required results will be achieved for their actions and recommendations. It is to be noted that it will be permitted for these committees, which are national in scope, to form regional committees, standing or otherwise.
Some institutions of secondary education have set aside time for discussion sessions with tutors, commencing from the final day of next week, to explain the final shape of the program of restructure for secondary education; and, in particular, in relation to orientation, which has come to be subject to the choice of the pupil in the first year of secondary, instead of the second... There is no doubt that meetings such as these will enrich discussion on the topic, and serve to lay to rest a number of points of enquiry and uncertainty in the minds of tutor and pupil.
"Work on the provision of a room, or more, for study; working for the best use of all available spaces throughout the day". However, a number of institutions either lack these rooms, or have not come to focus on this point, leading to pupils congregating in front of educational institutions for prolonged periods - so will more efforts be brought together to apply this very important point of the publication?
Whereas the prices of vegetables, cereals and white meat have been stable for some time, or rather a clear decrease has been seen in respect of a number of varieties from prices at this time last year, attention is drawn to the fact that fish prices have increased relatively from what they were, even during the summer.
Mixed SICAVs surpass TUNINDEX
Whilst this latter made do with a return of 5.23% on the last day of September, returns of 11.45% were achieved by the SICAV-BH PLACEMENT, 8.72% by SICAV-BNA, 6.38% by SICAV CROISSANCE and 5.38% by SUD VALEUR-SICAV.

Since 2002, favorable climatic circumstances - with the recording of a significant rate of rainfall following 4 continuous years of drought - have contributed to the increase of large cereal crops in the South, standing at 1.5 thousand hectares during the 2002-2003 season, raising production to 29 million kantars, as opposed to 5.1 million during the 2001-2002 season.
Kantar at a price of 381 million dinars, set against the 35 million
These indicators and data particular to the cereal sector reflect on the dough foods sector, so that the volume of Tunisian exports in this sector reached around 44 thousand tons in 2003, with couscous at 7.6 thousand tons, at a gross price estimated as around 35 million dinars. An increase in the volume of exports to 100 thousand tons is anticipated by 2007. All of these indicators confirm the surplus value which this sector is providing, a fact which may have a positive impact in narrowing the deficit in the nutrition budget, if we take into account its profits in hard currency.
Special measures in the economic sector
*Reducing the quantity of capital legally required for the creation of limited responsibility companies, to one thousand dinars.
*Creation of a Business Center in every province, bringing together all structures of support and provision for entrepreneurs.
*Maintaining the rate of growth of around 3% and the rate of the budget deficit for payments at around 2.5% of the Gross National Product.
*Establishing electronic banking and strengthening incentives and tools to raise a number of first-class companies in the stock market.
*Completion of systems linking between dams, and universal introduction of water economy techniques.
The Arab Common Market project: the arguments... and the reality
It is worth noting that this type of exchange - i.e. trade - within the same sector is reliant upon the desires and tastes of consumers, and it is up to the questioner to meditate upon the difference between "Peugeot" and "Mercedes Benz", which without a doubt, is a question of minutia. Thus "it is the duty of Arabs in general to surrender the economic situation in the service of politics, and to adopt the pragmatic or practical spirit, when they are evading it through this argument," according to the words of one Arab observer, who declined to mention his name.
Sfax - Assabah During the forthcoming period (the beginning of November), Olive harvest activities will commence in the department of Sfax, which will include the entire area of the province (more than 6 million olive plants). These preparations are accompanied by the great relief and full satisfaction of the people of the province and the provincial authorities regarding last season's production and the hope of a harvest in good quantities for this season.
The price of oil fluctuated between 5.2D and 7.2D per kilo, rising from the beginning of the month of February to around 7.3D. This rise in price was explained by the volume of foreign demand. The National Bureau for Oil was able to gather in 32 thousand tons, whilst 110 tons were gathered by private enterprises, noting that 1/3 of the production was considered to represent high-grade oils.
Provincial sources informed us that initial estimates for this season's harvest fluctuate between 140 thousand tons and 160 thousand tons of olives; these estimates were made using the naked eye, and technological methods.
He added that at the end of December, a quantity of chlorophyll is missing from the olive, which is among the few substances which preserve the stability of oil quality on storage.
Growth of 16% to 64.1 billion dinars
Synthesis
These prices do not only prevent the attraction this kind of visitor, but also hinder business tourism.

In fact, doubts began to be aired a long time ago with regard to this drug and a number of other similar medicines, both from the COXIBS family and the family of Rofecoxib, which are the scientific names for these drugs. Other names which are known and circulated worldwide, such as Vioxx, are only commercial names, which means that it is possible for there to be one scientific name, but many commercial names for the same drug, depending on the laboratory which manufactured the medicine.
However this is the first time that clinical testing measures have taken place with the aim of identifying the types of long term side-effects of this type of medicine ... i.e. over a period of 18 whole entire months!
For our part, we stress that all the experts in the world have advised against alarm or fear with regard to the danger of the situation, since the matter is merely a precautionary measure which it was necessary to take against health complications which might occur, and here we stress the words "might occur" to patients who have been taking this drug over a period of 18 months without interruption!

During this operation a number of books, talismans and pieces of equipment were seized, used by the charlatans in defining the location of the supposed treasure, besides an amount of incense and 15 antique coins, not confirmed as being genuine or forged.
Having been conveyed to security headquarters, the suspects did not take refuge in lies or the denial of responsibility, particularly since the material evidence against them was ample; they admitted the accusations immediately.

In fact the troublemaking pupil entered the class in the company of his friends without making his state known, i.e. in the beginning; but he began to ridicule his teacher, directly preventing the latter from giving the lesson.
At the start of his interrogation, the suspect admitted the accusations, awaiting his handing over to justice. In parallel with this he awaits the school board taking official measures in his respect, to serve as an example to others.
Carthage (TAP): A state visit to Tunisia over the 12th and 13th of October, headed by President Thabo Mbeki, president of the Republic of South Africa, came to an end yesterday afternoon. A parade was organized for the occasion, during which President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali bade farewell to his guest President Thabo Mbeki, and the delegation accompanying him.
Yesterday afternoon a second dialogue took place between President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and President Thabo Mbeki, president of the Republic of South Africa, which was the occasion for a review of matters of common bilateral, regional and international interest.
Within this context, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali expressed Tunisia's desire to see a greater progress in common African activity through its continued support for the African Union. His Excellency the President likewise highlighted the significance of the World Solidarity Fund's contribution to promoting practical treatment of the roots of the crises seen in the African continent.
He invited the President of the State to undertake a visit to South Africa.
Tunis - Assabah: Meetings between a delegation of Tunisian businessmen and around thirty important South African businessmen accompanying President Mbeki on the state visit to Tunisia have resulted in the signing of a treaty of co-operation between businessmen in the two countries. On the sidelines of this event, we encountered Mr. Gilani Ben Mubarak, President of the Tunisian Chamber of Industry and Commerce and Head of the Union of Chambers of Industry and Commerce in the Mediterranean States, and the conversation was as follows:
We are prepared to carry out the political will expressed by the President of the State, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, and his guest President Mbeki, regarding an increase in the level of economic relations and entry into common investments which are beneficial... and profitable...
The partnership may take in numerous sectors. We have commenced dialogue with businessmen in South Africa with regard to co-operation in some very important sectors, such as sanitation, energy, electronics, communications and manufacturing industries...
We perceived this admiration previously in the course of a conference of the Union of Chambers of Industry and Commerce in the Mediterranean States held in Beirut, which elected me as its president, out of admiration for Tunisia and its economic resources. It came as no surprise that I was received by the Lebanese president and the head of his government...
As for the English language, this obstacle has been overcome in Tunisia, and most Tunisian businessmen employ at least four languages, among them Arabic, English, French, Italian and sometimes German or Spanish...
Due to Desertification
Support for an anti-desertification program
Projects of the national anti-desertification program
It has been stated that the total investments allocated to fund the national anti-desertification program and preservation of water resources is around 3 billion dinars during the period of the Tenth Development Plan for 2002/2006, a rise of 23% compared to allocations during the Ninth Plan.
This comes after the recent approval of the negotiation of the administrative council of the Tunisian Central Bank and the decision to issue 400 gold coins worth 100 dinars each, alongside 400 silver coins at a value of 50 dinars each, and 200 silver pieces at a price of ten dinars each, which have legal currency and powers of settlement.
It is anticipated that the coming month, November, will see the organization of the Provincial Conference for Civil Education in the provinces of Tunis and Ariana on the topic of "the role of civil education in citizenship and the development of school life"... a number of inspectors and pedagogical experts will participate in this, alongside a group of front-line teachers and pupils.
The market still seeks its direction
As for the remainder of companies, exchange remained generally weak with regard to SIAME (60 shares), in addition to an absence of trading on the shares of 17 companies. Perhaps the most significant trades, despite their weakness, comprised the STB (4466 shares), STEQ (3600), the Arab Tunisian Bank (1636) and the SFBT (1201).
Towards the provision of additional privileges to Dutch and Tunisian export firms
The second point concerns support for Dutch companies wishing to invest in Tunisia by accommodating them on all levels, in particular with regard to the provision of data and information on the investment climate in Tunisia and the privileges which apply. This will come alongside the material support provided for these organizations by way of a program for sharing foreign markets, financed by Holland.
For his part, the director of the export support department at the Center for Export Promotion, Riadh Attia, indicated that bilateral cooperation between Holland and Tunisia will increase the trade balance existing between the two countries, stating that commercial exchanges between Holland and Tunisia had produced more than 500 million dinars in the year 2003. The trade balance existing between the two countries is considered to be equitable, with estimated revenues of 240 million dinars from exports and 285 million dinars from imports.

This artistic event was considered a supplement to the photography competition based on "Villages and Customs in my Country", which saw the participation of both amateur and professional photographers from all parts of the country. It aimed to promote the art of photography and revive the national heritage.
First prize: Wadi' Mahiri - photograph "Hamida, Takrouna 2004"
The winner of first prize, Wadi' Mahiri, an amateur photographer trained at the Italian Cultural Center, had recently participated in a joint exhibition at the Ibn Khaldun Cultural Center with three pictures on the subject of  "Dance and Motion". He told us that he had taken the picture which he had contributed, by chance when visiting the village of Takrouna, and that all its elements are natural rather than arranged or prepared in advance, saying "I am very happy about this prize - all the more so because I have contributed to the revival of the national heritage in general, and in particular of the village women who deserve all respect and esteem".
In response, Rafiq Al-Qasantini, a graduate of the Institute of Fine Arts specializing in digital photography, explained that informatics have come to form a crucial element of the photograph, due to their effectiveness in transforming its contents according to the desires and needs of its producer. These days digital photographs are a valuable means of communication and can be exchanged or sent within seconds either with a mobile phone or through the internet.
In addition there was a workshop involving the exhibition and discussion of a group of unforgettable pictures in human history.

A New Headquarters for Tunisair in Paris
For the new headquarters of Tunisair stand in one of Paris' high-class areas, the 8th Arrondissement. They were inaugurated by Messrs. Moncer Rouissi, the Tunisian ambassador in Paris and Rafi' Dakhil, the general manager of Tunisair, in the presence of a group of Tunisian and French journalists and Tunisair staff. Likewise the presence was noted of Mr. Francois Lebel, mayor of the 8th Arrondissement of the Paris municipality.
Mr. Rafi' Dakhil says that Tunisair's share in France stands at around 32% of charter and 65% of regular flights. He added during a press conference held in the presence of the Tunisian ambassador that the company, which was counted as being one of the safest companies, would pursue its efforts to beat the competition through a new marketing strategy including a plan which unites renewal and diversification for the period 2006-2015, perhaps the most prominent mark of which is the acquisition of new planes.
The Tunisian people, along with the rest of the Muslim peoples, welcome the Month of Ramadan, during which the Quran was revealed as a guide for people and a mercy to the inhabitants of this world. The Quran, which in the wisdom of the Sublime provides the opportunity to become stronger, requires the purification of soul and body, the adoption of correct manners and virtuous morals, and a mild, merciful and forgiving attitude when faced with misdeeds, as well as liberation from the impurities of bad habits and depraved manners, which rob the worship of its guiding wisdom and distance it from its legislative purposes.
Blessings are on the one who absorbs these meanings and acts upon them, particularly during this holy month, and carries them out with transparency and frankness, refraining from distortion or corruption. He devotes himself to fasting with the determination of the sincere and steadfast, rich in good deeds and in control of his desires, refraining from depraved habits and guarding his tongue, economical in his spending and wise in his consumption, pursuing his work in a good and sincere manner and adroit his performance, undertaking his responsibilities and therewith realizing the objectives and goals of fasting.
Special measures to guarantee good supply
Our source in the wholesale market said that for the occasion of the month of Ramadan, a sensitization campaign had been undertaken within the ranks of all the parties involved in the supply operation, from among bulk traders, sales agencies and traders in single items, so that the rules of supply and demand are respected and the balance of the market maintained; along with ensuring the transparency of commercial information and avoidance of all forms of monopolization which may infringe market law and lead to undesirable practices in the markets for which the consumer pays the price. This sensitization campaign also included farmers and producers, in particular touching classification, and supplying the market with goods of the requisite degree of quality, delivering them to the consumer in a good state. This comes through working on the improvement of the quality of preservation and harvest, particularly with regard to fruits and fragile products such as tomatoes, out of consideration for the fact that that the general appearance of the produce plays a large role in marketing it, especially in the month of Ramadan. It is a characteristic of the Tunisian consumer that he eats with his eyes, and many spend for the sake of satisfying this desire.

This year the "Youth Card" distribution campaign will be launched on October 21st, and continue until November 20th. This campaign includes a 50% decrease in the price of the card, i.e. it will become 5 dinars rather than 10. It is equivalent to a student rail subscription. Points of sale will be established within institutions and in public and private university hostels.
During the period from last October up until the end of August this year, more than 31, 800 tons of Tunisian dates were exported. The department of Tozeur is foremost among the areas exporting dates, with an amount of 8240 tons. It seems that the forecast for the current production and export season for dates is extremely good, given the increasing demand for them, in particular from a number of Islamic and some European countries.
As a result of the municipal repairs being carried out to the central market in the El Khadra area of the capital, vendors have been forced to set up outside the market. The resulting mode of work has come give rise to dissatisfaction, in particular in the case of produce which is quick to go off and cannot withstand the heat of the sun, such as fish, fruits, and other items.
Tunis - Assabah: The first six months of the year 2004 witnessed an improvement in the general economic climate. The agricultural sector experienced a significant resurgence for the second consecutive year; likewise the tourism sector is regaining its vitality, and the industrial sector witnessed a growth of 6% during this period. This improvement in the economic climate reflects relatively positively on the banking sector which passed through some difficulties in 2003. This sector has experienced a growth of 4.4% during the first six months in the figure of loans granted. This growth is considered to be an indicator, according to Tunisian Values analysts, of an improvement in the rate of collection during the first six months, when deposits witnessed a growth of 4.3% due to prosperity.

Seven people were killed, among them two Americans, and four others were injured in a bombardment targeting the Khadra area of Baghdad, which is subject to heightened security measures.
The explosions shook the area, which is under heightened protection, where a cloud of black smoke rose up over the location.
In Falluja, two assaults carried out yesterday by American planes resulted in the deaths of five people and the injuries to 13 others, according to the new count from the city's General Hospital.
Deaths among the Iraqi National Guard
On another topic, the Ramadi police announced that armed men had attacked a base of the Iraqi National Guard at dawn yesterday in Ar-Rabtah (450 km to the west of Baghdad) and stolen all of the weapons which were at the location.
Assassinations
It added that the journalist had been working for "Al-Hurriya" television, which belongs to the Kurdistani National Union, under the leadership of Jalal Talabani.
That came hours after the American army announced in two separate statements the death of four of its soldiers in two explosions to in the east of Baghdad.
and Sharon insists on continuing military operations
During the invasion the occupation bulldozers destroyed either totally or partially 34 Palestinian houses.
Sharon yesterday announced the continuation of the current operation in Gaza Sector, while top officers said "it was time" to end it.
On the other hand, another official in the army said "The feasibility of continuing the operation is debatable as the presence of the army in the northern Gaza Strip does not totally prevent the launching of Qassam rockets into Israel."
It is Bush's right to announce that the world is much better after the destruction of the Iraqi people, for when he talks about security he doesn't mean anyone except the United States and some of its allies.
Of course the world is safe after more than two hundred Spanish citizens died in the Madrid train explosion. The world is safe after the painful whack received by Russian students, teachers and parents in a Russian school that Russia is still grieving for and shall not ever forget.
Did he call on his army to depart Iraq and leave the Iraqis to decide their fate without treachery or custodianship?
The question is:
It is true that the attack that hurt the Russian people is terrorist.
The equation is obvious: there is no way to end terrorism and end resistance acts unless the policies of occupation, colonialism and subjugation of nations are ended.
A source at the Ministry of Health clarifies
In the same context, it is probable that the child then started vomiting and developed diarrhea, signs of acquiring Hepatitis A, before the infection spread to three other persons (12, 34 and 36 years of age). They were all taken to the hospital where the medical staff did their utmost during the treatment, resulting in the improvement of the state of the four patients.
On the other hand we contacted a reliable source at the Ministry of Public Health to clarify these cases. He assured that the infection with Hepatitis A is limited, and is treated after carrying out the necessary tests. He added that medicines and vaccinations against this non-dangerous disease are readily available.
3 clandestine departures by sea forestalled and 18 persons apprehended
Even though the driver obeyed the National Guards' signal and stopped on the edge of the road, their suspicions doubled, and they apprehended 5 persons after they admitted that they came from their places of origin to take part in an illegal trip which they had previously arranged with an organizer.

Tunis - Assabah: Thousands of patients visit public hospitals every year, and thousands of nurses and medical staff are allocated to provide various medical services to these patients. The public health sector is given much attention every year with much effort going into improving the level of services in the hospitals.
Fatima Ferchichi is of the same opinion. She is a housewife who visits the hospital regularly to obtain treatment for her disabled son. In Fatima's opinion "it is well known that registration is a difficult problem for the citizen, because not everyone can pay it, especially since the citizen has to pay for the registration and tests, and purchase medications. This makes it hard on those citizens who resort to public hospitals to avoid the expenses he would have to pay in private hospitals."
Waiting: Fatima Ferchichi has this to say about the waiting phenomenon in public hospitals: "I have a disabled son, and every time I bring him to the hospital I end up going home sick. If a normal person gets anxious about waiting, what about the sick person who has to patiently bear his pain while waiting for his turn."
On the other hand, Mrs. N assured us that our hospitals "still suffer from patients and those attending with them losing their tempers as a result of some of the male and female nurses' carelessness and lack of concern for their illness." Samia Jabali
"Usually the patient doesn't come here except after a referral from a private hospital. The practicing doctors in public hospitals are renowned for their competence."
Mrs. Amal assures that "Most of the problems that occur in the hospital are caused by the refusal by the citizen to pay the required fees, especially if he had been examined by one department of the hospital and then sent to another department, in which case he has to pay the fees for two examinations. In this case, the citizen has an excuse, because he is faced with an error and he has to bear the consequences of that error. Samia
Apart from a few consumers who dropped into the Company's abattoir, we did not notice much movement in the first hours of the morning in the sales outlet, until ten, when we saw a number of comers in taxis or on foot, starting to show up.
The process of coordinating supplies of this sales outlet depends on the levels of attendance and what the demand dictates. As a result, there are no defined quotas. Our speaker, who has described the attendance as good, said that the citizen can obtain what amounts he needs by himself without limitations. She stressed that all supplied meats are completely health assured and meet all quality and safety standards, and are being closely controlled during the various stages of supply.

10 Dinars worth of free calls with each 30 Dinars recharge. Tunis - Assabah: Since yesterday, Tunisia Telecom has started a special plan for the occasion of the month of Ramadan, which stipulates the lowering of sign-up fees for billable or pre-paid line to 30 Dinars.
In regards to the Multimedia Messaging Service MMS, the provision of which service the Tunisia Telecom has started preparing some time ago, Mr. Ahmed Mahjoub has stated that this service will be available soon and assured that the project is ready but is being trialed technically to ensure the quality and effectiveness of the service provided by the Multimedia Messaging Service. He pointed out that this project is part of the preparations for Tunisia to host the second stage of the World Summit on the Information Society in November 2005.
The company is working continually on expanding the network capacity and investments are continuing in this area, having exceeded 2 million Dinars in the year 2004.
Tunis - Assabah: The second mobile phone operator "Tunisiana" has begun recently to market new services aimed essentially at businessmen. These services are considered state-of-the-art in the communications field and consist of the double offer of "Autoiste" and the Mobile Office Services.
The Mobile Office Service enables the owner of a regular line or a business line to enjoy four services at the same time. These are professional voice messages, Mobile Fax-mail, Fax and Mobile Internet. To enable the owner of the line to use the Mobile Fax-mail and the Fax separately, the company offers a separate number for this service, allowing the professional to have all the services he enjoys in his own office.
Tunis - Assabah: The Tunisian Railways National Company welcomed the great month of Ramadan by preparing new timetables for metropolitan trains, as well as for trains to areas south of the capital and to the coastal areas. The special operating times for this month were taken into account on the one hand, and the times for Iftar on the other, in addition to the economic activity seen in the capital through the second half of Ramadan.
It is worth adding that the number of trains made available to clients amounts 119 trains daily during the first twenty days of Ramadan, increasing to 127 trains daily during the last ten days of the great month. These trains work 22 out of the 24 hours, with station masters and train guards available until Iftar time to ensure regular working.

We did not see this shameful picture during our tour of some of the main areas and the Central Market. It seems that the abundance of products, plenty of supplies and the saturation of distribution outlets of various levels early on have prevented the appearance of this behavior. The relevant authorities had pumped into the markets significant amounts of various types of products one week ahead of Ramadan's start.
What we hope for now is that this situation continues and that supplies are coordinated regularly throughout Ramadan, hoping that the sights of bemoaning the size of Ramadan's shopping bags of long ago will no longer remain with us.
The Administration had asked the Party to amend certain paragraphs in the Elections Program because of some of these paragraphs'  "illegal" content or strong, albeit politely worded, language.
According to information obtained by Assabah, the two sides reached an agreement about the wording and form of the second amendments. The Administration, however, then asked for new amendments. After negotiations between the two parties, the Observation Committee informed the body of the Party about Administration's concurrence. However, the Party's politburo had hastily convened an emergency meeting during which it decided to reject any amendments to the Elections Program, and to adhere to the initial version.

We asked about this problem Mr Khamis Bou Ali who is a secondary school inspector with the Ministry of Education and Training. He offered us a few suggestions for solving this problem in colleges. He said that any tardiness by the student means wasting academic time. This time is measured and set to meet the content of what the teachers present. Thus, any waste of this time affects the student's acquisition of learning and therefore affects its formation and the coordination of this formation, and especially its results.
Mr. Bou Ali pointed out that parents don't come to school except rarely, and do not follow up on their children's progress except close to final examinations. Most of them have no knowledge of their children's tardiness.
He mentioned that it might be better for students to be "semi-resident" at their schools, so as to revise during their break time. This will consequently prevent the problem of remaining on the streets during the hours in which they are not studying.
This in addition to the pedagogical role played by the teacher since he has the most contact with the student at school.
Saida Bou Hlal
The appearance of this trend in school perplexed some of the parents and made some of them contact the Weekly to complain about their helplessness and financial inability to provide for the private tuition of a child that wants nothing but to play. If the child may absorb much information away from the class and its environment that suffocates his childhood, what happens if he is forced to fill his head with revising the same lessons he had in the morning, from the same male or female teacher, except that the place has changed, since these teachers try and gather their students in one of those rooms full of furniture in their houses to offer them what they claim are lessons.

A health official stated that some of the toys are dangerous and could be hazardous to the child. For example toys made of fluff, cuddly toys, could cause the child to choke. Plastic toys, so abundant at the flea markets, usually without any indication as to the type of plastics they are made of, can become a danger to children's health, especially if the plastics are mixed with various fibers: DIMP, DNOP, DEHP, DNOP, DIDP, OBP and BBP. The General Administration for Competition and Internal Markets at the Ministry of Trade had banned 4 years ago the import and marketing of toys made from the above mentioned materials, especially after evidence was produced that the infiltration of these materials into the child or infant can adversely affect its liver and kidneys and even his growth, not to mention that cadmium causes cancer and kidney impairment.

In response to the American Duelfer report on Iraqi weapons:
The report prepared by the American chief weapons inspector in Iraq, Charles Duelfer, published last Wednesday in Washington stated that Iraqi intelligence tried to bribe a number of states with oil export contracts.
He continued, "I don't believe this at all."
Anan said, "I cannot say the world is safer when you consider the violence around us, when you look around you and see the terrorist attacks around the world and you see what is going on in Iraq."
Duelfer's report alleged that since June 2000, Iraq gave France approximately 15% of all contracts entered into within the Oil-for-Food Program.
The editor of the internet published newspaper Politikon, Zdenka Ulmannova, who is part of the efforts to create this party, said that it has started gathering the signatures necessary to lodge a registration application for the party and that men will be allowed to join it but will have to take into consideration that they will not feature on its election lists.
According to the law in the Czech Republic the license to establish a political party needs the collection of at least one thousand signatures of persons who support its program and goals. Ulmannova does not see this as a problem, and believes that the party will not only be able to participate in the coming parliamentary elections scheduled for summer 2006, but obtain parliamentary seats as well.
Then vote for women!"
Cook said that contrary to the British forces, the American forces employ aggressive methods towards the Iraqi people, causing anger among the Iraqis.
Paul Adams, the British Boradcasting and Television Corporation (BBC) defense correspondent, said that some believe an American military force is involved in combat operations in Fallujah, and that the British Government considers the request made by the American forces for re-deployment of the British forces in Baghdad as a replacement of the American forces by the British forces.
He said, "Last time the American forces attacked Fallujah they left behind one thousand civilian casualties. There is widespread anger in Iraq because of these violent actions, and there is the risk that if the British forces take the place of American forces, the British forces may become responsible too for what is happening to Fallujah residents."
Loses of the American occupation in Iraq escalating
In Fallujah, the suburb of  Jolan suffered massive shelling by American tanks stationed on the highway. American aircraft also bombed houses and shops in Al-Askari and Al-Sina'i suburbs.
Residents of the city assert that the air strikes kill only civilians.
In a previous field development, two helicopters belonging to the American Army crashed in the evening of the day before yesterday south west of Baghdad, resulting in the death of two American soldiers and injuring two others of its crew members.
It should be mentioned that the American Army has lost no less than 27 helicopters since invading Iraq last March.
Police in Karbala city said that those slain were part of a group that had finished its training in Jordan, and were on their way back after finishing their training course.
State Department for National Security Affairs announced in a statement, a copy of which was received by the Agence France Presse, "We call on the sons and tribes of Fallujah to immediately start expelling foreign terrorists and empty all suburbs in the city of these murderers and their criminal supporters who want to disturb the security and stability of our country."
Washington (News Agencies) American sources have revealed new torture practices against detainees in the American base in Guantanamo, Cuba, which confirm that these tactics are widespread and not just individual practices as the American Defense Department alleges.
Refused to comment
A number of states also objected to their citizens being detained in Guantanamo with their governments strongly interceding with the American administration to have them handed over to them as happened with Britain, European and Arab countries.
The timing of this case coincided with the first night of the month of Ramadan, when talk usually intensifies about the "hashish" which can sometimes cause unpredictable tragedies.

Tunis - Assabah: How will the general polling process be organized next Sunday?
We posed these questions to Mr. Abdelwaheb El Behi, Cairman of the National Elections Observatory. He stated that "the issue has been legally regulated by Decree No. 1564 issued on the 14th of last July, calling on the voters to vote on October 24th, then by the decree issued two weeks ago which ordered that polling stations be opened during this year's elections, as an exception, from seven thirty in the morning and closed at four thirty in the afternoon, that is about an hour and ten minutes prior to the Iftar time.
And if yes, who will supervise the ballot boxes?
Subsequently, ballot boxes, electoral files and the district registers are collected at the municipal level before being sent to provincial centers in preparation to being referred to the national level. After that, initial results are announced at night in the Ministry of Interior. The Minister of Interior will announce all the results at a press conference on Monday morning, and the results become official after the Constitutional Assembly authorizes them.
The National Observatory has raised this issue with the Administration representatives and were told that the issue has sometimes to do with unclear addresses and changing residence.
Commenting on this question, the Chairman of the National Observatory said that the Observatory was in touch with all lists, regionally and nationally, and that it interceded with the Administration in attempt to settle certain issues which arose in some districts, "and generally speaking the Administration acted affirmatively."
The Minister for Religious Affairs in a press conference:
For example, a large number of elegant carpets were distributed to different governorates with the permission of His Excellency the President of the Republic, to be spread in a number of mosques and religious landmarks.
The Minister said that a list of subjects was prepared by the departments of the Ministry for Religious Affairs and sent to their Excellencies the Governors, to draw upon when preparing the content of the religious lectures and entertainment by whoever will be presenting them. These subjects all revolve around the tolerant principles of the Muslim religion and highlight its noble values such as the value of solidarity, moderation, and praise of labour as a manner of worship.
One of the important milestones in the program of religious activities held during the month of Great Ramadan is the International Holy Koran Memorization, Recitation and Interpretation Competition. This is an innovative competition whose revival was permitted by the Head of the State, and is organized under his Excellency's supervision in the last ten nights. The Minister, speaking about this year's competition, informed that the number of participating states has increased on account of three new states joining in. Thus the number of participating states has reached 14.
Although this award itself is young (this year being its second round), it has become an internationally outstanding event in the Muslim World, with researchers, academics and intellectuals from all parts of the Muslim World competing in it to present the enlightened, interpretative and innovative aspects of Islamic thought.
Chairman of International Accor Tourist Group:
Plan for Reform
This question was answered by Mr. Gerard Pelisson, who said that the construction of two hotels was planned close to the airport, but the high land prices on the one hand and the impossibility to have the hotel directly open onto the airport on the other made the project infeasible.
The future of the sector
It is also renovating currently the Caravanserail Hotel in Nefta. The expected investments consist of 8 Novotel hotels distributed around the country. The Group owns land in Djerba, on which it is expected it will build the Novotel Talasa Djerba hotel. The Group also invests in Tunisia through the tourism investment company managed by Mr. Ali Dibbia. This company will be responsible for constructing the hotel on Ave. Mohamed V which will include, according to the same sources, Accor's Tourism Training Academy according to a agreement to establish it in Tunisia. It should be mentioned that the work on the hotel will start in April 2005.
The General Directorate for the Intermediate and Secondary Education at the Ministry of Education and Training issued this year's continual supervision pamphlet designed for the intermediate schools and secondary colleges, which organizes the various stages of tests, supervised assignments and essay writing.
In regards to the second quarter, the continual supervision pamphlet prescribes the start of tests and supervised assignments during the period between December 13th 2004 to February 19th 2005, inclusive of execution and correction. Intermediate schools' students will carry them out during the week prior to closure, from February 28th until March 5th 2005, after which the closure week will start, specifically from March 7th to 12th. March 19th has been set as the final date for correcting assignments and returning them to the students, and the teachers will hand averages to the administration on the same day. Department Committees discussions for the second quarter will start on April 4th, 2005.
Foreign Investment

As regards private investors in Tunisia, Netherlands registers its presence among the European nations with total investments at 282.8 million Dinars, employing 10,812 workers.
Huge attendance and joyful, festive atmosphere
Singer Insaf was introduced by the lively artist Jaloul Jelassi who himself contributed to the success of the concert with his monologues. Some of these we knew and some others he made up as things occurred. Among these was his performance of a song by Nancy Ajram with the voice of the late artist Ali Riahi.
His innovations lie in adopting eurhythmic songs to grab the attention of young Arabs absorbed by Western songs for lack of an artist the caliber of Abdel Halim Hafez, despite the proliferation of voices after his demise. These voices were however copies and nothing beats the original.
And because Ragheb Alama loves his Tunisian audience and considers that it was a grand occasion, he released a new song, saying:
Loving you is insufficient
At the end of the concert the Hammadi Ben Ammar's sector in Halq Al-Wadi and the support committee for President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali granted a certificate of appreciation to singer Ragheb Alama who sang throughout the concert while holding the red booklet..
Adel Bouallag's "The Caravan": The wind when it uncovers things
There is a cognitive incentive for this notion that contributed to its appearance, and that is Adel Bouallag's participation in a meeting about wind in the French city of Grenoble. This whetted his appetite for thinking and soaring, so he wrote an interesting paper titled "The Wind of Desires" in which he enumerated all the derivatives of the term "wind" in Arab imagination. He reached a number of conclusions, the first being that terms depicting sound in Arabic language all contain the letter "ha'" (siyah, faseeh, niwah) and that all terms depicting life also contain the letter "ha" (al-hubb, al-huriyya, al-rihla, al-hayat). Also all terms depicting movement contain the letter "ha".
"What drew our attention was the desert scene with its two aspects. In the first, the mirage prevails, with the desert's revealing rays weaving misty fantasies around it. The second is the real aspect of the desert, covered in factors of oblivion. The tourist scene, with its profit dimensions, prevails over the spiritual scene.
The second motive for producing "The Caravan" is the East and West dilemma, or that of the South and the North, the matter of secularization and the economies of the southern countries, and the issue of abuse of the rights of nations to self determination.

Iraq: 14 killed and 52 injured in new explosions and acts of violence
Col. Adnan Abdul Rahman said that "the attack at hour  local time using a car loaded with around 500 to 600 kgs of explosives"
This is the first assault in the Iraqi capital since the beginning of the month of Ramadan.
In the suburb of Jadiriya, south of Baghdad, a student was killed in his car and two others injured when a bomb exploded according to Wi'am Riyadh who owns a kiosk selling cigarettes in the area.
Also, the beheaded body of an Iraqi working as an interpreter for the American forces was found south of the city of Mosul.
Release
When asked about the possible return to negotiations with the government he responded that releasing Sheikh Khaled, "is a step in the right direction and that if shelling stops it will be a second positive step, and we could then reopen negotiation channels."
The Iraqi official told Reuters that the step aimed at halting the flow of arms into Sadr City, one of the Shia militants' strongholds in the capital Baghdad.
a possible violent confrontation between Sharon and the settlers
We are moving towards a confrontation."
On his behalf, Yehoshua Mor-Yussef, secretary general of settlers council told the public radio "We met with a prime minister deaf to our demands who read a set of texts prepared for him by his advisors.
And despite Sharon's currently ultimate rejection of such a suggestion, calls for organizing a referendum about the issue are beginning to increase.
It is expected that his plan will be presented for voting in the Parliament on October 25th .
On the diplomatic front, French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier started on Sunday afternoon his visit to Israel which may last longer than 48 hours, and which confirms the two countries' intention to restart dialogue after a period of convulsion.
The paper stated that these plans entail the deployment of 650 soldiers from the Scottish "Black Watch" regiment currently stationed in Basra as a reserve force in southern Baghdad and other cities such as Al Iskandariyah, Al Latifiyah and Al Mahmudiyah.
A spokesman for the British Ministry of Defense confirmed the day before yesterday to Agence France-Presse that Britain is studying a request from the Unites States for deployment of its forces in the Iraqi areas controlled by the American command, but that London refuses to send its forces to Baghdad or Fallujah.
President Ben Ali signs a decree regulating school life.
His Excellency the President confirmed the importance he gives to activating frameworks of debate and consultation which occur in this context, to make the schools a social space integrating the roles of the various parties - pedagogues, parents and students - and in which the spirit of citizenship and noble values are strengthened.
Religious landmarks in Tunisia: Change is the best proof of reconciliation with self and identity
The recent permission of his Excellency to distribute quantities of carpets to be spread in a number of religious landmarks in various provinces of the republic is the best proof of this sublime presidential care which translates through work and implementation the real reconciliation with self and identity as it was promised by the architect of this blessed transformation in his pioneering historical address at dawn of the eternal November 7th.
Current Issue
According to these organizations' diagnosis, the causes lie in the following points: misuse of public resources (expenditure greatly exceeding  resources), corruption, lack of feasibility in public projects (jobs exceed needs) so that such institutions are described as "cathedrals".
- The presence of side effects of the production and consumption processes, whether they be positive or negative, with the state being invited to compensate the society and deal with these effects.
These were the arguments presented by the neoconservatives for decreasing the role of the state, which the international financial institutions adopted to promote a reform program in developing countries. It failed, as it is known, especially in African and Latin American states because it lacked methodology and timescales, dependant as it was on immediate execution without constraints or conditions, and because it did not take into account the cultural and economic specifics of these states to facilitate the transition from one economic system to another.
25% increase in production
According to the same source, leasing companies listed on the stock exchange have registered a slight decrease in their earnings, though they were almost increased by 14% if we excluded the Amen Leasing which suffers costs of loan recovery that are higher than the value of its net revenue.
A Tourist Circumstance
Massive participation in largest international exhibitions
In a step that seemed to have come in response to the recommendations made by the strategic study and national consultation into the improvement of the tourist sector, the latest meeting of the Ministerial Council issued a decision to permit the traditional handicrafts sector the benefits of loans from the Fund for Industrial Promotion and Decentralization (FOPRODI), thus allowing the funding of projects which exceed 50 thousand Dinars in costs.

Baghdad - Fallujah (News Agencies) An Iraqi National Guard Forces headquarters in the neighborhood of Mashahidah, north of Baghdad, suffered an attack yesterday morning of Howitzer mortars which resulted - according to sources from the Defense Ministry - in four dead and more than 80 injured.
Iraqi police sources stated that violent battles raged yesterday morning in the southern neighborhoods of the town, while American and Iraqi forces were deployed in other suburbs and demanded through megaphones that the residents hand over a number of wanted persons.
On the other hand, an oil export pipeline in northern Iraq was attacked when unknown persons detonated an explosive which set one of its sectors on fire yesterday morning.
The American army alleged in a statement that the shelling targeted "hideouts and arms stores of Abu Musab Al Zarqawi's network.
With the events
And did the Commissioner General of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, Peter Hansen, need to wait until Israel completed its "Days of Penitence" operation staged against the Jabalaya Palestinian refugee camp to condemn these operations and consider them illegal and unjustifiable?
This is not the first time that Israel has perpetrated such a crime and it will surely not be the last. There is no doubt that what happened in Jabalaya camp is but a link added to many bloody links.
The Human Rights Watch report pointed out, for the first time, that it is essential for America to stop providing Israel with the bulldozers used for destroying houses and rendering the residents homeless.
and voting starts in Florida
This position adopted prior to September 11th is not going to protect our country at all."
The Democrat candidate had previously accused Bush of ignoring advice from the military regarding Iraq in an "insolent, dogmatic and arrogant" way.
The commentator asks, "Are Kerry and his left-wing allies a risk we can allow ourselves to take now?"
On the other hand in Florida, which remains one of the disputed states in the White House race as happened in 2000, the electorate has started voting the day before yesterday for the two candidates, the Republican president George Bush and his rival Democrat John Kerry, two weeks prior to the official start of the elections.
Two public opinion polls published at the end of the week showed that the two candidates are very close in this important state which has 27 large electors.
In this inconclusive battle Kerry has the support of a number of large newspapers in Florida, such as Miami Herald, St. Petersburg Times, Florida Today and Sun Sentinel.
France calls for vote on a new resolution against Syria
The proposed resolution sponsored by France and the United States calls on Damascus to comply with the requirements of a previous Security Council resolution demanding that Syria withdraws its troops from Lebanon.
It must be pointed out that declarations are more lenient than Security Council resolutions which are legally binding on all United Nations' 191 member states.
The day after the resolution was adopted on September 2nd, the Lebanese Parliament amended the constitution to extend the mandate of the Republic's President Emile Lahoud, who is Syria's ally, for three years.
" History teaches us that we don't choose our adversary"
The French Foreign Affairs Minister enquired on his third day of visiting Israel, "Have you heard in world history of peace between nations separated by walls?"
Europeans in general, and not just the French, are finding it difficult to accept the constant deterioration of the Palestinians' situation.
Yes, the Europeans are wondering about this, and they're waiting for answers."
The poll, performed for the American television network CNN and the newspaper "USA Today" showed that between October 14th and 16th about 51% of people deemed Kerry more qualified than President Bush (45%) to solve economic problems and promote the economy.
The poll included 1013 Americans.
The polls was conducted between September 15th and October 10th and included 850 blacks, with an error margin of 3.5 points.
Habash described the rumors about potential airlifting Arafat to Cairo for medical reasons as "rumors through which Israel aims either to remove the President from his homeland and rendering him homeless, or to prepare for his assassination in a way that would make his death look natural, by incessant talking about his deteriorating health."
The candidate for the Progressive Democratic Party in Kairouan electoral district, Mr. Rachid Khachana, invited to a televised debate one of the heads of the Democratic Constitutional Rally's lists in the legislative elections.

Echoes of the Initiative
The Attajdid Movement and the Democratic Initiative issued its comprehensive elections program dealing with various economic, social and political areas.
Prepared by Saleh Atiya
Comprehensive Social Cover: This will be achieved through introduction of a number of reforms to the authoritative role of the public sector in the fields of influence, research and treatment. In addition, improvement of the private sector will continue in a context of sector complementariness, especially since illness insurance services will become implemented from next year implying a gradual increase in seeking treatment that coincides in time with the expected increase in social cover.
On the preventative level, and taking into consideration the dangerous effects of chronic and life-threatening diseases on a person's health, it has been decided that their prevention will be a national priority. Therefore, early diagnosis shall be made accessible to those suffering from hypertension, diabetes and renal disorders. A plan will be drafted for early diagnosis of cancer, and it should be mentioned in this context that oncology departments will be made accessible in all provinces and new departments of cardiology and nephrology instituted, in addition to the creation of a national monitoring center for recent and new diseases and their prevention .
A Fitness Centre for Each Municipality
Why hasn't commercial activity started yet?
Since the start of the month of Ramadan, the Consumer Defense Organization has alerted the consumers, through preparatory meetings coordinated with Ministry of Trade, to the necessity of citizens to purchase all their needs early, so as to have the opportunity to choose and to avoid burdening the family budget by engaging in buying the feast requirements from sweets to clothing all at the same time, often being forced to borrow.
Some of the citizens we met mentioned the necessity to encourage shop owners to participate in stimulating activity in the center of the capital during the month of Ramadan as well as during ordinary days, when shops close early.
Under the slogan "Regular supply, moderate consumption", the regional office of the Consumer Defense Organization in Sfax started on the occasion of the blessed month of Ramadan implementing a program of gathering information and fieldwork to benefit the consumer. The aim is to encourage the consumer to adopt a moderate consumerist attitude, avoid all aspects of prodigality and wisely use the family budget.
On the hand it has been decided to contribute to the national program for energy control through promotion and information gathering aiming at changing some negative behaviors during the month of Ramadan, examples of which are overuse of power, gas and wasting fuel, all of which reflects adversely on the family's budget specifically and on the national economy generally.
The Regional Industries and Trade Union has continued during the second half of every Ramadan month to organize the trade fair that aims to provide more opportunities for shopping and purchasing of the feast's necessities, be they clothes, shoes, sweets or children's toys, at suitable prices while safeguarding the citizen's purchasing capacity. It has become a characteristic custom contributing to the creation of an important trade and economic dynamic in the region. This year, these "trading days" will also be organized with nearly 70 exhibitors from different provinces of the Republic participating in its activities. Preparations to get the Trade Fair grounds organized have already begun, ever since it has become a destination for residents of Tozeur and all the areas of  el-Djerid  as well as those coming to Tozeur from neighboring provinces to shop in it.
Whatever the situation, the positive thing that accompanied the organization of previous rounds is that the Tozeur Trade Fair has become entrenched as part of the traditions and customs and it should be continued astutely. Attempts should be made to avoid the present detractions.This is achieved through researching all aspects that can pave the way to providing total success, especially as there is an urgent demand for good quality products keeping in line with the youth's sophistication. In this context, many of those who spoke with us pointed out that previous rounds exhibited low quality products at high prices. Not just that, but - as some have asserted - the prices at the Trade Fair were higher in most cases than those marketplace retail shops which make heads of families flee. Another group pointed out the necessity of reducing the sizes of areas for selling gifts and to concentrate on ready-made clothes and shoes which are in huge demand by the visitors.
Chairman of the Central Bank in Conference on Full Convertibility of Tunisian Dinar:
Tawfiq Bakkar also mentioned that the coming period is a period for building information commerce with 1.25% of gross national product - the balance for scientific research in 2009 will be around 640 million dinars - allocated to technological and research programs.
In addition, this gradual approach toward complete liberalization of the dinar is aimed at preparing Tunisian enterprises for the globalization phase and paving the way for them to take their place in the world through facilitating investment abroad or ownership of shares in foreign companies.
3 Days Prior to Raising the Issue of Withdrawal from Gaza at the Knesset:
The widely distributed newspaper "Yediot Ahronot" headlined its front page with "Country Under Great Pressure."
Settlers, right-wing parties and "fundamentalists" in the Likud party pledged to wreck the plan.
Since his adoption of the separation plan with the Palestinians in June, Sharon has lost the majority he had previously enjoyed in parliament.
Movaz warned against tearing apart the Jewish state by the rabbis' calls to soldiers to refuse orders to vacate settlements in the Gaza Strip in accordance with the unilateral separation plan which he is trying to get the Shas party to agree to.
"New York Times"
A." expected the American forces to be welcomed with flowers at a time when Kurdish leader Masoud al-Barzani refused to describe occupying American forces as the enemy.
The newspaper added  that one of the erroneous readings of the Iraqi strategy was exemplified by the failure of central intelligence to foresee the role of Saddam Hussein's militia forces which carried out many of the principal attacks against American forces in southern Iraq and took them by surprise in  bloody battles, in addition to its failure to pinpoint the huge weapons stockpiles hidden in mosques and schools to equip fighters with weapons, in spite of the Central Intelligence Agency being aware of the existence of vast weapons inside Iraq.
Al-Hariri's resignation and the Lebanese opposition's refusal to participate in the next government has given President of the Republic Emile Lahoud, Syria's ally, a free hand to choose the head of government.
The banker went on to say "given al-Hariri's standing, any other government will necessarily be regarded as an intransigent ministry," alluding to the support the resigned prime minister enjoys from Western countries such as France and the Gulf Arab states whose citizens made large investments in Lebanon during his reign.
Confirming this, deputy and Druze leader Walid Jumblatt confirmed on Wednesday evening that his parliamentary bloc, which includes 18 deputies, refused to take part in these negotiations, considering that the question of the government's future was decided when President Lahoud's term in office was extended on September 3rd.
Jumblatt warned on Wednesday against "the merry-go-round of political violence" after an assassination attempt against Marwan Hamada, one of the four ministers who resigned.
Lebanese sources said the new government will include 30 ministers, among them twenty from the resigned cabinet.
Karami, a close ally of Syria, entered the political scene after the assassination of his brother Rashid Karami in 1987.
A young man in his thirties appeared before the attorney-general at the capital's Court of First Instance a few days ago on the charge of violent assault using a metal weapon. With regard to the details of the case, they show that the offender was previously involved in a case of theft where the victim played an important role in convicting him. This annoyed him a great deal and made him decide to seek revenge against the one who put him

Among these breaches, al-Shabi mentioned the hiding of his party's election agenda and allowing another opposition party to use yellow which has symbolized the party's lists since the eighties, not allowing his party's candidates the opportunity of political and media maneuvering and dropping 5 of the party's lists, including the lists for Tunis, Safqas and Bajah.
Al-Shabi denied the accusation of triggering a media and political crisis with the administration on the eve of the elections because he wanted to stand out and be in the limelight.
Kamal Ben Yunis
In accordance with section 14 of the Educational Code, approved in the summer of 2001, which calls for modernization of the structures of discussion and negotiation within pedagogical and institutional boards.
One of the new approaches brought in by the set of educational reforms is to make students the focus and center of the educational process and to involve them in discussions within the institution, such that they give their opinions and are listened to, in order to establish the desired cooperation between various parties.
Developing teaching methods
For students in the fifth year, technology modules listed in the official curriculum will be taught which include sessions dedicated to information and communications technology, in addition to construction skills in schools where equipped areas are available. If such means are not available in the educational institution, then modules relating to agriculture, construction and textile skills will be taught according to each school's capabilities. Where data processing facilities are available in the school, students' performances in these topics will be assessed over two terms in the area of information and communications technology and over one term in the area of construction. For unequipped schools, construction, agriculture and textile skills learned by students will be assessed and teachers will record the competence objectives in the subject of technological education at the end of each term in the appropriate section in the assessment file.

Adnan al-Ghowl (47 years), a missile manufacturing engineer with the Hamas movement, and his colleague were killed after an Israeli reconnaissance plane fired a missile on his car which also led to the injury of 6 bystanders in Yafa Street.
The Israeli raids come just hours after an Israeli soldier was killed in the Rafah area south of the Gaza Strip following an explosion for which the Hamas movement claimed responsibility.
Sharon's withdrawal plan
In this context, the leader of the religious Shas party in Israel, Eli Ishai, said his party would not support Sharon's plan to withdraw from Gaza when it comes before parliament next week.
Geography battle
The political aspect led the Arab world to waver between refusal and acceptance, denial and eagerness, which is precisely what has shaped Arab policy toward Israel over decades of the most ambiguous and strange oscillations, but other parties stood firmly by the position with a clear vision in keeping with the minimum levels of honorable practicality: no peace with Israel without the Palestinian people being given back their national rights and that the Palestinian people have the right to expect us, even though weaker in faith, not to extend our hand to Israel as long as its government is still intent on killing, destruction, displacement and occupation.

Carthage (WAT) The day before voting in the presidential and legislative elections, which are being held today Sunday October 24, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali addressed the Tunisian people yesterday evening. This is the text: "Fellow citizens, men and women, tomorrow, Sunday, you will head to the polling stations to elect the President of the Republic and members of parliament.
While expressing my thanks and my consideration to the contending parties, I would like seize this opportunity to pay tribute once again to the degree of maturity demonstrated by Tunisian men and women.
We have also adhered to the respect of law and its enforcement and ensuring freedom of choice, transparency and fairness.
We have given instructions to the administration to ensure this.

and 189 Deputies from among 979 Candidates to the Legislature
There are four candidates for the presidential elections and they are: President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, Democratic Constitutional Rally candidate; Mohamed Bouchiha, Popular Unity Party candidate; Mohamed Ali al-Halwani, Ettajdid Movement and Democratic Initiative candidate and Munir al-Baji, Liberal Social Party candidate.
It should be pointed out that the distribution of seats on the national level is based on adjusting the election denominator by adding up declared votes which did not win seats in districts and dividing these by the number of seats available nationally which, in the current elections, is 37 seats. They will be divided between the lists which did not win any one or more electoral districts in a proportional manner and according to the highest average.
Once the voting operation in the polling stations ends at the specified time, i.e. four thirty this evening, the vote count begins immediately and openly in the same way as with the voting process. The ballot boxes are opened in the presence of official delegates or their deputies. Electoral law states that the polling station must carefully determine the voting results by tallying the results of the ballots. These are sent, along with all documents for that polling station, to the vote gathering bureau or vote centralizing bureau which is responsible for tallying the ballot results received from vote gathering bureaus, if these have been assigned, or from all polling stations for that district if no vote gathering bureaus have been assigned.

16 Killed and 46 Wounded in Anbar and Samarra:
An Iraqi police source said ten people were killed and another 40 wounded in a suicide attack against a police volunteer center in the town of Baghdadi (220 km) west of Baghdad.
Elsewhere, nine armed men and three others were wounded in clashes with American soldiers the day before yesterday in Bahrez to the northeast of Baghdad while six others were wounded in the morning in a bomb attack on an American convoy passing through to the west of Baghdad.
Medical sources and eye witnesses said in the morning that four Iraqis, including a child, were wounded in clashes between gunmen and an American patrol in the area.
An Agence France Presse correspondent noted that four Humvee vehicles barricaded the northern entrance to the town as American helicopters circled overhead.
Shortly after, the army announced the number of wounded as six.
The army said in a statement that the man, whose identity has not been specified, was captured in the course of an operation targeting "a hideout in southern Fallujah."
The statement said: "Abu Musab al Zarqawi's followers come to Fallujah to hide among the civilian population" and called on residents to "come forward with information on the whereabouts of al Zarqawi's followers."
And Barak announces return to politics
In the meantime, a source close to the head of government revealed that ministers Tsahi Hanegby and Naveh pledged to back the separation plan, in spite of voting against it in the government, "this in view of the government approving the plan."
The newspaper added that Barak acknowledged, in the course of these meetings, the mistakes he made while prime minister and promised the activists that he would listen more to their advice in the future, and that what he did in the past was for the benefit of Israel.
happening today in the United Nations
went to fill the coffers of international organizations and companies, the truth is that these statements are intended to be a response to many of the areas of shortcoming and the trials which bear witness to the organization's failure to shoulder the role it was created for.
And no doubt in the tragedy of the Palestinian people, which started even before the United Nations was created and which it hoped it would join over the past decades, and in particular since the creation of Israel was announced within the womb of the United Nations itself, there is enough to list the stages of this continuing tragedy before Israel announced its renunciation and contempt of all the laws and standards which led to its presence within the nations of the world and gave it the right to join the United Nations.
Criminal department number 11 at the Tunis Appellate Court looked into a strange case involving four defendants aged between 27 and 59 years. They were accused of deception, appropriation and fraudulent use and had previously appeared before the criminal department at the Court of First Instance which sentenced the first to five years in jail, the second to 4 years and the remainder to two years each but they appealed against the ruling to appear again before the Court of Appeals. To go back to the facts, the first defendant, the principal one (32 years),
Voters cast their votes
There were around 13 thousand polling stations.
As for the legislative elections, the number of seats in parliament was fixed at 189 seats divided between 26 electoral districts.
* Popular Unity Front (26 lists) gold
* Progressive Socialist Party (16 lists) yellow
* Zaghwan (Aldhamir list) honey-colored
* Safaqis 1 (November 7th support list) marble-colored
"I was surprised by the large number of Tunisians turning out at the polling stations to elect the country's president and their representatives in parliament, especially women of different ages and educational levels, in a very normal atmosphere. I think privacy in polling stations is an important matter in conferring transparency and credibility on these elections which represent a vital step in deepening the democratic trend in Tunisia."
Mr. Adbulhameed Belkadhi, president of the Socialist Union of Popular forces, Kingdom of Morocco:
Mr. Antoine Aql, honorary president of the International Lawyers' Association:
Tunis - weekly: Tunisians, of all social groups, often abandon reasonable and sensible consumption during the month of Ramadan. The common trait, with everyone, is to flock to buy and spend products. Statistics show that  the consumption of food products of all types multiplies by hundreds of times compared to normal times, for example bread consumption rises by 30%, meat and poultry by 30 to 50%, eggs by 98%, fish by 250% and dates by 408%.
In this context, Mr. Altaher al-Gharbi of the National Food Institute says that physical and mental activity lessen during the month of Ramadan compared to normal days and so, logically, should the relative amount of food consumed by a person, but this contrary to what happens.
In it, we find all kinds of meats and fruits as well as sweets, carbonated beverages, dried fruits... the list grows with appetites at Ramadan with no relation to "each according to his means."
Another aspect is no less important and that is the health repercussions of unwise eating habits. Sources at the National Food Institute say that many citizens whose health deteriorates come to the Institute during the month of Ramadan as a result of overeating and consuming large quantities of fats and sugars. Some of those whose condition worsens during the month of Ramadan are those with diabetes and hypercholesterolemia who are meant to follow a specific diet and retain a good nutritional balance in each meal but they forget this when faced with the appetites of the month of Ramadan!
Surely the consumer has a right to know the price and conveniently choose and compare the cost of goods?
17% of professionals fully or partially display prices but in an unclear manner.
this section has various kinds of poultry, pigeons, partridge, rabbits, all animals we like to eat once in a while and when we come here, we find no indication of price so we have to ask and prices vary from one vendor to another without us knowing which one is right."
Other sectors as well
When the consumer has to choose between asking for prices to be displayed or contacting a consumer protection organization or the Ministry of Tourism, Trade and Crafts, he may come across some problems with vendors, especially if he chooses the first option.
The Consumer Protection Organization and Ministry of Trade agencies are his only recourse in this context and he has to resort to them because displaying prices is one of his basic rights regardless of the breaches.
However, we know that it is normal for a married man to wear a wedding ring but what is noticeable is that a large number of married men do not do so and for a myriad of reasons.
Unfaithfulness a possibility:
Of course, the question of wedding rings does not cover all married couples because however much we try, we cannot read the minds and intentions of every single person.
Tunis - Weekly: After the infection of mobile phones spread through classes in secondary schools, it is now the turn of students in primary schools. But this infection cannot conceal the many services mobile phones offer parents who can now make contact to check on their children at any moment and keep watch on them from a distance, especially as work prevents many from keeping an eye on their children until they return home in the evening. However, the negative side of these services is that students are losing their ability to concentrate in class as many of them purposely leave their phones on during lessons to receive calls and messages, making them a source of disruption in the class, not to mention ringing tones of every color and kind.
Eman al-Hamidi
The poet Mohamed Al-Saghir Awlaad Ahmed said at a Ramadan soiree last Wednesday, where the Tunis City Cultural Center audience met as part of the cultural society's monthly activity in this space, that the song played no role in his becoming a well-known poet...
My relationship with Amina is one of shared humanity
Happy with this experience
In talking about Arabic songs today, Mohamed Al-Saghir Awlaad Ahmed said we are nearly always dealing with one song only in terms of content. The Arab world has distinguished composers, musicians and performers but an abject paucity of lyrics which are both convincing and enjoyable because the noble message of art is not a solution to the creator's personal problems... the message of art is nobler and bigger than this general direction Arabic song is taking. In brief, if all poems continue to center on one subject only, then the song will not progress.
49 Bodies Found of Recruits in New Iraqi Army:
The circumstances of the attack were not immediately clear nor whether the diplomat met with his death inside the airport or in the surrounding area.
Information suggests that the dead soldiers were ambushed on their way back from a desert training camp and were unarmed.
She said "the victims' bodies were taken to a National Guard base in Mandaley" which lies 120 km to the east of Baquba.
Doctor Nazar al-Hittiof Hit Hospital near Albaghdadi said "we received 11 bodies and 23 wounded."
The source, who wished to remain anonymous, added "this morning, the body of policeman Mohamed Awda Abbas who was taken hostage by unknown persons was found riddled with bullets in the center of Ramadi."
Elsewhere, the Iraqi defense minister announced the day before yesterday the resumption of negotiations aimed at calming the situation in Fallujah and preventing a military attack on the town which has been subject to intensive American air and artillery bombing over the past few days.
Nouakchott (FP) - Judiciary sources in Nouakchott announced that nine officers from the Mauritanian army arrested in October accused of being involved in two failed coup attempts recently appeared in court in Rosso (southwest).
The arrested civilians include three from Mali who were driving a truck carrying "arms the revolutionaries acquired from abroad" which the authorities found in September, the sources added.
Two martyrs in Gaza... and Israeli incursion into Nablus camp
Palestinian sources said the two martyrs were Abu Mustapha and Sharif Muslim, both aged twenty. They were killed by a missile fired by an Israeli reconnaissance plane and were part of a group of six people who were on what appears to be a night watch patrol in anticipation of an Israeli incursion.
He added "in the coming week, a first draft of the project will be voted on at the Knesset."
In a Suicide Attack Claimed by the "Taliban" Movement:
The spokesman was not able to give the victim's age or identity.
A previous report on the attack mentioned two people killed including the suicide attacker and nine wounded among them the foreign woman.
The last attack in Kabul on August 29 led to nine people being killed, among them two Americans, when a car bomb exploded outside a building containing the offices of American security company, "Deancorp," which provides security for the Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
We learned that the suspect was brought before the judicial authorities at the Court of First Instance in Soussa in a state of arrest and that a prison warrant has been issued until he appears in court.
A few days later, he received the treasure but later found that the coins in his possession were not gold and realized he had fallen into the trap of a clever swindler.

He added that over seventy Palestinians have been wounded to date in the incursion, including ten in serious condition.
Palestinian security forces said more than thirty armored vehicles and seven bulldozers, which were stationed in the Khan Younis sector on Sunday, entered 800 meters into the Palestinian sector and occupied an entire neighborhood as helicopters circled overhead.

However, official Palestinian sources said Arafat is well and is simply suffering from a bad cold.
Responsible Palestinian medical sources had said before this that President Yasser Arafat was recovering from his illness, denying Israeli rumors about his deteriorating condition and said he was continuing to fast.
The day before yesterday, Saudi newspaper "Al-Jazeera" reported the Palestinian minister as saying that President Arafat is still conducting his work, meetings, correspondence and contacts as usual and is sending letters to various sides and issuing orders, demonstrating the stability of his health condition,
Abu al-Naja denied that President Arafat's office had asked Israel to allow him to leave the compound headquarters to undergo surgery in Egypt, describing this as rumors circulated by Israel.
The Indictment Division at the Court of Appeal in Tunis charged the suspects with a series of indictments related to the holding, consumption, possession, ownership, sale, transport, purchase, handling and distribution with the aim of dealing in a class B drug, and with forming, managing, joining and participating in a gang inside and outside the country in order to commit these crimes, the preparation and use of a site to consume and distribute drugs, and the storing and hiding drugs, in accordance with chapters 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8 of Law No. 52 for the year 1992 dated May 18, 1992.

The press statement by the delegation, which also includes two African parliamentarians, election experts and representatives of non-government organizations as members, consisted of a set of remarks about the election process which took place in Tunisia two days ago.
They also noted the presence of candidate representatives in some polling stations." In addition, the delegation said in its statement that voting operations were conducted in accordance with current legislation, stressing that it generally noted "a tangible improvement in democracy and the organization of the election process" in Tunisia.
Tunis - Assabah: It seems the problem of flying around 3500 pilgrims who had been granted visas but could not find a means of transport has been somewhat solved... after Saudi Airlines and Tunis Air put on additional flights to carry a substantial number of pilgrims... "Assabah" was alone in publishing full details of this problem mid-month.

Preliminary Results for General Population and Housing Census to be Made Public Soon
Rafiq Ben Abdullah
An official source at the Tunisia Transport Company told us that forms for this survey will be distributed over a period of ten days and that these forms will be distributed by 10 employees known for the ability to communicate with citizens. The same source said that around 750 interviewees will be asked questions during peak hours.
Improving services
In the question about overcrowding and journeys not being frequent enough, which increases overcrowding, the same source said overcrowding was not solely the company's responsibility but the joint responsibility of the transport company and other partners such as municipal councils, as well as that of the citizen which often leads to stoppage in the system.
No doubt someone reflecting on the composition of this index will have a number of questions about Tunisia's ranking according to this classification, especially as Tunisia is a reference - at least in terms of its geographic surroundings - in many economic and social indexes which have grown positively as the rate of growth of the gross domestic product or economy in general is about 5.5% per annum. It has maintained this pattern in spite of international oscillations in recent years. The percentage of schooling is 99% in the 6 to 12 year-old age range while the general percentage of schooling is 75%. The rate of individual income is around 2800 dollars and life expectancy at birth has exceeded 72 years. Other economic and social indexes are also relatively positive.
In spite of the qualitative addition offered by the Human Development Index and in addition to the financial aspect, the human aspect such as health, poverty and the standard of living was taken into consideration ... as this information is helpful in making comparisons between countries (see list), bringing out its shortcomings and improving it.
From Another Angle
However, the second operation, which is still in the negotiation phase after the recent visit to Tunisia by the head of the Dubai stock exchange, differs from the previous operation through the absence of price regulation between the Tunisia and Dubai stock exchanges. This means that shares in the Tunisian company will be bought and sold on the Dubai stock exchange only and the price of its shares in dollars cannot be transferred into Tunisia stock exchange prices in dinars. This will bring foreign currency in the long term, contrary to "BIAT" where the majority of shares listed in London and in dollars were transferred to dinars and sold on the Tunisian stock exchange. In other words, foreign currency brought in by this bank was eventually withdrawn.
It should be noted here that the Tunisian economy currently depends on bank financing at a level of about 95% and, consequently, the 20% target cannot be achieved without reducing the level of involvement by banks which themselves require financing.
Tunis - Assbah: The number of industrial companies whose industrial certification programs were approved at the end of last September of this year and since the program was launched in the mid-Nineties has reached 1862 companies, with investments worth 024,817,2 million dinars of which 9.363 million dinars for non-financial investments and 8.27 million dinars related to identifying investment opportunities.
With regard to the food industry, the number of companies having received approval for their certification programs was 263 companies at the end of September, receiving credit worth 648 million dinars and subsidies reaching 85 million dinars. 3 dossiers for industrial companies in the sector have been refused while another 185 dossiers are being examined for the purpose of approval.
Issue of the Moment
On the other side - the south - of the Mediterranean, there is a question that begs to be asked and that is: what conception do the Mediterranean partners have about the nature of this relationship?
The European Union is also relatively politically resigned with regard to issues concerning the region, particularly the Arab-Israeli conflict, a conflict with dangerous repercussions in terms of the region's security and stability, since intervention is limited to funding and does not involve internal politics in general.
This is what is generally related to the economic aspect but as for the third axis, that of the social and cultural aspect, in addition to cooperation in the areas of education, culture, fighting racism and the rights of immigrants, it also stipulates the prevention of clandestine immigration.
Stable horizons... thanks to the state
This drop is mainly due to the 8.9% decrease in revenue from interest on loans as well as the slump in currency revenue contrary to revenue from interest on customer banking services which showed a slight increase of 8.1%.

The rhythm of events in "Hotel" has lost its sparkle but its content remains cohesive in which Faisal Bilzain has come to the forefront as an actor with a special presence in his role as "Sateesh" in the series "Al-Khitab maa Albab".

Occupation Forces Begin Withdrawal after Two Days of Attacks:
In addition to 17 Palestinian deaths, 83 Palestinians were wounded, 12 among them 20 children 15 of whose injuries were described as serious, in the course of an operation by the army to put a stop to the firing of rockets from the Khan Younis area against nearby Jewish settlements.

His death brings the death toll to 4532 since the Palestinian Intifada broke out in late September 2000, among them 3502 Palestinians and 956 Israelis.
Occupied Jerusalem (FP) - Members of the Israeli Knesset voted yesterday evening in favor of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's plan for withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and some of the settlements in the West Bank next year.
In a moderate speech the day before yesterday, Sharon strove to reassure international public opinion and the Arab countries neighboring Israel about his intentions, saying that the plan was not aimed at freezing the political process with the Palestinians.
Sharon, who was interrupted many times forcing head of parliament Raufain Revlin to dismiss far-right deputies strongly opposed to the disengagement plan, added "we cannot forever rule millions of Palestinians whose numbers are increasing generation after generation."
Sharon made a strong appeal to settlers in Gosh Emonim, who have been loyal to him over a long period of time, to behave in a responsible manner and act as a barrier against "enmity between brothers" and "deadly extremism."
He went on "I will make every effort to reach peace" with the Palestinians, stressing that his country was facing a "critical choice" and adding that "we will not succeed in our task by force alone."
Missing explosives.
The months following the fall of Baghdad and invasion of Iraq were marked by a series of political crises and scandals and no doubt the scandal of tons of missing explosives will not be the last link in this long chain but may just be a new chapter added to previous chapters of the war in Iraq and which may contribute to revealing some missing threads at the present time.
While waiting for the American administration to solve the puzzle of the vanishing explosives or openly admit its failure to control the security situation in Iraq, Iraqis find themselves facing further fears about what use the vast explosives might be put with the prevailing situation in Iraq and the absence of peace and stability.
Over the past few days, investigators with the National Guard's central drug prevention team (headquarters: Wardiya) have uncovered two drug smuggling rings from a neighboring country in order to offer them for sale in our country. They arrested five people, among them a young Moroccan, and seized around 6.6 kg of marijuana, a class B drug, after two car chases between the towns of Haidara in the province of Qasrain and Hajib Aliyoun in the province of Qiarawan.
With the second operation, security investigations uncovered the presence of a Moroccan drug smuggling ring. Investigators were able to confirm that four young men, including one Moroccan, were involved in an attempt to smuggle and deal in drugs and accorded the matter the necessary attention such that, during one of the past nights, they were able to arrest the suspects and seize 1.6 kg of drugs from a car with which the arrested men tried to escape from Haidara to Hajib Aliyoun.
Investigators with the National Guard's investigation and inspection team in Aryana concluded their investigations into the case of damage to property involving a well-connected middle-aged man in an area located in the province of Aryana and which caused damage to his neighbor. He was later referred to the public prosecution for investigations to be continued before appearing in court on trial for what he was accused of. The case papers show that a complaint was lodged with the security officers by a citizen who made a complaint about the behavior of one of his neighbors and demanded that a case be brought against him after he deliberately set fire to his place of residence causing financial losses. On the basis of the victim's statement, officers from the above-mentioned security team arrested the suspect. On being questioned, he attempted to dodge the issue but quickly retracted his statement and admitted the whole truth, justifying his actions by his state of intoxication.
No Breaches in Presidential and Parliamentary Elections in Tunisia
- Arab and foreign observers cannot replace local observers and representatives of the opposition candidates, but the presence of foreign observers was one of the means which induced all parties to abide by the law and avoid any rigging or pressure on the electors.
- I believe the success of the Arab observers' mission in a number of Arab countries such as Algeria, Tunisia, Sudan and Djibouti, may encourage the creation of an Arab observatory to monitor elections in Arab countries in order to prove to the world that the Arabs, leaders and people, have a strong belief in the democratic course.
to the state of emergency and taking daring steps to establish political openness. Do you think the conference of the National Democratic Party achieved what you and a group of Egyptian dignitaries called for?
- Reform comes from inside and not from outside. What has been said and will be said about the greater Middle East project and imposing political and cultural reform is important. At this time, we cannot ignore the increasing role of great nations of the world, especially the greatest nation, the United States of America, but it must be emphasized that Arab leaders who were at the Arab summit in Tunisia last May anticipated the Georgia G8 summit and decided to carry out political reforms and support steps toward political change from inside... "by my own doing, not Omar's doing"?
Tunis - Assabah   Mr. Ibrahim Boulihya, member of the Algerian People's Assembly and president of the Algerian branch of the Arab Maghreb Union's state council, published a report on the parliamentary and presidential elections held this October 24, in his capacity as one of the observers invited to monitor the procedural situation at polling stations. The report contained a number of remarks on the election campaign and voting process held in Tunisia three days ago. The report stated: "Since our arrival in Tunisia on October 18, we have been received with the greatest hospitality in terms of accommodation, facilitating our mission and making all means available for us to accomplish our mission impartially, transparently and neutrally."
* The election campaign was conducted within the confines of mutual respect between participating actors and participating election lists, whether at election events or in respecting poster sites allocated to candidates and candidate lists in terms of equal space and number.
- voters came in a normal and orderly manner and in large numbers, demonstrating the importance the Tunisian citizen accords this election day and his contribution to making this challenge a success, as well as his concern in supporting the stability of the country's institutions and defending the gains achieved in this new era.
- Providing election equipment and necessities such as ballot boxes and booths which voters need to perform their electoral duty in accordance with the principle of privacy and confidentiality of voting.
- Ensuring intensive media coverage for the voting operations.
and consolidating the experiment of democratic practice, respecting popular sovereignty and supporting the rewards achieved by the Tunisian people under the auspices of a new era through respect of the Tunisian citizen's rights, his freedom of choice, the active and successful participation of Tunisian women and the mobilization of the Tunisian people behind President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and the Democratic Constitutional Rally.
To Reduce Congestion and Traffic Accidents
This set of measures takes the form of banning heavy trucks weighing over 3.5 tons from traveling in the center of the capital and main roads, southern entrance to the city and route "Z4", Jamhouriya street, Maghreb Arabi Street and main highway number 8 from six in the morning to nine in the morning and from one in the afternoon to four in the afternoon during the month of Ramadan and during application of the one-share scheme.
Our source at the capital municipality also said that to ensure these measures are implemented during the specified times, surveillance patrols from the municipality authorities will be increased in coordination with security officers whereby the necessary deterrent measures will be applied to cars that break the law either by clamping cars or towing them away to the car pound. He said that these measures, which infringers protest about, are not intended by the municipality as a cure or some such other as some believe, but rather to put a stop to reckless behavior and preventing the damage caused by some to the vast majority such as parking in prohibited areas which constricts traffic flow, or double parking or using pavements intended for pedestrians to park cars, breaches which grow worse from day to day. These measures have been implemented on these particular roads because of the volume of traffic they see and which heavy vehicles often disrupt.
In some instances, the consequences of such behavior can be harmful if not tragic in particular cases.
A skirmish took place in the street between a bus driver and the driver of a private car which made the latter angry. He got out of his car, picked up a big club and went at the driver to discipline him but the latter shut his window and the accused smashed the bus' glass. He was arrested and admitted to what he was charged with.
Features and News
In the town of Safaqis especially and other Tunisian towns, there has been a run on salted whale or what is called "Bakalaw". Some sources in the fish markets say that large quantities have been on the market for a while but the price of this fish seems high, especially particular kinds of it.

Beirut (news agencies) - The Lebanese prime minister-designate Omar Karameh announced the day before yesterday that he is forming a government comprised of 30 members among them two women for the first time in Lebanon. This composition is regarded as being completely pro-Syrian, according to Lebanese newspapers published yesterday.
The government also includes bankers whose banking institutions are considered to be among the top ten banks in the country. They are Minister of the Economy Adnan al-Qasar and Minister of Energy Maurice Sahnawi.
The other ministers in the government are known for their direct loyalty to Syria and include Druze ministers. They are opponents of Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, who spearheads the anti-Lahud opposition.
Formation of the new Lebanese government took three days of contacts and talks.
The Lebanese parliament extended Emile Lahud's term on September third to three years.
Opposition newspaper "An-Nahar" and pro-Syria newspaper "As-Safir" reported Karameh's statements who said "nothing better is possible."
Israeli Offensive to Destroy Palestinian Houses in Gaza Strip
No information is yet available about any casualties.
During the same period, a Palestinian citizen was killed in Khan Younis in the southern Strip as a result of Israeli bombing while the occupation army announced the redeployment of its forces in this area which has seen increased military operations that killed 17 Palestinians.
Latest Developments in Ghar Aldima':
We previously published preliminary details of the incident and said at the time that its conditions and details were still shrouded in mystery, but men from the above-mentioned security team had recently unmasked the circumstances surrounding the crime. The suspects were referred to the public prosecutor's office to pursue investigations before bringing the case to the courts and releasing the two relatives.
On being arrested, the two relatives completely and utterly denied what they were accused of and insisted on their innocence. The officers' doubts increased with regard to the daughter and they closed in on her until she broke down and confessed to the truth.
Risks Posed ... How will they be Dealt with?
as seen many times with the fading of leaders at specific political moments or periods... and while it might be hard to say that the Tunisian parliament with its varied political factions has produced a new elite in the previous two parliamentary eras, the presence of solid political leaderships along the lines of Mohamed Harnel, Mohamed Bouchiha, Ibrahim Hafaidhiya, Mohamed al-Taroudi, al-Tijani Hadad, Fuad al-Qarqawi and others has made it possible to find a basis for parliamentary debate which has at times risen to the level of a political discussion with which some government members have engaged, in one way or another,  through their reactions and responses.
But all this remained imprisoned within the walls of parliament and the wording of the official guidelines of the Tunisian republic for neither the Tunisian newspapers reflected this controversy and debate, with the exception of some newspapers which can be counted on the fingers of one hand, nor did this rapprochement develop into positions on the laws brought before parliament.
* Creating a relationship of dialogue and interaction with the Tunisian press that would - contrary to the disputes, dissimulations and tactics that boil over in parliament -be of use to the government and developmental work in general, whether in its economic and social aspects or in its political aspects.
Rate of contamination of foodstuffs no more than 1.2% out of 1629 total samples
When foodstuff contaminated with Listeria is eaten, Listeriosis can develop in fragile bodies such as the elderly, babies, pregnant women and those with diabetes. It particularly affects the nervous system. Its symptoms are generally similar to a cold accompanied by urinary tract and digestive system disorders such as vomiting and diarrhea and it causes inflammation of the meninges. It can lead to miscarriages in pregnant women.
This committee's work is distinguished by a field study in stages. It began in early June 2001 and continued over three years with the agency asking laboratories involved to provide a monthly account of the research results.

After questioning the suspects, who appeared under a detention order, and allowing for making legal arguments, the court decided to put the case on hold for arbitration and to pronounce judgment at a later time.
Detectives from the Investigation and Search Unit of the National Guard in Al Mahdia have foiled within the past few days a clandestine operation at sea from the outset.
In view of the importance of the information, detectives gave it proper attention and consequently conducted intense inquiries that yielded several pieces of information on the identity of three of the sailors, who turned out to be natives of rural areas located within Mahdia proper.

* Bachelors degrees, professorship, current and closed bank accounts * judgments in cases of those who managed to move to France with these documents
Although the suspects kept on working in secret with absolute professionalism and extreme caution over the span of two years in which they made it possible for many people to fulfill their dreams and move to France where they have settled, the unit's agents were on the lookout for them this time.  They uncovered the truth about their dangerous activity which was forging important documents that are difficult for the average person to obtain except through very rigorous and strict administrative procedures by the ministry, supplemented by authentic and administrative seals.
Agents from the National Security Center at Haisher Circle are looking into the files of a theft case in which the victim, a third-year female student who came to the capital for the first time, lost a doctorate dissertation, a sum of money estimated at two thousand seven hundred dinars, and a collection of personal papers.
The victim contacted us and begged us to appeal to any philanthropists who may find the case and the papers related to her dissertation to contact her at the earliest opportunity to help prevent the loss of her future, especially since she is faced with waiting for two more years to present her doctorate dissertation..

The plane carrying Arafat landed at a military airbase near Paris at 13:30 noon local time (11:30 GMT) yesterday.
Nabil Abu Redina, the Palestinian president's advisor, said that the Palestinian officials are satisfied with Israel's permission for Arafat's return as soon as his condition allows it.
The French Defense Ministry said that the plane was forced to avoid Israeli airspace because France does not have a permanent agreement with Israel regarding the use of Israeli airspace.
The Palestinian Foreign Minister, Nabil Shaath, who travels with the Palestinian president, said that doctors need to accurately determine the cause of Arafat's illness.
Shaath said that all of the institutions are ready to run Palestinian affairs in Arafat's absence.
It is very touching, everybody is crying.
He insisted that Arafat was not poisoned, and he is not suffering from blood cancer (leukemia).
He looked weak and pale, albeit smiling.
On a different front, the New China News Agency reported that China had offered help to the Palestinian Authority President, whom it described as an exceptional leader, for the sake of his complete recovery.

It began with a woman who was stopped by a man whose features implied that he had reached the third decade of his life as he projected an image of grace and dignity.  He asked this woman to lead him to a poor family who is in dire need in the neighborhood or neighborhoods in the vicinity of the woman's home because she knew her neighbors and was familiar with their situations, and considering that he is a stranger to this area and that he came to this place because of his love for charity especially during the holy month of Ramadan.  He had been visiting various neighborhoods and cities, and during each visit, he would offer help to deserving families or individuals.  In view of the honest intentions of this person, the woman quickly informed him that her neighbor so-and-so was a widow and mother of orphans, and that she was exhausted by the hassles of making a living for her kids, and that she was more deserving than others for his help.  With this advice, she thought that she is contributing to affirming the good intentions of this person and putting them to good use.

Did Arafat lose consciousness?
N - News Agencies) News reports have conflicted about the real illness that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is suffering from and whether or not he is inflicted with blood cancer leukemia.
Shaheed said in statements to reporters that doctors are examining Arafat's condition to determine the illness of which he is suffering.
N.
N is incorrect.
The sources said that due to this development in Arafat's condition, Palestinian leaders will hold meetings in Ramallah for the purpose of determining the measures that must be taken for the next phase and allocating responsibilities and tasks.
Aides said that Arafat (75 years) will undergo tests to be conducted over several days to check the drop in his blood platelets count, a condition that can be caused by leukemia.
Mohamed Rasheed, another Arafat aide, was asked about the condition of the Palestinian president and said that doctors need at least 72 hours to diagnose his condition.
They asserted that the Palestinians are the ones who had the discussions and obtained Israeli guarantees in this regard before they headed to France.
Amid these developments, yesterday in Ramallah in the West Bank, the second-ranking official in the Palestine Liberation Organization, Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), called on all forces of the Palestinian people to unite and affirmed the continuation of contact with the Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and receiving his directives.
With Events
However, what happened was the opposite when Osama Bin Laden appeared at a critical time after a long absence of his voice, and a longer absence of his image.  He appeared to be in such health and form that it stunned everyone after the American Administration had previously circulated the idea of the likelihood of the Al Qaeda leader's death.. as well as taking big legal steps.  Only four days prior to the American presidential election - which is likely to be no less exciting and ambiguous than the preceding one that was held in the year 2000.. and the results of which will not be decisive or clear until the day of the voting - Bin Laden made his move giving John Kerry the sweetest present that even his election campaign, throughout which he spent billions of dollars, was not able to give him and neither could former American President Bill Clinton, who Kerry had waited a long time for him to recover from his illness in order to support his election campaign in an attempt to oust the Republican opponent George Bush.
American policy has resulted, especially the stance on the Middle East conflict and the war in Iraq, in dire consequences for the security of the world as a whole.. as chaos, turmoil, violence, bombing, assassinations and kidnappings have become the hallmarks of the world today.. Following the blasts of September 11, 2001, the world has turned upside down, feeding terrorism which struck all over the world and rendered no place safe from explosions and terrorist acts.  American influence has extended everywhere under the pretext of pursuing the terrorists and eradicating terrorism.. The result produced was the opposite.. as terrorism continued and doubled, and American dominance, injustice and tyranny increased.. Security and safety have become non-existent and the biggest loser in all of this is mankind everywhere.
The scuffle resulted in injuring two people, the condition of whom was described as serious.  One of them was transferred to Munji Selim Hospital after he was stabbed in the chest, while the other casualty was transferred to the neurology department at the Rabita Hospital after he received a blow to the head by an iron chain, requiring that he be admitted to the intensive care unit after he slipped into a coma from which he has not yet recovered as of the time of writing this report.  Three suspects, reported by witnesses as being involved in the disturbances, were detained while the search continued in order to detain the rest.

Meanwhile, some other cab drivers, especially those working on the Nabel-Bani Kheyar route reported that their means of transportation were burglarized by unknown individuals who took advantage of the car being unattended by removing one of its doors or breaking its triangular glass and then stealing items that were light-weight but valuable.

According to Dr. Amin Selim, this virus is not as serious as the flu virus, which exists following the appearance of another virus similar to the Adeno virus.  As for the correlation between fasting and contracting this illness, the same source affirmed that a normal person may fast despite his infliction with this virus, which is not considered serious.
In this respect, the required quantities estimated at about 170 thousand doses annually have been made available.
Cherie Blair attacks Bush.. and Kennedy's daughter protests the use of her father's name in his election campaign
The wife of Tony Blair, Washington's biggest ally, commented on Bush's policies on gays and expressed her satisfaction on the Supreme Court's decision that reversed laws passed, especially in Texas, that punish gays and she described this decision as a model of good judicial reasoning.
The attack by the Prime Minister's wife on the American Republican Party's candidate for the presidential elections, which will be held tomorrow, Tuesday, in the United States, comes while the daughter of former American President John Kennedy, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, in turn, strongly protested the use of her father's name by the American President George Bush in his election campaign.
President Bush has embarked recently on calling on moderate Democrats to support him and to talk about Democratic presidents who enjoyed immense popularity such as John Kennedy, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, or Lyndon Johnson.
Polls have frequently shown that most Britons feel uncomfortable with the Blair-Bush friendship and their joint policy with regards to Iraq.
Tunisians and Eid El Fitr
Ali (citizen and father of two children): I have been going around stores for hours to buy some ready-made clothes for my two children, but the prices are soaring hot, and I wonder if it is possible to buy one or two pieces for the both of them with this month's budget.
Fake discounts
The flea market is the solution
Upon questioning the owners of ready-made clothes stores about this competition, the Weekly noticed that there is anger on their part.  They asserted that it is an unfair competition and hurts the national product, which must be defended and protected.  Mohamed Al Jaridi (salesman) said, It is senseless that I incur taxes, store overhead, and pay miscellaneous expenses to offer such products then we find, on the other hand, a person selling some outdated junk on street corners to compete with me.  This is senseless.  Frankly, this sector is destroying both the industry and commerce and must be monitored because the fabric industry has been hurt as we, the wholesale and retail merchants, have.

A significant cross section of Tunisians is deprived every year of enjoying such atmospheres.  This cross section is the class of students who spend Ramadan away from family because of their studies.  We can almost say that female students miss being away from home, family, and Ramadan ambiance much more.
Najlaa, an Arabic-major freshman student says: This is my first year for me at the residence, and, therefore, spending the month of Ramadan away from my family is really a difficult thing for me, but the ambiance at the residence compensates somewhat for my missing the family setting since we make sure at the residence to have breakfast together.  As for evenings, we spend them in front of the television or at the residence when the residence management organizes active and cultural evenings inside the residence.
Therefore, they have no problems with the residence owners.
Some other students, who are well-off enough to enjoy some of the best Ramadan evenings, prefer family settings.  In this regard, Miss Yasmin, a law student, says: I live with my sister in an apartment at Wajh Al Karaa.  Although we make sure to accept the invitations of friends to go out and enjoy Ramadan evenings, my sister and I are always in agreement to spend the evening at home since I am studying and I am compelled to give some attention to my studies and not slack off during this month.  In addition, we make sure to accept the invitations of relatives who give us special attention during this month.
Actress Samia Al Ayyari
- This role came along the path I had sought to follow by expanding the circle of my creative experience outside of Tunisia.. The start was through contact with the Arab Cinema and Television Center in Jordan, which quickly accepted my request.
- I did not have any difficulty considering my big love for drama acts that have mythical and historical flavor.  I was very impressed with the scenario because of its charge and dramatic plot and because it is written in classic Arabic language.
- Yes.. With all humility I can say that I won this bet as witnessed by all of those who performed this grand drama project
- Absolutely.. You cannot compare Kawther in Scheherazade and the Last Tale and Samah in Accountabilities and Reprimand

* Are there any characters that impressed you in this project?
* Do you think that you are heading in the direction you planned?
All means have been tried to develop a new or sophisticated format for the Tunisian Song Festival to free it of monotony and stagnation.. It seems that the solution lies in having the National Orchestra for Music present an evening of Tunisian song at the end of each month.  At the conclusion of such evening, a ceremony to honor the best two singing performances will be held and two token awards will be presented.  This will lead to the final award ceremony to be held at the end of the year to honor the festival's best 3 singing performances and to present the grand awards following the elimination stage.  This way, we guarantee our National Orchestra that it will always be active in addition to revitalizing the singing stage and turning the wheel of musical production in our country all year round.  We also would guarantee the availability of Tunisian singers, composers, and lyricists on the artistic scene.

Bloody clashes in Ramadi.. Number of marines killed in Anbar rises to 9
With that, the number of American army's deaths since the invasion of Iraq in March of last year rises to 1113, according to statistics by the American Department of Defense (the Pentagon).
Eye witnesses indicated that three American soldiers were injured in the detonation of an explosive device that targeted a (marines) patrol in the city.
While the American forces are preparing to launch a major offensive on Fallujah and Ramadi, one of Fallujah's officials said that contacts continued yesterday between members of a city delegation and the National Interim Council (Parliament), which will, in turn, make contacts with the interim government to resolve the crisis peacefully.
He also announced the arrest of a former Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council, Ezzat Ibrahim Al Duri, although he did not mention him by name.
Gaza - Ramallah (News Agencies) - The Palestine News Network reported yesterday that in another twist that demonstrates the occupation troops' sadism and perversion, soldiers from an Israeli unit that had stormed the town of Bourka north of the city of Nablus depicted images and sexual insinuations on posters of martyrs that are placed on the walls.
Sheikh Khalid Abu Hussein contended that this act violates religious doctrines because it violates the sanctity of martyrs and is a violation of norms and national values of people.
Settler wounded
The Martyr Ezzedine Al Qassam Brigades, the military wing of the Palestinian Resistance Movement Hamas, claimed in a statement responsibility for launching five mortar shells at the Israeli settlement of Morag near Rafah.
Prior to that, Israeli television announced that the Israeli Foreign Ministry recommended to the government to stop the policy of assassinations unless it is related to an imminent danger.
The first is preliminarily accused of having intercourse with a female under the age of eighteen with her consent and participating in an illegal abortion; the second is accused of performing an illegal abortion procedure; and the third and fourth are accused of participating in an illegal abortion procedure.  The case's sequence of events covered the cities of Tunis and Siliana.
However, an anonymous letter was received by the Pubic Prosecutor's Office in which the sender reported that the young woman had had intercourse and that an illegal abortion procedure had been performed on her.  The judicial authority then issued a order to open an investigation in the case, which was carried out by detectives from the Judicial Police Unit at the national security region in Siliana.

Tunis - Al Sabah: Al Sabah has learned from sources close to the Liberal Social Party that the party's chairman, Mr. Munir Al Baji, intends to call the party's convention to session in one of the European countries instead of Tunisia during the next period.. In order to investigate the truth about the latest developments with regards to the next convention of the Liberal, we contacted Mr. Munir Al Baji who confirmed to Al Sabah that the possibility of calling the convention to session abroad is very likely, indicating that the proposed European country may be France or - most likely - England, where the headquarters of the World Liberal Organization are located.
The upcoming days will determine the directions of the choices for the next phase with regards to the party's direction and its future, whether as related to the next convention or to the various issues that the party will discuss from the view point of its assessment of the past phase, especially its participation in past elections and the extent of exploring future outlooks.

When the Arab imagination is incapable of creating laughter
Although the Arab satellite stations made us truly enjoy these clips, they made us face a painful reality represented in the failure of the Arab imagination incapability to create laughter.  The Hidden Camera was tried for years and years and started to lose its appeal year after year because its creators assumed it was easy. So they fabricated it and turned it into pre-planned sketches, which was realized by the audience.  Besides, it has become repetitive and old and lost its humor.  As a matter of fact, some clips were inspired by the comic clips we mentioned.
An Evening With Singer Ali Al Deek Who Comes from Syrian Countryside:
The audience was surprised to know that this artist has to his credit many mountainous rural songs that bring together the Syrian, Iraqi, Lebanese, Jordanian, and Palestinian.  His songs have a unique sweetness, and his voice has an artistic depth that does not exist in any of the artists in the Arab Orient, specifically in Syria. The song is one of those dancing songs to the point of hysteria if you will, but not the type of sick hysteria. It is the addiction that music inspires when it is beautiful and stimulating to the human soul.
In a word, this evening was enjoyable.  It uncovered a real artist who knew how to preserve the sweet, rural Syrian song with its dance movements and rhythms, and with its heroic stories and magnificent virgin love.. This is combined with interacting with modern rhythms, use of modern instruments, and appeal for quiet dancing.. or rowdy dancing to the point of addiction, as it is known to fans of authentic Arabic singing.

This event recurred with George Bush senior, whose military victory in the second Gulf War for the liberation of Kuwait did not help him.
Although Bush and Kerry intentionally outbid each other, during the three debates that brought them together, as far as Israel's security was concerned, each of them also was careful not to bring up the Palestinian issue, which was discussed only causally and at occasions memory fails to recall.
No matter what changes that the next American administration, whether Republican or Democrat, makes in direction or plans during the rest of the first decade of the twenty-first century, America's interests and priorities will remain the same as the current interests that were set by former leaders in the White House and which dictate that America maintains dominance over the energy resources in the world and will not allow anyone to threaten such interests.
Occupied Jerusalem (News Agencies) The Abu Ali Mustapha Brigades, the military wing of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, claimed responsibility for the Tel Aviv guerrilla operation, which inflicted five Israeli dead and more than 40 wounded.
Because it is the only way to end the cycle of violence.
After a guerrilla entered one of the stores in the market, which was jammed with shoppers, just before noon, and then he detonated himself.
The last Palestinian guerrilla operation had taken place on the 22nd of last September when a Palestinian woman detonated herself at a major crossroad in Occupied Jerusalem resulting in the killing of two Israeli soldiers.
57% of establishments in Tunisia are looking for partners
It also reported that 41% of these establishments put searching for new markets on top of their plans due to their belief that improving the product and making it more competitive are key to the success of the establishment.
The study shows, from another perspective, that 60% of companies have an export group without a manager fully dedicated to this task, thereby hindering the export process.
Topic of the Hour: Demographic Transformations
So, what is behind these transformations, and what is the extent of their impact on the course of development and also the impact on public choices in terms of managing expenditures?
This impact will be severe in the developing countries since the growth rate will shrink by a half point during the next fifty years.  Also, savings will shrink, and consequently, investments will slump, as the elderly usually consume during retirement all means of savings available to them, which will reflect on the current balances of these countries due to the rise in expenditures to finance social funds.
Conversely, the developing countries do experience other types of problems.  The ratio of young people in these societies is an asset that supports economic growth, provided that good training is made available, and consequently, providing significant financial resources to build the basic infrastructure that is appropriate for modern factors such as health and research.. Also, all of these countries are urged to plan now for adapting their budgets on retirement and health regulations in order not to experience a deficit in the financial resources allocated for these areas and to avoid what is happening in Germany now, for instance.
Ramallah - Paris (News Agencies) - With the declaration of the Palestinian Authority on its rejection of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's statements calling for an alternative Palestinian leadership, officials announced the stabilization of President Yasser Arafat's health condition and his response to treatment while awaiting the results of final tests, perhaps today.

Tunis - Al Sabah: Following the fall of amounts of rain in most areas of the country, the rain stopped and a soaring heat wave, which reminded us of the heat of the past July and August, took hold.  This heat led in many areas to a wave of a host of fears among the farming communities, which experienced a delay in their autumn farming activities in all of its aspects and types, especially those related to major produce.. Nevertheless, with the return of rain during the beginning of this week and its continuation until yesterday, faces lit up and joy and hope returned to the hearts in preparation for intensive farming activity.. So what was the extent of the impact of these rains on the agricultural sector overall and also on the produce and its properties, and it be said that the rains of the past two days came just in time to save the season?
As for the central regions, the amounts fallen in most areas ranged between 15 ml. and 18 ml. or below.

The soldiers who are willing to sacrifice and put their life in danger are disappearing. This is a major deference between the security and the militants.
One example of that is the King of Bahrain,
The royal family has lost a great chance to compensate its loss of credibility. The official words are still as they have always been.
It is then followed by a great religious and media campaign.
I want to apologize for the premature title that I wrote in a hurry,
here are the key words that are able to summarize this imminent political moment: resistance,
standing in front of you coinciding with the fourth anniversary for liberation of Lebanon,
its glorious lessons taught every Arabic citizen,
Here we have to remember the "April understanding" which; embodied one of the most successful diplomatic battles in establishing the right of citizens of an occupied land to resist,
with Syria’s coordination and its supervision to those "Mujahedien =holy combatant",
and thirdly, some of these are repeated and reran which suggests that the paralysis that hit the Arabic world decision centers had caused it to petrify and became unable to react, if not to save their homeland yet to keep their personal dignity,
and who refuse the title of the presidency because they see it as less stature.
Some in the Arab league want to be completely liberated from their national identity, and not just its politics. They do not want to be bound by their Arabism and all its implications,
solidarity, economy, common defense,
and everything that connect them with their identity from any futuristic plan for this vast land from Morocco to Indonesia .
so that the foreign hegemony will not achieve its goal in imposing on us humiliating conditions.
Tunis, (and Libya recently), Egypt,
when the enlighten pioneer found the path to their common identity for these vanquished and lost people for more than one thousand year,
Arabism freed us from the Turks without leaving Islam as a religion and without becoming the infidel west.
The first pioneers engaged in several battles on several fronts,
a state where all its citizens are not discriminated against based on religion, ethnicity, or color.
societies,
everything around us is in a shamble,
the Arabic person almost will deny his dark skin,
and accept Israel and reject each other.
The result of all these entities will not lead to a union, unity or solidarity based on: move or walk in the steps of the weakest among you.
When the ideological foundation for nationalism ideology became unbalanced and establishing it by suggestion,
or they lived abroad and imported slogan that it was not for it or for our societies,
and then the regional state that was built too fast is unable to stand to the demand of life in this alluring area,
whether it is the Israeli who occupied some of it and built on it its state.
The public attributed to it all the shortcoming of its ideology.
build union states (by force).
The state settled in the land,
and his voice is the source for the legitimacy for decision.
because we did not know it in our land before. We were regions that transferred as states among several empires, between the Ottomans and the Umayyad,
the king, crown prince and the president.
It was impossible for ideological calling, with a goal to ensure belonging to the same identity,
Islam as they believed in it ,
authority and opposition….and what left it from rituals and ignorant dead texts or dead because of its bad meaning,
and they ran &lt;&gt;
even after all the beating that were carried out against them from some in the nationalistic movement in its political symbols after it took over authority positions.
The regional country did endure,
We have to confess that the outside world look at our realty and not our aborted hopes and dreams.
if they dealt with them willingly or by force,
The people are in disarray,
unable to object.
some of partisanship or semi partisanship,
no party or union, no skill union,
his statues for the angry mob, historical museums for market thieves, and the mobs.
there was no political party,
not even those joining by force or need.
and to Islam that the despot borrowed from it the Jihad slogan …. The impossible! The despotic ruler became the king,
and the defeated was to all of them.
This public soon regained his awareness and began to rise to affirm his existence and right to decide This is in Iraq.
All of this in the absent of the Libyan people and without their knowledge.
Arabism is resistance completely .Arabism is rejection to foreign hegemony,
The resistance actually believes in belonging to the land,
and working toward a better future with it,
Without democracy there is no resistance. When the human spirit is crushed there can be no resistance. When a person doesn’t have free will,
When the choice is between a local despotism&lt;&gt;and foreign occupation then it is not worth sacrificing life.
through its long history suffered clear deficiency in its Arabism,
the Arab resistor,
.in Falloujah , as in Najef and karbala , in Mousal and Karkouk as well as in the Dewania,
Arabism is oppressed, chased, repressed,
This is worse what the foreign occupier can do and even despotism, this diminish patriotism and make people in to sheep, some are servants,
and the radical butcher organizations hurt the Arabs and Muslims badly; this feeling toward the Arabs and Islam will not be wiped out except after a long struggle generations to come, maybe.
its patriotic awareness is high,
or religion like Christian in all different denominations.
at this moment,
and whoever fails to believe in it is betraying its tomorrow and not just today.

Accusations 
2003. It became a real choice by far,
The feeling was that Iraq did not fight the concurring American forces and that will encourage the Americans to expand their military adventure and complete everything on their aggressive political agenda,
The Americans cannot claim in front of the Syrians and the Iranians in particular that the occupation of Iraq is a walk in the park and a test for their experience,
but it is limited to fear of spread of the internal Iraqi chaos and instability to outside the Iraqi border by an American decision or by incident that is out of the American desire,
exactly in the same way that they got out of the big Iraqi cities, using temporary agreements that do not serve the general political goals of Iraq!
It is sufficient to start the calm and deep thinking of a humble Iraqi project that would replace the foolish American project and the project of Abu-Mus’ab Al-Zarqawi,

Saudi Arabia: Before Changing the Terror Culture Reality Must Change Following series of bloody events and confrontations between Al-Jehadi’een (Holy Fighters) and security apparatus, the Saudi government is trying to snatch victory from defeat’s claws.
debate, interpretation or explanation. Portraying the opposite equation made up of vicious fighter cells,
who is requested after every armed attack to declare his loyalty, renew his pledge in the mosque, on the street,
Iraq is resisting direct occupation and is going through a hardship of its own specifics that does not apply to the Saudi equation at hand. In summary, after every violent confrontation the government tries to establish new law upon the remains of the dead and the ruins.
is suffering from a slow war may well be called "Low Warfare Intensity" Its latest, what happened in Khubar. This war drains the country economically,
in countries that used to believe and practice such rights. The more so the case in countries that are not bound to such details, rather they refuse them for they conflict with the local culture and timeworn legacy.
in specific, form the two main sources of terrorism in the world.
The Saudi government and the society must believe that real solution to the problem doesn’t lie in the security solution only, and should also learn from the experience of the United States in many areas.
for a pure scientific reason, which is the fact based on the most important intuitive saying: before changing the mind you must change reality. Mind,
it becomes the important engine and the effective tool in shaping the individual,
tendencies and thoughts. Changing reality entails negating some behavior and practices that became coherent to the essence and identity of the government. Some of it is the following: Destroying,
and the religious term it would probably be hypocrisy.) Lately, the gap between stated policy and hidden policy has become larger. While in the past,
it will not succeed so long as the United States is following a policy that is clear in its hostility to the Arab and Muslim issues from Iraq to Palestine crossing other areas and many prisons from Guantanamo to Abu-Ghraib. As long as the government is viewed as a conspirator promoting the interest of the west in the region, it will be useless to preach to be passionate to the foreigner,
The mentality and the practice of hating the foreigner is not a result of a culture it is the result of the double standard reality and contradiction. In changing reality we must destroy double standard and contradiction in the religious stretch. This means that government should quit its failing attempt to convince everyone that it is adopting policies that are appropriate to the religion and its teachings.
While the government presents itself as a symbol of purity and decency, we find it permitting economic, social and political practices that would be least described as not related to the essence of the religion.
Another chapter of double standard and contradiction is the social and economical reality of the foreign western treachery in Saudi Arabia, and the gap between what is permissible for this aiding hand and what is permissible to the people, what those can benefit and what the people can or can not benefit.
Now this group of people is tax exempted and is allowed to sacrifice their sheep on holidays, Muslim style, in back yards letting blood run down the streets and door steps.
Will this reality create fraternal culture, dialogue and accepting one another? Or it will create an exploding situation waiting for a spark to ignite it?
Al-Quds Al-'Arabi has learned that at least to two members of the government forces were killed yesterday at Al-Hamzat area in Su’dah. Also seven others were injured during short military operations by elements that support Bad Al-Din Al-Huthi, who six months ago declared himself Imam for the Muslims,
The sources said that the government carried out this big operation against Al-Huthi and his followers because he did not comply with its demands for him to change his thinking.
The papers said that the government forces used RPGs and other weapons in the area, some of which hit houses where Al-Huthi is hiding. No one was able to get into the area to know the number of the killed and injured in these confrontations which are in their third consecutive day.
The resistance, which seems to follow a systematic plan, is planning not to prevent the transfer of authority on the 30th of the month,
which includes Ba’thists and others. The Battle of Baghdad that is coming soon will cause a clear disruption to the strategy of handing over authority. This will be the basis for the shape of the resistance plan,
They were new elements of the police that were created by the American occupation. The Ba’thist police stations were avoided. It seems that the resistance is directing it activities towards police stations while distinguishing between stations that have Ba’thists in them and those that do have any Ba’thists in them.
so that they can start the plans for withdrawal from Iraq. The United States officially informed many countries that surround Iraq that it is worried because of the increasing Iranian military activity near the border with Iraq. Washington has officially asked Iran not to use the chaos in the Iraqi scene in order to change the realities on the ground.
The current Islamists claim that their existence is a reaction to the fall of the Islamic succession and the spread of occupation and foreign presence in the Arab and Muslim world,

because there are differences in visions and goals between the groups.
like Hamas, Jihad and Hizb Allah.
Can this be achieved or will the claims of having the ultimate truth,
This renewed announcement about the Jordanian position came after news that Jordanian authorities have refused to allow Raghad, the eldest daughter of the former president, to hold a press conference on Thursday at the same time when her father Saddam Hussein will stand in front of Iraqi court when he will be told of his crimes.
The Jordanian government has previously asked Raghad not to do any political or media activities in Jordan. As for the issue of Raghad’s financial and trade activities in Jordan, Khadir said that Raghad and her sister have the right trade in Jordan in order to provide for their families.
Whoever visits Europe from Israel, the country that supports the US with all its force, has to be surprised by this phenomenon and its size.
which is apparent through the making fun of Bush’s religious views. Iraq is at the center of this divide.
It is not an exaggeration to say that many wanted to see America being defeated in Iraq, but it is doubtful that they looked deeply at the consequences of this on the European strategic level.
In general, sending soldiers in an international force, for example to Gaza,
said that relationships with Israel should be based, as in the past, on the memory of the Holocaust,
If Bush supports something, then it is obvious that they have to oppose him immediately regardless of the nature of the issue.

The conservative right in America tries to go around the crisis by saying that this is nothing in comparison to what Saddam used to do. Some of the forces in the Right forget the reality that it is the American media who broke the story, not the Arabs or the Iraqis.

EGYPTIAN LEADERS CONCERNED OVER IMPACTS OF ATTACK ON IRAQ ON EGYPT'S DOMESTIC AFFAIRS
An analyst of Al-Ahram Center for Strategic Studies said Egypt "would see strong protests which can hardly be controlled by the Egyptian regime."
Therefore, the Egyptian President will suppress any public protests against U.S. war on Iraq.
The British paper noted that the Egyptian President shared the same opinion of his opponents of the Muslim Brotherhood on the impacts of the U.S. military campaign against Iraq on the country, believing that the attack would unfavourably affect Arab countries and the world as a whole. America is seeking weak targets following Afghanistan, including Iraq and then Libya, according to a Muslim Brotherhood leader.
According to Fatah officials, Cairo meeting comes after mediation by European countries and Egypt in a bid to persuade Hamas to stop martyrdom operations and armed ambushes which they considered harmful to the efforts of setting up a Palestinian state.
Hamas will be represented in this dialogue by its political bureau chairman, Khaled Meshaal and Mohamed Nizal, Moussa Abou-Marzouk and Imad Al-Alami. Meanwhile, there were several names for chairing Fatah delegation to the meeting including PLO executive committee Mahmoud Abbas (Abou-Mazin) or secretary general of the Palestinian presidency Al-Tayeb Abdel-Rehim or Zakareya Al-Agha.
Purchasing in installments has substituted cash purchasing, a phenomenon that put more burdens on traders who are suffering from sharp recession. Traders are, therefore, compelled to sell their commodities at any price ahead of their expiry dates. Some people describe the Egyptian market as a market of "shop-window viewers rather than buyers."
The high-incomed families purchased half of their purchases last year and a quarter of what they bought in 1998. This means that there is an imbalance that should be redressed. Experts say that salaries increased by 44 per cent in the last four years, while the prices of some basic commodities skyrocketed by 200 per cent.
Noticeably, traders took the depreciation of the pound rate of exchange against the dollar by 35 per cent as a pretext to increase commodity prices. Their trick was exposed when such an increase included domestic commodities that do not include any foreign component. Family providers sustain tremendous pressure, for instance the necessary needs of their families exceed their incomes and, therefore, they should seek another sustenance in order to fulfill their commitments.
Although the Government denied any rise in commodity prices in Ramadan, housewives in the posh Al-Mohandessin district confirm that all requirements are available and that there is a relative demand regardless of price rises due to the high income of people. Strangely enough, the same commodities, according to Fae'qa Rashed, are sold at lower prices in popular districts in an attempt (by traders) to attract middle-class clients who refrained from purchasing.

DEMONSTRATIONS IN AL-AZHAR
ISRAELI INTERIOR MINISTER DOES NOT WANT ANY CHURCHES OR NON-JEWS IN ISRAEL
Under this headline Nabil Zaki, chief editor of Al-Ahali wrote his column, which ran to the following effect:
As is always the case with the Arabs, they might not think of using their weapons against Israel one day, but would probably use them against their neighbours or against other Arabs.
Now the USA wants to search for these scientists inside Iraq in a row in order to transport them abroad to eliminate all human capital Iraq might possess, or else they would be the first to be killed at the first moment of the imminent American war against Iraq!
If the international inspectors in Iraq found a locked door and the search for the key took some time, or if a traffic jam delayed the inspector's arrival at a certain site or if the family of an Iraqi expert or scientist failed to meet a call in order for investigation abroad with their breadwinner under an inspectors' warrant, then Washington might construe each of such cases as an impediment to the inspectors' work, thus giving it the long-awaited pretext to launch war against Iraq.
For all objections and reservations, the war only postponed not cancelled.
They ought to forestall the American war project especially after that unprecedentedly strict resolution which has laid down a new inspection system.
President Hosni Mubarak said the Iraqi question is "very complicated", noting that "anyone imagines that attacking Iraq will intimidate other Arab countries is mistaken and ignorant of the nature of this region and its peoples."

When a people are expelled from their land, they will not stand, he said.
He also laid bare that he received a message from Sharon, saying that he wanted to end his political life with peace. Mubarak hoped that this promise would not be similar to his previous ones.

In the recent People's Assembly elections, three Copts won the elections. The membership of one of them was cancelled due to dual-nationality.
A- My statements did not include anything to that effect. We did not ask for a certain percentage in the (parliament) seats, but we see that voters are more important than candidates. Many people tried in vain to register their names in the electoral rolls. I informed President Mubarak of some complications, and he responded and called on the minister of the interior to streamline measures for the electorate.
Immigration Department sources estimated the number of Egyptians who traveled to Israel in the last ten months this year at four thousands.

IN LIGHT OF THE IRAQI CRISIS: THE IRAQI-IRANIAN RELATIONS, WHERETO?
Although alliances changed, Iraq has remained a balance factor for Iranian ambitions in the Gulf.
Whether that influence is hegemony is yet open to discussion. What is more important would rely on those neighbours feeling of security regarding their more powerful neighbour and how far the American presence in the region would deter Iranian ambitions.
In that case, it would not only constitute a primary threat to the region but would subject the market to a sort of Iraqi oil dumping as a result of a step taken by Iraq to that end in order to avenge itself on the Gulf States for what they caused it in the Second Gulf War. This would eventually lead to further deterioration of oil prices which would, in turn, have negative impacts on the Iranian economy.
If, however, a new Iraqi government was set up under a direct American administration i.e. through an American military governor in Iraq, the image would be inevitably different with other implications regarding Iran.

The American wave of armed pounce managed to break the backs of the Islamic radical organizations, particularly Al-Qaeda and Taliban, and dismantled several rings of extremism and terrorism in more than a state - Pakistan and Indonesia in the East, Germany and Spain in the West and in Yemen, Somalia and Sudan as well. At the same degree, the political Islamic trend in general was shocked and embarrassed. The shock and embarrassment came from two or three sources.
Thus, the latest stormy incidents, internally and externally, have placed the movement of political Islam in situations of challenge, pressure and siege on the one hand, and in situations of temptation and attraction on the other. This Islamic movement is now standing in a very difficult U-turn. It is trapped between return to radicalism and armed violence, which were adopted by some of its factions in the past twenty years, and rush towards ideological and systematic development and modernization. If the movement opts for the second option, it will amalgamate with the move of the Arab and Muslim society that "voluntarily" seeks to bring about limited democracy or that is being pressurized by foreign forces to change towards open democracy.
I believe that the success of moderate organizations and parties in more than one Arab and Muslim country will tempt their counterparts in the other countries to do the same. This success also puts the general trend of the movement of political Islam in situations of challenge and response.
It is clear that the latest success of the Islamic parties in more than a country, as mentioned above, depended on this essential change that was an alternative to the slogan of "Islam is the solution" that was raised by the political Islamic trends in the past decades.
I daresay that these two different parties are placed together under horrible American pressures. These pressures begin with accusations that both parties are directly responsible for terrorism, violence and extremism. These pressures do not, at the same time, end with an urge to bring about radical reforms to the ruling regimes but want them to "modernize Islam" itself, something that causes increasing sensitivity.
This needs essential surgeries in the march of our lives and homelands.

The General Supply Commodity Authority, the key wheat importer in Egypt, last Tuesday surprisingly bought 420,000 tons of U.S. wheat for around 65 million U.S. dollars in lieu of French wheat which is roughly 8.5 million U.S. dollars lower than U.S. wheat.
Commenting on the agreement, Mr. Abul-Oyoon said it would help increase cooperation between Egyptian and Russian banks on the one hand and the Central Banks in both countries on the other, a thing that might bolster bilateral economic and trade relations.

LEAVE THE CBE ALONE!
International monetary agencies estimate the size of those funds at LE79 billion, i.e. the equivalent of 30% of the banks deposits volume, which predicts a certain disaster.
Also to be blamed is the insistence on the technique of political selection for bank leaderships without taking into account any standards of professional efficiency or expertise that can employ banks money in genuine enterprises that yield real profits for them and for their depositors and really contribute to developing national economy.
Bankers uncovered conflicting figures about the size of bad debts in banks. They emphasized that, according to the latest CBE data, such debts amounted to about LE33 billion, 11.3% of bank loans size.
The forum uncovered that many clients had founded illusory companies in the names of their wives, children and relatives in order to obtain loans.
He pointed out that there was something wrong with the credit granting process as only a few number of clients were concentrated on. 35 clients got loans to the value of LE37 billion.
THE GOVERNMENT OWES SIA $31 BILLION
The collusion includes famous, semi-famous and even obscure figures who, nevertheless, have obtained hundreds of millions of pounds.
It turned out that the percentage of loans and facilities granted without sufficient collateral amounted to 64.8% and that the debts had exceeded the licensed limits by rates ranging from 15% and 519%.
For the first time since early the 1980's, poverty rates went down from 19.4% of the population in 1995/1996 to 16.4% in 1999/2000 in spite of the fact that the bank indicated that sluggishness of economic growth since 2000 raises misgivings regarding the latest poverty rate.
Poverty rates in Lower Egypt during the reporting period increased from 29.3% to 34.2% in rural areas and from 10.8% to 19.3% in urban areas. On the other hand, poverty rates in Upper Egypt went down from 21.5% to 11.8% in rural areas and from 8.3% to 6.2% in urban areas.
He stressed the necessity of selecting bank cadres from among professionals away from political appointments, training the personnel who work for banks and making sure that owners of projects contribute 50% of their own money to such projects.
However, head of Saleh Kamel Center, Dr. Mohamed Abdel-Halim Omar refused to make light of what the banking body is being exposed to so that what happened could be avoided in the future.
The Centre's chairman, Mohamed Abdel Halim Omar said that the problem of faltering debts had turned into a real crisis threatening the stability of the banking system in Egypt.
Arab Banking Corporation chairman, Hassan Abbas Zaki said that the volume of faltering ranged from LE23 billion to LE25 billion while the volume of deposits reached LE260 billion. Mohamed Abdel Halim Omar indicated the American embassy's report on the Egyptian economy issued in July 2002, which said that faltering loans were in the range between 15% and 20% of the size of bank credit which reached LE266.1 billion and the faltering loans would consequently range between LE39.9 billion and LE53.3 billion.
Former prime minister Aziz Sedki bombarded the government for sticking to the emergency law, saying that no genuine development can be achieved under the 22-year emergency law.
The incumbent government should recognize the deteriorating economic conditions and unsuccessful policies, he requested.
Accusing some incumbent cabinet ministers of corruption, the premier wondered: how can a minister amass 20 million pounds three years after he takes up as such, though his salary does not reach 5,000 pounds.
The cash fluidity shortage is partly due to the flight of over 80 billion pounds in investments owing to the economic crisis in the country, he said The former prime minister, moreover, called on the government to monitor foreign cement companies in Egypt to thwart any plan to designedly slim cement prices in a bid to control the financial position of Egyptian cement companies to buy them.
The trainees have already got down to work for the abortion of any acts by the Palestinian groups against Israeli targets.
In her first media appearance in the annual Iftar (fast-breaking) party, thrown by the Muslim Brotherhood during the holy month of Ramadan, Wafaa Mashhour, the daughter of the Muslim Brotherhood's late General Guide Mostafa Mashhour, delivered a speech on the role of women in society on behalf of Muslim Brotherhood lady members.
Egyptian parliamentary deputies asked foreign minister, Ahmed Mahir to give an urgent statement before the Parliament about the truth of mass media reports about 90 Egyptian Prisoners of War (POWs) being jailed in Israel. They were arrested after they crossed Palestinian borders by mistake, let alone those who were kidnapped from Sinai after the 1967 war. The deputies cited some Israeli newspaper reports about those Egyptians being jailed in Ping, Ashkelon, Acre and Al-Khayam prisons.
Parliamentary deputies also asked for holding a joint meeting of the two committees on foreign affairs and national security to discuss the phenomenon of Egyptian youth emigration abroad with some of them giving up the Egyptian nationality. This would have extremely grave impact on Egyptian national security as well as those youth belonging.
They expressed fears of the youth feeling of alienation inside their own country and urged studying poverty and unemployment problems as primary reasons for the phenomenon of emigration and abandoning nationality.
The U.S. is reconsidering all its aid to Arab countries and mulling over allocating it to programs that spur democracy and the rule of law, said a Department of State official, who asked to remain anonymous.
On a potential U.S. military action against Iraq, the source said the goal of reconsideration is to boost aid to the programs of democracy and the rule of law, but did not say whether the volume of aid will change.
Well-informed sources unfolded that Cairo had invited the new leader of the Israeli Labour Party, Amaran Mitzna to visit it. The sources expected the visit to take place prior to the date of Israeli elections. some sources believe that Mitzna would reach a few days after Eid Al-Fitr (Lesser Bairam). The sources pointed out that Egypt was monitoring carefully what the new Labour Party does whether related to his concepts of the solution or his attitude towards the current Palestinian leadership or any other important issues like those of the refugees, the status of Jerusalem and the settlements besides his vision of a comprehensive political solution in the region.
While sources close to the group attributed the delay in announcing the new guide's name to "inter-differences", Al-Hudheibi told Asharq Al-Awsat that the decision came after a relatively very short time in light of the procedures required for the announcement.
Salaheddin Hafez, Assistant Chief Editor of Al-Ahram, writes a lengthy article under the above heading. Excerpts run to the following effect: The American and Western pounce on the Arab and Muslim world has strong impact on and deep changes in the political, social and cultural movements, the heralds of which appeared quickly among the milieus of the political Islamic trend, to be accurate.
I believe that success won recently by political Islamic organizations and parties in more than a state like Turkey, Morocco, Bahrain and Pakistan - after they had merged in a process of democratic development - opens the door for other models in other countries. The US, moreover, supports this success, as it says that it fights "Islamic" extremism and terrorism, but encourages "Islamic" moderation and democratic development. Challenge:
The current internal and international incidents pushed the winds to the sail, something that introduced to us moderate Islamic parties. These parties contest elections, declare their faith in democracy, place their announced philosophy in the square of "justice and development," and introduce themselves as an alternative to the conventional political Islamic movement, which has become outdated like the Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan). These parties also introduce themselves as an alternative to the radical Islamic organizations like Al-Qaeda, Taliban and Jihad, which brought in negative disasters to Islam and the Muslims in general.
One of the mainly required surgeries is the re-wording of the political platforms of the Islamic parties to an extent that conforms to the ideals, concepts and methods of democratic development that is inevitable in this century. Those platforms should also be re-worded in a way that harmonizes with the life requirements and daily sufferings of the peoples - poverty, unemployment and stagnation. Those platforms should also recognize the multi-party system, the right to take part in political action and the woman's role in Muslim societies, especially as women have lost their basic rights that are enshrined in Islam.
I daresay that this talk causes strong sensitivities whether among some of the ruling regimes that are suspicious of the movement of political Islam or inside this movement itself, especially as it is being pressurized and facing harsh challenges nowadays.
In this case, it is not enough to exchange (with the West) violence with violence or hatred with hatred. The issue is deeper than that and the responsibility is bigger.
"Turkey will go into the European Union trailing myriad of problems and complications, such as the Kurdish problem, sectarian conflicts, the possibility of war over the waters of the Tigris and the Euphrates, the membership of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and Turkey's roots in the Muslim countries of Central Asia," Colonel Gaddafi warned on the evening of 26 November.
Turkey is like a tree whose roots are deeply driven in Asia but whose branches entered Europe.
Gaddafi's recent comments, which are his first official statements on Turkey, are expected to have wide repercussions similar to those which occurred during the visit of former Turkish prime minister and disbanded Rafa Party leader Nemettin Erbikan to Tripoli. Gaddafi surprised his guest by delivering a severe tongue lashing to Turkey official policy towards the Kurds and demanded that the Kurds be given the right to establish their own independent state.
These challenges are totally different from past challenges." An annual plan would be implemented as of next year, the first in the history of the party, that targets achieving the main goals of the party on the public level. Everybody will feel the new changes and developments.

In statements to Al-Ahali, Dr. Ibrahim Al-Esawi, National Planning Institute consultant and member of Al-Tagamo'h Party Central Committee said that both the international and the domestic figures were correct as each relied on a different standard.
Dr. Al-Esawi pointed out that many Egyptian economists tended to approve the international figure - 53%, which approximated to the total figure announced in the report on human development in Egypt, especially as it suited the conditions undergone by the country after the implementation of the policy of structural adaptation and the remarkable increase in unemployment rates. This means that the difference between the domestic and the international figures was triggered by differences in the definition of the poverty concept.
The ministry has set next December 19 as a final date for receiving the draft budgets of the state administrative body as a prelude to compiling the final form of the draft to be presented to the Cabinet, the People's Assembly and the Shura Council, said Minister of Finance Medhat Hassanein.

It seems that luck is still at odds with businessman Hosam Abul-Fotouh. After his property had been sequestrated, some Egyptian businessmen started attempts to get the BMW agency from him. By the end of last week, he was having dinner with the official in charge of Africa region in BMW, Mr. Walker when he knew from him that he would have dinner with Banque du Caire President, Ahmed El Baradi. Banque du Caire was the bank from which Hosam Abul-Fotouh got the bulk of his loans that exceeded LE900 million.
The agency was the only business that provided him with cash liquidity that amounted to LE150 million annually, thus enabling him to repay part of his debts or of their interests.
COMPANY FOR TRADE WITH ROMANIA
The company has already been declared and its board has been formed, said Ghourab who affirmed that it has been agreed with the Romanian side on establishing a commercial representation office for the Holding Company for pharmaceuticals in Bucharest with a view to promoting the Egyptian medicines in Romania and the neighboring markets like Bulgaria, Moldova and Ukraine with the help of the Romanian side, while the Egyptian side will help in promoting the Romanian products in "COMESA" countries and other surrounding markets.

The companies aim at looking for supplies and the establishment of joint ventures for technology transfer and the achievement of medical integration between the two countries.
INDIAN OFFERS IN THE FIELD OF DRUGS MANUFACTURE
Chairman of Printing Industries Chamber, Ahmed Atef uncovered that three companies, members in the chamber and producers of polypropylene had submitted a memo to the chamber's board of directors about the great harm they incurred as a result of bilateral agreements with a number of Arab countries.
This, consequently, would make the costs of the Egyptian product much higher than its counterparts from those countries.
The total Egyptian polypropylene imports from Saudi Arabia in one year amounted to 21429 tons, 37.5% of total Egyptian polypropylene imports.
Holding Orascom Telecom, the pioneering company in the field of mobile and internet services in the Middle East, Africa and Pakistan announced signing a partnership contract with Al Tataneya Telecom for Communications, the pioneering company in the field of mobile services in Kuwait in order to co-operate in running Orascom Telecom Tunisia (Orascom Tunis) which owns the second mobile network in Tunisia.

The new system aims at activating the privatization program as the investors were reluctant to purchase loss-making companies put up this year by the Ministry of Public Enterprise Sector and due to the capital market inability to assimilate new shares.
1-The rate of capital increase is used in reforming and developing the company on the basis that it is considered pumping fresh investments.
Minister of Public Enterprise Sector Mukhtar Khattab denied reports to the effect that the government had decided to suspend the implementation of privatisation program in Egypt due to the current economic slowdown. He also denied that Egypt had informed the World Bank officials of this issue during the recent visit of the World Bank president.
Following a Cabinet meeting yesterday, Information Minister Safwat Al-Sherif said that the Investment Authority would be the headquarters from where investors would get all approval. He pointed out that in a few days' time the Prime Minister would open the first headquarters of investment complexes.
It added that such a strike would abort the recovery attempts started by the Egyptian economy through the growth in the number of tourists in Egypt in the last few months.
National Bank of Egypt (NBE) Chairman Ahmed Dia' Eddin said the NBE's financial position is strong and has no problems related to insolvent investors.
The NBE has also got back some 136 million pounds from Ramy Lakah, another key businessman, he said.
The ATFP, Mana'i maintained, is also aimed to stimulate Arab exports to other countries, particularly as Arab countries have committed themselves to free trade requirements in line with the GATT by means of offering financial support to Arab exporters and producers in order to make use of such privileges, he added.
The Association, which represents the biggest non-governmental organisation in the country, did not content itself with its call for reexamining the defaulters' files but also alluded to its readiness to put in a request to the political leadership so as to preserve the achievements of the economic reform which are eroded as megaprojects are falling together with their owners.
Second, if mortgages were not enough, sequestration was imposed on the property of the defaulters. In the first case, banks discovered a difficulty in disposing of mortgages, because every mortgage was offered as a guarantee for more than a loan and to more than a bank. Consequently, the mortgage in this case is primarily insufficient and turns into a dispute among creditor banks.
In a related incident, Prime Minister, Atef Ebeid received a memo, the first of its kind, presented by Muslim Brotherhood deputy Hamdi Hassan concerning the escape of a bank borrower although the same borrower had another escape precedent.
Saleh added that focussing on the African markets is a great chance for Egyptian businessmen and exporters because of these markets high need of Egyptian products and the COMESA agreement which allows commodity and service exchange among these African countries on the basis of mutual customs exemptions that will contribute to raising exports and improving trade balance.

The study urged Egyptian businessmen and companies to constantly participate in the international specialised exhibitions mounted in Japan through subsidy provided by the Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO). In addition, Egyptian exporters should participate in some other expositions at their own expense so that Egyptian exporters could meet directly with the expected importers, the study said.
Although the Egyptian-Japanese trade balance deficit hit 498.1 million dollars in 2001, the volume of trade exchange decreased to 650.3 million dollars against 888.2 million dollars in 2000, the study said.
The agreement was signed on behalf of the Ministry by the Ministry's first undersecretary and head of the Technological Development sector and on the Danish behalf by Dr. Prepian Findlob.
The minister pointed out the importance of qualifying and training factories to get the ISO certificates with a view to promoting exports to foreign markets in addition to chemical and bacteriological tests, developing test labs and producing healthy and safe foods for the consumer.
"I proposed this idea in an article entitled One Wife is not Enough' which was published in a magazine," said the association chairman, Mrs. Hoyam Derbek. "In this article I called on wives to allow their husbands to get married for many reasons such eliminating the singlehood problem which has been gravely aggravated in the Arab world. On the other hand, there is an increasing rate in the urfi (unofficial, unregistered and clandestine) marriage hitting 2.5 percent in Egypt; hence my call to establish a society calling for polygamy publicly rather than behind the wives' back."
I work 18 hours a day in the field of mass media, the press and organizing symposia and conferences. So, I'm very remiss at home. By the end of the day, I return home so exhausted that I have to take a rest. Therefore, I nominated a neighbor and relative girl to my husband.
Everybody, government and subjects alike, is of the opinion that political reform is a must for this country.
We must note here that the US Administration has made its stand on political reform in Saudi Arabia clear within the context of an American political project on the Middle East. The same view was reiterated later, and in plainer language this time, by the head of the Central Intelligence Agency.
- A domestic choice, divided into a popular choice and a governmental one.
These two pretexts gained more momentum in the 1990's in the midst of the collapse of the former Soviet Union and the emergence of religious radicalism in North Africa, particularly in Algeria, and even Egypt. They maintained their strength until the first suicidal airliner crashed into one of the World Trade Center Twin Towers. The collapse of the towers on 11 September marked the emergence of a new pretext, which insisted on uprooting the fundamentalist threat, but from its origins in Saudi Arabia this time.
The current responses to the calls of reformists in Saudi Arabia tend to trace the lines of the ongoing reform processes in neighbouring countries like Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar.
Therefore, the Saudi royal family has been trying very hard to absorb any local, or even international, pressures and make only the least possible concessions whatever the pressures.
Saudi Arabia, with its monarchic regime, imposes full control over the land and the people, forcefully resisting any local attempts at protest.
However, there does exist a problem that precludes the adoption of constitutional monarch in the kingdom: it is the struggle for power from within Saudi Arabia itself, not from outside.
Under this heading Saudi writer and researcher, Hamza al-Hassan, writes a lengthy article to say:
Over the last 12 years, it was clear that the Saudi Kingdom had no articulate policy towards Iraq. Excluding Kuwait from among other Arab neighbours, the Kingdom seldom had a margin of manoeuvering and alternatives that could spare it some of the expected perils.
The Saudi government 's opposition to the method of U.S. war makes one feel that it admits to the crime (of supporting terrorism), while the anti-Saudi lobby seeks to take the opportunity of events and prove the charge, giving an excuse to target the Kingdom as a state and government (the royal family) in the coming confrontations.
Over the last eight decades, apart from the period of war with Iran, relations with Iraq were only cool, dim and surrounded by fears and suspicions.
Only for comparison, cards owned by the Kingdom today to shun risks brought by Iraq whether for its current situation or possible occupation by U.S. soldiers, are less significant than their counterparts held by Syria and Iran, which, like the Kingdom, will be targeted if Iraq is occupied.
For its part, the Kingdom, which is still insistent on its old-fashioned policy, had good opportunities to invest, but it was unable or unwilling to do so as if the Iraqi situation did not really concern it. Following the Second Gulf War, Saudi Arabia failed to host over 35,000 Iraqis, including around 3,000 officers, in the context of its policies, humanitarian principles or refugees' rights. But, it encircled them in Rafga, Artawia and Dwadami camps, and tempted some of them to return to Iraq, shrugging off potential risks. With the increasing disturbances in "5-star" camps, as claimed, and banning Iraqi refugees from gathering or going out of camps, a large number of them escaped to other countries. European countries, Australia and Syria expressed willingness to host them.
They thought that with a single low-ranking officer and unserious methods they can deal with party ministers, prime ministers, generals, officers and commanders.
Therefore, the Kingdom is fully far from the main trends in Iraq:
Such tensed relations with the key Iraqi opposition parties, along with the Kingdom's provocation against the Iraqi Intifada in 1991, portend a bad future in Saudi-Iraqi relations, and may even turn Iraq into a base for blatant hositility to Saudi Arabia as if all what will happen is just replacing one enemy with another.
It was natural for it, as usual, to attach significance to Iraqi Sunnis. It started to help long-awaited and neglected Iraqi opposition leaders become more active once more, prepared to hold a conference and made an extraordinary political discourse that may bring benefit on the one hand and bring harm on the other hand.
The Kingdom can not adopt a unilateral policy, nor can it stand against risks without coordination with other Arab countries and other countries concerned in the region.
Iraqi Trade Minister, Mahdi Saleh said that Baghdad would hit any Arab or foreign state that would provide or offer bases to the American forces that would participate in attacking Iraq. He accused the UN of appropriating Iraq's dues from the Oil for Food programme. He pointed out that the value of Iraq's exports of oil amounted to $60 billion, out of which $23 billion were received by the UN in favour of Inspection committees and UN administration system, which rendered Iraq incapable of paying for the economic contracts comprised by the programme.
The Iraqi minister accused Israel and America of using biological weapons for spreading diseases in Arab countries while the Arabs are not allowed to use genetic engineering in agriculture. No Arab national, he added, is allowed to study atomic energy abroad as Arab scientists in that field are normally persecuted and assassinated.
"An agreement is being reached at present with a hotel in Saudi Arabia in order to book rooms for the trip members and a hall for holding lectures and symposia," said Safwat Safi, an official with the travel agency.
The 5-day journey's per capita cost is estimated at about 5,000 pounds, in addition to the transport expenses inside Medina. As for the journey to London, whose details have been yet determined, it will cost 5,000 to 7,000 dollars, he said.
Khalid's followers still wonder about his travel to Britain. Although he announced that he had traveled to get the Ph.D. degree, strong rumours are spread to the effect that he had exposed to a conspiracy plotted by a number of sheikhs who make reservations about his fatwas (religious independent opinions) and judicial opinions.
It is noteworthy that a poll was conducted in the American University in Cairo in which Khalid came first among youth preachers.
Egyptian nearby houses were exposed to heavy shakes due to Israel's usage of explosives in digging the foundations of the high fence.
Renting blankets has become a booming trade for the citizens of the Egyptian Rafah whether they are Egyptians or Palestinians.
In many cases, too, the Egyptian authorities adopt stricter measures against Israelis and some European tourists willing to enter the Egyptian lands to barter them with a similar number of Palestinians willing to cross to Palestinian autonomous areas. Within the framework of the policy of fraud and recalcitrance adopted by Israelis, Palestinians crossing borders banned to bring in foodstuffs and electric appliances. The Israelis used to accuse these travelers of smuggling weapons inside cargos though the crossing guards used to examine parcels through hi-tech devices. Strangely enough, the crossing has witnessed many birth-giving cases over the last few months while pregnant women were standing waiting for passage.
Unprecedentedly since the beginning of the Egyptian campaign for boycotting American and Israeli goods, American Coca Cola company has filed a complaint against the Boycotting Committee in Alexandria (North Egypt) accusing it of distorting its image and damaging its trade mark in public transport means and through publications and posters that it publishes and spreads throughout the city.
A GOVERNMENT PROJECT TO SELL IRRIGATION WATER TO FARMERS
The government bill banned the use of any pumps at the developed canals which will be used only by water user associations pumps. The costs of old canals development will consequently be levied in accordance with the Ministry's bill executive statute.
While some senior bankers, especially Ali Negm and Dr. Hazim Al Biblawi confirmed contentment about that fatwa that, according to them, could resolve a long controversy over this issue, some others, expressing reservations about the fatwa, said it had not been unanimously approved by Islamic Research Academy scholars as it was objected to by some of them, in the forefront of whom is former head of Al Azhar University, Dr. Abdel Fattah Al Sheikh, and former dean of Sharia and Law Faculty, Dr. Mohamed Rafat Othaman. They emphasized that the fatwa would do a lot of harm to Islamic banks operating in Egypt.
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD DEPUTY WITH DROPPED MEMBERSHIP FEARS NEW GOVERNMENT ESCALATION AGAINST THE GROUP
The parliament also violated its own established principles and passed a decision that marred the country's democracy and political image."
He regarded the decision to drop his membership a step in the opposite direction.
He did not rule out the possibility that his other 16 colleagues in the parliament would face similar positions. He said, "What happened might be just a message of warning to the other brothers or the opposition in general.
Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdel-Aziz said the Muslim Brotherhood Group seek to grip leadership and government and deal in Islam and use it to serve a personal purpose.
WESTERN RESEARCHERS IN A SEMINAR IN ALEXANDRIA: ISLAMIC GROUPS DISTORT IMAGE OF ISLAM
The misconceptions of the four paradigms have been so misused by fundamentalist Islamic groups that they declared war.
A French researcher who participated in the conference said it was necessary to differentiate between the "other" and the "enemy" and to teach cultural plurality as the cold war was over and only terrorism was left, thus turning the UN into a worthless organization.
The Egyptian diplomacy did well when it sought or rather hoped to affect the new American policy and preclude the outbreak of a war in the region.
Egyptian diplomacy, however, is acting in a way that raises question about the reasons for departing from such a rule of thumb which dealing with Iraq' s crisis especially as the problem is no longer one concerned with the Iraqi opposition but rather extended to outright rejection of any role in determining Iraq's future.
The majority of those who establish relations with America are not American agents but rather found in it the only resort.
The Egyptian diplomacy, through its weight and respectability, can influence some Iraqi opposition trends, which were driven by despair of any Arab help to just let itself fall into Washington's arms.
Naturally, any new regime acts towards other countries in accordance with the leaders concepts of each country and how close its relations with them are.
Should that happen, Iraq's getting over its trial and lifting the siege imposed on it would not be an asset in favour of the Arab order but rather a liability, which would, certainly, be a considerable loss because Iraq is not a small country.
This is what the Egyptian diplomacy ought to consider.
ISRAEL BUYS A COMPUTER PROGRAMME TO TAP THE INTERNET
According to a Hebrew newspaper, the Israeli security body would buy a programme from Microsoft for $21.7 million.
Egyptian Intelligence Chief Omar Soleiman had personally undertaken along with one of his aides the negotiations with Hamas and Jihad and the dialogue between Hamas and Fatah. He also held separate and expanded meetings with the leaders of these organisations.
Both Hamas and Jihad, the sources said, do not want to stop operations but they want to continue political dialogue with Egypt and make more effective continuation to the political arena in preparation for any possible incident in the occupied territories.
Powell said he had already talked about his initiative with officials of Washington's Arab allies, including Saudi Arabia, emphasizing that he respected Saudi customs and traditions. However, responding to a question on the fact that there is no elected parliament or political parties and that women are barred from driving in the Saudi kingdom, he believed that Saudi officials "should examine such customs and exercises just to see whether it is possible to carry out changes" The U.S. Secretary of State also patted Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and Morocco on the back for their recent democratic changes, regarding that every country has the right to carry out the reforms it deems suitable to it.
He crossed his fingers that Cairo would spend some of U.S. economic aid on the purposes of his initiative to shore up democracy and civil society organizations.
The chairman of the Export Development Centre's Executive Council, Dr. Abdel Rahman Al-Zamil, expected opening telecommunication means between the two parties would have great importance in consolidating bilateral trade relations. He attached great importance to Iraq's economic potentialities and commercial opportunities that turned it into one of the most important markets in the region.
Identical sources told Al-Hayat that Saleh would not seek to contract deals of purchasing new weapons from Russia, expecting that the military cooperation between them would increase technically and that spare parts for the Russian weapons in the Yemeni armed forces would be provided.

It also started to monitor the group's activities inside Saudi Arabia and its relations with some opposition symbols there. It seems that Saudi Arabia has recently informed some Ikhwanite leaderships of dissatisfaction with many moves made by the group prior to the invasion of Kuwait especially after it had known about what happened in the meeting held by Saddam Hussein in Baghdad with Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood group delegation during the session of the International Conference of Islamic Movements in July 1990, only a few months before the invasion. It was the conference attended by all Muslim Brotherhood branches in the Arab and Islamic worlds. Egyptian Brotherhood participants included Ahmed Sief Al Islam, Isam El Iryan and Abdul Hamid Al Ghazali whom Saddam Hussein had granted an exclusive meeting where he implicitly referred to the possibility of invading Kuwait.

Al Azhar Islamic Research Academy scholars opined that it was religiously impermissible to extend any kind of assistance to the American forces and their allies in the potential aggression on Iraq. They said, "It is religiously impermissible for any Arab or Islamic country to offer assistance to the American forces. Nor is it permissible to deploy any foreign forces in Muslim territories, as that would mean a kind of alienation of Islam and Muslim sovereignty and recognition of the enemy's right to occupy our lands."
It is noteworthy that some Arab countries have offered facilities to the American presence including setting up military bases, deploying military forces and offer intelligence information to help America in its war against Muslims in Iraq.
Citing the delegation head, Pop Idcar, Secretary General of American Churches the National Council, Iraqi News Agency said, following the delegation's arrival at Saddam International Airport last night, that the delegation had gone to Iraq in solidarity with its people.
Setting up a Christian state in Kurdistan, North of Iraq has been the life dream of Christian generations. In 1968 the Ba'ath Party stepped to power in Baghdad and gave the Christians ample opportunities to build their cultural, social and political centers. In these circumstances, Beit Al Nahreen Party emerged in 1976, followed by the emergence of the Assyrian Democratic Movement. They divided roles among themselves so that while Beit Al Nahreen Party took a hardline attitude, the Assyrian Democratic Movement resorts to maneuvering and adopts a moderate stance regarding putting forward Christian demands. Through this tactic, they could create optimal conditions for them in the Kurdistan region.

During the Egyptian bourse saw the year 2002 many developments and events, which directly and indirectly impacted on its performance, which was calm most of the time. Lights were shed on a number of issues pertaining to the rights of the minority mainly including the two deals of Alexandria Cement Company and the Egyptian-American Bank.

Both EFGI financial group and Hermes indicators reported the highest two points late July affected by the decision to end pricing limits of the activities of 12 companies after which the prices started to plummet to stand at low levels. The report showed that the total market capital rose by around 11% to report 123 billion pounds, or 27 billion dollars or about 32% of the GDP compared with the year 2001 when the overall market capital went down by some 7% to report 111 billion pounds in late 2001.
This reflects the calm performance of the market during the year and the control of the big applied operations and the operations carried out on bonds.
The most active twenty companies in 2002 controlled some 22% of the circulation value in comparison with around 46% of the total circulation value in 2001. This difference stems from the rise in the rates of bond circulation and the decline of the shares circulation activity.
Egypt's performance was moderate compared with the other nascent markets as IFCG-EGYPT indicator reported a slight decline estimated at about 1.6% with a low risk factor estimated at some 0.9%.

Abu Zeid added that plans and programmes of the companies and investors working in the project for planting their allocated plots, which were estimated at two thirds of the project area, i.e. 400,000 feddans, were reviewed. He, further, pointed out the execution of two huge experimental farms. The first is erected on an area of 1000 feddans and is affiliated to Al-Mamlaka Company which exports its production to Belgium. The second is affiliated to South Valley Development Company with an area of 800 feddans.
This came in a speech delivered by the minister on 11 January in a symposium organized by the National Center for Social Researches under the chairmanship of Dr. Nagwa Amin Al-Fawwal.
The role of the ministry's power on markets would be amended in order to impact on the market mechanisms and prices, thus developing the market through planning by setting up trade exhibitions, cutting prices and adopting systems and mechanisms of retail.
The chambers of commerce are being linked electronically to the ministry's departments nationwide, he added. As for the ministry's supervisory role, Dr. Khidr said it is being developed and the supply inspectors are trained in the latest trade techniques and developments. He pointed out that the number of reports conducted against illegal activities on markets hit more than one third of a million annually.

The value of the deal reached LE92 million for 6 million shares which are the company total capital, i.e. 15.33 pounds per share.
PRIVATE BANKS MAINLY BLAMED FOR ECONOMIC DETERIORATION
The negative aspect may unfavourably affect the volume of investments in Egypt, especially as the Egyptian economy is still suffering. The positive aspect may help the country get back money smuggled outside the country, he added.
Yussef referred 3 points which were crucial to the negotiations as follows.
WARNINGS ABOUT UNEMPLOYMENT RATE EXCEEDING 8.8%
An overall reform programme should be adopted through increasing demand for work. This could be done by invigorating the economy, reforming training and education systems and guaranteeing labour's rights in an atmosphere convenient for work.
Economic growth in Egypt was marked by sluggishness over the past years which negatively impacted on the national economy's ability to assimilate new labour into the work market. Sharp slowdown in the economic activity's performance was a natural result of the government way of running the macroeconomics.
The State Security Prosecution decided to keep 14 Ikhwanite key figures in custody for 15 days pending investigations into the Group's activity in east Cairo. The prosecution decided an escapee be arrested.
Ikhwan lawyer, Abd Al-Mon'em Abd Al-Maksoud deemed such accusations untrue, saying that his clients had denied such accusations during investigations and confirmed their respect of law and the constitution.
If Saddam, on the other hand, said he had no mass destruction weapons, that credibility would be hard to attain.
The problem is simply that Washington wants to topple the Iraqi ruling regime which has built up out of its continuation and desire to survive as a sort of national cause that is worth fighting for, i.e for the regime rather than the country itself and consequently deserves that parts of the country be destroyed so that it might survive.
Now that the USA has certainly made up its mind, not many options have remained theoretically open.
However, the regime, through such sacrifice, may serve the country and population, so long as it can do so while still in power.
Such stepping down (on the part of the Iraqi elite) would certainly abort the military strike which the Pentagon hardliners are very anxious to launch but the departure of Saddam, his ministers and senior officials would not convince the Americans that their war goals have been achieved. They had after all gone to great lengths to fabricate such goals and find ethical pretexts for them and even entered into confrontations with so many countries to promote them.
Al-Azhar's Islamic Research Academy (IRA) made permissible the use of genetics in prevention and treatment of diseases on condition that the efforts exerted by scientists in the field of genetic treatment should be intended to remedy or prevent the diseases from which man suffers.
Second: If such tests on animals prove that the genetic treatment of a dangerous disease leads to a less harmful one, genetic treatment in this case is permissible according to the Islamic rule, "the more harmful thing is averted by a less harmful one." Genetic treatment is impermissible when it leads to a same dangerous disease according to the Islamic rule, "a harm should not be warded off by incurring another harm." Therefore, no treatment of a disease should be prescribed if it leads to a more harmful one, he said.
Q- It has been reported behind the Israeli and Egyptian scenes that the real aim of your visit to Egypt is to get acquainted with what is going on in the second round of Palestinian talks, hosted by Cairo late last month, is this true?
I confirm that the Palestinians have the right to have a political capital, namely Jerusalem, but without full control over the holy places. In my point of view, the best solution is that neither party should get full control over the holy places. These places should be set under international supervision whether by the UN or the Security Council or even a joint supervision by the Israeli and Palestinian parties.
Q- What about the issue of refugees whether in or even outside the Palestinian territories?
Q- What do you mean by "the position of Israel as a Jewish state"?
In this context, Arab-American talks have been held for discussing the economic situation in case of war. A number of Arab countries told Washington that the volume of transactions between the Arab countries and America, which stood at $55 billion last year, would go down to $30 billion. The American investments in the Arab world would also decline to $35 billion against $70 billion last year.
Minister of Manpower Ahmad Al-Amawi ruled out the possibility of the Egyptian labour in the region, 860 thousand in number, being largely dented as was the case in 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait as the rate of Egyptian labour in Iraq went down than before. Therefore, the impact may be possible on the Egyptian labour in some Gulf states that can terminate the foreign and Arab employment contracts to settle their labour instead.
Al-Ahram Al-Arabi learned that the list of the countries, which would be harmed, was given to the US Administration, which formed a specialised work team that included assistant US secretary of commerce, deputy assistant Secretary of State for economic affairs, the Commerce Department deputy for the Middle East and North African affairs, and deputy Secretary of State.
The most urgent question is: is this large strategic and military build-up intended only to face the current standoff or are there other aims behind it?
At the heart of the region, the second fact, namely the American attempts to build the major regional power, which it controls, namely Israel will be confirmed. The third fact is the American attempts to change the identity of new Iraq to advocate and implement the US policy in the Middle East. The fourth fact is the increase of the strategic and military imbalance tipping the balance of power in favour of Israel.
As far as the timing of the attack is concerned, the events indicate it will be around the end of February or during the first half of March 2003.
The defendants fully admitted to the terrorist schemes and those admissions emphasized that they had not direct relationship with Al-Qaeda Organization.
Some elements of that 43-member terrorist group have tried to infiltrate into the Israeli borders to take direct revenge on the Israelis, but they could not do so owing to the strict security measures taken by Egypt across its borders to prevent any infiltration attempt from or into the Israeli borders.
He also rented a building to serve as a factory for explosives and transferred some terrorist elements to it. Ismail also taught his elements how to manufacture explosives and bought them automatic rifles and pistols to be ready for the planned operations.
They would then be transported to the targeted building or just flown near it.
COURT RULING ENTITLES SHUKRI TO LEAD LABOUR PARTY
There is still a dispute between opponents in this respect, the court said, pointing out that the party is the only body that is competent to settle its internal disputes.
The Egyptian Foreign Ministry filed a lawsuit against the importing company for breaching laws and importation rules, the government said.
Meanwhile, reliable Palestinian sources were quoted as saying that disputes ran deeper within the central committee of the Palestinian mainstream Fatah, led by Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, over the continuity of dialogue between Fatah and the Palestinian Resistance Movement (Hamas) in Cairo, involving Egyptian Intelligence Agency Chief Omar Solyman as a facilitator.
In a recent meeting of the Fatah central committee to discuss the Cairo dialogue, differences cropped up among the members, with most of them objecting to the Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's economic advisor Mohamed Rashid's involvement in the dialogue as a member of the Fatah delegation. Preconditions set by Hamas Political Bureau Chief Khalid Mashal for attending the Cairo dialogue were also given the thumbs down by other central committee members.
The Turkish request came on the margin of the historic visit paid by Turkish Premier Abdulla Gul to AL headquarters in Cairo two days ago. The visit was the first to be paid by a Turkish official on that level since the AL was established in 1945.
The Turkish government has decided to fully develop its relations with Arab countries, said Gul, adding that there had been an agreement with the Arab League on many matters including collectively studying the region's problems in the next months.
The same source added that the Turkish request was only an initiative for public relations by which Turkey wanted to convey a message to the Arab countries that it was seriously eager to promote cooperation with them, in an attempt to remove the impression dominating the Arab world that Turkey was involved in American policies that are hostile to Arab interests especially after Turkey agreed to offer the American forces extensive competence in Incirlik Airbase used by the American forces to launch air raids in the no-fly zone in the north and south of Iraq.
The draft constitution will be viewed as the touchstone of the U.S. administration's willingness to abide by the official position on establishing an independent Palestinian statehood.
The Iraqi tribal card seems to be important as Saddam had done a lot for it, for its backing attitude towards him and as it represents a big population sector. Iraq contains 150 tribal gatherings that, in turn, consist of 2 thousand smaller tribal sub-gatherings. Big tribes can claim a population of a million souls, while the smaller ones may claim only thousands.
So far it is reported that tribe chieftains are waiting for the war when they would fight for the Iraqi President. One of the Northern tribes chieftains said he had asked the central government to provide his tribe with heavy weapons the moment war is declared on their country by the Americans. No weapons reached him so far, he commented.
The Iraqi regime structure relies on the tribal element. Tikrit to which the Iraqi president belonged represented an important element in the Iraqi government equation.
Israeli Television correspondent Odid Granoth said on air from Cairo that Egyptian key officials told him that Egyptian Intelligence Agency Chief Omar Solyman gave a strongly-worded warning to Hamas' leaders in Cairo, threatening that if Hamas pursued operations against the Hebrew state, then Egypt would announce soon that the organization is "anti-peace", and would sever all relations with it.

IRAQI OIL MINISTER AXED FOLLOWING DISPUTE WITH OUDI
Amer Al Saadi, and not Amer Rashid, was entitled to represent the Iraqi Government in its talks with UNMOVIC, sources confirmed.

The CAPMS chairman cautioned against random import, calling for imposing restrictions on imported products whose Egyptian counterparts are available here. He wondered how bananas are imported from Morocco, though Egyptian ones are more sweet, a certain kind of cheese is imported for 160 pounds per kg, and air-conditioners and TV sets are brought in from abroad while there are pioneering enterprises specialized in this field.
THE FUTURE OF ISLAMIC ACTION
Certainly, Islamic Organizations can no longer practise their activities in the way they did in the past, but handing them over "in toto" and unconditionally to Mr. Kofi Annan would be wishful thinking.
For the first time in the Egyptian history, Orthodox Copts celebrated the Christmas within an official public holiday as per a presidential edict last month. Christians were satisfied by the decision.
The Muslim Brotherhood had succeeded in concluding a deal to control Al-Liwaa Al-Arabi newspaper of limited distribution, after they have lost "Afaq Arabia" newspaper when Al-Ahrar party withdrew it, as some considered it as the mouthpiece of the Muslim Brotherhood.
And it sent to Cairo saying that if the American strike against Iraq occurred, Washington would grant additional aid to Egypt.
The Saudi justification is that in such case, the decision to hit Iraq would be an international one, making it imperative for United Nations members to cooperate for putting it into effect.
It may mean that Egypt has helped the United States in the issue of hitting Iraq or has promised to do something for which it must be rewarded with additional aid.
Therefore, what Egypt must do now is to adopt a clear and decisive stand on this possible war, and I believe that what has been announced in this respect so far is not enough.
We must also be aware, and make others aware too, of the grave dangers against the whole region, its present and its future, due to the attempts to bring two great peoples, the Iraqi and the Palestinian, to their knees simultaneously and disarm them with American and Israeli military force.
As a key party and a central country that can play a weighty and historic role, Egypt is interested in facilitating a dialogue between Palestinian factions, he said.
Yesterday, Future Centre for Studies and Researches, which sponsors the initiative for reconciliation between Islamists and Arab governments issued a statement wishing that those governments would respond to that initiative and try to activate it.
On the other hand, senior security official said that Egypt had managed to eliminate several violence and terrorism crimes. Assistant Minister of the Interior, Major General Mohamed Sha'rawi said, "The Egyptian security bodies managed to eliminate several violence and terrorism crimes while several countries of the world are still suffering from such a serious phenomenon. Such a serious security performance has been given credit by all regional and international security bodies."
In a sudden development, Eritrea has appointed a representative in the Arab League (AL) as "observer". The new representative, ambassador Hassan Kurdi, is likely to reach Cairo before the end of the instant month to discharge his new duties.

The first transit shipment of Jordanian farming produce has been exported to West Europe via the Israeli Haifa Seaport, according to agricultural sources.
The shipment is expected to take at least one week from Haifa Seaport to European countries, the sources added.
Well-informed sources told Al-Ahram correspondent, Ahmed Moussa, that State Security Investigation forces had monitored the terrorist organization members led by a certain Ihab Ismail, who formed three groups in Mahalla Al-Kobra, Al-Beheira and Cairo. He used the Internet for contacting Jihad leaderships abroad and rented several flats to harbour the organization elements. He also bought some cars and two factories for manufacturing explosives in Al-Kulg and Al-Nubareya.
This is only a message to those who are setting the fire of terrorism and then leave us the whole responsibility of putting such a fire out.
They prepared a programme for holding study meetings inside houses, owned by them, where they were provided with publications containing the ideology of the extremist organization of Jihad. They also prepared the elements physically through tough exercises and taught them how to discover security follow-up techniques. They instructed them to shave their beards, use code names and carry forged IDs during their movements for the sake of camouflage. The leader, Ihab Ismail, also ordered his elements to abandon their houses and move to Cairo where they rented several flats for their residence.
The group planned to use the most intelligent carrier pigeons so that each pigeon would carry 200 grams of TNT explosives with one hundred grams fixed to each foot.
The defendants admitted that the Jenin massacres perpetrated by Israeli occupation authorities against the unarmed Palestinian people had aroused their emotions and desire for performing any Jihad act. They thought of traveling to Palestine for Jihad, but could not, and hence they started to plan for carrying out operations against foreign interests.
The Supreme Administrative Court made an important principle in the Egyptian political life when it decided in the ruling whereases that the Parties' Committee is not empowered to determine the destiny of parties or interfere in their affairs, through recognizing a party's leader or not.
In its reply to Port Said Ikhwanite MP, Akram Al Sha'ir, the Egyptian government pointed out that it had stymied an Egyptian company's attempt to import American hospitals' wastes and rubbish, store and smuggle them into the country in breach of previous government decision to re-export those rejected consignments.
BRITISH INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL FOLLOWS UP INTER-PALESTINIAN DIALOGUE IN CAIRO
The anti-Cairo dialogue Fatah trend calls for holding this dialogue in Al-Muqata building in Ramallah.
On January 6th, Turkey officially asked for joining the Arab League after the repeated futile attempts to join the European Union.
For his part, Gul emphasized that the Turkish government decided to forge its relations with Arab countries.
The draft constitution will be viewed as the touchstone of the U.S. administration's willingness to abide by the official position on establishing an independent Palestinian statehood.

JEWS IN MOROCCO LESS THAN 5,000 LIVING IN CASABLANCA
The number of the Jews who are still living in Morocco is an untrodden issue that is scarcely dealt with in Morocco because the Moroccan laws do not discriminate between citizens on religious basis.
Jews in Morocco live in Casablanca and Rabat. Few numbers of them live in Marrakech, Fez, Agadir and Tangier.
This call came during his reception of a popular delegation in the occupied city of Haifa. "Once my home arrest is over, I would form a Christian delegation to visit Iraq to work as human shields against the potential aggression on Iraq, " he stated.
WAR MID-FEBRUARY
Third: Sand would be much denser at that time, so that tanks and armours could move easily.
Hordes of central security police which flowed into the constituency and besieged over 100 election stations struck terror into voters' hearts especially after a curfew had been imposed and security cordons prevented voters from reaching the polls.

ISRAELI ADVANCED EQUIPMENT TO DETECT BORDERLINE TUNNELS
NEW TURKEY..AAND THE WAR
Nobody can imagine that the US would proceed towards its expected war without securing full Turkish cooperation.
It is true that its Atlantic side imposes obligations on it, but most of the Atlantic countries move at two paces towards the American war; a military pace trying to cope as much as it can with Washington's pressure and a political pace displaying slowness, objection and conditions.
Summing up the essence of the Turkish orientations, there is no exaggeration to say that Ankara does not seek a regional reconciliation strategy as much as it seems to be concerned with the war loots it could get.
Turkey's position is however lower than that of Israel and the evidence is that Israel started to get the price of its participation in the war on Iraq but Turkey would only get the minimum of its requests.
Israel has urgently voiced concern over the direct serious impacts of North Korea's decision to withdraw from Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) on the Middle East region. It claimed that the close relations between North Korea and each of Iran, Syria and Libya involve serious threats to the Hebrew State's security.
Furthermore, the report alleges that Syria has been bent for the last two years on developing a biological weapon containing the Ricin toxin, which damages the lungs and might cause death and which Israel has got no effective remedy for.
It claims that Damascus is practising a "dual" policy, while participating in the anti-terrorism war, to avoid being included in the axis of evil list, it regards terrorism a legitimate means to achieve political results.
On Sunday, Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) led by John Garang said that the new military agreement between Khartoum and Kampala signed by Sudanese Defence Minister Major General Bakri Hassan Saleh and his Ugandan counterpart regarding pursuing Ugandan rebels in South Sudan runs counter to the valid truce with the Sudanese government since last October.
AND WHY SHOULD SADDAM STEP DOWN!
This shift in American propaganda campaigns from insisting on the removal of Iraq's arsenal of mass destruction weapons to insisting on the removal of the regime headed by Saddam Hussein synchronizes with the emergency of the inspection operations results which gave the lie to American and British allegations, thus making it necessary to find another goal for the war.
Why don't the Americans have a liking for a ruler like Venezuela's President Chavez even though he had been elected by his people? Why do they now try to topple him?
Washington, which offered Amman an annual assistance to the value of $450 million in the past, has decided to increase its assistance to Jordan to hit about $1 billion in light of the losses the Jordanian economy would sustain in case of war outbreak, the sources said.
In a sit-in staged in the Red Cross headquarters in Gaza he said, "The prisoners in the Israeli occupation jails are waiting for being exchanged with (Israeli) hostages.
On the other hand, Sheikh Yassin wondered: Why does the U.S. want to solve its problem with North Korea peacefully and solve its problems with us through aircraft, tanks and missiles?
He also called on Arab countries and liberals of the world not to side with the aggression and the unfair war mobilized by America.
Lebanon's Interior Minister Ellias al-Mur, who was also the conference president, and CAIM Secretary-General Mohamed bin Ali Kuman, said a technical committee was formed of Arab interior and justice ministers to mull over including the crimes of instigating and commending terrorist acts, printing, publishing and distributing terror-related circulars, owning and using property in terrorist purposes in the list of terrorist crimes amerciable according to the anti-terror Arab agreement.

Both visits were shrouded in secrecy and news about them leaked only on the last day.
He added that the visit would be "an important political step" to promote relations. He expected Sultanov to hold high level meetings.
The executive authorities have also been accustomed to charging international human rights organizations with collaboration with Western and Israeli intelligence agencies even though those organizations reports took care to take into account the points of view of both the government representatives and the victims.
In order that this step may lead to a better tackling of facts, it should be developed through seriously attempting to set up a ministry for human rights as is the case with some Arab Maghrib countries if we want to gain the support of international public opinion for our causes especially as the guilt of violating freedoms has extended to include, besides the government, categories that advocate despotism, alienation and opinion monopoly. These are categories that evade a confrontation with challenges of the age and is incapable of extending its vision towards the future.
The argument of the "axis of evil" has particularly fallen apart completely and entirely failed to stand the Korean test revealing both fragility and impetuosity.
Why is negotiation permissible with Pyongyang but a taboo with Baghdad? If, in both cases, no heed is paid by the USA to the interests of both peoples why, then, should a disaster crisis be avoided there, but courted here?

PARALLEL WAR
What is going on, then, is some kind of moving in a vicious circle in a bid to blind the Arab peoples to and divert their attention from military preparations for hitting Iraq. If Tony Blair could possibly positively influence on Bush, Israel would constantly ruled out from the game.
Iraq fully responded to the UN resolutions and opened all its bases to the UN weapons inspectors and bore all their ribaldries and acts of provocation. It is only Iraq that has the right to say it is sick and tired as Iraq has not heard a good word from the US Administration or its British ally after all that cooperation.
The inspection period will end after two weeks at most. It is not expected that they would find the mass destruction weapons they are hunting for a very simple reason; the non-existence of such weapons, as the Iraqi officials affirm. This explains the state of nervous confusion President Bush is going through, which urged him to say he went out of patience.
Meanwhile, the respite for submitting such lists was extended till next 28th March.

The Saudi initiative adopts constructive points such as the rejection of any external aggression on any Arab country, implementation of internal reforms, enhancement of political participation, human resources development and creation of optimal conditions for a comprehensive Arab revival, all these and other points have remarkably been included in several Arab agreements and treaties like Arab Collective Defence and the Arab Common Market as well as most final statements issued by Arab summits since they started in the mid sixties of the previous century.
Talk about the enhancement of political participation is loose talk simply because it would practically mean the end of most current Arab regimes and we do not think that those regimes would step down and relinquish power of their own accord. Our contention can find solid evidence in the fact that the vast majority of Arab rulers, monarchs and presidents alike are planning to transfer power to their own sons.
Under this headline, chief editor of Al-Quds Al-Arabi, Abd Al-Bari Atwan writes an article, excerpts from which run to the following effect: Next week, Arab leaders and officials will head for Turkey in response to Turkey's invitation to seek a peaceful way out of the Iraqi crisis.
The crises of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, Iran and Turkey may be more dangerous and complicated than that of Iraq that they seek to solve. The whole world sympathizes with Iraq and sees the U.S. offensive amoral aiming at economic cupidity. However, the crises of the neighbouring countries especially the Arab ones, would rise to the surface on the following day of attacking Iraq, as demonstrations, anarchy, unrest and terrorist acts would break out in the whole region that might topple such regimes which are remiss to hold their moral and national duties just like what took place following the 1948 Nakba (catastrophe; when Palestine fell at the hands of the Jews and Arab armies were defeated).
The regional countries that would participate in the coming Ankara summit can avoid the war if they take similar actions along the lines of those of North Korea's neighbours, i.e. refusing any kind of cooperation with the U.S. aggression, siding with Iraq in its confrontation and calling for lifting the ban imposed on it completely.

A SAUDI INITIATIVE FOR SUMMIT: START OF NEW POLITICAL THOUGHT?
Criticism has been allowed provided that no specific Arab country is marked as a case of this reality.
After that, particularly after the 1991 Gulf war, the criticism of Arab reality became a mark of the Arab media.
It is special media as it enjoys a wider margin of freedom than that of the local official, or private media.
It is striking in this connection that the criticism leveled at the Arab reality in the parallel media is met with official silence, silence on commenting supported sometimes by winking at the acrimony of the criticism, but on condition of specifying no country being maintained.
It may be clear that this relationship is not governed by the fundamentals of law and rights. Rather, it is measured by the rules of a political game imposed by many developments that came over the Arab world in recent years. These developments urged the cultured or opinion-holders to be more modest towards stalemated reality and made the man of power, vis-à-vis the same reality, be more receptive to criticism as long as he is not the direct butt of criticism.
What happened last week is not totally irrelevant, but came at the end of a series of Arab movements and statements all intended to officially emphasize the Arab weakness whether in Palestine or Iraq or before the deterioration of the political and economic conditions inside each country separately.
The Arab world faces for the first time a real challenge related to its future".
The first main point is taking pledge before the peoples to secure the sovereignty of the Arab countries and the unity of their land and building Arab defense capabilities.
Therefore, the three main proposals of the initiative were related to the role of the governments in the issues of defense and political action inside every country and the restructuring of the Arab regional order to protect it from falling apart.
The two proposals related to the re-building of the Arab defense capabilities and the development of political participation inside the Arab countries should be noticed here.
The notable point in the other proposal is that it sees that the political participation comes within the self-reform program and that both represent a base for an Arab rebirth.
This is a new and positive development in the Saudi political scene.
However, these proposals need a key and complementary point; the point of freedom, freedom of thought and freedom of expression.
The political participation as a concept is not confined to the role of the official and legislative institutions, but even goes beyond this to the fields of research and media and all forms of expression.
But, on the other hand, those carry a big part of this responsibility simply because they are the men of power and decision.
Although the relationship between the two responsibilities is of controversial nature here, the beginning of reform must be from the men of power and nobody else.
We should not disregard here the local conditions and their interactions with the external conditions as a key factor also in this regard.
Al-Adli was speaking at the conclusion of the Arab Interior and Information ministers meeting in Tunisia.

In a first reaction to the bill which has yet to be put up for discussion, Egyptian deputies said that the National Democratic Party (NDP) deputy (Fayka Al-Refa'i) had embarrassed the ruling party and its government because Egyptian Railways was excluded from privatization under clear-cut government pledges when the privatization programme started in 1991.

UN General Commission for Refugees official statistics issued by its Cairo-based office emphasized that there are 10 thousand political refugees throughout Egypt.
The Egyptian government decided to set up a pentagonal committee to face the illegitimate emigration phenomenon into Egypt or of Egyptians to Europe, especially for some nationalities that use Egypt as a transit station to Europe.
There are 3 categories of political refugees in Egypt. Firstly, rulers, premiers or senior officials in their countries who were deposed through a political coup or a change in the government system or due to differences with the ruling regime, which forced them to come to Egypt and these are few in number.
An official in the Refugee Commission in Cairo says that Egypt is one of the leading countries with old traditions for granting political asylum without being biased to a certain individual or his affiliation even before the signature of the relevant international agreement.
He added that the list of most famous political asylum seekers in Egypt includes field martial Abdullah Al-Sallal, former president of Yemen, Ali Nasser Mohamed former president of South Yemen, Abdul-Hamid Al-Sarrag, former deputy premier of Syria, Ali Saleh Al-Saadi, former Iraqi general secretary of Baath Party and deputy premier, Ahmed Bin Billa, former Algerian leader, Al-Habib Bourkeiba, former Tunisan president, Al-Mahdi Bin Baraka, Moroccan political leader, Prince Abdel-Karim Al-Khatabi, former Moroccan leader, Omar Al-Mihaishi, former member of Libyan Revolutionary Council, Abdel-Hamid Al-Bakkush, former Libyan premier, Mohamed Reda Bahlavi, former Iranian Shah, Ahmed Zogho (son of former Albanian King), Hussein Habri, former Chadian minister of defence, Ibrahim Tobal, former leader of Tunisian opposition, Gafaar Al-Numeiri, former Sudanese president, Abdel-Khalek Al-Mahgoub, a Sudanese leader during Gafaar Al-Numeiri era.

MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY PREFERS AUC GRADUATES
SHURA COUNCIL CALLS FOR REVIVING JONGLEI CANAL PROJECT IN SUDAN
FOREIGN DIPLOMATS IN ISRAEL LEAVE FOR EILAT OR TABA FOR FEAR OF WAR
Israeli military commanders met on Tuesday to discuss a potential high alert during the Israeli general elections next Tuesday in anticipation of suicide bombing attacks. The military may remain on high alert until a potential war on Iraq is over, as requested by Israeli military sources.
In a lengthy interview with French political weekly newspaper Al-Amari said, "We have broken the backbone of the terrorists and only one thousand of them have been left."
Al-Amari's talk about accepting Islamists reminds those interested in the Algerian affairs of what happened in 1992 when the military, all of a sudden changed the game rules and stopped the elections when they sensed that the Islamic Salvation Front would certainly win and would soon form a government without the need of any others taking part.
He added, "We had difficulty getting even the ammunition used for shooting rifles for municipality guards."
Other banners called on the Arab nation from the Atlantic Ocean as far as the Arab Gulf to get united against the looming U.S.-led aggression on Iraq. The sitters-in also urged churches across the world to protest the potential U.S. aggression on the Arab country. They further commended Palestinian heroic martyrdom operations against Israeli targets, criticizing "Americanized and Zionist-ized persons" who consider such operations as "terrorist attacks".
From the Easter Church, we greet heroic martyrs and their families who should be catered for and supported since they are targeted by the occupation forces."
"Why do infamous western circles linked to Zionism want to describe resistance as terrorism, while winking at the fact that occupation is the real terrorism," he wondered. "It is our duty to resist for resistance is a patriotic action in the first place."
Hizbullah deputy in the Lebanese parliament, Abdullah Qusair made an announcement to the effect that all of Hizbullah operations against Israeli sites were but reactions to Israeli aggression on Lebanese civilians. This announcement raised questions whether Hizbullah intends to suspend its operations against Israeli sites at the time being.
He added that the timing of this announcement did not mean that Hizbullah refrained from launching operations against occupation.
Hizbullah will not intentionally open the South front during the U.S. war against Iraq, but it will be ready to square up to an Israeli move towards the Lebanese lands, he pointed out.
Double that number of refugees have also been monitored by unofficial statistics about whom the Commission is entirely in the dark.
The procedures of official bodies approval of granting political asylum confirms that the guidelines in that regard may be found in the July 1951 agreement and the January 1967 protocol on political refugees status as well as the items of international law.
Secondly, old refugees who came early last century and belong to different nationalities. This categories are mostly Armenians who lived in Cairo and Alexandria, merged with the community and worked in tobacco, jewellery, shoes and photography industries. They just like their counterparts in Lebanon, have become such an organized sect that they were allowed by local authorities to elect a sectarian council and set a constitution of their own.
Now Egypt is considered one of the least refugee hosting countries.

Family expenditure on health care including herbal medicines also increased by 69% in urban areas and 38% in rural areas.
The report said that population of governorate metropolitan cities had the highest annual income, followed by city dwellers and then the rural population. It added that the gap between the lowest and the highest average incomes has widened in the last years, with the lowest reaching LE400 and the highest hitting over LE20 thousand. The citizen with over LE2000 income have constituted the widest base while the most disadvantaged constituted a tiny percentage as their number reached only 6 families out of 48 thousand families from all governorates.
Jordanian officials told Al-Hayat that Jordan's ability to absorb the consequences of the American strike to Iraq has improved after getting international and Arab guarantees to minimize the Kingdom's losses and pledges to preserve Jordan's security and stability during military operations especially regarding its Western borders with Israel.
Israel's entering the war on the USA side would double Jordan's fears of security disruptions in its street strongly sympathizing with Baghdad and would intensify confrontation with the political opposition especially the Islamic opposition which issued a fatwa (religious opinion) forbidding the extension of any form of support to Washington in its imminent war against Iraq.
The sources said that the evacuation decision would likely be left to the nationals' choice. Every EU embassy in Amman will send memos to its nationals in Jordan showing its willingness to help them if they want to leave Jordan and pay cash assistance to them if they have not enough money.
IKHWANITE MP PRESENTS DRAFT LAW BANNING TV COMPETITIONS
"There is a rapid growth in the economy of gambling such as what is so-called TV reward programmes," he said. Such programmes have become an important channel for spreading the "luck culture," which is contrary to work and production. Besides, they drain part of the incomes of those who participate in such programmes, he pointed out.
For Egypt, there is a set of circumstances that pushed it to facilitate this dialogue.
After all, the dialogue was an opportunity for Egypt to regain its part, and, at the same time, to keep intact Yasser Arafat's leadership, which appeared to be jeopardized unprecedentedly in recent months not only by the Hebrew country and its greater sponsor, but also by internal forces that seemed to be yearning to get engaged in the alternative leadership game.
We are not with those who said Cairo did want to suspend resistance.
Although opposition against him mounted in recent months, the message of dialogues will send matters back to normal, anticipating a different kind of shift, which is represented in attacking Iraq, a stage which was also heeded by Cairo so as to short-circuit any Palestinian bid to abate its referentiality.
In this context, to suspend resistance is a rejectable option to Fatah as it will undermine the popularity it won during the Al-Aqsa Intifada. The masses can not give anyone a "dud cheque" as the option of reversing can not be viable under Israeli suppression, killings and destruction in the fiercest, but greatest, battle, in the history of the Palestinians.
Neither Hamas nor Jihad went to Cairo to sign what may end their presence and influence represented by resistance for which martyrs sacrificed themselves so their line should be maintained. However, tactics should be reversed in a certain stage, just as what happened for weeks following the September 11 attacks on the U.S. or in 1998-2000.
MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY PREFERS AUC GRADUATES
SHURA COUNCIL CALLS FOR REVIVING JONGLEI CANAL PROJECT IN SUDAN
FOREIGN DIPLOMATS IN ISRAEL LEAVE FOR EILAT OR TABA FOR FEAR OF WAR
Israeli military commanders met on Tuesday to discuss a potential high alert during the Israeli general elections next Tuesday in anticipation of suicide bombing attacks. The military may remain on high alert until a potential war on Iraq is over, as requested by Israeli military sources.
Private commercial and investment banks also sold the dollar to their clients for prices similar to those of public banks.
Officials with these banks justified their stance refusing imposition of commission by lack of specified instructions issued by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) that stipulate imposition of currency procurement commission on opening credits on clients. These banks fear to face risks in case of selling the dollar for the black market prices, which swing from time to time.
Egyptian businessman, Rashed Mohamed Rashed has been appointed head of the first Egyptian-Dutch business council.
The Dutch commercial attaché laid it bare that the Dutch businessmen had requested the commercial department with the Dutch embassy to compile a study around Toshka for considering the possibility of transferring Toshka products to Europe through Abu-Simble and Marsa Alam airports as a springboard for Dutch companies to invest in Egypt.
He pointed out that the British companies seek to go into long-term partnership relationship with the Egyptian government and the private sector.
JAPANESE DELEGATION TO STUDY PROJECTS PROPOSED BY EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT
The visit came in response to the important visit paid by Minister of Foreign Affairs, Fayza Abul-Naga to Japan recently. During that visit, cooperation aspects were discussed and priorities were defined in 6 areas:
The Japanese ambassador said that the size of trade exchange between Egypt and Japan amounted to $580 million, out of which only $80 million as Egyptian exports to Japan. He added that they wanted to achieve balance, as Egypt would set up an organization for foreign trade on the model of the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO). It would aim at promoting and marketing Egyptian products on external markets.
STATISTICS: SERIOUS RETREAT IN DEMAND FOR CREDIT IN EGYPTIAN BANKS
It is noteworthy that the size of deposits in Egyptian banking system reached LE351.16 billion at the end October last and that total credits and facilities did not exceed about 80% of the deposits.
This, in consequence, affected the demand of serious or even faltering businessmen especially as the state of market recession is still on. Al-Barbari said that there was another important problem that affected bank profits. This problem popped up after intervention to cover the banks short positions in foreign exchange by using a part of the reserves while letting the banks secure their own resources. It is known that banks made profits from the differential in foreign exchange operations.
On the other hand, new banking leaderships believe the current stage is a transitional one and cannot, therefore, be considered the basis for final rules. President of State-owned Bank of Alexandria says that undergoing various economic circumstances have unveiled the market real problems as well as banks defects and the limitations of the system adopted in taking decisions to face such problems.
Abdel-Sattar Ishra, an advisor to the Egyptian Federation of Chambers of Commerce, said Egypt and Saudi Arabia are forecast to make consultations soon on arrangements for a joint conference of businessmen in Riyadh. The gathering is aimed to reinforce and bolster bilateral trade and investment cooperation between both nations and remove any relevant barriers, he said. Egyptian-Saudi economic cooperation is anticipated to see a marked boom this year following recent talks in Cairo between the Saudi foreign, commerce, finance and economy ministers, and Egypt's prime minister and ministers of finance and foreign trade, Ishra said. Now that both countries' leaders are willing to cement and shore up economic cooperative ties, businessmen from both countries will be stimulated to set up joint mega projects in several vital spaces, and relevant officials will be pushed to remove any technical hurdles impeding this direction, he said.
The government plans to put a package of measures in place, including banning cabinet ministries from buying or importing new commodities, regulating state import operations and obliging the public sector to meet its needs out of its respective resources, the minister added.
The pound has lost 36 percent of its value in four drops since late 2000 when its exchange rate stood at LE3.40 against the U.S. dollars, it said.
Delegates attending the economic conference quoted the prime minister and the CBE governor as saying that exchange rates would be deregulated as of Wednesday, with banks given a free rein to determine prices, it said.
There were different reactions around the liberalization of exchange rate decision. Exporters and exchange companies owners praised this step stressing that it will better the Egyptian product competitiveness, while importers were worried about the negative impacts of this decision. The Chambers of Commerce warned against the high increase in goods prices after pound floatation.
Cairo Chamber cashier, Mossa'd Abul-Makarim, described the new decision as a disaster for manufacturers, who depend on intermediary commodities and raw materials, adding that the prices will witness the same increase of dollar rate of exchange.
Head of Grocers and Supermarket Traders Division, Sayed Abdeen, expects a new rise in commodities prices.
The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) and the Ministry of Finance have agreed on allocating LE4 billion of the retained reserves of CBE last years' profits for increasing the capital of the six public banks, the commercial and specialized ones.
NEW BMW ASSEMBLY PLANT TO BE ERECTED IN EGYPT AFTER TERMINATION OF FORMER ABUL FOTOUH AGENCY
The two sides were engaged in talks over the past two years in a bid to solve their differences, but to no avail.
The contract has been signed between the German Group and the winner group that had formed a German-Arab consortium under the name of Bavaria Auto Company that is registered in Egypt. Bavaria has recently approved the final conditions of the agreement. Al Hayat also learned that Bavaria Company will erect a car assembly plant with an annual capacity of 5000 cars of the 300- and 500-class models, plus X-class 4-wheel-drive cars that AFA used to import in the past.
The distribution contract also expired on 31 December 2002, and was not extended, either.
Contacts are also underway for building maintenance and repair workshops according to high standards that BMW imposed in the contract to insure maintenance and after-sale services to customers.
MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM DENIES NATURAL GAS EXPORTS TO ISRAEL
The Arab natural gas project, which is expected to start operation by 2005, involves Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, it said. An agreement has already been reached among the four countries on establishing an Arab gas organization and an Arab company for transporting and marketing natural gas.
Egyptians spend LE10 billion per annum on magic and superstition, revealed the study pointing out that half of the Egyptian women believe in superstition. They go secretly and publicly to quacks. Charlatans' fees in Egypt, stated the study, are either meager sums that do not exceed LE10 or huge amounts that hit LE10,000 for famous charlatans, who are frequented by not only Egyptians but also the haves of the Arabian oil states.
There are similar villages just like Tanah in Upper and Lower Egypt, which turned along decades into centers for magicians and quacks and are frequented by those who are seeking to have a baby, get married quickly and break spells. Cases, where charlatans are arrested, revealed that they received amounts ranging from ten pounds to 10.000 pounds per visit according to the financial status of the client. This created a myth-like atmosphere around the activities of some of those charlatans. In addition, some artists are used to attending their sessions and some businessmen fetch them by special planes, particularly that some Arabian emirs pay them regular salary per month in US dollar.
There are also frightening and dark figures that leads to one result, i.e. resorting to charlatans and the realm of superstition to solve the problems that people were unable to face such as spinsterhood. They go to charlatans under the pretext of breaking the spell that resulted in girls' spinsterhood. Statistics of the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics point out that the number of young people, who are over 39 and missed the chance of getting married, is 9 million young people.
The World Bank and IMF demands focus on the necessity to reduce the value of the Egyptian pound to reflect its real power against the dollar to cope with the considerable rise in the dollar rate of exchange in the black market.
During the talks with the World Bank, poverty in Egypt as well as the means to combat it will be discussed. The measures taken by the government to support the low-income brackets, create job opportunities and expand the setting up of small projects will also be discussed.
WASHINGTON ORDERS ITS EMBASSIES TO MAKE READY FOR EVACUATING U.S. NATIONALS
It also quoted "influential sources" in Washington as saying that President Bush intends to heat the situation through his weekly "state of union speech" on Tuesday to come.
Due to the high number and gravity of such offences, the command is no longer able to conceal them.
Some of those deserters repeat that offence, which means that there are 3000 soldiers in the regular army and the reservists who are considered chronic deserters. Several others were also imprisoned although the army refrains from announcing accurate information on this issue for security reasons.
Every 3 days, a theft of this type takes place.
The soldier is first lieutenant in the paratroopers corps who served in several areas in the West Bank in the last two years.
It is not accidential that such a big number of offenders were arrested.
Dr. Tantawi's indication, though far from elaborate points out that behind the scene there is a tug-of-war between parties that are always at loggerheads.
The same source told Al-Quds Al-Arabi that those groups contacted some unidentified deputies so that they would raise the question in the PA during its current session in order to change such a penalty.
Are jurists now preparing a draft as a starting point for the argument?
The penalty, however, could not be omitted if it was explicitly provided for in the holy Koran and the Prophet's (PBUH) tradition.
However, capital punishment is permissible only in certain circumstances when it becomes absolutely necessary.
A parliament deputy said, "Matters are of three kinds: wishful thinking, matters that are eligible for argument and discussion and matters that are passed through the People's Assembly and have the force of law in the form of legislation. Blocs and arguments inside the People's Assembly cannot be free of difficult turnings, but this does not mean that if a certain bloc wants to have a certain bill passed, it would, in the course of time, be passed.
Israel has appointed its former consul in Turkey, Eli Shekid as ambassador in Cairo succeeding current ambassador David Bin Ari who is about to leave for Tel Aviv after he has retired. Bin Ami has spent about two years in Cairo.
In its meeting on Thursday, the appointment committee with the Israeli Foreign Ministry endorsed the appointment of Shekid as head of the Israeli diplomatic mission in Cairo. In the same meeting, the committee also endorsed the appointment of Jacob Hadas as ambassador in Jordan.
By the end of last year, Israel had to close down its consulate in Alexandria after it was turned out to be economically unfeasible now that Alexandrians boycotted its activities its consulate had completely failed to convince them of boosting Egyptian-Israeli relations.
A high level source said that Arab countries had informed the American Administration that 7 Arab countries had signed contracts to the value of $9 billion with Iraq under the Oil for Food Agreement concluded in 1997, of which Egypt has the lion's share with contracts to the value of $3 billion, Jordan with half a billion dollars, Saudi Arabia with a third of a billion dollars, the UAE with $800 million, Tunisia with $712 million, Syria with $650 million and Lebanon with $485 million, apart from other countries whose trade would come to a complete standstill.
Furthermore, part of the already exhausted Arab economy will be directed to removing the traces of that war. Development and economic recovery allocations will shift to the remedying of the economic deterioration ensuing from the war.
Premier Atef Ebeid issued a decision on 29th Jan. on modifying the executive statute of law no. 38 for the year 1996 regarding dealing in foreign exchange.
Regarding non-banking bodies licensed to deal in foreign exchange, modifications confined their activities to buying and selling "banknotes" for their own benefit and under their auspices as well as buying, collecting and selling travellers' cheques issued by banks operative in Egypt and abroad. Collecting in case of purchase and coverage in case of selling are carried out through their accounts with an accredited bank in Egypt.
On his part CBE, governor Mahmoud Abul-Oyoon notified exchange firms of the new amendments introduced to monetary law, foremost of which is the fact that exchange firms are not allowed to determine foreign exchange rates, enforcing each exchange firm to declare its rates of exchange in agreement with any of the accredited banks and tell its clients that these rates are the exchange rates of the bank it has agreed with.
Abul-Oyoon voiced hopes that in light of this new system exchange firms abide by the new rules issued by the premier on 29th Jan.
Abul-Oyoon threatened to withdraw the licenses of banks and exchange firms in case of violating the new policy.
He pointed out that decontrolling exchange rates would be done according to the average price between banks on the previous day according to the system applied in the bourse.
The government decided to grant exchange firms a last chance to join the new banking system through their presence as legal outlets beside banks for the circulation of currency.
An expanded meeting would be held on 2 February 2003 to be attended by bank leaderships and exchange firm owners to coordinate efforts for the implementation of the new exchange rate system.
Last Wednesday, the latest rate of exchange of the dollar was 525 pts.

On his part, Department of Assay and Weight head, Maj. General, Sayed Mo' men, emphasized that in spite of the retreat of demand for gold on the Egyptian market owing to the increase of gold prices internationally, the quantity that was hallmarked until now, 250 tons, was just the same as the quantity of the corresponding period last year. He pointed out that it was difficult to predict the future of gold prices within the coming period, especially under the current fluctuation. While all expectations refer that the price of the gram of 21-carat gold would continue to report increase.
The German government has agreed to extend an 8.8-million-euro grant, about 40 million pounds, to the Ministry of Agriculture with a view to implementing a project for developing the cotton sector so that its contribution to the national income could be increased.
In conclusion of the first session works of the joint committee on fishing, Kammon stressed the necessity of making the two countries go into partnership. The success of this partnership would completely depend on the degree of cooperation of the private sector and public bodies in the two countries, he pointed out.
The minister told Al-Alam Al-Youm that the preliminary costs of studies of different projects hit about 3 billion dollars. These projects cover 7 sectors including irrigation, electricity, energy, dredging of the Nile water course and establishment of joint agricultural and productive projects.
Abu-Zeid added that a joint committee would be formed of experts from Egypt, Sudan and Libya with a view to studying and exploiting water of the Nubian subterranean reservoir as a prelude to extensive expansion operations and reclamation of more lands by investors, particularly as studies proved the high value and quality of border lands between the three countries.
The public sector got 1.1 billion pounds of such facilities. The governmental sector was granted just 0.4 billion pounds, while credit facilities granted to foreign countries went down by 0.6 billion pounds, the report stated.
FINANCIAL EXPERT: POUND FLOTATION CONSOLIDATES COMPETITIVENESS OF EXPORTS AND TOURISM, HARMS INVESTORS AND DEPOSITORS
He thought that floating the pound and adopting an exchange rate according to supply and demand would enhance the competitiveness of Egyptian exports, with the pound rate of exchange going down. It will make the tourism market in Egypt cheaper and more competitive. However, it will do harm to depositors and investors in the Egyptian pound when the value of their investments are estimated at the dollar, and the pound purchasing power, he made it clear.
He warned against dollarizing the pound and called on the Central Bank of Egypt to take measures that could guarantee the continuation of dealing in the Egyptian pound.
This was declared by General Federation of Chambers of Commerce chairman, Khalid Abou-Ismail, who pointed out the aim is activating the off-set system and implementing the agreement that was signed during the Egyptian delegation visit to Russia in the last few days.
It was agreed on organizing an exhibition for marketing and promoting different kinds of Egyptian products in the coming year, he stressed pointing out that this comes within the framework of measures taken by the Egyptian side to restore Russian market.
One of the "promoters" for privatization companies said in case of selling any public enterprise sector company to a foreign investor at a value of 100 million pounds, the investor used to exchange 21.6 million dollars before the deregulation decree, but now he would exchange only 16.6 million dollars.
Therefore, financial positions of the companies that have foreign exchange resources would improve in contradiction to the companies that take out loans and import raw materials necessary for production in dollar. Such companies would incur losses owing to differentials in exchange rates of currency that are bigger than before.
Hudeibi's tenure is forecast to see a drastic about-turn in view of relations between the Muslim Brotherhood and other forces, who were previously rejected by the group. Responding to a question by Al-Majalla weekly on the secret layers of this shift which was a bolt out of the blue, the Ikhwan leader said reports on a historic reconciliation between the Muslim Brotherhood and the Nasserite Party were grossly misrepresented. He noted, "I said some misconstrue that we do not meet with the Nasserites on the grounds that there was a problem or crisis between us and late Nasser. But, we repeatedly met with party leaders since national unity requires coordination among all opposition parties to square up to the outside danger threatening all of us, Ikwhan, Nasserites, communists, liberals and others.
Could they disagree over necessary fair, free and independent elections, free mass media and political factional formations?"
Next to the USA comes Canada (110 thousands), Italy (90 thousands), Australia (70 thousands), Greece (60 thousands), Holland (40 thousands), France (36 thousands), the UK (35 thousands) and Germany (12 thousands).

It is noteworthy that according to a modern study by Scientific Research Academy, Egypt's loss through this phenomenon is estimated at about LE50 billion.
The lawsuit said, "This contravenes the law and the constitution. The state discriminates in treatment between the sons of one homeland, celebrating the Hegira Calendar beginning during which ministries and government offices stop work, but fails, either consciously or unconsciously, to mark the Coptic Calendar beginning.
He added, "Continuation of such omission does harm to Egypt's civilization position as a pioneering state in national unity and harmony between religions."
"We will review the initial report concluded by ad hoc committee on those two subjects," he said, pointing out that the secretariat would mull over a memo submitted by the party's youth.
In a television interview, he said that world countries "started to reconsider their previous attitudes after they had thought they would be safe from terrorism in spite of Egypt's warnings".
He said, "Prisons provide their inmates with many services, prepare and rehabilitate them to be good people in the society.
In an indication to government measures against "Muslim Brotherhood", Al-Hudhaibi said, "the attempts to exclude popular forces that have a record in edifying generations, cultivating virtue and values and resisting Zionist colonialism in Palestine under pretexts and allegations which are groundless and illogical cannot be considered in favour of the Islamic nation." Muslim Brotherhood, he added, are advocates of national unity and the necessity to put Arab and Islamic matters in order. They are doing their duty towards the Islamic call adopting dialogue as a civilized way.
He went on to say that if that war broke out, it would not end in a year or a couple of years as no military force would be able to defeat the Arabs who would fight the Americans using a technique similar to that used by the Palestinian intifada and the Lebanese resistance against Israeli occupation forces.
LE5 BILLION ROAD ACCIDENTS LOSSES

This has been done on instructions from Minister of Industry and Technological Development Dr. Ali Al-Saidi. The initial reports of chambers of commerce uncovered that the Engineering Industries Sector would be the most harmed by the war on Iraq due to its companies having the largest presence among different companies on the Iraqi market. According to the reports, the losses to be incurred by this sector is estimated at about one billion pounds.
Geneidi pointed out that he would submit a memo of the losses of the engineering sector to Foreign Trade Minister, Dr. Youssef Botros Ghali.
KUWAITI NEWSPAPERS WARN MINISTER OF INFORMATION AGAINST CROSSING REDLINES
These statements incited owners of Kuwaiti newspapers, which present themselves as advanced vanguard for the country's dignity and unity. They considered Prince Al-Fahd's statements as crossing the redlines and social covenant between the state and the media which is considered "a fourth estate" in terms of its liberal opinion.
therefore, Al-Qabas newspaper sees that attacking the press is considered a redline that cannot be overstepped.
EGYPT MAINTAINS PRIVATIZATION OF STATE-OWNED COMPANIES The privatization of state-owned companies is still in place, and Egypt's national economy is still under restructuring ahead of taking it from centralism to liberalism, said Minister of Public Enterprise Sector Mokhtar Khattab.
The modernization blueprint is part of a plan to cope with new changes and circumstances both at home and abroad, including stumbling capital inflow and foreign investments at international markets, stagnation and inactivity.

DEFENCE MINISTER: PERMANENT AND COMPREHENSIVE PEACE REQUIRES A MILITARY FORCE TO PROTECT AND KEEP IT
WHY RETURN TO DEMOCRACY MILITARIZATION?
What may come next drives us to anticipate prospective scenarios especially in light of the American call to teach the Arabs and Muslims the principles of democratic government, in accordance with the initiative of General Powell as well as other inflammatory initiatives!
We are being urged and pressurized by America, in the name of the necessity of democratic development and cultural, educational, religious and political reform as well as economic opening up and integration with the globalization market. Such demands comply with our peoples' long cherished aspirations and hopes, in quest for progress, liberation, development, social justice, wise government and rotation of power and sharing wealth whether in prosperity or adversity.
Thus the prerequisites of comprehensive and wise reform are put forward now and without delay lest we should fall prey to militarized democracy on the American model that had been previously proposed for Afghanistan and is now being proposed for Iraq and the rest later on in a row.
Large-scale economic, political and media Zionist sway in the U.S. has a clout on some American Christians' decision. Commenting on the controversial issue of cloning, the pope said it is still a bone of contention among many scientists since man is a maker, not a creator.
The Israeli ambassador during one of his meetings in Washington on 28th January reiterated the Israeli allegations that Jerusalem had been along its history the capital of one country, namely the Jewish state.
One the other hand, Pope Shenouda denied rumours that had it that a Coptic satellite channel would be launched soon from the US. He also denied any political role played by the church. This came in a meeting held in the Book Fair and run by head of the Book Authority, Dr. Samir Sarhan.
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General, Mohamed El-Baradei linked the respite he was demanding to the level and quality of Iraqi cooperation with the inspectors. In an interview with Al-Hayat, he said that the inspection chief Hans Blix had not yet reached the point of no return regarding a decision to withdraw owing to disappointment with the situation as being irremediable.
GCC FOREIGN AND DEFENCE MINISTERS TO MEET EXTRAORDINARILY IN RIYADH ON IRAQ STANDOFF
Being pessimistic about the Iraqi standoff, Gulf sources said they are confident that ongoing efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Iraqi issue will be doomed to failure in consequence of U.S. intransigence and insistence on removing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's regime.
Egypt hoped that it would be able to help Palestinian factions reach an articulate and frank agreement. Therefore, Egypt is expected to come up soon with a fresh policy to open up to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, reliable sources said.
The sources concluded by saying "Hamas and Jihad come across a difficult test and challenge because if they adventure their struggle and resistance, the entire Palestinian cause will be at risk."
EGYPTIAN POUND FLOATED
Well-informed sources expected the dollar rate of exchange to reach LE6 on the Egyptian market within the coming days.
PALESTINIAN FACTIONS DECISION DOES NOT HELP MOVE PEACE PROCESS
NEW SAUDI MEMO OF ADVICE CALLING FOR REFORM AND FIGHTING CORRUPTION
The signatories tried to hand the memo to Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdel-Aziz but because his advisors and his office staff denied them access to his office. They resorted to sending it by the express mail. They also sent copies of it to all senior princes in the Saudi royal family.
Saudi sources said that such a project would be the main item on the agenda of the coming Arab League Summit, which would be held in Manama next March.
It might be mentioned that another memo of advice was issued ahead of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. It also called for similar reforms, but no practical implementation has been carried out. The signatories of this memo turned, then, into two Islamic opposition trends: the first was a London-based movement led by Dr. Saad Al-Faqeeh and Dr. Mohamed Al-Mas'ari, which was called An-Nasiha Wal-Islah (Advice and Reform Organization) while the second was more extremist, led by Sheikh Osama Bin Laden which has been calling for expelling the US forces from the Arabian Peninsula.
Without trying to con anybody, this is a war involving governments rather than peoples, involving armies that have long been eager break that peaceful routine, but lacking politicians who look at war as the last resort or remedy.
It is a war that claims the highest share of lies and has the slightest inkling of truth.
Those Europeans are not certainly as enthusiastic for the war as the British Premier, but they are eager to explore the end of the tunnel which the American Administration hard-liners entered and dragged them into too.
They simply ignored the fact that that monster was backed by another bigger American one which is now defying them now making light of the Western street, American and European alike? This might be a harbinger of the imminent war.
After a decade of non-policy, hesitation and confusion, Washington found the only way to cover its diplomatic failure was to unleash its military arsenal in a flexing of strength, the American audience is considered to be in permanent thirst for.
Everybody is trying to hide behind this lie as if the USA would fail to extract a security Council resolution or as if it did not frighten Russia, subordinate Britain, tame China threaten France and Germany to avenge itself on them! Or as if the other nine countries in the Council would object!
It does not want to destroy the infrastructure as if it were going to use mock bombs for intimidation rather than killing and devastating."
They have spent a lot of time trying to convince the world of the inevitability of this war and have used and will use a lot of lies in order to achieve that end so long as it has become imminent. It is not worthwhile to spend more time trying to find means to end the Iraqi people's suffering or shape its future.
Inflation rates may also go up. Would the government increase the wages and salaries to face the negative impacts?
Al-Mahdi pointed out that should the government increase the pay, more inflation would be created as in such case the consumer would have money to buy from the market, which would eventually lead to the traders raising prices. She also revealed that if the government resorted to increasing the pay, this would be done on a very limited scale. Foreign investment escape She affirmed that the decision taken by the government to decontrol the exchange rate was a right decision and the first stage of the application of the decision would witness fluctuations that would bring no stability to the market and nobody knows exactly when the market gets stable.
She pointed out that the flotation would impact on the inflation rates, which might go up along with the prices, which would largely affect the level of the income of limited-income categories.
FIRST RESEARCH LAB FOR CLONING ANIMALS AT CAIRO UNIVERSITY
It to be mentioned that Mostagir called for issuing an international resolution criminalizing cloning humans, however key Muslim scholar, deputy Isma'il Al-Deftar, said that we could research the possibility of cloning human organs for treating patients.
The question raised by many people is connected with the feasibility of taking such a decision at such inopportune economic time whether domestically or internationally. Obviously, the government untimely decision has been urged by the fact that there is a critical retreat in the level of government owned foreign exchange reserves to $14.1 billion, thus making it impossible to use them for maintaining the rate of exchange policy. This was emphasized by the Egyptian president's instructions to his government to keep those reserves unprejudiced. Shock Treatment:
The external sector: Looking at the Egyptian external sector from the previous perspectives, the latest data used by the Central Bank of Egypt say that the Egyptian balance of payments witnessed a decline after 1997 when Egyptian economy was exposed to several incidents which had a considerable negative impact on the Egyptian external sector. These data pointed out that trade balance deficit in the fiscal year 2000/2001 hit about $8 billion. In the same year, commodity exports decreased by 6.1% and oil exports witnessed a sharp decline by 27.7%. AT the level of domestic economy, the economy suffers from high inflationary rates, unemployment and a retreat in economic growth which stood at just 2.5% according to government estimates or 1% according to international estimates in 2001.
The Egyptian side stressed the necessity of abrogating the "five-cases" system and adopting a case by case strategy.
The brown rot disease has infiltrated into the Egyptian soil through the diseased potato imported from some European countries as seeds, he added "We had no idea that didn't know that disease spread in these European countries."
Minister of Tourism, Dr. Mamdouh Al-Beltagi emphasized that the construction and building operation would be maintained in order to add extra hotel capacities and tourism services in Egypt with Arab, foreign and national investments at a time when tourism activities in all the region's countries had halted.

ARAB REGIONAL ORDER DYING
Palestine..democratic reconciliation As the Palestinian issue has been the central Arab cause for over half a century, we directed our question to Palestinian researcher, Dr. Mustafa Al-Barghouthi who said the Arab nation was passing through the most serious stages in its history because its wealth, will, and consolidation as one nation are targeted. The danger comes from several foreign forces mainly including Israel which wants to impose its military, economic, and political tutelage. The Arab oil is particularly targeted, Al-Barghouthi said.
Concluding his talk, Al-Barghouthi stressed if the Arabs failed to defend two causes, the cause of the struggling Palestinian people and the prevention of war on Iraq would all perish.
Latif called for looking at the African states despite their hard economic situation because they are still insisting on having their will and decision at every level.

He said the current efforts to prevent the catastrophe are not up to the level of responsibility whether at the official level or the popular one. Therefore, the outbreak of war on Iraq would deal a painful blow to the already weak regional Arab order, which lacks political dynamism. This heralds serious consequences to the peoples of the Arab nation to a man particularly as the potential geo-political changes would extend to the entire region, he said.
He also points to the limited political interactions among the Arab countries. The recent difference on the summit is nothing but an emphasis on the lack of Arab political interactions, he says.

The government had not taken into account the rise in interest rates would cope with the inflation pressure of the deficit, in addition to a deficit. In addition to the deficit in the balance of payments, which was an obvious indication to the necessity of the deregulation of the pound at that time.

GAMAL MUBARAK DEMANDS URGENTLY PREPARING OPINION PAPERS OF EGYPT'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS CURRENT EVENTS
Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher emphasized to the committee the importance of achieving stability in Iraq as soon as possible as well as cooperation with all forces that aim at achieving that stability.

First: Shiite Islamic Trend, which mainly consists of four organisations:
-The Supreme Council of Islamic Revolution in Iraq headed by Ayatollah Mohammad Baqer Al-Hakim. It has the biggest military Islamic Iraqi power, which is Badr Legion whose head is one of the preponderant Iraqi opposition figures.
-Kurdistan Democratic Party led by Masoud Barzani, which runs Duhuk province, most of Arbil and part of Mosul.
Fourth: The Liberal Trend, which was formed after 1991 and whose main organisations include:
Fifth: The Marxist Trend, which mainly represents the Iraqi communist party led by Hameid Majeed Al-Byati, the secretary general.
-Iraqi Tribes Gathering.
The second part is the liberal opposition, which would adopt a peaceful approach to oppose the Americans.
Due to the Sunni Islamic forces low percentage of population (around 20% of the Iraqi population) and their open or desert geographical areas, most of them would avoid armed confrontation with the US forces but would support Shiites in resistance operations.
Diplomatic sources pointed out that contacts are now underway between Arab and American parties on this issue particularly after the Gulf Cooperation Council GCC foreign ministers meeting. However, there is American opposition to the idea of forming the government of Iraqis in this stage. America prefers forming a transitional administration of American figures that would deliver power to Iraqi figures in the near future.

"We were actually ready for entering Mosul ahead of such uncontrollable situation and before the gangs start looting.
After the fall of the regime in Kirkuk and Mosul, we could almost enter easily, but we did not in order not to give an excuse and in order to have organized entrance.
- Do you hint to the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) entrance to the city?
What happened in Kirkuk allowed Turkey to interfere and send observers.
There should be accelerated steps to fill in this vacuum."
On 24th March, Jordan has signed an agreement with the US to reschedule $871 million of the American dues on Jordan.
Today (25th March) a donation campaign, organized by Mohamed Bin Rashed Al-Maktoum Charity Institution, will start at 2 pm in the state-owned Dubai TV to help the Iraqi people.
The Iraqis refrainment from resorting to the Jordanian border side represents one of the most outstanding anomalies of war against Iraq on the Jordanian arena. All indications and incidents have so far demonstrated that the big refugee camps set up on the Jordanian side to accommodate not less than 100 thousand Iraqi refugees have received no one yet. Though the war started five days ago, no single Iraqi refugee came, contrary to all expectations.
The Jordanian government had narrowly agreed to set two refugee camps inside Jordanian land on condition that the international organisations be financially in charge of them. Sources told Al-Quds Al-Arabi that the absence of refugee movement harmed international deals with some restaurants and food companies, which signed contracts of tens of thousands of dollars to provide food for hungry men supposed to be Iraqis.
Vis-à-vis this case, tens of media men who took hundreds of thousands of dollars from TV stations to be in Al-Rewaishid had to go back to Amman and impatiently wait for any story or event. From the Jordanian authorities' point of view, this state contributed to the leakage of untrue information and predictions about what is happening in the eastern area of Jordan.
The most outstanding anomaly circulated by Jordanians now through cellular phones is one that conveys a news item supposed to have been carried by CNN station to the effect that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein agreed to leave Baghdad with his family and top aides provided that they head for the White House.
The survey pointed out as well that the number of the viewers of the American CNN news channel has retreated to its lowest rate since the second Gulf War, during which this channel managed to attract a lot of viewers in the Arab world.
KUWAIT THREATENS LIBYA AND SYRIA
The new idea presented by the students via their website has proved a great success with their Egyptian relatives, who are searching for any means to support their brethren Iraqi people. They asked that that idea be generalized through electronic forums. This thought was adopted by many websites, which opened dialogue for it. The result was amazing.
The innovators of the idea said that it was discovered, through monitoring those who had called, that those calls made the Iraqis happy upon receiving calls. This had a great influence on raising the morale of the Iraqi people. They added that if each caller was keen on calling even for one minute and some 100,000 persons called, then they would boost the steadfastness of 100,000 Iraqi families.
Some other Egyptian youths made a proposal, via the websites that adopted the idea, to provide free international call cards to anyone who desires to call Iraq and has not enough money.
Another young lady called Mariam said that she succeeded in calling Baghdad after she had failed many times. She added, "I cannot describe to you the sincere feelings of the householder of the Iraqi family whom I talked to. He invoked blessing for me even more than I did for him. My tears betrayed me more than once when I was talking to him.
He quickly replied, "I'm an Egyptian and we here call random numbers to tell you that you are our brothers and we would never let you down. We will always pray for you and boycott your enemies.
"All of them expressed their happiness and surprise, emphasizing that their morale is high and asked us to sincerely and continuously pray for them. They told us they knew that our feelings were genuine and they were never angry about our stance," Akdar added.
Calling America as well On the other hand, Jihad through the internet forged ahead where some Muslim youths had innovated more thoughts for electronic Jihad, in reply to the call of many ladies through e-mail groups. The last of those calls was a message from a group of young people calling for escalating electronic Jihad. They said, "Dear members of Arab and Islamic e-mail groups it is necessary to coordinate efforts, unify powers and work together to uphold our poor brothers in Iraq and defeat the crusade criminal Anglo-American force." The new idea presents the following proposals:
This must be put in an easy, clear and brief English. Those who do not know English well, should read a text of a set of texts. We must ask them to watch a specific website or satellite channel in a bid to break the blackout of American disinformation offices."
This idea is not applicable for Iraq or its people because it was not defeated in World War II like Japan and because circumstances were totally different in both cases.
In a symposium at the Faculty of Economics and Political Science, Al-Fiqui rejected any criticism to be directed to the Iraqi regime now. He said that this would be "immoral" and would be considered in support of the aggression.
He set conditions for Israel to join that fresh regional system including reaching a just and comprehensive settlement for the Arab-Israeli conflict and subjecting all its nuclear establishments to international supervision and control.
He added that the present American Administration aimed at "crushing Muslims and seizing their fortunes and lands."
He added that Muslim Brotherhood expressed concern over the fate which has befallen everybody but regrettably no response was give by the governments to such sincere counseling. Instead they declared war on Muslim Brotherhood.
According to the reports received by the ruling party general secretariat, headed by Minister of Information, Safwat Al Sherif, the fact that the old cadres succeeded in retaining their positions points out their effectiveness with the masses.
Lots of the Israelis attacked the Egyptian pop singer, Shaaban Abdel-Rahim due to his new song "hitting Iraq". In his song he calls on the UN and the international community to necessarily look to Israel that possesses weapons of mass destruction, emphasizing that Iraq is void of such weapons.
In his article, the Israeli writer stressed the "naivety" of the Egyptian singer who, according to him, finds no difference between Sharon and Barak in his song "I hate Israel" of which he sold 15 million copies until now. however, he then described him as intelligent in dealing with some phrases that "tackles the fancy of the tense Arab street" when he described Bush as the leader of the Axis of Evil and Sharon as sitting in a Jacuzzi with Arabs blood dripping around him like rain.

RETREAT OF LOCAL SAVING AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT
Turkey seeks to boost economic relations and trade exchange with Egypt and raise the ceiling of dealings up to one billion dollars annually, i.e. more than twice as much as its current volume, said Turkish State Minister for Foreign Trade. It is unreasonable for Turkey to have meager economic and trade relations with a major country like Egypt that has much potential whether in terms of raw materials, investment opportunities or its consumption market, he said. He added that his recent visit to Egypt two weeks before, during which he was accompanied by a number of Turkish government officials, was a success. The Turkish government officials felt comfortable on such a visit and underlined the necessity of putting its results into effect, he added.
There are also the Egyptian marble, which competes with Italian; marble ceramics, whose industry has progressed in Egypt, in addition to natural gas of which the Egyptian fields produce good kinds, not to mention its huge reserves in Egypt, which is considered very near to Turkey, which can import it in the future, the minister said.
The new system will spare 40 million dollars, the company's head Eng. Atef Abdel-Hamid said.

EGYPT, CHINA TO CONSIDER SETTING UP INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR MARBLE
It is noteworthy that China is the biggest importer of Egyptian marble blocks as the Egyptian marble exports to China in 2001 were estimated at about 50 million dollars.
One out of five consumers who were included in the study has at least one Egyptian cotton-made product. About 93% showed their admiration for the Egyptian cotton-made products, while 60% expressed willingness to buy Egyptian cotton-made products in the future. However, 50% indicated that they would only buy products made of Egyptian cotton out of their belief that it is absolutely the best kind of cotton. The consumers determined the characteristics that distinguish the Egyptian cotton whether in terms of quality, strength or smoothness, which are the most prominent factors relied on while taking a purchasing decision, the study pointed out.
Egypt was ranked ninth in terms of the most important countries that export husked or bleached rice with exports valued at 133.7 million dollars in 2001 and a market quota of 3.24% of the total exports worldwide for the same year.

EXCHANGE FIRMS SUE CBE
The defence emphasized that it is up to the prime minister, rather than the CBE governor, to make such closure decisions.
In a related development, three American pharmaceutical companies in Egypt hinted that they would suspend their fresh investments until a suitable solution is found to the problem of medicine pricing and the pegged prices that have existed for some time in spite of the increase in dollar rate of exchange. The three companies as well as other companies called for necessarily increasing the medicine prices so as to make up for the rise of costs and prices of imported input. On the other hand, the Egyptian government is still insistent on the current pricing system in order to protect the bulk of Egyptian people against the high increase in medicine prices. Director of the Economic Department in the US Chamber of Commerce in Cairo Khalid Sweilam said some 55 US companies in Egypt informed Prime Minister Atef Ebeid of the main problems they faced owing to the economic recession slowness and the instability of exchange rates despite the significant measure taken to deregulate such a market.
There is a big shortage in the revenues to the value of 21.9 billion pounds due to retreats in the proceeds of public tax, customs, sales tax, services and privatization, he said.
The economic authorities' budget has been illegally amended, something that led to a rise in their budget from 167 billion pounds to 176 billion pounds due to some authorities covering such an increase through decreasing the surplus of the government's quota and the remaining items of the current operations' surplus, he said.
EMIRIAN DONATION CAMPAIGN TO HELP IRAQI PEOPLE
FOREIGN REPORTERS BORED WITH NON-EMIGRATION OF IRAQI REFUGEES TO JORDAN
The circumstances point to the fact that since the war started, only one Iraqi six-member family has arrived to the Jordanian borders but refused to live in the refugee camps and preferred to return the day following. Up to Sunday, 474 comers mainly including Sudanese people had arrived and stayed for some days and hours in the refugee camps before their departure to their countries.
Due to the media and press boredom, some issues have been much explored and what is broadcast by TVs from the area is only words of praise by Sudanese comers about the services offered to them on the Jordanian side. The majority of media men there feel disappointed as they expected mass emigration by Iraqis that would help them prepare live testimonies to part of what is going on inside Iraqi land.
This is not the Jordanian anomaly on the sidelines of war as in the angry Jordanian milieus there is an outstanding tendency to circulate meaningful political jokes about war through tens of cellular phones to the extent that cellular phone operators complained about the heavy pressure on their lines.
In a survey compiled by a number of students at the Faculty of Mass Communications, Cairo University, Abu Dhabi TV channel topped the list of channels watched by Egyptians, Al-Jazeera channel ranked second while the Egyptian Radio and TV Union, known as Maspero, was out of competition. The latter was described by hundreds of viewers as backward and far from events. The survey in which about 900 viewers participated revealed that due to its complete coverage of the Iraqi crisis before the outbreak of the war, Abu Dhabi TV channel has succeeded in increasing its popularity. It is to be mentioned that Abu Dhabi TV channel and Al-Jazeera channel exclusively covered the demonstrations witnessed by Cairo, foremost of which was that on Friday last (21st March). However, Al-Jazeera channel did not transmit the tragic developments of the demonstration before the headquarters of the ruling National Democratic Party.
In a related development, a lot of Cairo cafés posted placards on which they wrote the word "full up" due to the high turnout on the part of citizens to know about war news. Other cafés raised the price of watching Abu Dhabi TV channel and Al-Jazeera channel to three pounds, which is the same price paid by those who would like to watch the ciphered football matches which the Egyptian TV can not broadcast.
Within the framework of increasing Egyptian efforts to support the Iraqi people, whether through invocation in prayers or internet, Alexandria University students have devised a new method to support the Iraqi people. This step is part of a project entitled "Wipe the Tears of Baghdad" which comes within a series of "wrath panorama projects" to support the Iraqi people. The idea in a nutshell is to call any random Iraqi phone number and talk to its owner to encourage him to face his distress and tell him that all Muslims are bolstering him and all the Iraqi people.
They also noted how happy the Iraqis are due to this good step that shows inter-Arab and Muslims cooperation at the time of distress.
Some others volunteered to transfer the idea outside Egypt through inquiring about the way how to make international calls to Iraq from different Arab and foreign cities.
She explains her experience saying "God is Greater... my whole body was trembling" due to her attempt to wipe the tears of an Iraqi citizen.
Naser wondered, "Who is speaking and how did you know the number?".
The Egyptian young lady Akdar says that her four-member family and she called four Iraqi families.
The idea of calling the Iraqi people came to be the most modern method of Jihad via phone.
2- "Calling Iraq and its poor people in order to encourage them. This, however, must be done in a reverse way, in other words calling random phone numbers in the USA and calmly telling them that their sons are dying in the Iraqi desert in a free holocaust in order for the masters of the White House to enjoy Oil and for the sake of Israel.
Egyptian speaker Dr. Fatehi Sorour referred to Parliament's Education Committee an urgent statement tabled by Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) deputy Ali Laban regarding the Education Minister's attack on Katatib (Quran memorization schools) before Shoura Council holding them responsible for increasing illiteracy in Egypt.

Al-Fiqi castigated the decrepitude of the present Arab regional system terming the Arab League as "paralyzed" and a sort of "useless folklore" that has failed to be effective."

In an article entitled "in the face of mass wrath" published in Israeli Yediot Aharonot an Israeli journalist said that the song which made great sales, more than 4 million copies, in Beirut, Damascus and Amman in addition to its sales in Cairo. That song, he said, would never have been spread but for the report broadcast by a widely spread Arab satellite channel. He, further, pointed out that official TV channels in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and some Gulf countries ignored the song in accordance with what he described as "high level orders".
Boastfully, the Iraqis talk about a brigade of Arab volunteers including Sudanese and Jordanian nationals led by an Egyptian commando. The brigade inflicted heavy causalities in lives and machinery on American and British forces during clashes in the southern front under the command of Ali Hassan Al-Maguid.

A Russian newspaper points out that there are still Russian diplomats in Baghdad despite war dangers with the target of completing an important accomplishment carried out by some agents of the Russian intelligence with their Iraqi counterparts in Baghdad. This task is meant to obtain the secret documents of Saddam Hussein to protect and safeguard them so that his enemies could not get access to them in case the ruling regime in Iraq is endangered. The Russian intelligence men are keen on maintaining their relations with the Iraqi public and military intelligence alike.
* The Russian intelligence body getting access to the activities of the Iraqi agents and their activities in other countries.
Some make it likely that the Iraqi side will choose Russia if the situation worsens in order to safeguard such documents no matter the price would be especially as the Russian intelligence maintains close relations with Baghdad and because the Russian leadership defends Iraq and is opposed to the military campaign on it out of a Russian strategic perspective.
The next goal, which is considered the most serious to the Americans, may be Iran, as the U.S. seeks to solve the very strategic tasks given the fact that the oil reserve decreases worldwide, he pointed out.
China now is exerting growing pressure on Kirghizia where there is an American military base. Why, then, do the Americans need military bases in Kirghizia, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan? It seems that such a step means nothing after its control of Afghanistan.
Saudi firms are expected to win some reconstruction contracts and practically participate in reconstruction, an official with Jeddah Trade and Industry Chamber said.
There is a growing sense of unease haunting countries about US's trial to corner and control the Iraqi reconstruction market, he concluded.
WHOEVER SETS HIMSELF OFF AGAINST ENEMY-RANKS IS A MARTYR TANTAWI
There is a big difference between Jihad and terrorism, he said, as Jihad was legitimized in Islam to defend soul, homeland, abode, liberty, humanity and legal values. It was also legitimized to help the oppressed to get their rights.
All wise men should stand by the aggrieved party until it takes its rights.
EMIRIAN DONATION CAMPAIGN TO HELP IRAQI PEOPLE
FOREIGN REPORTERS BORED WITH NON-EMIGRATION OF IRAQI REFUGEES TO JORDAN
The circumstances point to the fact that since the war started, only one Iraqi six-member family has arrived to the Jordanian borders but refused to live in the refugee camps and preferred to return the day following. Up to Sunday, 474 comers mainly including Sudanese people had arrived and stayed for some days and hours in the refugee camps before their departure to their countries.
Due to the media and press boredom, some issues have been much explored and what is broadcast by TVs from the area is only words of praise by Sudanese comers about the services offered to them on the Jordanian side. The majority of media men there feel disappointed as they expected mass emigration by Iraqis that would help them prepare live testimonies to part of what is going on inside Iraqi land.
This is not the Jordanian anomaly on the sidelines of war as in the angry Jordanian milieus there is an outstanding tendency to circulate meaningful political jokes about war through tens of cellular phones to the extent that cellular phone operators complained about the heavy pressure on their lines.
In a survey compiled by a number of students at the Faculty of Mass Communications, Cairo University, Abu Dhabi TV channel topped the list of channels watched by Egyptians, Al-Jazeera channel ranked second while the Egyptian Radio and TV Union, known as Maspero, was out of competition. The latter was described by hundreds of viewers as backward and far from events. The survey in which about 900 viewers participated revealed that due to its complete coverage of the Iraqi crisis before the outbreak of the war, Abu Dhabi TV channel has succeeded in increasing its popularity. It is to be mentioned that Abu Dhabi TV channel and Al-Jazeera channel exclusively covered the demonstrations witnessed by Cairo, foremost of which was that on Friday last (21st March). However, Al-Jazeera channel did not transmit the tragic developments of the demonstration before the headquarters of the ruling National Democratic Party.
In a related development, a lot of Cairo cafés posted placards on which they wrote the word "full up" due to the high turnout on the part of citizens to know about war news. Other cafés raised the price of watching Abu Dhabi TV channel and Al-Jazeera channel to three pounds, which is the same price paid by those who would like to watch the ciphered football matches which the Egyptian TV can not broadcast.
The idea is summarized that everyone would head to the nearest phone and calls a random phone number in Iraq and talk to the one who answers the call for one minute in order to encourage him. An Egyptian would call 00964 then Baghdad code (1) then any random number provided that it would start with 443, 818 or 527. This way he would ensure that he is randomly calling an Iraqi household.
Further, they called for not feeling disappointed if some attempts to call Iraq did not succeed owing to different circumstances and called on them to re-call before telephone lines are disconnected due to war.
Islamonline.net adopted the idea and presented it through dialogue channels in the website under the title "Alexandria University wipes Baghdad's tears". It started to receive the experiments of those who made phone calls with Iraqis to encourage others. The result was also amazing.
How come that he is more confident than me while he is going through such circumstances?
Just, dear brother, hold on and fight under the banner of "No God but Allah".
It is known that the Egyptian communication companies had devised many new methods for using the mobile phone in order to listen to certain songs, chat or listen to some Fatwas.
1- "Starting an intensified electronic Jihad through dealing media blows to the criminal American Administration by sending pictures of the criminal American build-up to the whole world and all American and British e-mail groups and dialogue groups. They also called for collecting the e-mails of as many American people as possible, including individuals, research centers, elites, magazines and websites. It is preferable to concentrate on the e-mail addresses of individuals, which are easy to be obtained.
3- Concentrating on electronic Jihad via a set of websites and develop these proposals by our computer professionals.
Consequently, Egypt categorically rejected that idea, he said.
"I don't defend that "blood-stained" regime due to all its bad record and the catastrophes it has caused for the region and its peoples," he said. "However, I'm against the brutality and genocide that our brotherly Iraqi people are being exposed to."
Talking about the Egyptian regional role in formulating the prospects of the region, Al-Fiqi called upon Egypt to formulate a new role that is based on educational, democratic and political reform model after Egypt lost its pioneering role in different fields especially education.
In a message he addressed to Muslim Brotherhood, Al-Hudhaibi hailed a fatwa (religious opinion) passed by Al-Azhar two weeks ago regarding Jihad (holy struggle) as an obligation upon Muslims in support of the Iraqi people and to repel aggression.
If those rulers had listened to Muslim Brotherhood's opinion and prepared their peoples for Jihad and brought them up on faith and sacrifice, the Jews would never have thought of sweeping Palestine nor would America have acted so preposterously nor would it have threatened the world, especially the Arab and Islamic worlds or tampered with its destiny and future, killing and capturing, detaining and torturing at will. It is America, after all, that now backs Zionism in Palestine and declares war on Iraq's Muslim unarmed people.
The elections were held in 6700 party units nationwide and ended yesterday after a span of 6 days to renew 25% of the members of those committees in accordance with the party's new constitution.
Lots of those writers think that the "troublemaker laundry worker' is striking the sensitive note for hundreds of millions of Arabs, i.e hating Israel.
DESTROYING IRAQ IS PRELUDE TO BESIEGING CHINA
The Russian newspaper sees that such documents are of a very importance to Russia in three aspects:
Some make it likely that such matters have been discussed between President Saddam Hussein and former Russian prime minister Yuvegeni Primakov when President Putin commissioned him a task last February ahead of the start of the American war on Iraq.
If the American and British intelligence bodies rely on their spies, the Russian one depends on the Iraqi-Russian cooperation as well as the previous and accumulated experience since the Soviet Union and its current inheritor: "the department of the Russian and international intelligence."
Here, we can reach a new issue emerged apparently. This issue envisages confrontations between the U.S. and China, which is the only power that can vie with the U.S. as the Chinese economy develops dynamically while the country suffers great oil energy shortage.
Of course, there is almost a need to such bases not to confront terrorism but to dominate the northwestern part of China. Surrounding China gradually depends on the American military bases in an indirect way.
Saudi businessman Abdullah bin Mahfouz told Al-Hayat that he was on standby to partake in Iraq reconstruction projects and compete for post-war commercial contracts and transactions.
The primary contracts would be exclusive to US companies, which would lead the reconstruction process, Saudi businessman Hussein Shobokshi said, pointing out that Saudi and other companies of different nationalities would come second to American ones.
Grand Sheikh of Al Azhar Muhammed Sayed Tantawi called for putting an end to the current war against the Iraqi people as soon as possible because they are a war-torn people.
To the contrary, he indicated, terrorism aimed at killing innocents, occupying lands and transgressing against freedoms and honour. There is a general legal rule terming as "terrorist" whoever transgresses, without a legitimate right, against others whether s/he be Muslim or Christian and Islam has clean hands of them.
Commenting on boycotting foreign goods, he said that fatwas must not be issued in that regard without reference to competent bodies to underline to what extent that boycotting is useful and whether it could harm individuals or the society.
Today (25th March) a donation campaign, organized by Mohamed Bin Rashed Al-Maktoum Charity Institution, will start at 2 pm in the state-owned Dubai TV to help the Iraqi people.
The Iraqis refrainment from resorting to the Jordanian border side represents one of the most outstanding anomalies of war against Iraq on the Jordanian arena. All indications and incidents have so far demonstrated that the big refugee camps set up on the Jordanian side to accommodate not less than 100 thousand Iraqi refugees have received no one yet. Though the war started five days ago, no single Iraqi refugee came, contrary to all expectations.
The Jordanian government had narrowly agreed to set two refugee camps inside Jordanian land on condition that the international organisations be financially in charge of them. Sources told Al-Quds Al-Arabi that the absence of refugee movement harmed international deals with some restaurants and food companies, which signed contracts of tens of thousands of dollars to provide food for hungry men supposed to be Iraqis.
Vis-à-vis this case, tens of media men who took hundreds of thousands of dollars from TV stations to be in Al-Rewaishid had to go back to Amman and impatiently wait for any story or event. From the Jordanian authorities' point of view, this state contributed to the leakage of untrue information and predictions about what is happening in the eastern area of Jordan.
The most outstanding anomaly circulated by Jordanians now through cellular phones is one that conveys a news item supposed to have been carried by CNN station to the effect that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein agreed to leave Baghdad with his family and top aides provided that they head for the White House.
The survey pointed out as well that the number of the viewers of the American CNN news channel has retreated to its lowest rate since the second Gulf War, during which this channel managed to attract a lot of viewers in the Arab world.
JIHAD VIA PHONE IN SOLIDARITY WITH IRAQI PEOPLE
Many Egyptians had called Iraqi people through haphazard numbers and talked to them and noticed that their morale is very high and that Iraqis insist on victory.
Calls made by some Egyptians uncovered a state of extraordinary solidarity. Some families started to call the Iraqis to boost their morale and pray for them.
Noura, for example, said that she had called the random number 0096414432642 in Iraq and a father of an Iraqi family replied to her.
Another one who calls himself "A Muslim who loves Islam very much" says that he succeeded in calling Iraq and an Iraqi youth called Naser answered him.
You must fight in faith not as to sacrifice for anyone."
Some Muslim youths had used that idea during Aqsa uprising in Palestine and started to direct young people to call certain numbers. The revenues of those calls are allocated to back the Iraqi people or to enhance other medical and social projects.
Ordinary mail addresses should be obtained as well in order to send them the pictures of rotten corpses of their sons so as not to think again of desecrating the Islamic world countries."
EGYPTIAN FM TURNS DOWN IDEA OF APPOINTING AMERICAN GENERAL TO RULE IRAQ
On the other hand, head of Foreign Affairs Committee in the parliament Mostafa Al-Fiqi said two days ago that the Anglo-American war on Iraq would continue for several weeks and the Iraqi people would not accept an American governor or occupation of its lands though it has earlier approved of the dictatorship of Saddam.
Al-Fiqi castigated the decrepitude of the present Arab regional system terming the Arab League as "paralyzed" and a sort of "useless folklore" that has failed to be effective."
MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD GUIDE: AMERICA WANTS TO CRUSH MUSLIMS & SEIZE THEIR LAND
He emphasized that "the blatant aggression on the nation makes Jihad an obligation upon each and every Muslim man or woman.
RULING PARTY GRASSROOTS ELECTIONS IN EGYPT RESULT IN RETAINING OLD LEADERSHIPS
The reports said that such elections had been held with complete transparency and democracy on the part of the party, thus revealing the success of such an experiment regarded as the first of its kind in the party.
In an article entitled "in the face of mass wrath" published in Israeli Yediot Aharonot an Israeli journalist said that the song which made great sales, more than 4 million copies, in Beirut, Damascus and Amman in addition to its sales in Cairo. That song, he said, would never have been spread but for the report broadcast by a widely spread Arab satellite channel. He, further, pointed out that official TV channels in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and some Gulf countries ignored the song in accordance with what he described as "high level orders".
Al-Ahram Al-Arabi's correspondent in Moscow Abdel-Malik Khalil writes an article to the following effect only in part: The whole world is living a historical awful moment caused by the aggressive war launched by the U.S. and Britain on the Iraqi people at a time when the U.S. hurries up to disclose its aggressive plots which will also include Syria and Iran. Resorting to accusing Russia of offering military aid to Iraq makes it apparent that the world verges on a third world war, or, according to a Russian parliamentarian: "We live now in almost the harbingers of a third world war."
Protecting the Russian interests in post-war Iraq, especially as President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov have articulately explained more than once that Russia has important interests in Iraq now and in the future.
However, Primakov explicitly told Saddam about this matter, even though it was not an easy one despite the friendly relations between Primakov and Saddam since the Soviet era when Primakov was former Soviet Union president Mikhail Gorbachev's envoy to Saddam Hussein to convince him of the military withdrawal from Kuwait and saving the Iraqi people, but the U.S.-led war machine imposed the withdrawal and sanctions for over ten years on Iraq.
Former chief of the national economic security body in the first main administration of the Russian intelligence spoke about the American aggression on Iraq. He said that what is going on now is not meant to promote democracy nor to make life go smoothly regardless of the U.S. efforts to promote such allegations. They speak about changing the regime in Baghdad. After such change, Iraq will be, then, ruled by a puppet government. Undoubtedly, it would be incapable of controlling the country without Western protection just as the case in Afghanistan.
Although the U.S. assault on Afghanistan was meant to eliminate Taliban, the real goal was its neighboring country - China. The Western military forces in Afghanistan seemed to have determined the borders on which China could extend its influence.
SAUDI BUSINESSMEN: READY TO COMPETE FOR RECONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS IN IRAQ
He added that British and US companies should not be let alone in that field, pointing out that Saudi businessmen should take well-studied and planned moves to win some of these contracts to "reconstruct a neighbour Arab country whose people would welcome us more than anybody else."
However, he said, US companies might depend on some Saudi businesses to provide their needs because of joint relations.
Al Azhar and Islamic Research Academy scholars' stance on that war goes in parallel with the Christian position declared by both Pope John Paul II and Pope Shenouda III, Tantawi said. Both stances are opposed to war and are calling for peace, tolerance and reconciliation, he added.
Jihad includes self-sacrifice, money-sacrifice and anything anybody can do to help what is right, Tantawi said in the conference.
When asked about the Palestinian cause, Tantawi said that the Palestinians should continue defending their rights by all available means and the UN should help them through subjecting Israel to its resolutions and forcing it to comply with them, otherwise, he went on, it could lose its powers as an international organization that has binding resolutions.
Deputy chairman of the institution, counsellor Ibrahim Bomelha told journalists yesterday that the aim behind the charity campaign was to help the Iraqi people in their distress and provide them, especially children, women and the old, with aid and basic needs.
On the contrary, the Jordanian-Iraqi crossing point witnesses the crossing of Iraqis heading back to their country, which baffled Jordanian observers. While international organisations had not reported even a single case of Iraqi refugee until yesterday afternoon, the official Jordanian records said around 500 Iraqi citizens at least crossed the Jordanian-Iraqi borders heading towards Baghdad in a bewildering behaviour that needs much explanation. Among those returnees are five Iraqi diplomats who quickly and "happily" left, to quote in the words of the Iraqi embassy spokesman in Amman Gawad Al-Hamad while speaking about a Jordanian decision that five Iraqi diplomats should leave Jordan.
It has been noticeable so far that big quantities of fresh meals have found no people to eat them near the Jordanian-Iraqi borders. Some of those who are there for whom the meals were not originally prepared get the meals free of charge now so that suppliers may not bear the cost of returning them to Amman.
It seems that foreign reporters know they have nothing to do in eastern Jordan for the Iraqis move in the opposite direction heading to Iraq and the people there are only truck drivers and customs and relief workers and there is no real way to know what happens outside the borderline.
Some local press expressions also entered the circle of fun. Arabs Today local newspaper carried on its front-page yesterday a word of advice to US President George W. Bush saying that he should receive lessons in geography due to his statements in which he said war would last longer because Iraq is a vast and "very rugged" country. The newspaper mentioned that Iraq is a plain and open country rather than mountainous and rugged, which requires that lessons in geography should be given to the ignorant president.
For his part, Dr Ahmed Mahmoud, the researcher at Cairo University and supervisor of the survey, said that excluding Maspero from the competition was not a surprise as there were former indications that confirmed that. At the last months, Maspero's following up of events was very poor.
Within the framework of increasing Egyptian efforts to support the Iraqi people, whether through invocation in prayers or internet, Alexandria University students have devised a new method to support the Iraqi people. This step is part of a project entitled "Wipe the Tears of Baghdad" which comes within a series of "wrath panorama projects" to support the Iraqi people. The idea in a nutshell is to call any random Iraqi phone number and talk to its owner to encourage him to face his distress and tell him that all Muslims are bolstering him and all the Iraqi people.
They also noted how happy the Iraqis are due to this good step that shows inter-Arab and Muslims cooperation at the time of distress.
Some others volunteered to transfer the idea outside Egypt through inquiring about the way how to make international calls to Iraq from different Arab and foreign cities.
She explains her experience saying "God is Greater... my whole body was trembling" due to her attempt to wipe the tears of an Iraqi citizen.
Naser wondered, "Who is speaking and how did you know the number?".
The Egyptian young lady Akdar says that her four-member family and she called four Iraqi families.
The idea of calling the Iraqi people came to be the most modern method of Jihad via phone.
2- "Calling Iraq and its poor people in order to encourage them. This, however, must be done in a reverse way, in other words calling random phone numbers in the USA and calmly telling them that their sons are dying in the Iraqi desert in a free holocaust in order for the masters of the White House to enjoy Oil and for the sake of Israel.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher expressed his country's rejection of America appointing an American general to govern post-Saddam Iraq and repeating the post-World War II Japan example.
Al-Fiqi warned Saddam Hussein against using weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in his war against coalition forces because such an act would be naive that would make him lose wide international sympathy and make the war against him legitimate.
I call for a new regional system that brings Israel to account after we let it go monstrous for the last 50 years."
Muslim Brotherhood Guide in Egypt, Counsellor, Mamoun Al-Hudhaibi warned that America was seeking to "control the fortunes of the world and infiltrate into the centers of power and leadership in the world through crime, terrorism, deception, bribery and debauchery.
He said, "Everybody must understand that our defence and support of the Muslim people of Iraq should not mean the Iraqi regime but rather the Islamic people, land, nation and sanctities and mosques where Allah's name is often mentioned. He went on to say that "The unarmed people of Iraq are standing against America and its allies' tyranny and, through faith, stubbornness and steadfastness can, God Willing, repel the aggressors. This means that any faithful people who believe in their right and sacrifice for their freedom can face oppression and tyranny.
The elections of the ruling party units and grassroots in villages and districts resulted in most old leaderships retaining their positions.
ISRAEL ATTACKS SHAABAN ABDEL-REHIM
The song refers to the fact that disarming weapons of mass destruction in "something good" but not in Iraq as inspection teams did not prove that it has such weapons, rather in Israel which possesses such weapons and whose soldiers kill the old and the young in Palestine without any consideration to the international community. If, moreover, talks about the tragedy which the Arabs started to live since the September 11th incidents in New York and Washington and about the Arab leaders failure to unanimously agree on unified resolutions owing to the surrounding changes.
The harbingers of this world war are represented in the ongoing war behind the scenes undergone by the three intelligence bodies of America, Britain and Russia in order to get the archive of documents of the Iraqi State, the Iraqi intelligence documents in and outside the country, and the Baath Party's documents.
Determining to what extent Saddam's regime has financed Russian political movements and parties.
Anyway, it was announced that Primakov's visit to Iraq in February 2003 was meant to convince Saddam to cooperate with the UN. So, the visit was meagerly covered by the media amid different interpretations and speculations.
Following Iraq, the U.S. will try to change the ruling regime in Saudi Arabia. However, the events will likely develop and take another course of action peacefully.
Consequently, the U.S. exerted its efforts to install "the Western rule" in Afghanistan as if the matter was to draw geopolitical interests.
Many Saudi businessmen said they were ready to compete with American and British companies for juicy contracts of reconstructing Iraq once was over. Other Saudi economists, however, were of the view of the necessity of forming a Saudi bloc and not moving individually to win these contracts.
Moreover, Head of Saudi Export Development Center Dr. Abdul Rahman Zamil pointed out that the geographical location of the kingdom, adjacent to Iraq, nominated it to be a preferable supplier of construction materials, foodstuffs and Iraqi market needs. Thus, the kingdom has a good chance to participate and win some reconstruction contracts.
When Iraqi money comes back home from abroad in post-war stage, he expected, Saudi businesses could stand much better chances of signing contracts with Iraqi partners in the medium range because the Saudi market is very close to the Iraqi one.
Tantawi said in a press conference held yesterday (April 5th) and attended by a constellation of foreign and Arab correspondents and reporters that Al Azhar never opposed those willing to fly to Iraq to help the Iraqi people, noting that doors of Jihad were open.
Asked about "martyrdom" operations targeting American targets in Iraq, the Grand Imam said, "Whoever blows himself up against the aggressor is a martyr."
Tantawi pointed out that the Palestinian people should be confident of God's victory, pointing out that responsibility for the present goings-on is borne by the Islamic world including rulers and Muslim scholars, everybody within his role and competence.
The plan includes making the Palestinian security bodies undertake their works and extending international aid to them, which may include international field presence according to "an agreement between the two sides".
BASHIR GIVES FREE REIN TO ARMY TO PUT DOWN REBELLION IN DARFUR
WASHINGTON HANDS CAIRO LIST OF 500 EGYPTIANS FOUGHT IN IRAQ
The volunteers' issue is still fresh. The authorities seek to collect much more information about it, the diplomat said. "It's too early to speak about this issue and the list of volunteers while the war is not over yet," the diplomat said. He considered the linking between the two issues as mere confusion.
Some experts confirmed the possibilities of extending that pipeline in the near future and as soon as a relative stability is achieved in Iraq. They based their argument upon the ability of the Anglo-American administration to implement such a step especially as American military governor, who is a friend of Israeli Premier Sharon's and a Zionist symbol in the American lobby, would be heading Iraq.
He adds that if such a project was revived it would represent a golden opportunity for Egypt to be released, even though only in part, from the burdens of a reconciliation with Israel which might have forced it to pump Egyptian oil to it especially in light of the hazards involved in the American-Israeli scheme in Iraq and the region, which would hit the Arab interests including Egyptian interests in the heart.
Under this heading, chief editor Galal Deweidar wrote an article which ran to the following effect only in part:
We have to admit that such a disaster would never have taken place if it were not for the ignorance and madness of the Iraqi leadership that indulged in collaboration with the new American colonialism which aimed at liquidating and weakening the Arab nation in favour of international Zionism and Israel.
Now, everything is clear as the Arab countries are being exposed one after another to dangers and destruction due to the conspiracies of external forces that regrettably use internal forces- for instance the role played by the Iraqi regime which drove Gulf countries and all the Arab countries to the snare of American political and economic control and hegemony.
"The Jewish soldiers in the U.S. and British forces in Iraq should recite such prayers on the western bank of the Euphrates river," said Nehemiah Hehori, one of the rabbis who handed down this religious opinion. Every spot of this land is part of greater Israel, so prayers should be recited there to redeem and liberate this land, he said.
The remarks were made by the presidential advisor at a news briefing following an Egyptian-Jordanian summit on Monday. There is no comparison between Syria and Iraq under Saddam Hussein's regime.
CHARGE CAMPAIGN AGAINST SYRIA RUNS FIERCER
At a news briefing in Kuwait on Monday, he called on Damascus to mend its ways and provide full cooperation for picking up Iraqi leaders.
The list of alleged accusations included allowing Arab volunteers to enter Iraq via Syrian territories, sending anti-tank missiles to Iraq and providing safe shelter to Iraqi officials and scientists.
PARLIAMENTARY COMM. TO DISCUSS RELIGIOUS DISCOURSE SHORTCOMINGS
The committee, furthermore, proposed setting up a multilingual hi-tech Islamic satellite channel to be run by religious scholars who master foreign languages and capable of getting the right notions of religion across to people.
Shehab said that it usually took 3 years instead of 6 years on average to take out a patent.
Calling for scrapping the unanimity condition, he said AL resolutions should be adopted narrowly or by two thirds of AL members.
On the Iraqi situation, the president said nobody, whether governments or peoples, can approve of Iraq being ruled by non-Iraqis.
For the first time, debaters started to find the idea of economic liberalism appealing within the agreed upon principles of political liberalism, which constitutes a crucial upgrade in the ideas of the leftists who have refused for long to deal with the file of economic liberalism due to their bias towards a certain bracket of the society whose interests run counter to free market mechanisms. This could be a plausible explanation why the advocates of the new trend linked free market mechanisms to securing social rights for citizens.
However, the chairman of the conference Dr. Magdi Abdel Hamid talked about a broader vision of reform. Talking to Al-Hayat about that, he said that the latest developments require of us to formulate a new social contract. For his part, Mr. Farid Zahran, a prominent human rights activist, said, "The new proposal is based on the initiatives and proposals suggested a long time ago by several authorities to formulate a potential vision through dialogue with all popular authorities.
The constitution determines the country's government bases, political and religious identity as well as the basic components of its society, rights and duties and the organization of estates and their inter-relationships.
In a step, which will hopefully be put into effect without delay, the constitution ensures freedom of worship for all nationals and residents in accordance with the law and the requirements of protecting public order and morals.
Sorour pointed out that security has an integrated concept and that what is happening in Europe affects Egypt and vice versa, confirming that Egypt doesn't transgress against any neighbouring country. Saddam Hussein was playing a role in the region in favour of America which came to the point that it should play the role itself and end Saddam's role. Sorour considered that America in this stage sold Saddam down the river because it is in no need of his role as its forces came to the region.
Yesterday(13th April), the General Authority for Supply Commodities had concluded a loan agreement at a value of $25 million with Islamic Bank for Development (IBD) and it would also hammer out another loan agreement at the same value in the coming few days, said deputy chairman of the 	Authority Mahmoud Abdel-Hamid to Reuter's Agency.
Egypt topped the list of buyers of American wheat during the last five seasons but it descended to the 6th rank in 2002-2003 after it chose cheap imports from France and Eastern Europe. This step came as a result of the high increase in American prices which achieved its highest level in five years last September due to drought.
EGYPTIAN-TURKISH TRADE EXCHANGE UP TO ONE BILLION DOLLAR
It is a mistake to say that the production of the two countries are similar, the minister said, pointing out that Turkey, for instance, needs many commodities from Egypt including cotton of which Egypt produces many excellent kinds.
EgyptAir Holding Company decided to convert the purchase of 5 320-Airbuses to the financial lease system instead of direct loans.
He added that the period from January to March 2003 witnessed a rise of 12.3% compared to the same period last year as the number of tourists hit 1,184,000.
CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES TO BE GIVEN ACCESS TO FREE ZONES
GHALI: LEAP IN EGYPTIAN STEEL EXPORTS
He added that the fact that steel sheets factories in Suez started operation would increase such exports to one million tons annually as of this year. He went on saying that such factories were essential components in export development strategy to take exports of building and construction materials from $361 million in 2001 to about $1 billion in 2006, with steel exports claiming 25% annually.
According to the Egyptian government, 90000 hectares of agricultural land would benefit by that grant as wheat production is expected to rise in those lands by 15% from 570000 tons to 650000 tons.
He called on Egyptian companies to study the need of the Russian party to import several commodities like medicines, serums, vaccines and cosmetics. Russian businessmen should try to make use of Egypt's membership of the COMESA which have 300 million souls.
"Egypt seeks to make up for the retreat in exports to the Iraqi market following the collapse of the government," said an officer in foreign trade sector, confirming that African markets were the best to accommodate Egyptian commodities on condition that exporters comply with the specifications required by such markets.
Egypt and Russia have resumed bilateral talks on a 5-year deal that provides for giving Egypt one million tons of wheat on a yearly basis, said a spokeswoman for the Russian Ministry of Commerce.
The Egyptian-Dutch Consultant Council is currently holding a meeting in Aswan under the chairmanship of Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Dr. Mahmoud Abu Zaid.
Holland will also probe a project for developing the navigational course of the river Nile in cooperation with the ministries of transport and water resources. The cost of that project will be 600 million dollars, 40% of which will be financed by the Dutch side.
He explained that such a strategy relies on giant national projects in Toshka, South Valley, Sinai and West Nubariya in order to meet the needs of food and strategic stock on the national level.
Soon, he added, the first electronic system would be put in force in order to show on the spot the foreign currency selling and purchasing operations in banks and exchange firms on the CBE screens.
The debate, which started during the committee's discussion of the new banking law, triggered a heated argument.
"This was an unnecessary measure that denied access to this job to competent bankers and financiers who may be more worthy of this position," he pointed out.
The latter were just civil servants who could be fired or retired or replaced and were like any other occupants of senior positions in the civil service, they said, while membership of the People's Assembly required loyalty to only one origin and one fatherland for representation of an Egyptian constituency, so as to avoid suspicions of divided loyalty, particularly as the Assembly was discussing certain topics related to Egypt's relationship with the country whose nationality was borne by the deputy or deputies in question.
CUSTOMS DOLLAR UP TO 575 PIASTERS
The final formula of the trade agreement between Egypt and Russia was approved yesterday. This agreement will last five years as per which 1.5 million tons of Russian wheat per year will be exchanged annually for Egyptian commodities such as vaccines, rice, fruit, onion and garlic. It is worth mentioning that these products represent 50% of the deal value.
It was agreed on a financing mechanism at distinguished and preferential prices, he said.
It was agreed with the manager of the national bank in Shanghai to cooperate with the chamber so as to put it onto all information about the Chinese market as well as the means of cooperation with different marketing companies.

The CAA uncovered continuation of negative phenomena concerning the implementation of the budget's projects, foremost of which are the choosing of inappropriate projects, inadequate initial studies and putting such projects up without removing the existent obstacles, which led to sluggish implementation and aggravating burdens, he said. Al-Malt warned against amending the items of the budget's projects during the implementation process in violation of the law. The implementation parts of some projects, for instance, exceeded what was planned to a great extent, he said.
It is noteworthy that the last few weeks witnessed periods of negotiations and suspension between Bavaria Auto and AKFA owing to disagreement regarding the value of the deal.

On the other hand, an analytical study on estimating the free trade agreement between Egypt and Morocco, which was prepared by the Egyptian Commercial Representation's Arab Countries Department, emphasized that 76% of the commodities exempted from Moroccan customs duties are not exploited. Also Egypt's exports to Morocco concentrate on only 7 commodity groups out of 29 goods included in the Egyptian commodities that are completely exempted from Moroccan customs duties. This highlights the necessity of reconsidering the way of dealing with such goods in a way that could boost Egyptian exports, said Minister Plenipotentiary at the Arab Countries Department Mohamed Abd Al-Gawwad. Exporters should be acquainted with such agreements in order to make full use of such exempted lists, he pointed out .
The successive rises of the iron prices on the markets during this period led to the stoppage of a large number of contractors for fear of losses resulting from prices differentials and the rise of costs.
Nobody has interfered to rescue this industry from the current stalemate or to compel the two companies that produce the billet - one of which is State-owned- to distribute the billet under the quota system to local factories in order to decrease production costs instead of three factories monopolizing the whole Egypt's production of billet, he added.

"The Congolese President tasked me with boosting relations with Egypt in the field of agricultural cooperation," the Congolese minister said, noting that the Congolese president was keen on establishing a model farm in the DRC to transfer the applicable Egyptian agricultural experience to the Congo, as was the case with neighbouring Niger.
Within the framework of Egypt's keenness on activating COMESA agreement and making full use of its preferential advantages, an exhibition for the Egyptian products will be mounted in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi during the period from May 23rd to June 1st. This also comes within the context of choosing Kenya as a center for promoting and marketing Egyptian products in Kenya's neighbouring countries in light of an Egyptian trade strategy greenlit by Minister of Foreign Trade Dr. Youssef Botros Ghali for moving in Africa.
The volume of Kenya's trade with the world countries in 2001 hit about 5 billion dollars, of which 3.1 billion dollars stood for the value of its imports. Egypt's exports to Kenya in 2001 were estimated at 20 million dollars, while its imports from Kenya accounted for 95 million dollars. Egypt's imports from Kenya are mostly represented in the Kenyan tea, which is highly favoured by the Egyptian consumer because it is customs-exempted according to the COMESA agreement. This decreases its cost and it is, consequently, sold at competitive prices on the domestic market.
Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa are considered the biggest African economies. They also take part in major economic blocs in Africa, he added.
A decision was taken to set up common farms jointly by Egypt and Sudan to cultivate 60 thousand feddans, 50 thousand in Sudan and around 10 thousand in Egypt.

Egypt made use of the shift in foreign trade of Gulf countries in general from the Eastern side of the Gulf to the Western side of the Red Sea, the report pointed out, adding that that would increase the chance of Egypt's exports to get access to Saudi markets thanks to the geographical proximity and the high costs of freight and insurance in the region that extends from Strait of Hormuz to the Gulf region which is divided to three parts according to the rate of risk. Some 35 dollars were added to the freight value of a 20-foot-long container. This price is doubled for 40-foot-long containers to hit $70 per container. These prices are applicable in the ports of Bahrain, Qatar, Dubai and Saudi Arabia that look over the Persian Gulf, the report noted.

The lines extend for 750 kilometers and would cost about 95 million dollars. The project aims at connecting Libya with the Arab unified grid as well as providing new job opportunities and foreign currency.
Eng. Shahat added that the three Egyptian companies, namely Elegect, Highdilco and Kahromica, had vast international experience in executing giant projects of electricity lines in different Arab and African countries.
It is expected that the files of the ban imposed on Egyptian red meat, poultry, and potato exports on the one hand and the dumping cases filed against Saudi ethylene and polypropylene exports to Egypt will top the committee agenda on its part related to the commercial and economic cooperation between the two countries.

The volunteers' issue is still fresh. The authorities seek to collect much more information about it, the diplomat said. "It's too early to speak about this issue and the list of volunteers while the war is not over yet," the diplomat said. He considered the linking between the two issues as mere confusion.
Some experts confirmed the possibilities of extending that pipeline in the near future and as soon as a relative stability is achieved in Iraq. They based their argument upon the ability of the Anglo-American administration to implement such a step especially as American military governor, who is a friend of Israeli Premier Sharon's and a Zionist symbol in the American lobby, would be heading Iraq.
He adds that if such a project was revived it would represent a golden opportunity for Egypt to be released, even though only in part, from the burdens of a reconciliation with Israel which might have forced it to pump Egyptian oil to it especially in light of the hazards involved in the American-Israeli scheme in Iraq and the region, which would hit the Arab interests including Egyptian interests in the heart.
Under this heading, chief editor Galal Deweidar wrote an article which ran to the following effect only in part:
We have to admit that such a disaster would never have taken place if it were not for the ignorance and madness of the Iraqi leadership that indulged in collaboration with the new American colonialism which aimed at liquidating and weakening the Arab nation in favour of international Zionism and Israel.
Now, everything is clear as the Arab countries are being exposed one after another to dangers and destruction due to the conspiracies of external forces that regrettably use internal forces- for instance the role played by the Iraqi regime which drove Gulf countries and all the Arab countries to the snare of American political and economic control and hegemony.
"The Jewish soldiers in the U.S. and British forces in Iraq should recite such prayers on the western bank of the Euphrates river," said Nehemiah Hehori, one of the rabbis who handed down this religious opinion. Every spot of this land is part of greater Israel, so prayers should be recited there to redeem and liberate this land, he said.

For the first time, debaters started to find the idea of economic liberalism appealing within the agreed upon principles of political liberalism, which constitutes a crucial upgrade in the ideas of the leftists who have refused for long to deal with the file of economic liberalism due to their bias towards a certain bracket of the society whose interests run counter to free market mechanisms. This could be a plausible explanation why the advocates of the new trend linked free market mechanisms to securing social rights for citizens.
However, the chairman of the conference Dr. Magdi Abdel Hamid talked about a broader vision of reform. Talking to Al-Hayat about that, he said that the latest developments require of us to formulate a new social contract.

The constitution determines the country's government bases, political and religious identity as well as the basic components of its society, rights and duties and the organization of estates and their inter-relationships.
In a step, which will hopefully be put into effect without delay, the constitution ensures freedom of worship for all nationals and residents in accordance with the law and the requirements of protecting public order and morals.
Sorour pointed out that security has an integrated concept and that what is happening in Europe affects Egypt and vice versa, confirming that Egypt doesn't transgress against any neighbouring country. Saddam Hussein was playing a role in the region in favour of America which came to the point that it should play the role itself and end Saddam's role. Sorour considered that America in this stage sold Saddam down the river because it is in no need of his role as its forces came to the region.
Board chairman of Misr Banque Mohamed Barakat said that the bank would fund a number of giant investment projects during the forthcoming period after completion of feasibility studies.

On the other hand, the Chairman of the Parliament's Legislative Committee, Counselor Mohammad Mousa, declared that he had succeeded in the tedious job of getting the Minister of Finance and the Central Bank Governor to agree to the removal of a government-introduced text that required candidates for the governorship of the Central Bank to have Egyptian parents.
Proponents of Mousa's proposal include the Chairman of the Economic Committee, Said Al Alfi; Amr Al Hini; Dr Fayka Al Refa'ee, former deputy governor of the Central Bank; Munir Fakhri Abdel Nour, leader of the Wafd Party opposition in the Assembly; and Abdel Fattah Diab. They said that there was a big difference between allowing dual-nationality citizens to become members of the People's Assembly and allowing them to become governors of the Central Bank of Egypt.
It was also Mousa's Legislative Committee that led the campaign for ousting these dual-nationality members, acting on a report from the State Commissioners.
EGYPT-RUSSIA DISCUSS WHEAT FOR PRODUCTS DEALS

Finally, after tiring talks and with a special interference from Minister of Industry Dr. Ali Al-Sa'idi, Bavaria Auto, the new agent of BMW in Egypt, managed to conclude the transaction for selling car assembly factory in 6th October City (AKFA). Bavaria will also buy the distribution company and maintenance centers affiliated to the group, which ex-BMW agent businessman Hossam Abul Fotouh possessed.

On the other hand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is considered the first Arab partner and the third foreign one after the European Union and the USA. The volume of trade exchange between both countries hit about $800 million in 2001. Saudi Arabia also ranks first among Arab and foreign countries as far as investments in Egypt are concerned, continued the report.

EGYPTIAN-SAUDI CONSULTATION TO SETTLE DIFFERENCE OVER DUMPING
Attempts are underway between Cairo and Riyadh to settle the commercial differences between them, said First Undersecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Trade Sayed Abul-Qumsan. Removing the obstacles that limit the Egyptian-Saudi trade exchange of some commodities need painstaking technical measures that might take some time to be activated, he added.
The dumping duties imposed on some Saudi petrochemicals are still temporary, said Ministry of Foreign Trade-affiliated Anti-Subsidy and Dumping Body chief Abdurahman Fawzi. It is a technical and commercial matter that can be overcome through negotiation and understanding with Saudi complaining companies, he said.
In a study on the prospects of monetary policy in the country three months after the liberalization of exchange rates entitled, "Rationalization of the use of CBE monetary Policies," Al- Shafie pointed out that the operational goal of the monetary policy is to influence nominal interest rates orientations on the Egyptian capital market in the short term.
In order to achieve such a goal, the CBE started a comprehensive modernization process that took into account the technological development and the smooth flow of information.
The change in exchange rate led most of the companies that provide the ministry with supplies to withdraw their quotations and submit new ones that cope with the market prices.
Owing to that situation which is threatening the electricity sector, Yunis convened many meetings last week with a number of officials with the ministry to mull over the measures that might be taken to ensure collecting the dues of the ministry and government-owned companies as well as public and private sectors.
Dr. Yunis was lately exposed to many pressures from the ministry's officials and the head of People's Assembly Industry and Energy Committee as well as some MPs to examine the subsidy of household brackets, from which about 98% of the consumers benefit. They asked him to slightly increase some brackets, which would not be greatly affected, but the circumstances are reverse for that step. Asked by Asharq Al-Awsat about that question, the minister replied, "Increasing the price is currently out of the question."
The coming stage will see a big rise in the costs of water used in new water projects, the minister said.
The remarkable shortage of fertilizers led to a price rise as the exportation of fertilizers exceeded the allowed limits, hence the Prime Minister Dr. Atef Ebeid's decision to stop exportation of fertilizers, said General Association for Agricultural Credit head Abul-Abbas Othman.
EGYPTIAN COTTON PRICES UP DUE TO SARS
"Consequently, the Ministry of Agriculture is intent on encouraging farmers to boost their cotton production through increasing the price rate of buying cotton from farmers."

The new year's budget is one of the biggest budgets in Egypt's history as it hits 158.6 billion pounds, a rise of 15.6 billion pounds over the current budget. The new budget focuses on the social dimension through increasing the funds necessary for low-income categories' care, particularly in light of the advance in the prices of some commodities.
The third concern of the budget is rationalizing the government's expenditure and adopting expansive policies to reinforce the economy and put an end to the state of recession dominating the market.
The budget's indicators point out imposition of no further taxes or charges on citizens. However, it relies on activating the collection of the State's arrears and concluding more agreements with senior businessmen and taxpayers, in addition to developing the customs work. Therefore, the new budget's resources were estimated in the light of the real proceeds that had been already achieved. The new budget will levy 32.9 billion pounds as income taxes and another 22.7 billion pounds as sales taxes. The customs proceeds are expected to hit some 15 billion pounds besides 10 billion pounds as development charges and other sovereign sources.
This decline came at a time when Egypt's foreign exchange resources were witnessing a tangible improvement particularly at the level of tourism, expatriate remittances, and Suez Canal revenues.
Credit facilities extended by banks to their clients witnessed a rise after a one-month decline.
The cash reserve with the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) continued to decline, thus reaching 14 billion and 79 million dollars only late last January, a fall of 272 million dollars compared with last December.
With regard to credit facilities from banks, aside from the CBE, the report said the total lending and deduction balances reported late last January a rise of 12.1 billion pounds in 9 months as they hit 275 billion and 815 million pounds of which 14.7 billion were given to the government and around 261 billion pounds to non-government bodies.
British Petroleum (BP) is planning to dig three exploration wells in the Gulf of Suez this year. Now, one of these wells is being dug in the concession area L.L87, which the company has been granted recently.
The Ministry of Petroleum in Egypt has announced that a giant project for the production of pipes would be carried out with Kuwaiti contribution (60%) and investments of $95 million.
Board member of the General Exporters Division at the Federation of Chambers of Commerce Medhat Mustafa, who is also a major marble exporter and investor, said the Chinese who have quarries in Egypt started to undersell marble as a prelude to cornering the overseas market.
Marble exporters called for passing a decision preventing foreigners, especially the Chinese, from hiring or possessing quarries in order to preserve Egyptian exports.
Printing industry in Egypt is threatened with collapse due to the successive advances in paper prices following the decision on the exchange rate deregulation.
Paper prices jumped up last year to reach some 3325 pounds, but following liberalization of the rate of exchange they hit 5,000 pounds, which is unaffordable for big and small printing offices.
There are 15 thousand workers in printing offices threatened with dismissal because of such a crisis, said Baghdadi. 36% of the printeries, which concluded contracts with the government especially the Ministry of Education, are unable to fulfill their contracts. The remaining printeries, which still implement these contracts, will stop working once their paper and ink stock they got before the exchange rate liberalization run out. The deadline of implementing the contracts is very soon.
Continual care given by President Mubarak to agricultural producers is the reason behind the unprecedented achievements of the agricultural sector, he said.
Giza governorate earmarked 640,000 feddans for sugar beet cultivation in a bid to achieve self-sufficiency and stop importation.
NEW CANAL TO SOLVE GRADUATES' PROBLEMS IN NUBARIYA
EGYPTIAN-AMERICAN TALKS IN WASHINGTON TO EXPEDITE LOANS COLLATERAL AND FREE TRADE ZONE
On the other hand, a small delegation from the American Chamber of Commerce in Cairo headed by Mohamed Mansour will visit the USA on May 18th, to discuss cementing economic, trade and investment relations.
An official source said that the goal of the study was to determine the best way to use the network of the Egyptian company with a view to achieving the highest possible income rates together with the optimum use of the fleet so that the company may be able to cope with the growing air traffic as well as the prospective increase in the next years. This will lead to the creation of new lines, the cancellation of existent ones or an increase in the traffic volume for others. He added that the study to be done by Cyber Company to develop the company would last for 10 months.
In press statements made yesterday (5th May), the European Union ambassador said that discussions also included the projects that had already been implemented, as well as those projects that would be agreed upon by the end of this year as part of the national programme like the two projects of the regional integration of South Sinai and the renovation of temples.
He added that it was difficult to predict the results The ambassador went on to say that the European commission in Brussels would send a delegation to discuss the new national programme and expected the issues would have been discussed by the end of this year.
In a memo submitted to the European Commissioner of Commerce, Cairo said that the volume and prices of Egyptian exports didn't pose any actual threat to the European steel industry if they were compared with the threats, if any, represented by the other exporting countries as the prices of other exporting countries which are included in the European dumping claim filed against Egyptian exports of steel. Moreover, Egyptian steel export prices exceed the prices of European steel industry.
Under this headline, Salama Ahmed Salama of Al-Ahram wrote a column which ran to the following effect: History books may well say that colonialist looting wars that ended in the Middle of the twentieth century have once again been resuscitated at the hands of the USA helped along by Britain in the twenty first century and incited by Israel.
At this historic decisive moment, the Arab regimes and governments should not just stand bewildered, amazed and arm-folded, marking the time or moving in vicious circles blaming what happened on the American-Zionist right who conspired to trigger such a war outside international legitimacy or blaming it on Saddam Hussein and his corrupt regime which courted its destruction.
On the other hand, the Turkish experiment proves that if the government is based on a democratic majority even if that majority was labeled religious, it would be better able to stand any pressure or stratagems of international domination of the uni-superpower of the world, and to ensure quite a space for maneuvering. The Arab order badly needs reconsidering.
While a high-ranking Israeli delegation was raising objection to the "Peace Plan" in the White House and the US administration spokespersons were declaring that President Bush would bring it into effect without amendment, the US ambassador in Tel Aviv stated that the "roadmap" was no longer fit.
You, journalist, cannot get how close the relations are between Israel and the US as well as President Bush and I." You forget that the "roadmap" stemmed from President Bush's speech delivered on last June 24th, which, in turn, emanated from the ideas I put forward before him at that time as we reached an agreement on the plan, Sharon added.
THE EGYPTIAN WHO ATTACKED AMERICANS IN KUWAIT: WHAT I DID WAS "JIHAD"
Barbari was working for a local company as an electrician in Al-Udira' Camp. He used a pick-up to run over a group of American soldiers who gathered in front of the camp cooperative society. Accordingly, fifteen soldiers were slightly injured and he was seriously injured in his shoulder and chest as he was shot by the soldiers. Barbari was taken to the intensive care of the camp hospital until the critical condition was over.
This, in turn, means that what has been happening in Iraq would, alas, represent a setback for the Arab peoples hopes and ambitions for democracy not the opposite as some expected and others imagined. Therefore, the invasion, metaphorically called war, represents a catastrophe to the region on more than one level despite the positive results on some levels such as the removal of the repressive regime in Baghdad and opening the door for inter-Arab reconciliation that would bury the impacts of the invasion of Kuwait.
The people were divided into groups, tribes and subdivisions, fighting in a country where there had been no differences in religion, race, or sect before. The collapse was total to the extent that neither America nor the UN could restore even the smallest characteristics of the state and its institutions in spite of the desperate attempts. What happens in Iraq heralds a similar danger if it is not quickly handled as the political vacuum left by the collapse of the state created room for kinds of polarization that makes it difficult to restore harmony and state authority.
LOVERS DREAM OF SUICIDE BOMBINGS IN IRAQ, AL HARAM NIGHTCLUBS CLOSE DOORS With the exception of downtown Qasr Nile Bridge, and Fish Park, Zamalek district, most nightclubs and cinema houses witness a state of recession due to the ongoing war on Iraqi villages and cities over the past fortnight.
Wages of belly dancers at hotels and touristic nightclubs decreased by about 70% in light of visitors' refrainment from frequenting such places because they are preoccupied with following the news of war, which has become the main concern of the Egyptians.
Two other students told Al-Quds Al-Arabi that war affected them, as they feel they have grown up over the past two weeks. They attributed their maturity to the sacrifices of mujahideen in Baghdad who sacrifice themselves for their honour and religion. Ihab Tawfiq, one of the two guys, student at the Faculty of Engineering, stated that he frequently dreamt of martyrdom and added that he would be happy if one day his dream came true.
Heba Metwali, a 3rd year student in the Faculty of Commerce, said that her mother was angry from her son because he wanted to travel to Iraq to join fighters defending land and honour and leave his classes.
The minister pointed to Israel's expansionist greed in Africa in order to obtain fresh water as it lacks every potable water source.
KUWAIT, AL AGREE TO STOP DETERIORATION OF THEIR RELATIONS
Yesterday (6th April), scores of Egyptian volunteers for jihad in Iraq demonstrated before the Bar Association headquarters in protest against the Bar Association failure to finish their procedures of traveling to Iraq. They carried anti-US banners and accused the Bar Association of procrastination.
This will be done in coordination with the Iraqi embassy and the costs of travel will be borne by the Bar Association, he said.
SYRIA AND JORDAN START BUILDING AL-WEHDA DAM
MINISTRY OF CULTURE LAUNCHES NEW SATELLITE CHANNEL IN DECEMBER
Eminent TV and mass media figure, Emadeddin Adeeb is one of the most outstanding candidates for chairing the channel. A Ministry of Culture leadership is currently in charge of supervising the implementation of the administrative steps of the preparation of the channel premises and selecting the administrative cadres that will run its financial and administrative affairs.
The channel's surprise will be its bulletins and news programmes. A network of correspondents is being prepared and both male and female announcers are being selected to cover such an important activity especially as the new channel will be headed by Emadeddin Adeeb.
Maher held a meeting with Welch two days ago to discuss on the situation in Iraq and the "Road Map" plan.
EGYPT DENIES EXPORTING MEALS TO COALITION FORCES
On his visit to the Fatwa House, Kasim said, "The visit I paid to the mufti comes within a batch of several meetings Hizbullah conducts to ponder on the latest developments in the region especially the American aggression on Iraq. Hizbullah's ideas and thoughts are identical with the mufti's as far as the region is concerned.
Commenting on the American warnings to Syria and Iran, Hizbullah's deputy noted that America was psychologically and morally pressurizing the two countries because they are very effective that hinder the Zionist project in the region.
The figures were uncovered at a recent symposium on the PNA's 2003 budget organized by a human rights center in Gaza. It was attended by Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) Budget Committee Chairman Saadi al-Karnaz, Salah Abdel-Shafi, an economist, and Ma'in Ragab, dean of the Al-Azhar University Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences.
This shows PNA's disinterest in farming which constitutes a main earner for many Palestinians. Palestinian farming is taking the brunt of the Zionist occupation policy.
CALL TO TEACH CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN EGYPTIAN SCHOOLS
In an urgent quest for notification to Prime Minister, Dr. Atef Ebeid, the deputy rejected the USA Department of State's accusation against Al Azhar of interfering in the political affairs and overstepping its religious competence because it lashed out at the US-British aggression on Iraq.
In a press briefing he held in Damascus on Saturday following his meeting with Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad, Lentos said he would personally suggest imposing sanctions on Syria if it did not meet such demands.
If Syria maintained such (Palestinian) offices in Damascus or continued military backing of Hizbullah we could easily guess what would happen and I would personally try to have a sanction law passed by the Congress against Syria."
YEMENI PRES.: HIGH TREASON IN BAGHDAD
On his part, Saleh enumerated his party's accomplishments including reunion, demarcation of borders with Saudi Arabia and Oman and settlement of Henish crisis with Eritrea.
The decision taken by the Muslim Brotherhood group two days ago to participate in the legislative elections due to be held in the kingdom on June 17th had been strongly urged by domestic and regional factors, especially the Iraqi and Palestinian causes and their political implications on Jordan.
Sources with the group told Al-Hayat that the Islamists had realized that they would better take a positive reaction to the first elections in the reign of King Abdullah the Second to emphasize their course of action advocating reform and abandoning violence and to forestall the attempts of an extensive trend in the state demanding to dissolve the group and follow in the footsteps of the Egyptian experiment in that concern.
Arabiyat also demanded that the judiciary be given the capacity of determining violations on the spot through the presence of judges in the polling stations, and not confining its role to mere supervision. He believed that the Islamic Movement initiative to participate needed similar measures from the government to cement confidence in the political climate in Jordan.
Chairman of the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMS) Ahab Olwi said that among this figure there were 2455 scientists working in medicine, nuclear medicine, radiology, nuclear engineering, astronautics, genetic engineering besides businessmen running sophisticated mega-projects all over the world.
Deputy chairman of the institution, counsellor Ibrahim Bomelha told journalists yesterday that the aim behind the charity campaign was to help the Iraqi people in their distress and provide them, especially children, women and the old, with aid and basic needs.
On the contrary, the Jordanian-Iraqi crossing point witnesses the crossing of Iraqis heading back to their country, which baffled Jordanian observers. While international organisations had not reported even a single case of Iraqi refugee until yesterday afternoon, the official Jordanian records said around 500 Iraqi citizens at least crossed the Jordanian-Iraqi borders heading towards Baghdad in a bewildering behaviour that needs much explanation. Among those returnees are five Iraqi diplomats who quickly and "happily" left, to quote in the words of the Iraqi embassy spokesman in Amman Gawad Al-Hamad while speaking about a Jordanian decision that five Iraqi diplomats should leave Jordan.
It has been noticeable so far that big quantities of fresh meals have found no people to eat them near the Jordanian-Iraqi borders. Some of those who are there for whom the meals were not originally prepared get the meals free of charge now so that suppliers may not bear the cost of returning them to Amman.
It seems that foreign reporters know they have nothing to do in eastern Jordan for the Iraqis move in the opposite direction heading to Iraq and the people there are only truck drivers and customs and relief workers and there is no real way to know what happens outside the borderline.
Some local press expressions also entered the circle of fun. Arabs Today local newspaper carried on its front-page yesterday a word of advice to US President George W. Bush saying that he should receive lessons in geography due to his statements in which he said war would last longer because Iraq is a vast and "very rugged" country. The newspaper mentioned that Iraq is a plain and open country rather than mountainous and rugged, which requires that lessons in geography should be given to the ignorant president.
For his part, Dr Ahmed Mahmoud, the researcher at Cairo University and supervisor of the survey, said that excluding Maspero from the competition was not a surprise as there were former indications that confirmed that. At the last months, Maspero's following up of events was very poor.
Palestinian Minister of Local Government, Sai'b Oraikat, said the British Premier Tony Blair told the Palestinian Prime Minister "Abu Mazen" in a phone conversation on Tuesday that both Britain and the USA tend to postpone implementation of the "Road Map" until the war in Iraq is over. However, the Palestinian Authority (PA) hastened to refuse such postponement.
The idea is summarized that everyone would head to the nearest phone and calls a random phone number in Iraq and talk to the one who answers the call for one minute in order to encourage him. An Egyptian would call 00964 then Baghdad code (1) then any random number provided that it would start with 443, 818 or 527. This way he would ensure that he is randomly calling an Iraqi household.
Further, they called for not feeling disappointed if some attempts to call Iraq did not succeed owing to different circumstances and called on them to re-call before telephone lines are disconnected due to war.
Islamonline.net adopted the idea and presented it through dialogue channels in the website under the title "Alexandria University wipes Baghdad's tears". It started to receive the experiments of those who made phone calls with Iraqis to encourage others. The result was also amazing.
How come that he is more confident than me while he is going through such circumstances?
Just, dear brother, hold on and fight under the banner of "No God but Allah".
It is known that the Egyptian communication companies had devised many new methods for using the mobile phone in order to listen to certain songs, chat or listen to some Fatwas.
1- "Starting an intensified electronic Jihad through dealing media blows to the criminal American Administration by sending pictures of the criminal American build-up to the whole world and all American and British e-mail groups and dialogue groups. They also called for collecting the e-mails of as many American people as possible, including individuals, research centers, elites, magazines and websites. It is preferable to concentrate on the e-mail addresses of individuals, which are easy to be obtained.
3- Concentrating on electronic Jihad via a set of websites and develop these proposals by our computer professionals.
He laid it bare that the minister, who attacks those schools for using the method of memorization in lieu of innovation and creation, is mixing between the method of learning natural sciences, which depend on innovation, and the method of studying the Holy Quran, which depends on memorization and dictation. The prophet (PBUH) had received the Holy Quran from the Angel Gabriel and recited it to his companions, who in turn handed it over to their descendants until today."
This idea is not applicable for Iraq or its people because it was not defeated in World War II like Japan and because circumstances were totally different in both cases.
In a symposium at the Faculty of Economics and Political Science, Al-Fiqui rejected any criticism to be directed to the Iraqi regime now. He said that this would be "immoral" and would be considered in support of the aggression.
He set conditions for Israel to join that fresh regional system including reaching a just and comprehensive settlement for the Arab-Israeli conflict and subjecting all its nuclear establishments to international supervision and control.
He added that the present American Administration aimed at "crushing Muslims and seizing their fortunes and lands."
He added that Muslim Brotherhood expressed concern over the fate which has befallen everybody but regrettably no response was give by the governments to such sincere counseling. Instead they declared war on Muslim Brotherhood.
According to the reports received by the ruling party general secretariat, headed by Minister of Information, Safwat Al Sherif, the fact that the old cadres succeeded in retaining their positions points out their effectiveness with the masses.
Lots of the Israelis attacked the Egyptian pop singer, Shaaban Abdel-Rahim due to his new song "hitting Iraq". In his song he calls on the UN and the international community to necessarily look to Israel that possesses weapons of mass destruction, emphasizing that Iraq is void of such weapons.
In his article, the Israeli writer stressed the "naivety" of the Egyptian singer who, according to him, finds no difference between Sharon and Barak in his song "I hate Israel" of which he sold 15 million copies until now. however, he then described him as intelligent in dealing with some phrases that "tackles the fancy of the tense Arab street" when he described Bush as the leader of the Axis of Evil and Sharon as sitting in a Jacuzzi with Arabs blood dripping around him like rain.
Nobody knows for certain whether the Son of the Nile has traveled to Iraq as a volunteer to defend its land a few months ago or is a resident who had been there before the crisis began. That was why the American forces administration in As-Saliyah had made contacts with a view to enquiring about his identity as well as the names of Egyptian, Sudanese and Jordanian nationals enlisted in his brigade.
Al-Ahram Al-Arabi's correspondent in Moscow Abdel-Malik Khalil writes an article to the following effect only in part: The whole world is living a historical awful moment caused by the aggressive war launched by the U.S. and Britain on the Iraqi people at a time when the U.S. hurries up to disclose its aggressive plots which will also include Syria and Iran. Resorting to accusing Russia of offering military aid to Iraq makes it apparent that the world verges on a third world war, or, according to a Russian parliamentarian: "We live now in almost the harbingers of a third world war."
* Protecting the Russian interests in post-war Iraq, especially as President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov have articulately explained more than once that Russia has important interests in Iraq now and in the future.
However, Primakov explicitly told Saddam about this matter, even though it was not an easy one despite the friendly relations between Primakov and Saddam since the Soviet era when Primakov was former Soviet Union president Mikhail Gorbachev's envoy to Saddam Hussein to convince him of the military withdrawal from Kuwait and saving the Iraqi people, but the U.S.-led war machine imposed the withdrawal and sanctions for over ten years on Iraq.
Former chief of the national economic security body in the first main administration of the Russian intelligence spoke about the American aggression on Iraq. He said that what is going on now is not meant to promote democracy nor to make life go smoothly regardless of the U.S. efforts to promote such allegations. They speak about changing the regime in Baghdad. After such change, Iraq will be, then, ruled by a puppet government. Undoubtedly, it would be incapable of controlling the country without Western protection just as the case in Afghanistan.
Although the U.S. assault on Afghanistan was meant to eliminate Taliban, the real goal was its neighboring country - China. The Western military forces in Afghanistan seemed to have determined the borders on which China could extend its influence.
SAUDI BUSINESSMEN: READY TO COMPETE FOR RECONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS IN IRAQ
He added that British and US companies should not be let alone in that field, pointing out that Saudi businessmen should take well-studied and planned moves to win some of these contracts to "reconstruct a neighbour Arab country whose people would welcome us more than anybody else."
However, he said, US companies might depend on some Saudi businesses to provide their needs because of joint relations.
Al Azhar and Islamic Research Academy scholars' stance on that war goes in parallel with the Christian position declared by both Pope John Paul II and Pope Shenouda III, Tantawi said. Both stances are opposed to war and are calling for peace, tolerance and reconciliation, he added.
Jihad includes self-sacrifice, money-sacrifice and anything anybody can do to help what is right, Tantawi said in the conference.
When asked about the Palestinian cause, Tantawi said that the Palestinians should continue defending their rights by all available means and the UN should help them through subjecting Israel to its resolutions and forcing it to comply with them, otherwise, he went on, it could lose its powers as an international organization that has binding resolutions.
In exclusives to Al-Alam Al-Youm, Barakat said that Misr Banque raised its authorized capital to LE5 billion from LE1.5 billion and issued and paid-up capital from LE1 billion to LE1.8 billion.
Yesterday(13th April), the General Authority for Supply Commodities had concluded a loan agreement at a value of $25 million with Islamic Bank for Development (IBD) and it would also hammer out another loan agreement at the same value in the coming few days, said deputy chairman of the Authority Mahmoud Abdel-Hamid to Reuter's Agency.
Egypt topped the list of buyers of American wheat during the last five seasons but it descended to the 6th rank in 2002-2003 after it chose cheap imports from France and Eastern Europe. This step came as a result of the high increase in American prices which achieved its highest level in five years last September due to drought.
EGYPTIAN-TURKISH TRADE EXCHANGE UP TO ONE BILLION DOLLAR
It is a mistake to say that the production of the two countries are similar, the minister said, pointing out that Turkey, for instance, needs many commodities from Egypt including cotton of which Egypt produces many excellent kinds.
EgyptAir Holding Company decided to convert the purchase of 5 320-Airbuses to the financial lease system instead of direct loans.
He added that the period from January to March 2003 witnessed a rise of 12.3% compared to the same period last year as the number of tourists hit 1,184,000.
CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES TO BE GIVEN ACCESS TO FREE ZONES
GHALI: LEAP IN EGYPTIAN STEEL EXPORTS
He added that the fact that steel sheets factories in Suez started operation would increase such exports to one million tons annually as of this year. He went on saying that such factories were essential components in export development strategy to take exports of building and construction materials from $361 million in 2001 to about $1 billion in 2006, with steel exports claiming 25% annually.
According to the Egyptian government, 90000 hectares of agricultural land would benefit by that grant as wheat production is expected to rise in those lands by 15% from 570000 tons to 650000 tons.
He called on Egyptian companies to study the need of the Russian party to import several commodities like medicines, serums, vaccines and cosmetics. Russian businessmen should try to make use of Egypt's membership of the COMESA which have 300 million souls.
"Egypt seeks to make up for the retreat in exports to the Iraqi market following the collapse of the government," said an officer in foreign trade sector, confirming that African markets were the best to accommodate Egyptian commodities on condition that exporters comply with the specifications required by such markets.
Egypt and Russia have resumed bilateral talks on a 5-year deal that provides for giving Egypt one million tons of wheat on a yearly basis, said a spokeswoman for the Russian Ministry of Commerce.
The Egyptian-Dutch Consultant Council is currently holding a meeting in Aswan under the chairmanship of Minister of Water Resources and Irrigation Dr. Mahmoud Abu Zaid.
Holland will also probe a project for developing the navigational course of the river Nile in cooperation with the ministries of transport and water resources. The cost of that project will be 600 million dollars, 40% of which will be financed by the Dutch side.
He explained that such a strategy relies on giant national projects in Toshka, South Valley, Sinai and West Nubariya in order to meet the needs of food and strategic stock on the national level.
Soon, he added, the first electronic system would be put in force in order to show on the spot the foreign currency selling and purchasing operations in banks and exchange firms on the CBE screens.
The debate, which started during the committee's discussion of the new banking law, triggered a heated argument.
"This was an unnecessary measure that denied access to this job to competent bankers and financiers who may be more worthy of this position," he pointed out.
The latter were just civil servants who could be fired or retired or replaced and were like any other occupants of senior positions in the civil service, they said, while membership of the People's Assembly required loyalty to only one origin and one fatherland for representation of an Egyptian constituency, so as to avoid suspicions of divided loyalty, particularly as the Assembly was discussing certain topics related to Egypt's relationship with the country whose nationality was borne by the deputy or deputies in question.
CUSTOMS DOLLAR UP TO 575 PIASTERS
The final formula of the trade agreement between Egypt and Russia was approved yesterday. This agreement will last five years as per which 1.5 million tons of Russian wheat per year will be exchanged annually for Egyptian commodities such as vaccines, rice, fruit, onion and garlic. It is worth mentioning that these products represent 50% of the deal value.
It was agreed on a financing mechanism at distinguished and preferential prices, he said.
It was agreed with the manager of the national bank in Shanghai to cooperate with the chamber so as to put it onto all information about the Chinese market as well as the means of cooperation with different marketing companies.
This comes within the framework of an international campaign organized by the Ministry of Foreign Trade in cooperation with Cotton Exporters Union to promote the Egyptian cotton, consolidate its position as the best kind of cotton all over the world and get access to other international markets.
$133.7 MILLION RICE EXPORTS
The total value of exports to the biggest 10 markets hit 3.51 billion dollars or about 58.12% of the total Egyptian exports in 2001. Thailand came first in terms of the biggest (rice) exporters all over the world with 1.36 billion dollars or 33.21% of the total value of exports this year, the study pointed out.
Over the last two months, the CBE shut down around 23 exchangers, 11 of which challenged the shutdown with the court, while the others are bracing for taking similar legal actions soon.
US BUSINESSES COMPLAIN ABOUT RECESSION IN EGYPTIAN MARKET
Uses hit 119.5 billion pounds against 85.3-billion-pound revenues, a thing that necessitates rationalizing expenditure, widening the taxpayers' slash, reviewing customs exemptions and combating tax and customs evasion.
The government's internal public debt is steadily increasing. It rose from 147 billion pounds in 1998 to 194.8 billion pounds in 2001, in addition to the net debt of the economic authorities, which accounts for 45 billion pounds. The National Investment Bank's debts are estimated at 54 billion pounds, he pointed out.
The CAA uncovered continuation of negative phenomena concerning the implementation of the budget's projects, foremost of which are the choosing of inappropriate projects, inadequate initial studies and putting such projects up without removing the existent obstacles, which led to sluggish implementation and aggravating burdens, he said. Al-Malt warned against amending the items of the budget's projects during the implementation process in violation of the law. The implementation parts of some projects, for instance, exceeded what was planned to a great extent, he said.
"We also work hard to cut commodity imports to reach $14.4 billion with an increase which does not exceed $4300 million," the minister said, pointing out that total foreign currency usage in the economic development plan project has reached $19.825 billion against $19.075 billion last year. Total foreign currency resources hit $20.1 billion compared to $19.1 billion, an increase of $1 billion, thus achieving a surplus in foreign currency resources estimated at $275 million despite all global economic conditions.
Exchange firm owners considered such a step an indication to its going out of the competition ring. Experts stressed that the rarity of foreign currency and the war circumstances led to the government's interference once again through compelling different institutions and authorities to deposit 75% of their foreign exchange revenues to banks. The decision caused too much controversy regarding its legitimacy. Experts called on the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) to find a solution to the problem of dollar loan borrowers and to tighten control over dealers in the exchange market on condition that the Police surveillance that threatens the Egyptian economy would come to an end as a whole.
"The only solution requires the government to identify the priority problem, i.e. recession, which we have to consecrate all our capabilities to solve," he concluded. Dr. Alia Al-Mahdi, professor at the Faculty of Economics and Political Science, opines that the exchange rate deregulation decision negatively impacted on the market now that dealers started to hoard foreign exchange, especially the dollar, in order to speculate on it. The problem, she added, aggravated due to the limited sources of foreign exchange in addition to the fact that the decision synchronized with the effects of the war on Iraq. Dr. Mahdi laid it bare that the black market would remain so long as the chronic economic problems remained. It would be wrong on the part of banks to seek to increase the dollar rate to snatch the clients of that market.
The price per ton of onion to Germany hits 786 dollars while it is sold to Qatar at only 32 dollars, something that points out price differences all over the world.
He added that any decision would be announced once it is reached and that negotiations constituted one of a set of options under examination.
The war on Iraq together with the military preparations that preceded it have negatively impacted on the volume of direct foreign investments in Egypt. Total foreign investments in the second quarter of the FY 2002/2003 hit 150.4 million dollars against 402 million dollars reported in the first quarter, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) monthly report said.
THE PICTURE IS DIM, HOPE STILL THERE
In fact, I felt pity for Premier Atef Ebeid and Finance Minister Medhat Hassanein while they were talking about the economic conditions in Egypt during their meeting with chairpersons and chief-editors of press institutions to solve the issues related to publication of books and opening documentary credits for purchasing paper.
Despite the fact that the economic picture is dim, predictions show strong indications of a breakthrough as long as we showed discipline and credibility in the decisions and measures related to economic reform program.
He pointed out that his country's move was motivated by its desire to ward off any economic harm done to Egypt as a friendly country which has strong relations with Greece.
High-ranking sources ruled out the possibility that the Egyptian relevant bodies would resort to liquidate some banking entities, which face problems in their financial positions.
Hassan suggested resorting to the technique of big banks owning weak banks instead of the liquidation option just as what happened when Banque Misr owned Credit and Commerce International Bank, which collapsed.
According to an official report, food commodities prices in Egypt increased by 10% on the average after the pound floatation decision, while industrial commodities prices rose by 6.5% for both whole sale and retail prices after the floatation.
Regarding industrial goods, reinforcing iron price rose by 45.7% per ton and the price rise for detergent ranged between 16% and 36% per ton.
This came in a report received by Minister of Transport Eng. Hamdi Al-Shayeb about the results of the visit to Sudan paid by the Egyptian delegation that comprised representatives from roads and bridges companies and the board of directors of the Federation of Egyptian-Sudanese Contractors.
Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) Governor Mahmoud Abul-Oyoun instructed banks to carefully look into the feasibility studies of public and private projects that count on bankrolling through foreign exchange borrowing.
In the meeting, a banking revamp modernization drive - as directed by President Hosni Mubarak - was also discussed. Banks were also urged to give borrowing to pre-export production operations in a bid to develop export industries.
On last March 8th, arguments were in full swing regarding the free trade zone with the USA after the discussions of a free trade zone with Egypt had been ruled out by the American commercial representative Robert Zoellick.
It seems, nevertheless, that the official attitude towards the war against Iraq was the main reason behind the launching of the initiative in light of the absence of effective Arab rejection and confrontation against America.
EGYPT, JAPAN COOPERATE IN CONSTRUCTION FIELD
The World Bank (WB) has agreed to finance the building of passenger Hall No.3 at Cairo International Airport, in cooperation with the National Investment Bank, Minister of Civil Aviation Ahmed Shafik declared yesterday.
Egyptian bankers monitored a 4-5% increase in the demand for the euro and the pound sterling in addition to a remarkable increase in the euro saving rates along last week. They laid it bare that the euro saving coffers are expected to increase during the coming few days in view of the expectation that the euro rate will likely surge up against US dollar which reached it lowest level before the European currency in 4 years.
Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) governor Dr Mahmoud Abul-Oyoun announced that the automated teller machines nationwide would be linked through the CBE to one linking network within days with the aim of helping clients and making it possible to use those machines anywhere in Egypt no matter which bank they deal with.

First Undersecretary Ministry of External Trade and Head of Commercial Representation Authority, Al Said Qassim said that the Egyptian companies which produce and export sea herbs have ample opportunities to export those herbs to the Japanese market that consumes big amounts of them.
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, ambassador Fayza Aboul Naga uncovered that the USAID programme was currently being reviewed in order to make the best possible use of it. She said that Egypt had asked that the cost of experts, consultants and feasibility studies be radically cut down as these used to claim a big part of the aid. No rewards or grants would, furthermore, be rewarded either to Egyptians or foreigners, she said.
The curtain finally fell on the last scene of the Dwarf case which has created a sensation for four years because businessmen Mark Fahim Dwarf defaulted on the repayment of his debts to 7 banks, to the value of LE370 million.
Maged Fahmi added that under that agreement, the total capital of the two companies reached LE95 million out of total debts amounting to LE241 million which was converted into working capital to be recycled inside the complex of Dwarf factories in Alexandria.
Egyptian Minister of Petroleum, Samih Fahmy emphasized the sector's commitment to rationalizing public expenditure, increasing revenues and enhancing the final surplus through the exploitation of the companies' available productive capacities, minimizing waste, achieving the highest economic return and making use of the idle stock that is no longer needed by the sector's companies and observing the rules of accuracy in estimating investment applications and rationalizing investment expenditure.

The Belorussian side is represented by Belgospi Chepron Company, an affiliate of Belorussian Ministry of Agricultural, said Commercial Representation chief Al-Saeed Foad Qassim.
Under this headline, Dawoud Al Shyrian of Al-Hayat wrote a column, which runs to the following effect: Has Baghdad surrendered or has it been surrendered?
Such a rapid collapse of Iraq requires a response that pays no heed to submission or acceptance of the status quo or justification of occupation under the slogan of liberation from despotism. Nor should we deal with the issue with arrogance, intransigence, ignoring facts or the lust for revenge.
The unfinished U.S. onslaught on Iraq could extend to bring pressure to bear on neighbouring countries and safeguard Israel, said Mostafa al-Fiqi, head of the Egyptian parliamentary Committee of Foreign Affairs. He kept his fingers crossed that what has happened would be a shock that gives Arab mentality pause for thought. The regional situation will not be stable unless there is an Arab legitimacy for post-war stage in Iraq. This legitimacy can not be brought without Egypt. The remarks were made by the senior lawmaker in an interview with Al-Hayat daily.
Pressure does not mean a military action, but may include calls on the two countries to carry out reforms to be determined by the U.S. However, I believe that Lebanon's Hezbollah will be the next target. I predict that emboldened by the U.S. presence in the region, Israel will attack its adversary Hezbollah which, along with Hamas and Jihad, it wants to destroy. Hezbollah is its main target.
Israel lies behind the U.S. orientation towards the two countries. I see that Israel plays a central role in the war on Iraq. But, no one can bring it to book.
Q: What is the solution?
Many Arab countries have double-faced political characters.
We should deliberate on the region's future.
Fiqi: First and foremost, a domestic reform should be carried out, coinciding with an all-out regional role. State security trials should be scrapped.
Democratic systems have to be established in the region.
If Egypt wants to play a key role in the region, it should seek a common ground with America.
Fiqi: The die is cast.
Fiqi: There is no ambivalence.
Fiqi: Free movement is limited and leverages have not been useful any longer. For the Americans, the UN now means nothing to the extent that they do not pay their UN dues.
General Garner said he would head for Baghdad shortly. His first task will be to get acquainted with the local leaders, start the rehabilitation process and introduce an all-over drive to extend aid to Iraq, which he said it would return to be the "gem" of the Middle East.
The Israeli government hopes to achieve its water goals in Iraq after it has failed, so far, to obtain the Nile water.
Water Resources and Irrigation Ministry reports say that Egypt's per capita income of water has gone down to 900 cubic metres a year, which represents a critical stage.
So far it has refused to sign water agreements with Egypt contenting itself with being an observer in the Andego and TechnoNil.
It is a grave matter as it is related to the Egyptian's life. The current international circumstances are favourable to the implementation of Israel's ambition. Will the government just pause for a little and consider the wishes of the World Bank regarding water or will it just carry on with the deed and, for a few dollars, abide by all instructions just as it did with the rate of exchange issue. We should also say that the coming war between Egypt and Israel will be one caused by water.
CHANGES IN THE RULING PARTY LEADERSHIP AND MINISTERS IN TWO STAGES
In the last few days, there have been consultations about some names put forward for taking up leading positions by the end of this year including former minister of supply Dr. Ahmed Geweili whose name was put forward once again for premiership and Dr. Mufeed Shehab, minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research for Parliament Speakership and Dr. Atef Ebeid, the present premier for Al-Shura Council's speakership (should the council be dissolved and re-elections take place).
Saudi government's keenness on mosques affairs is not new. It assumes the responsibility of building them and providing them with all services. During the last two decades more than $17 billion were spent on the expansion and renovation of the two holy shrines. Besides, such keenness extended to mosques all over the world.
A drive must be laid down with the aim of putting an end to the overlap between political and cultural discourse and religious one, determining the location and role of religious discourse in the social movement and creating a state of equilibrium in mass communication discourse in general. This case must be dealt with in a way that allows pluralism without exaggeration and allows the society to express itself in a way that fears no confiscation or exclusion.
Beshara ruled out that Washington might launch a war against Syria because the position in Syria, according to him, is different from the position in Iraq. The US can not launch any military operations against Syria before the coming US presidential elections.
Tel Aviv, they repeated, hopes to reoperate the oil pipeline from Kirkuk to Haifa across the Jordanian territories even before a peace agreement is concluded between it and Iraq.
They concluded by pointing out that Israeli agronomists would help American experts execute the agricultural development programmes in Iraq.
The U.S. marines found that their location was near a Saddam's hunting preserve.
The daily hunted deer is cooked in a large pot with orange juice in the open-air, according to the Russian Itar-Tass news agency.
As regards the homosexuals' case, which was included in the European decision, Sorour said, "The Egyptian Penal Code does not criminalize the special sexual relations between adults by mutual consent. The Egyptian law does not interfere in the private life of individuals by any means. The public practices that were connected with deriding religions and encouraging licence rather than the perversion acts were behind the criminalization in this case. So, we should respect the people's right to freely choose their legal system and protect their religious and cultural values."
According to the legal change, carried by Jordanian local press on Friday, the "attorney-general shall stop chasing a criminal involved in an embezzlement case if he returns the whole or even part of the misappropriated funds to the original owner. Such a decision should be okayed by a judicial panel.
CHANTS OF THE VOICELESS IN W.C.''S
Using a marker, a student wrote: " if Bush and Blair belonged to the species of "Ulouj" (infidels) the Arab rulers belonged to the species of "Taratir"(the inept)" in reference to Arab rulers' positions during Iraq's crisis quoting Al-Sahaf's words.
He them reiterated his conviction in Saddam "O people believe me Saddam is not a traitor.. he's just been sold down the river".
Another retorts "How come?
"O God Almighty degrade America and bestow victory on Saddam." The word God was crossed by another student who wrote, "Such divine word must not be written in the bathroom, silly blockhead!"
In the faculty of Agriculture another student wrote "the Americans and the British belonged to the species of Oloug with a "J" letter (infidels), our rulers would belong to the species of Olouq (with a "q" letter (sissies) as we have just failed to answer back."
Another student replies " Od boy, Baghdad fell because Verginia went to bed with Acre's viceroy once again," in reference to the incidents for Al-Nasser Saladdine movie.
Another female student wrote " Brilliant Widad. You are worth one hundred men," in reference to martyrdom operation carried out by an Iraqi woman who drove a booby-trapped car and stormed an American check point, causing over 5 deaths and injuries among the American Marines.
Before the war has come to an end, an American message came quickly in the words of Assistant Secretary of State John Bolton to the effect that the Iranians have to draw a lesson from what happened to the Iraqi regime. This has raised fears among Iranian milieus that Washington may move, as soon as its military campaign is over and the occupation of Iraq is complete, to widen the regional revenge circle and exert more political and economic pressure on Tehran with the purpose of changing the existing political situation or curbing its interventions into the heart of the Middle East cause without excluding the options of resorting to force in a later stage.
The quadruple committee A source closely connected with the Iranian decision-making circles told Al-Majalla that the strong tone of the supreme leader towards the US and his Arabic address to the Iraqi people come within the framework of the Islamic Republic's categorical refusal of America exclusively drawing the political future of Iraq. This is also meant to emphasize that Iran can influence the course of events after the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime.
The important question here is: will the US be able to exclusively draw the future of Iraq and distance regional parties particularly Iran?
Rather, the discussions now underway in the American media and political forums on the future of Iraq will urge that our reasonable and also constructive role should be enhanced.
TV broadcast Moreover, Iran set up a ground TV broadcast station intended for Iraqi population called (Righteousness TV) and the Iraqi Supreme Council of Islamic Revolution was entrusted with its management.
Shiite visions Tehran's bet is that its efforts will result in rendering the supreme council a principal and pivotal power in the political Iraqi life during the post-Saddam era.
Conflicts The trend of martyr al-Sadr is marked by its emphasis on the Arab privacy of the Shiite situation in Iraq and its rejection at the same time of any form of foreign influence whether it was western or Iranian. This trend extends into the Iraqi Sunni milieu unlike the other Shiite movements and trends.
It is too early to predict how the political features of the post-Saddam stage and the level of the international and regional influence on that score would be. However, it is certain that any external party would not ignore the fact of the multiplicity of the political, doctrinal, and traditional mosaic of the Iraqi people. Nor would it be able to exclusively draw the political future of this country.
"Our cooperation with the Iraqi people doesn't go beyond the media and popular support as we have no material potential to contribute. We also have duties to do in Palestine", he said. We hope that the Iraqi people may follow the suit of the Palestinian resistance and escalate their resistance to the American occupation, added Rantissi.
According to the documents of American intelligence, Egypt helped Syria to possess chemical weapons during the 1973 war.
Sources with the Group said that instructions had been issued by Guidance Bureau, the highest authority in the group, to the organization's branches in various governorates to avoid organziational procedures and stop holding meetings which might be interpreted by security bodies as illegal activities and not to give the authorities the chance to hunt the organization action cadres.
Two days ago, Egyptian security bodies raided a house in Damanhour city, Beheira governorate and arrested ten Muslim Brotherhood leaders who were in and referred them to the state security prosecution which ordered they be put in custody for 15 days pending investigation after it charged them mainly with acting to topple the ruling regime.
The voices calling for dissolving the Arab League, reformulating its charter and activating its role in order that it may fit in with the political developments and changes which are being witnessed by the Arab region are far from now. Besides, the performance of the AL is being exposed to criticism by its own officials especially the Secretary General himself.
He had reached that position well equipped by his rare political experience and political assets he had acquired from his previous position.
The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) issued a report about torture in Egyptian prisons and described it as a daily crime committed against prisoners, which should be stopped.
It demands the article 282 of the penal code be amended as it failed to discriminate between torture practiced by an individual or that exercised by the state, and article 129 of the penal code regarding using cruelty as the set penalty was too light to suit the wrong done.
In response to a question by Asharq Al-Awast about the U.S. threats to Hizbullah, head of Al-Wafaa resistance bloc (Hizbullah deputies in the Lebanese parliament) Mohamed Ra'd said Hizbullah did not intend to send any of its elements to Iraq.
There are Egyptian-Arab high-ranking political moves at present to abort any Israeli attempt to exploit the occupation of Iraq without ending the state of war with Arab countries, he noted. There is Arab consensus to exclude any joint ventures that will do harm to Arab projects such as Suez Canal and SUMED pipeline. Such a project primarily aims to put Israel among the region's economies without withdrawing from all Arab occupied territories, he pointed out.
Egyptian Mufti (religious opinion authority) Dr. Ahmed Al-Tayeb emphasized that since the mid-forties Western colonization has been seeking to partition the Islamic world countries from Pakistan in the East to Morocco in the West as such a step was thought by colonialists to be only guarantee of Israel's security.
He pointed out that Iraq would not be the last step in the Western scheme.
Those U.S. lawmakers had repeatedly failed to have such a bill okayed.
Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Sharaa said Syria had always longed to hold a dialogue with the U.S.
The U.S. official labeled the Lebanese resistance group as a key terrorist group.
Arabs and Muslims will become increasingly antagonistic to the U.S. due to its policies in the Middle East region.
However, it seemed obvious that all those groups and organizations have no influence or even presence in the street inside the capital.
Al-Hayat had a round in the district of Al-Azameya, and Al-Jam'a quarter where it saw printed leaflets hung on mosque walls and doors calling for national unity and refraining to deal with the Americans. The leaflets were signed by "Baghdad Scholars Group".
PAYING FOR EGYPTAIR TICKETS BY INSTALLMENTS!
The agreement, which will be in force in EgyptAir Cairo-based branches in Heliopolis, Adli, Sheraton and Alexandria-based Gleem branch, stipulated that the experiment be tried in other EgyptAir airline offices after a period of assessment to underline how successful it was.
The report also noted that the percentage of the elderly and children hit 81.2%; thus putting great pressure on the workforce (18.8% approximately) to afford their basic needs.
President Arafat does his best to abort Abu Mazen's trial to form a government and Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon, who kills and ravages on a daily basis, helps him for personal reasons.
Israel stated that it wanted Mohamed Dahlan to be in charge of the security portfolio, thus driving Palestinians to think of the man as a collaborator. Dahlan has earlier announced, after Arafat objected to his assuming the post, that he would not stand as a stumbling block in the way of the new government.
Abu Mazen's duty is to side with his people's interest against the enemy's.
AL-FIQI: WASHINGTON LEAKS INFORMATION TO CAUSE BEDLAM

"RABAT HALL" FROM CLASSICAL MUSIC TO SAIRI'S HQ
Ten pictures of Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) leader Masud Barzani were hung on the pillars of the building that overlooks Al-Azamiya district in Baghdad.
Iraqis receive such parties in astonishment while some citizens head for some headquarters to propose new ideas of political, economic and media activities within the framework of reconstruction.
The outcome was that future wars would not depend heavily on armored corps.
Another conclusive reason was cited for this cut, which is ridding of Iraq as an Arab rival force from the Arab-Israeli conflict.
The privatization plan would include a number of army factories, opening competition for supplying logistics and other services such as tasking private companies with flying army generals with their helicopters instead of that of the army, thus laying off a lot of personnel.
GOING OUT OF TOMB
Didn't Plato write in his Republic "The Cave Myth" about what may happen to a human being if he suddenly moved from darkness to light and from the shackles to freedom?!
Yet, there is a lesson that has to be drawn by the Arabs outside Iraq especially those who defended the bygone regime and considered fighting side by side with it as Jihad for the cause of God. The lesson lies in the horrible poverty in which people of a rich oil country live; the misery rampant in villages, suburbs and cities; the hundreds of thousands of women and old men who search for 300,000 missing persons whom the regime kidnapped, killed or forgot in prisons; the cellars and prisons discovered daily; the mass graves and unidentified skulls and bones. Isn't this enough to be a witness for an era of chaos and despotism that should have been ended a long time ago?!
A number of Iraqi businessmen asked for concluding transactions with Israeli companies operative in fields of construction and communications, the sources added.

The European parliament also called on the European Commission to express deep concern to the Egyptian authorities over what it called "a spate of detentions of homosexuals" and the rulings passed in March 2003 against 21 Egyptian citizens accused of homosexuality. It said that the European Commission would have to closely monitor "any other developments in such cases!"
One axis of such a strategy relies on striking the Saudi regime, expelling the Saudi royal family from Mecca and Medina, striking Syria, isolating Egypt from the Arab World, setting up a Turkish-Hashemite-Israeli pact and besieging Iran.
According to the report, the Arabian Peninsula needs not to be Saudi or Wahabite.
Pursuing and trying anybody related to any terrorist groups including state bodies personnel such as the Intelligence Department.
The crux of the matter, nevertheless, which is the custody of the holy places from which the Saudi ruling regime draws its legitimacy, the report openly refers to alternatives such as a return to the Hashemite family who have legitimate rights to protect holy places.
At this point, both the American and the Israeli visions of peace in the Middle East and with the Palestinians are mixed up as they are both based on the principles drawn up by Israeli former premier, Netanyahu.
Some Israeli travel agencies announced the organization of regular flights to Iraq. They pointed out that the Iraqi meals are very cheap and appropriate for the Israeli tourists who always seek cheap destinations.

5 EGYPTIAN TV BROADCASTERS PUT ON VEIL, PUTTING TV OFF
Shereen Gamal, Naglaa al-Husseini, Heba Tayseer, Mervatt Fawzy and Fatma Fuad, having triggered off confusion in the Egyptian Television by putting on hijab, called for being put on the same footing with the four veiled announcers of Channel 5, who put up a good fight to remain as broadcasters, but they could not appear on the screens. They only asked senior officials of the Radio and Television Union to grant them access to documentary shows, parading monumental and landmark treasures in Menya, along with other tourist, religious and cultural shows. Unfortunately, their diverse requests were not granted by the officials.
Veiled announcers should gain access to the same advantages of those unveiled ones who are allowed to appear on the screens so freely. She voiced dismay at transferring her, together with her colleagues, to work as channel controllers, a job which any lay person can do.
Channel 7 is now stuck in predicament due to the shortage of professional lady announcers, brought by the transfer of the five veiled announcers to other tasks, with officials seeking to fill the gap by making fresh recruitments.

Under this headline, Saudi professor of sociopolitics at King Abd Al-Aziz University, Saudi Arabia, Khalid Al-Dekhil wrote a lengthy article, excerpts of which run to the following effect: The political situation in Iraq now under occupation is open to all probabilities concerning the possible shape of rule.
The difference lies in the formula that such cooperation should reach.
Religious leaders seem to be the only ones that have typical indicators of how the coming rule in Iraq should be.
The U.S., however, was the only party that ousted the former regime by the force of arms.
Despite the American domination of the Iraqi scene, the situation in Iraq on the heels of the collapse of the political regime provides unprecedented opportunity.
The U.S. is a superpower: this is true.
This can, nevertheless, be supported, especially after the downfall of the Iraqi regime, by the Iraq openness to the idea of state secularization, which can be legitimate. In the past, such legitimacy was confined to the intellectual contexts of some political parties such as the Baath Party.
The two pillars almost agreed by the Iraqis nowadays are: a federal state and a separation between religion and politics.
Yet, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, a Shiite leader in Najaf, made an admonition that religious events should not be capitalized on to obtain political goals, pointing a call by the Supreme Assembly for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SAIRI) in Iraq on the Shiite community last week to flock to Kerbala to mark a Shiite event to show off its political sway and influence on Shiites.
For his part, Sheikh Ahmed al-Kobaisi, a Sunni leader, adopted a similar position by telling Al-Hayat daily that his group did not favour an Islamic system in Iraq, emphasizing that "an Islamic state is unfavourable for the time being.
In case this assumption proved to be right, it reflects the boldness of those sheiks in taking the wheel instead of succumbing to "grassroots' rule"; a wide-spread phenomenon among many leaders of "political Islam".
It is not clear whether there was coordination between different sects in Iraq about their declared stances regarding the rule in Iraq.
Religious convictions are generally speaking exclusive and private whether on the individual or sectarian levels and that is why they are characterized by introversion and exclusion of other religious and sectarian affiliations.
All Iraqis want national unity as a safety valve.
AGREEMENT FOR TRADE COOPERATION BETWEEN EGYPT, GULF STATES
Some other topics related to cooperation in the cultural, judicial, consular and administrative fields would also be dealt with.
Al-Ahrar got a report prepared by the Ministry of Finance including a plan for the development of economic organisations in the new fiscal year, which will start on 1st July next.
The report disclosed that most organisations affiliated to the State organisational structure, which are 59 in number, suffer sharp imbalances in their financial structures despite their economic nature.
The report underlined that the sharp imbalance in the budgets of public economic institutions requires the reformation of conditions and improvement of their operation economics with a view to achieving a suitable return for the Public Treasury that suits the investments spent by the State on them over the past years. The total cost of these investments amounted to 338.4 billion pounds including 6.1 billion pounds invested in the Suez Canal Authority and 37.1 billion pounds in the General Petroleum Corporation as well as 295.3 billion pounds invested in the other organisations.
However, Egypt is still ranking seventh for four months on end, as the GDP growth rate stopped at 3.1%. It was preceded by Turkey, China, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brazil which achieved GDP growth rates accounting for 11.4%, 8.1%, 6.1%, 5.6%, 3.8% and 3.4% respectively.
On the level of the balance of trade and external commodity dealings, the report registered a rise in the commodity exports only from 1.53 billion pounds in January 2002 to 2.63 billion pounds during the same period this year. However, imports went down from 5.08 billion pounds to 4.70 billion pounds. The volume of the balance of trade deficit nosedived from 3.55 billion pounds to 2.07 billion pounds during the same period.
The annual report of the Egyptian Businessmen Association on national economy said that industry was ranked first in terms of total loans and facilities during the year 2001/2002 with a rate of 34% followed by the services sector with a rate of 23.7% followed by the trade sector with a rate of 21.2% followed by the agriculture sector, which ranked last with a rate of 2.1%.
As far as the contribution to the GDP is concerned, the trade, finance, and insurance sector came first with 21.2% followed by the industry and mining sector with a rate of 19.3%, then the agriculture sector with 16.8% and the social insurance sector, which is ranked last with 0.1%.
As far as the balance of payments is concerned, the report pointed out that it reported a dollar deficit at the end of the 2002 by around 448 million dollars, a fall of about 423 million dollars compared with last year as it hit 871 million dollars at the end of June 2001. The report said that this decline does not reflect the reality of the situation as regards the balance of payments.
LE29 BILLION SIZE OF TRADE DEFICIT IN 10 MONTHS
The report pointed out that the goods, the exports value of which rose were petroleum products which rose to LE4 billion and 495, a percentage of 9% compared to petroleum products in 2001. Raw cotton exports also rose to LE1 billion and crude oil exports surged up to LE1 billion 192 million.
The report demanded that quality of domestic products be improved in order to be able to compete with foreign goods and products, which would help to penetrate several new markets and increase the volume of exports.
President Mubarak had resolved the dispute regarding the third company last week and issued instructions that an Egyptian joint venture be founded and that finance be studied in accordance with the feasibility studies that had been prepared beforehand and then implementation would be immediately started. This took place following the news leaked out about negotiations between the two existent companies and the government to put off the impleme ntation of the new company till 2007 in return for LE2 billion as the licence value.
During his meeting with the Ukrainian ambassador and the Russian acting official in Egypt, Prime Minister Atef Ebeid considered the stages of negotiations to conclude an agreement to import wheat from the two countries under the barter deal system.
The Prime Minister underlined the importance of opening new markets - other than the traditional ones which include America, France and Australia - to import wheat therefrom, Abul-Naga said.
In a ministerial meeting attended by ministers of industry and military production, public enterprise sector and the general secretary of the Cabinet, the prime minister considered the setting up of 20 metal silos to be increased to 50 in the future.
FIRST UNIFIED LAW TO FOUND COMPANIES IN EGYPT!
Al-Ghamrawi added that the most important principles on which the new law relies is the unification of the general legal framework which organizes the foundation, administration and the liquidation of companies, achieving equality in treatment between all types of companies and taking care of the rights of the minorities protecting the rights of small shareholders especially in joint ventures and not prejudicing the rights of personnel that have become established in the Egyptian society and is preserved by the constitution.

This reflects how far the economic problem is deep, as explained by economists, due to the limited ways of solution.

AMERICA DEMANDS $1 BILLION FROZEN IRAQI ASSETS FROM EGYPT!
According to American embassy sources, such a step came in accordance with a report sent to it as well as to American embassies in Middle Eastern countries especially Jordan, Lebanon, the UAE and Saudi Arabia through Office of Foreign Assets Control. The report asked American businessmen and companies throughout the world not to deal with a list of banks throughout the world as they are dangerous to American national security. This came within the framework of a series of measures aiming at imposing economic sanctions on some banks in Egypt because they had refused to uncover the accounts and deposits of some Egyptian businessmen accused by the embassy of being agents of the Iraqi regime.
The report added that Washington would resort to the World Bank for resolving disputes in order to force the Egyptian banks to uncover accounts numbers and deposits which the embassy claims that the government is covering up for their holders on behalf of Saddam Hussein as well as cashing approximately one billion dollars Iraqi assets frozen in Egypt to the American Federal Bank.

There has been a higher demand for the Saudi riyal in Egypt in the last few days as it rose to 165pts on the black market against 156.5pts on the official market. This is attributed to Egyptian "Mu'tamireen" or minor pilgrimage performers to procure their needs of the riyal before Umra (minor pilgrimage) season in a bid to avoid the riyal shortage that usually happens at the beginning of Rajab (7th month of Islamic year) and continues till the end of the Haj season.
He pointed out that the market usually witnesses a sharp shortage in the riyal, which is softened after the end of the Haj season. He added that another reason for such a shortage is Egypt's weak exports to Saudi Arabia, which might amount to $40 million against $200 million as imports from Saudi Arabia, which shows a trade balance deficit tipping in favour of Saudi Arabia.

Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) Governor, Dr. Mahmoud Abou El Oyoun said that the CBE reserves of foreign exchange are quite secure. He denied rumours that had it that the Government would confiscate foreign exchange deposits with the banks. He pointed out the unconstitutionality of such a measure as every citizen has the right to deposit funds in foreign exchange and that his funds should be secure.
Aboul Oyoun emphasized that there are LE385 billion as bank deposits by Egyptian citizens, according to the CBE daily data, besides the funds deposited with the postal savings bank and investment certificates in the hand of the Ministry of Finance, a sum that is a little higher than the volume of Egypt's production of goods and services in one year, which means that the accumulations that took place in the form of bank clients savings over the last years are something to be reckoned with.
The CBE report indicated that such remittances declined by $1.3 million in the second quarter of the current fiscal year, thus hitting $737.1 million in the period from October to December 2002. The decline was most apparent in 9 countries - Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the USA, Britain, Germany, Italy, Japan and Canada, while Egyptians' remittances from the rest of the world achieved a slight rise in the range of $0.1 million in Greece to $8.4 million from Switzerland.
According to such rules, the CBE called upon all banks to increase their capital so that the minimum capital will be 500 million pounds.
Heated files "The aim behind increasing the capital of banks is to solve the problems of such banks rather than close them down as they constitute burdens over the Egyptian economy," said former CBE governor and current president of Delta International Bank Ali Negm. Such problems upset the Egyptian banking body especially as there are many heated files of the banks such as the accusations related to the financial reputation of some bank personnel or the large number of faltering cases, Negm said. Such problems can be solved through the amalgamation in other stronger banks and through a programme aiming at boosting the banking work together with admission that the banking sector is lacking in the qualified cadres to compete in this field, he pointed out.
Danger of liquidation For his part, bank researcher Ahmed Abdullah said the issue of increasing the banks' capital is considered an important issue at present due to the problems occurred in previous periods starting with the "the crisis of MPs of loans" (the MPs who got bank loans without sufficient collateral, and failed to clear them) to the increase of the volume of the defaulting credit, some bank borrowers who are on the run and the credit facilities outside the state. Such incidents should cope with Basel Committee regulations, which include the ten industrial countries under the supervision of the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), he added.
25% RETREAT IN TOURISM REVENUES, COLLAPSE IN EXPATRIATES' REMITTANCES
It added that it is expected that the Egyptian expatriates' remittances would witness a considerable collapse as a result of the war especially after the confusion that took place in the position of labour in Arab countries. It pointed out that it was necessary to take into account that such impacts might be softened as a result of the USA embarking on the implementation of the programme on the reconstruction of Iraq, especially as Egyptian labour enjoys relative advantages on Iraqi markets.

Housing experts including university professors and owners of consulting offices in Egypt uncovered before the People's Assembly's Housing Committee that 88 per cent of the Egyptian real estate wealth violates the building law.

It might be mentioned that the PA Housing Committee, headed by MP Mohamed Abul-Enein, had called upon a number of experts and professors to lay down the final formula of the draft law to protect real estate wealth, which PA Speaker Dr. Ahmed Fatehi Sorour had called for. Dr. Sorour accused those who refrained from putting the bill forward of committing a crime against citizens after the collapse of a building in Toson Street, Shubra, North Cairo, last week.

OMAR SOLAYMAN TO VISIT TEL AVIV SHORTLY TO INVITE SHARON TO VISIT CAIRO
Furthermore, the Israeli occupation army refused to allow seven members of the Legislative Council to reach Ramallah city from Gaza under the pretext that they were related to Palestinian commando operations.
It is just unreasonable that after long months of coordination and understanding between the group and the ruling National Democratic Party especially regarding the mass marches and popular actions in support of the Palestinian and the Iraqi peoples, the Muslim Brotherhood leaders might be accused of seeking to exploit the post-aggression on Iraq climates for the incitement of the masses. They had already had a striking presence in the demonstrations which they participated in throughout the last couple of years especially those that used to be staged following Friday prayers in Al-Azhar mosque campus as well as mosques in various Egyptian governorates where, in most cases, such demonstrations turned into an act of muscle flexing.
The previous years experiences confirm that detention campaigns, referral to courts-martial, pursuing and harassment would only strengthen Muslim Brotherhood and give it even more popularity especially as the group's social role increases in service activities where the State's role has retreated.
However, disarming Hizbullah is a Lebanese desire before it becomes an American one and the group's determination not to lay down arms has been one of the most pressing political problems that has facing Lebanon since Taif Agreement was signed. What silenced the Lebanese sects all that time about this case was just the Israeli occupation of the South. But this does not mean that keeping Hizbullah's arms constitute a Lebanese national policy. Moreover, featuring the militarization of Hizbullah's elements as natural because they are not emergency military groups living in barracks, rather they are ordinary people living in villages means, by the same token, that other sects should also be militarized to protect their souls and villages.
It is noteworthy that former information minister Mohamed Saeed Al-Sahaf had announced on that day that the US forces would be confronted by unconventional arms.

The Israelis received the message with due care and considered it a U-turn in President Assad positions who said two weeks ago that Israel was the obstacle to the peace process, a thing that was understood as a call for liquidating it.
Asharq Al-Awsat phoned Adel Murad, a former information official and present Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) representative in Syria, in Baghdad who talked through his satellite mobile to say: I don't know where the second wife of Saddam and her only son are. I learnt from former activists in ousted president Saddam Hussein's regime that Ali got married to a 17-year-old young girl, named Mouj, last February but I don't really know her family name. She is a Shiite like Samira Al-Shahbandar. It is worth mentioning that Saddam got married to four wives.

The petition will not make a change, sources close to the petition told Al-Q uds Al-Arabi. It will be doomed to the same fate of previous petitions, the last of which was the national petition presented by more than one hundred Saudi cultured persons and businessmen to Crown Prince Abdullah last January, the sources added.
The petition stressed urgent needs in such hard circumstances and called upon the government to announce that the Saudi Kingdom respects all Islamic sects including the Shiite one, opens the way to different Islamic schools, encourages communication between the Kingdom's scholars and other Muslim scholars of other sects, and strives for achieving closeness and acquaintance between different Islamic sects.

Responding to another question on the Arab response to Washington's goals, he said urgent policies should be segregated from strategic planning on the 7-8-year short run.
The case of Iraq should not be repeatable in any other Arab country, especially Iran or Syria, he said, responding to a question on how the Arabs can find a way of the fallout of the aggression on Iraq and the consequent Arab shock. If a collective Arab security system is really wanted, the Gulf countries ought to reconsider their military agreements with America, some of which will run ineffective by 2006 while the others will come to a close by 2011. Arab countries should seek to develop their economic relations with other powers, rather than America, in a bid to bring about a political balance.
Reformists in Saudi Arabia were awfully dejected at the longed-for cabinet reshaping that saw no anomalies as key portfolios remained intact, with prince ministers having retained the positions which they have been taking up for over 30 years.
Dr. Ghazi al-Qosaibi's tasks were expanded in the cabinet reshaping by annexing the electricity sector to the Ministry of Water which was specifically created for him to cover up a decision on recalling him as a Saudi Arabian ambassador to Britain under Jewish pressure due to his support for Palestinian martyrdom attacks against Israel and flat opposition to Israeli crimes.

Many Egyptian economists see that the American initiative to set up a free trade zone with the Middle East is a serious opportunity to attract foreign investments and raise the level of competition on the region's markets.
Meanwhile, deputy head of Sadat Academy for Management Sciences Dr. Hamdi Abdel-Azim calls on the Egyptian government to exploit this chance as soon as possible so as to ask the American party to implement the free trade zone agreement with Egypt, as it has become a necessity especially after implementing all the preparations that qualify Egypt for such a step.

"We were received by presidential and popular delegations, the Iraqi Women Union and representatives of the Baath Party."
Pope Shenouda III turned down a request submitted by a member of the St. Mark Cathedral's Clerical Council to necessarily send a Coptic delegation to Iraq in order to follow up the state of the Iraqi Christians and support them following the US-led war on Iraq. The request also called for following up the Eastern churches in Iraq after the US troops besieged the ousted regime's members who took shelter in those churches during the war.
Under this headline, Zuhair Qusaibati of Al-Hayat wrote an article running to the following effect: When the security of Israel becomes "the key to the world security" we can imagine to what extent could George Bush administration pressurize all of (Israel's) neighbours, forefront of which is Syria, with a view to securing what the Hebrew state needs in such an era of Arab history. The American-Israeli collaboration is unrepeatable.
Prior to Powell's visit to Syria, Damascus was informed of the American and Israeli demands, which it realizes as a reality even if it refuses such "dictations" which came in an intimidating formula through calling for dialogue.
This cannot be explained in U.S. domino game after the war on Iraq except through robbing all the regional roles of Damascus or even assigning Syria a role in implementing the game from Iraq to Lebanon and Palestine.
The question is: Are there any options before Damascus?
Nor should it be astonished when Powel deviates the etiquette of diplomacy in Damascus when he reminded it that the Iraqi oil pipeline was a bad experiment according to the American rules of conduct.
This is a mere start.
They also made it clear that head of the gathering Mohamed Othman Al-Mirghani felt "upset" due to the way he was treated during the visit of Sudan's People's Liberation Army (SPLA) leader John Garang to Cairo. He was also vexed at the Egyptian authorities neglecting him and failure to invite him to any of Garang's meetings with Egyptian officials.

The reform plan that Egypt seeks to achieve relies on some bases, forefront of which is setting up an Arab security council that comprises 5-7 members to be elected periodically every two years, said the source. Such a council, he added, would undertake settling inter-Arab disputes and imposing sanctions on any country that wouldn't commit itself to implementing the council's resolutions. The reform plan also includes establishing an Arab justice court to discharge the duty of resolving inter-Arab organizations disputes as well as disputes between organizations and Arab countries, and between individuals and other countries too.
Mandour is one of the most prominent Islamic lawyers in Egypt and lawyer of Jama'a Islamiya leader Dr Omar Abdel-Rahman and Abboud Al-Zomor, former leader of Jihad organization. "The lawsuit against the Interior Ministry is due to the cancellation of religion blank in the issued personal documents which is an obliteration of Islamic identity and serves the Zionist and American interests against Muslims", Mandour said, adding "The situation complies with Kissinger's theory of emptying man of his content as a prelude to penetrating his identity".
Member of the political leadership of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) Abdel Aziz Al-Rantissi said his movement would not cause the Syrian government embarrassment in case it closed down Hamas' office in Damascus.
Powell's pressure on Syria at a time coordination is in full swing between Israel and Western intelligence services on the heels of the latest Tel Aviv operation only reflects apprehension of both America and Israel about a comprehensive Islamic rise not only in Palestine but also in the whole region, said Rantissi.
This means that the losers had once really betted on the victory and sustenance of the Iraqi regime to continue its bloody old methods.
It is the lesson of defeat for some and the lesson of victory for some others.
Did "religious fundamentalism", in the form of its various aspects up to Al Qaeda organization, manage to give an alternative to 'nationalism' or its like?
We have heard and seen the opinions and proposals of some "winners", even though some of them had advocated, until recently, an all-out support for the political trends they are now demanding to be demolished.
If the American victory still dreams about a breakthrough in peace just as it succeeded in war, it has so far constituted a victory for the American Administration's Likudists whose interest in the forthcoming stage missions is shaped only by how far such missions would succeed in achieving their goals, which are at variance with the goals of the Arab "winners" whether Iraqis or non-Iraqis!
SAUDI ARABIA DENIES ANY AGREEMENT ON AMERICAN MILITARY BASES
Saudi sources denied any Saudi role in the imposition of forces or trends in the next Iraqi government structure as that was an entirely Iraqi affair.
REQUIRED ROLE? Under this heading, Mostafa al-Fiqi, head of the parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, writes a lengthy article to say:
Third: The official Islamic institution of Al-Azhar in Egypt has come under silent broadside in many U.S. circles, as extremists in Washington can not forget the strong position, decisive fatwas (religious opinions) and fiery statements made by Al-Azhar during, before and following the war on Iraq. The position of Al-Azhar, the key Islamic center of Sunnis where Shiite fiqh (jurisprudence) is also taught, emphatically supporting the Palestinian issue and opposing Israeli policies can not either be forgotten by these circles which set plans and visions for a regional future that is much different from its national identity and civilization character, especially as Egypt adopts the Sunni sect, but leans towards the Shiite one.
First: Critical circles of the Egyptian role claim that it was an "instigative role" that neither succumbed to pressure nor followed the required trend that always echo that terrorism could be an international phenomenon involving Muslim peoples, but the mind that lay behind it was an Egyptian one in view of the source, approach and culture.
It is Egypt which should lead the political and constitutional reform movement in the region, initiate a modern culture and put forward a wonderful model that can be followed by others.
Which would you prefer us or those bloody putschists and leftist extremists in revolutionary regimes who would do away with you?!"
We can safely say that after all these radical developments nobody would be able to scare advocates of reform by proposing such a dilemma which has become a thing of the past and the validity of which has become expired! Such a type of justification might hold its advocates accountable for the corruption and despotism running rampant until reform came at the hands of a legitimate national leadership that transcended the dilemma and, hand in hand with its people, went ahead towards real reform which would not be aborted by the remnants of a corrupt party no matter what ploys or manipulations it resorted to.
This came after the revolutionary Nasserite threat to them ebbed away and the emergence of both official and popular Arab climate characterized by "realism" and tolerance towards the idea of gradual reform and more appreciative of the methodology of evolution than the concept of revolution after what repelling putschist experiments had been witnessed, thus clinging more to their evolutionary regimes in the hope that such "evolutionism" might prove to be genuine!
This is the inevitable historic rule which can never be manipulated or evaded!
Shiites have joined other Iraqi bodies in coordinating with Cairo with regard to the forthcoming stage. The meeting held between the Supreme Assembly for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SAIRI) and Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher on April 5th adds to the Egyptian efforts seeking to formulate the future of Iraq.
Even though Maher denied that Egypt prefers a certain faction to an other, it is clear that Egypt sought to establish ties with the strongest Shiite gathering in Iraq through opening channels with the SAIRI, which is believed to play an important role in forming Iraq future after ensuring contacts with the Sunnis through Pachachi and the Kurds through Saleh.
Osama's remarks were made in a massive conference during the Shiite delegation's visit to Egypt.
This week, the Egyptian authorities will officially invite all key Palestinian figures and leaderships, Egyptian official sources said.
The easiness of the American war on Iraq and the access of the Marines into Baghdad with the least amount of human and material losses scared most Arab capitals whether allies or would-be allies, as there are "no enemies to Washington among the regimes." The Arab regimes, the overwhelming majority of which are illegitimate and un-elected, are doing their best to do as many concessions as they can to avoid the American wrath and keep safe and survive.
What issues will Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Al-Sharaa put up in the coming Arab summits? What denouncing or refusing statements will he make in his press conferences he usually makes following any Arab foreign ministers' meeting if any "Arab" and foreign ministers were to meet?
Unlike the Iraqi regime, Syria was not in a conflict with the United States. Rather, it was an ally with it in all its recent wars. In the first Gulf War, Syria sent forces to the Arab Peninsula, supported in expelling the Iraqi forces from Kuwait by force of arms and formed the Damascus Declaration countries.
"IRAQ LIBERATION FRONT", AN UMBRELLA FOR MILITARY ORGANIZATION SUPERVISED BY QUSAI
Those groups started their activity on 28th last month on the occasion of his birthday. They are making contacts with former security elements within the framework of monitoring and preparing for striking forthcoming targets. They act under the name of "Iraq's Liberation Front" which have been thought as one of the scores of opposition organizations that were spawned uncontrollably all over Iraq in the last few weeks but turned out later on to be a paramilitary organization, which had a special ideological programme.
The common quality of all of them was that they all, should have a fierce nature and very high physical fitness, according to the reports of some people who closely followed up the formation of such a secret organization whose supervising officers simply used the "Republican Palace" in Baghdad as a center and used an office known as the Arab Cultural Office which had no sign or notice at the portico indicating its identity.
According to sources, the organization is currently collecting information and monitoring targets inside Baghdad and all over Iraq. It makes use of its complete knowledge of the files of all security elements to ask them to collect information about public utilities and the dates of American and British forces movements, routes as well as other targets to be monitored.
This information synchronizes with American reports to the effect that some resistance are being launched by former regime's elements who are trying to retain their leadership positions, and impede any possible refurbishments to obstruct the work of the new administration and the American efforts at all levels.
The sources said that they did not know the number of those comprised by that "front" as, according to them, the three thousands account only for those selected in 1998, to the exclusion of any other additional numbers that might have been recruited after that.
Mubarak's remarks were made during a symposium yesterday (May 6th) evening organized by the American University in Cairo (AUC) titled "Egypt's Future". The symposium dealt with development issues in Egypt, the Egyptian society's need to comprehensive revival and the new thought sweeping the ruling party. Gamal Mubarak denied that the newly-devised Policies Secretariat or even his adoption of development thoughts are some sort of "steppingstone" to "standing for presidency".
He talked about his activity in the Future Generation Foundation (FGF) and Future Youth Foundation, saying that the two foundations are "among thousands of foundations that are operative in public work field in Egypt".
Talking about the space of freedoms in Egypt, he added, "There are no hushed up topics in Egypt that are not arguable whether these topics were political, social or related to our relation with the outer world. This is the starter of reform."
WASHINGTON SEEKS TO ARREST 1000 IRAQI "NUCLEAR MUJAHEDEEN"
The source uncovered that Washington would release information shortly related to the Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.
THE PICTURE IS DIM, HOPE STILL THERE
In fact, I felt pity for Premier Atef Ebeid and Finance Minister Medhat Hassanein while they were talking about the economic conditions in Egypt during their meeting with chairpersons and chief-editors of press institutions to solve the issues related to publication of books and opening documentary credits for purchasing paper.
Despite the fact that the economic picture is dim, predictions show strong indications of a breakthrough as long as we showed discipline and credibility in the decisions and measures related to economic reform program.
GOVERNMENT IMPORTS MAD COW DISEASE!
Surprisingly, Dr. Ebeid himself had issued a decree to stop importing that powder in compliance with a recommendation by Minister of Health and Population, Dr. Mohamed Awedh Tajeddin for fear of poultry contracting the mad cow disease.
The People's Assembly (PA) is discussing a bill to restrict freedom to issue partisan newspapers.

SURPRISING SPEECH BY AL-AZHAR GRAND SHEIKH
Some audience were astonished at Tantawi's words as during the war on Iraq he signed a statement that caused a sensation and was issued by the Islamic Research Academy, affiliated to Al-Azhar, where Muslims were called on to fight the American an British forces and reject the invasion of that Arab Muslim country.
The Kurdish source pointed out that a group of Jewish Kurds had visited London during the war on Iraq to hold a similar meeting within the framework of the preparation of a plan aiming at returning Jewish Kurds to North Iraq next August after the Israeli Intelligence (Mossad) as well as the Rabbi Authority reports had been prepared.
There're also syndicates and professional and civil organizations, which are supposed to let people express their opinions.
I cite here, for instance, two incidents from two messages sent to me by two university professors:
I still remember when I was at my early youth over 40 years ago when I used to travel from my village, Belkas, to Cairo particularly to sit in the front seats at Abdin Square to listen to late president Gamal Abdel-Nasser's annual speech on July 23rd, a thing that formed my patriotic and nationalist feeling.
Since late the 1960s, travelling to attend such conferences have become conditional on an approval by the university president. This system lasted for a while until the university staff were surprised by a letter from the university asking them to send the required documents to attend conferences a long time ahead of traveling, as after the approval of the university president there should be an approval by the security office, which takes a full month.
The two examples need no further comment!
This came during the inauguration of the "green corridor" symposium organized by the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAIFZ) in cooperation with the Italian investment promotion unit and the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).

The minister said that the plan was keen to provide necessary investments for the agricultural sector to complete the execution of land reclamation projects to increase the agricultural area. The plan provides investments for the investment program of the agricultural sector estimated at 9.4 billion pounds allocated for the reclamation of around 312 thousand feddans of which government agencies would execute projects to the value of 4.7 billion pounds. The projects would be executed by the ministries of agriculture and land reclamation and water resources and irrigation.

The WB also called for introducing legislative amendments with a view to encouraging foreign investments in all fields in Egypt without confining them to national companies.

In statements to Al- Alam Al- Youm, head of the Commercial Representation Office Al Said Qasim announced that the previous negotiations ended with the Turkish side conviction of including agriculture and industry activities in the free trade zone rather than the Turkish suggestion of confining it to industrial products only.
Dealings on the foreign exchange market in Egypt witnessed a fresh rise in the European currencies rates especially the euro, which skyrocketed by 1.40 pound since the beginning of liberating the rates of exchange on January 29th last. It ranged between 7.04 pounds for selling and 6.93 pounds for buying in banks against 7.5 pounds and 7.75 pounds on the unofficial market, which witnessed a qualitative shift towards speculation in the euro to make up for the recession in the dollar dealings especially in light of the steady rise of the euro against the pound, which amounted in the last week to about 20 piasters. This led banks to announce that they would put up saving coffers in euro to bolster their financial position of such rising European currency, now that banks noticed a relative increase in depositing in euro at the expense of the U.S. dollar.
Bankers also pointed out that putting up saving coffers in euro comes within the framework of a banking policy to encourage the dollar owners to transfer their dollar deposits to the euro in order to benefit from the interest differential and reduce the dollar dominance gradually.
According to banking experts, the lull in the dealings on the unofficial market does not mean an end to it altogether.

It also evaluated the nature of the Japanese market as well as the consumers' taste there. The study indicated a clear-cut decline in the trade balance between the two countries hitting 498.1 million dollars in 2001.
The study called for abiding by some important rules for penetrating the Japanese market, which represent a prominent hindrance of exportation to this market. Foremost of these rules are the system of internal distribution in Japan, which doesn't allow importation except via Japanese companies so that these companies would be utterly responsible for distribution to wholesale companies and then retail companies until the goods reach the consumer, in addition to customs aid and importation laws imposed by the Japanese government such as the regulations imposed on importation of rice and agricultural products.

Q. What is your comment on the formation of the Palestinian government, headed by Mahmoud Abbas Abu Mazin?
Everybody says that there is one authority and that such an authority must protect its people from aggression and bring about security to them. But, if it tries to provide security to the occupying Israeli enemy, this means that it is not a single authority but an authority serving the Israeli enemy and the American interests. The Palestinian people also need their security, land and future. Therefore, we need one authority and one law to defend the people, homeland and the future of the Palestinian dispersed people.
A. As for us, we aren't ready to enter into inter-Palestinian fighting. Our arms, God willing, will remain pointed at the Israeli enemy. They will not be pointed at our people. And if the Authority men are concerned with implementing this matter, they will be responsible for this. It is unacceptable for us to enter into an inter-Palestinian bloody conflict.
A. Two matters should be mentioned in this respect: we fight in order to liberate our land and country so long as the Palestinian land and people are occupied, restricted and besieged. How could we, then, stop the Intifada?
We've been waiting for Oslo agreements for 10 years to solve our problem. Ten years ago, we started with Gaza and Jericho at first. Then, we waited for the establishment of the Palestinian state but to no avail. The U.S. was guaranteeing all such agreements, which were even signed in America, but nothing has been implemented so far. Only what Israel wants can be carried out.
Such initiatives died. What they speak about today is the realization of the security of the Zionist entity in Palestine.
HIZBULLAH AND THE POTENTIALITIES OF FRIENDS TREACHERY!
Nor was the Syrian government unaware of the American administration's demand to close those offices and it therefore lost no time in closing them down even before Colin Powell had turned up in Damascus!
The second option is to get rid of the Palestinian organizations which have offices in Syria, an option which has been clearly favoured by Syria!
Hassan Nasrallah, then, said, "Hizbullah is a political movement which is steadily growing inside the Lebanese society and has presence in the political street.
Hassan Nasrallah, then, laughed.
He, meanwhile, realized that he is dealing with a reality whose calculations, givens and vicissitudes vary on the momentary bases.
The question, as we see it, is based on mere speculation.
Following his visit to Syria, the American Secretary of State Colin Powell announced that the American Administration was waiting for actions not words or rather the Syrian government would have to prove by actions rather than words that it did not sponsor terrorism, of course from the American and the Israeli point of view.

Under this headline, chief editor of Al-Akhbar, Galal Deweidar writes an article some excerpts of which run to the following effect: It is not enough that the USA should offer a project to settle the bloody conflict in the Middle East as the crux of the matter is that it should be serious in facing its pampered child Israel to give expansionist and militarism policies and become, therefore, ready to accept the requirements of the settlement of a just and comprehensive peace.
Its bias to and conspiring against the Arabs and their rights in favour of Zionism and Israel raise doubts regarding any arguments on its part for giving momentum to the peace efforts.
I wish the visit started by USA State Secretary, Colin Powell two days ago to the Arab-Israeli conflict region would not be just like its preceding visits which all ended in further American encouragement of the Israeli aggression and describing the terrorism which this rogue state commits as self defence and, furthermore dubbing killer Sharon as a man of peace!

The depth of the so-called Israel, if another state is established in the West Bank, will be 14km only, a thing that will be unacceptable by the Israelis.
Rather, they want an armed state that can defend and arm itself at the same level of armament of the neighbouring countries.
The radical historical solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict lies in establishing one state for the Palestinians and Israelis under the name "Isratine," he said. The success of this idea is conditional on the return of Palestinian refugees and deportees wherever they are if they wish so.

TOWARDS DEMOCRATIC IRAQI SYSTEM PROTECTED BY NEW MILITARY
The United States was surprised by the formidability and organizational capabilities of the Shiites of Iraq.
In order not to allow this apprehension, whose parallels exist in several Arab countries, to cause more wrongs to the Iraqi people, it may be useful to look into the possibility of building a viable democratic political system that could not be used to bring about the menace of a fundamentalist government.
As this is a problem whose scope is much wider than Iraq, perhaps finding a solution to it in that country now would help reinforce democratization in other countries if its elements are there.
However, two things would be required for this notion to see the light. First, the new constitution should be formulated in such a way as to turn the military establishment an observer that would protect this constitution and see to its proper application. Under such a constitution, the military would act as an arbitrator between political parties and forces should there be any dispute.
Because the general concept and some of the aspects of this solution are derived from the Turkish experiment, it is necessary to avoid the shortcomings of that very experiment, the most significant of which are the predominance of the military and the generals' crossing of the borders that separate the military and civilian domains.
This applies to all the principles of the political system that will be described by the new Iraqi constitution.
Second, The Turkish military was involved in three coups in 1960, 1971 and 1980, although its record looks relatively cleaner than that of its Iraqi counterpart.
Even if extremist Shiite forces do win the elections and form a government, they will have to uphold the existing constitution and hold the next elections on time, because if they try any tricks, the military will step in to depose them and install a provisional government to hold the elections.
If this experiment succeeds, it will put an end to fears in other countries that such forces may exploit the atmosphere of freedom to assume power, only to monopolize it and abort the democratic system.

For her part, Na'ela Alouba, head of the Association's Exportation Committee, asked for an Egyptian political movement to reactivate the preferential trade agreement between Egypt and Iraq, which contains big customs exemptions for Egyptian exports to Iraq.
He expressed astonishment at the measures taken against Islamists.
"It is the old policy of schemes, triggering sectarianism and rifts and sowing the seeds of discord.
"Some regimes imagine that they are away from such aggression so long as they meet the demands of the American cowboy. But, it is impossible. The cowboy will only accept entire surrender and absolute subordination politically, economically and culturally."
The initiative of the Egyptian information community includes seven axes: digital preparation, e-government, e-business, e-education, e-services for the health sector, e-documentation of civilizational and natural heritage and developing the industry of the IT.
This service was provided in cooperation between Telecom Egypt and over 100 companies.
As regards the cyber cafés, IT instruments were provided for the children and youths in low-income districts.
There were also legislations organizing the e-signature and e-dealings (the law on organizing the e-signature). The infrastructure of using the "smart cards", the spreading of e-signature, e-documents and e-contracts in the governmental bodies and banking sector, and extending the services of the e-signature and e-documents for the masses at the post offices, IT cafés and gathering centers were also laid down.
In order to qualify specialists in the IT field, persons of high skillful expertise were trained in internationally certified programmes. There was also cooperation with international companies to support Egyptian ones with a view to exporting their services.

Maher also asked that an almost exact inventory be made for the number of Egyptian injuries and deaths as a result of military operations launched by American and British forces against Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein's regime.
Lebanon's Mufti (Religious Opinion Authority), Sheikh Mohamed Rashid Qabbani announced that, "if the Jews dared to storm Al-Aqsa Mosque campus and performed their religious rites there, Jihad in the cause of Allah would practically start." He added that such a war would be comprehensive and an obligation to each and every Muslim till Al-Aqsa mosque and Jerusalem are liberated from Jewish occupation, which unscrupulously killed and exterminated the Palestinians, destroyed their houses, displaced them and occupied their lands ever since it usurped and occupied Palestine.
It can simply be possible for anybody to know the tendencies of the political movements that have reached almost 20 parties and movements through the streamers hoisted. New parties are hoped to be formed in a few days' time.
The statements and the continuous call for free expression and political nation in a way that does not contravene legislative, national interests, promoting democracy, securing the domestic position and the advocacy of the idea that the only standard of legitimacy for any government that may be set up in Iraq should come through the elections and polling boxes. They also call for making the Iraqis holders of their own resources. The statements of parties and political movements started operating with unprecedented freedom in Iraq and even in the US, Britain and other European countries, publishing their own newspapers and announcing the necessity of spreading discipline and the sovereignty of law that would have to replace the chaos currently prevalent in Iraq. They even directly do a hatchet job on the current situation in Iraq in the aftermath of the war and often launch criticism at the American forces blaming them for the current instability in Iraq!
An Egyptian MP asked the Egyptian government to arrange for interpreters for the deaf and the dumb in Friday sermons in mosques so that citizens with special needs might be integrated into the society and be acquainted with its problems and causes and would consequently feel they are part and parcel of such a society.

Much more important is his unprecedented statement that Hezbollah does not want to fight on behalf of all Palestinians as they are free to decide the way they follow.
Powell's insistence on raising the issue of the withdrawal of the Syrian army from Lebanon in implementation of resolution 520 encouraged a large number of anti-Syrian presence opponents to raise this issue aboveboard and outspokenly. The frankest of them was former Lebanese foreign minister, writer Khassan Twaini who participated in the wording of this resolution when he was Lebanon's ambassador to the UN. He affirmed that though this resolution did not name Syria, it was clear and plain on the necessity of respecting the sovereignty of Lebanon.
Amidst statements and counter-statements between the American side and the Syrian-Lebanese side remains a definite truth raised by Powell in the two capitals Damascus and Beirut. The truth is that America promises to reach a peaceful settlement that guarantees the return of the Golan Heights, which may include the part of Shebaa Farms, to Syria and non-settlement of Palestinians in Lebanon in return for turning Hezbollah into a political party without a military wing, particularly as such settlement would guarantee security arrangements on the borders with Israel, and Syria stopping its support for the opposition Palestinian organisations and reaching a special arrangement with Lebanon that guarantees its interests without direct presence in Lebanon.

Nor did it welcome the decision as an attitude. He, rather, asked the government to stop the policy of boasting about one's good turns.
Muslim Brotherhood Group (Ikhwan) General Guide Ma'moun Al-Hudhaibi said that jihad should be confined to the Arab and Muslim countries which are occupied by foreign forces, including Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan.
As for the other land where Muslims are ruling regardless of their circumstances and inclinations, it is impermissible to shed blood or encroach upon the property or lives of others, he pointed out.
This also could be attainable when the institutions of the state establish justice according to sharia rather than exceptional power, and when its executive authorities protect security and implement judicial rulings and do not transgress the law, he pointed out.
The deputies had once sought to amend the law on practicing political life to retain their seats, but the parliament rejected that request on the pretext that such a legal dispute was being examined by the Constitutional Court.
The report added that the candidature papers of those citizens should not have been accepted by the competent authorities.
Abu Mazin informed Hamas delegation explicitly that inter-Palestinian fighting is a red line that should not be transgressed, Rantisi said.
He went on saying, "As I said before, Abu Mazin did not ask for obvious demands but rather he provided a detailed explanation about the political stance and problems he is facing."
Hamas delegation told Abu Mazin that calling for a truce with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is a trap that would not push ahead with an opportunity for peace.
President Hosni Mubarak said education represents a cornerstone for nation's independence. The remark was made by the president at a meeting at the Presidential Palace on Tuesday morning, saying that Egypt had a long history in education so its educational programs represented a pacesetter for other countries in the region. He also underlined the state's centralized role in working out policies and strategies, following up quality, achieving educational ends in Egypt and providing educational administrative flexibility at the localities' level.
For his part, Minister of Education Hussein Kamel Bah'eddin said, during the meeting, President Mubarak attached much importance to all the details of a recent visit by an educational delegation to the U.S., including the fact that the U.S. asked for no amendments to school curricula in Egypt. On the contrary, the American side commended the educational system in Egypt and patted on President Mubarak on the back for educational development efforts.
Defending Egyptian curricula, he emphasized that they do not instigate extremism or terrorism.
AL-AZHAR GRAND SHEIKH: RIYADH AND CASABLANCA BOMBERS VIOLATED ISLAM
Aqedati (a religious newspaper) quoted Tantawi as saying, "What happened in Saudi Arabia and Morocco has painful impacts because this is considered aggression on innocents, causing havoc and instability, something that make non-Muslim countries see the Islamic nation as unsafe countries where peoples kill each other. Such matters are shameful and painful. All of us should square up to terrorism and aggressors to prove the truth and denounce falsehood."

Besides, the collected revenues of the current tariff cover only about 38% of the cost of operation and maintenance of potable water and about 16% of the costs of operation and maintenance of sanitary drainage. This led to the aggravation of about an annual 2.7-billion-pound deficit over the actual costs.
The government also earmarked one billion pounds for upgrading facilities and basic services and subsidizing basic commodities to mitigate the burdens on citizens so that public expenditure would reach 159.6 billion pounds.

The Japanese market is a huge promising market with its external trade volume reaching about $750 billion for both imports and exports. However, it is a market which is difficult to penetrate due to the heavy competition the Egyptian exports are likely to face from other countries, especially China and South East Asian countries whose export commodities not only have competitive prices but also suit the tastes and specifications of the Japanese consumer because of the common culture that combines those countries.
-Unsteady commitment to the specifications agreed upon for the Egyptian commodity, which drives the Japanese importer to stop dealing with the same exporter or other exporters in case non-commitment to the required specifications are repeated.
The Japanese market can accommodate several Egyptian export items, if they meet that market's technical and price specifications, especially as Japan is currently adopting policies that would increase its imports from various countries of the world. This can be shown by the fact that the role of the Japanese trade authority has been converted into the authority for the development of other countries' exports to Japan.
The volume of trade exchange between Egypt and Japan has declined from about $650 million in 2001 to $579 million last year as a result of the decline in the value of Egyptian exports from $76 million in 2001 to $69.6 million last year and the decline in the value of Egyptian imports from $574 million in 2001 to $509 million last year.

This decline is attributed to the fact that Egypt didn't import medical and ornamental plants, sulphate salt, gypsum and cement, he said. In addition, he added, Egypt's imports of tobacco went down by 54% and imports of raw cotton and cotton yarn and textiles also dipped by 7%.

NATIONAL FRONT JUMPING-OFF FOR COUNTRY'S REAL SALVATION: GROUPING LEADER
Political parties and civil society establishments should be allowed to join the governmental discussions of public issues and crises, he said.
It is the people who should change the constitution.
The seventh annual report on human development has monitored many accomplishments achieved in economic growth in the past decade. However, it draws attention to the fact that these accomplishments have not been achieved at the same level nationwide, and that Egypt has a bracket of poor people who are still in need of special care from the State. The report also monitors discrepancy between the rural and urban areas, as well as Lower and Upper Egypt.
In ten years, more than 90% of Egyptians are getting potable and safe water.
Despite such remarkable progress in the domain of human development, monitored by the report that was prepared by a group of Egyptian elite, the report says there are moral discrepancies between the governorates of Egypt and even inside the same governorate.
This reflects transference of the wealth from the rural areas to the urban ones during the period of the past eleven years.
However, this rate is low in urban governorates, as it stood at 7.4% in Alexandria and 12.6% in Cairo. Civil Society: The report asks for the adoption of measures to enhance and develop civil society in Egypt, especially as it discovered the weak capabilities of the non-governmental organizations. The report also discovered that the so-many charity societies do not play their role as representatives of the abjectly poor in the local development operations.

The fact of making the council an affiliate to the Shura Council in lieu of the Presidency, as was scheduled, aims at providing more popularity to the council as two thirds of the Shura Council's members are elected. It is to be mentioned that the constitution stipulates that the President of the Republic is the head of the executive estate, which means that making the human rights council affiliated to him will impose on him some kind of commitment before the government.
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EGYPT & PALESTINIAN MOVEMENTS ON TRUCE
THERE IS NO CRISIS-MANAGEMENT MECHANISM: PREMIER'S ADVISOR
Blasting a paucity of information and scientific inefficiency in this respect, he called for a civil crisis-management center in Egypt.
The administrative performance in Egypt needs to be revamped, said professor Mohsen Al-Aboudi of the Police Academy, pointing out large-scale administrative remissness and negligence.
He added that Jordan would be Jordan and Palestine would remain Palestine as the Jordanian position is based on the fact that the establishment of an independent Palestinian state according to international legitimacy resolutions was the solution to the Palestine refugees issue.
The Israeli minister suggests that the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip be granted Jordanian nationality after granting Jordan the potentialities to receive the Palestinians.
Israeli Prime minister advisor dubbed the USA proposed roadmap in the Middle East as bloody!
ISRAEL EXPLOITS TERRORIST OPERATIONS TO INVITE MOROCCO'S JEWS TO EMIGRATE TO IT
It is noteworthy that the number of the Jews in Morocco is 3500-4000 while the number of Moroccan Jews in Israel amounts to about half a million souls.
Some of them wanted to restore social relations only.
Fadlallah announced his condemnation of such acts and called on those in charge of Islam and Muslims affairs to launch an awareness campaign against such practices that assume the cloak of religion but is completely innocent of it.
Head of Hizbullah's Political Council Sheikh Ibrahim Amin Al-Sayyed called for "preparing our institutions and generations for the political battle with America." "The USA can win a military battle anywhere but it cannot win the political, cultural, social and civilizational battle. We have little arms in comparison to the USA, but all of our mentality, culture, history, values and civilization run counter to those of the US and Israel."
This is actually what happening, as the Jordanian government has opened its borders before the Iraqi traders or the "whales" as they are called. This step is meant to react with an unconventional trade activity that started to sweep the Jordanian domestic markets for the interest of consumption or "storage" in Iraq.
Car traders particularly in Jordan live their golden age, as the whales of the Iraqi market import huge quantities of small or fabulous cars. The Iraqi traders pay in cash millions of dinars and then transport their consignments in a few hours. They imagine that the Iraqi market is in need of any four-wheeled things.
There is a highl demand, in particular, for tyres and car spare parts and exceptional interest in importing pharmaceuticals and medical supplies and related devices.
Over ten thousand Iraqis and Jordanians residing in Jordan are dealing in such a trade. They work as mediators and an executive body between the two parties. It is said that a great Iraqi trader has been seeking for Jordanian partners to clinch deals in the field of cosmetics, as the Iraqi market has been suffering from a sharp shortage of such materials for 12 years. It also seems that large quantities of plastic-made shoes made in Jordan are now on their way to Iraq in addition to herbal formulas, local and Arab newspapers, and cassette tapes.
Tawheed and Islah (Monotheism and Reform) Movement is led by university professor Dr. Ahmad Al-Risoni. The movement is an amalgamation established 6 years ago by two movements; the Islamic Future League and the Reform and Renewal Movement. Tawheed and Islah's Movement ideological bases near the jurist Salafist thought, but it joins the Adl and Ihsan Group in the political orientation as it adopts the approach of the Muslim Brotherhood. But, it is more flexible in dealing with reality and order as it believes an amendment to the Constitution is necessary, but it sees calm and peaceful participation and civilized interaction with the other parties can achieve its goals and that is why it is the only movement that has 42 representatives in Parliament.
It is noticeable that the leaderships of these Islamic movements are in their 40s except Sheikh Abdel-Salam Yassin who reached 70.
Some call it the Salafi Jihad Group. The movement is led by Sheikh Hassan Al-Kinani and Sheikh Abu-Hafs (Both under 30 years of age) who were arrested and are now in prison. It is the only Islamic trend that some of whose members adopt violence as they were accused of killing a policeman. The security agencies announced after this incident a list of the names of some Moroccan figures and accused this organisation of intending to kill them.
A Moroccan source says that the main danger is the emergence of a five-year-old modern Shiite trend, which admires Hezbollah and its leader Hassan Nasrullah, but, alas, is a Salafi trend that is totally away from the ideas of Hezbollah and whose reference is the old Shiite books. It believes in all idle talk about Islamic heritage and selects only the worst of it and seems to be dogmatic and fanatic.
Islamists never forget that King Hassan had put Sheikh Abdel-Salam Yassin, the spiritual leader of the Islamic trend, if the expression allows, under house arrest for years and that King Mohammad VI cancelled this decision. Although his release of one of the fanatic Jewish prisoners was accepted by the west and America, giving this person big privileges after his release such as putting him in charge of concluding oil exploration contracts raised the hackles of many people particularly Islamists.
However, such mass media fail to see that those perpetrators are Saudis who are by-products of the professed official creed, graduates of the regime's schools and its Islamic institution which used religion as a pretext for survival and freedoms confiscation.
In an address yesterday, the Saudi Monarch King Fahed bin Abdel Aziz admitted to the necessity to make reforms, enhance popular participation, but omitted to say where or how such participation would be. We wonder whether it was necessary for all those blasts to take place so that we might eventually hear such magic words about reform and popular participation.
The new conservatives in America hardly achieved anything by toppling the regime of the Talibans. They rather started to harvest trouble due to their occupation of Iraq. Afghanistan is still a hotbed for chaos and instability. Iraq is still without water, electricity or security!
Reformist politicians and media men and liberals in Iran urged that a lesson should be learnt from what happened in Iraq and Afghanistan, so that Islamic regime institutions in Tehran should undergo deep reforms.
The European Union is holding trade talks in parallel with a political dialogue to pressurize Iran in order to refrain from seeking to own mass destruction weapons and to stop supporting anti-Israel groups and improve its human rights record.
The signatories demanded a return to the people and referendum and called for "stopping detentions and illegal summons before the judiciary".
PARLIAMENT DISMISSES RECEIVING ANY INVALID VOTE REPORTS
A Court of Cassation report had declared Al-Zaitoun elections invalid as main and sub-polling stations were chaired by members of the State Litigation Authority and the Administrative Prosecution, which are not judicial bodies.
Tagamo'h Assistant Secretary General, Hussein Abdel-Razik who also doubles as rapporteur of the committee on defending democracy and member of the quadruple committee which is tasked with facilitating the action of the national committee, told Asharq Al-Awsat that there was always constant objections from the government to any Constitution amendments concerning the system of the presidential poll. Not only was this said by the NDP secretary general, but also by other officials who are opposed to the idea of introducing any amendments to the Constitution, he added.

The story usually begins with some of the ambassador's entourage visiting the gallery to inform its organizer of an important personality intending to visit the gallery. The identity of that personality would not be revealed and is claimed to be any country's ambassador or minister.

EGYPTIAN-MALAYSIAN COOPERATION IN SMALL-SIZED PROJECTS
People's Assembly (PA) Economic Committee asked for considering the real reasons behind the retreat of private sector investments after the recent statistics showed that its participation in investments do not exceed 46%.
The report highlighted a number of indices describing them as serious, as the economic growth rate dipped during the first year, 2002/2003, of the five-year plan to 2.5% while it was expected to hit 4.5%, something that raises doubts about the ability of the five-year plan that will end in 2006-2007 to achieve its targets. It is worth mentioning that the growth rate of different economic sectors in general and the intermediary industries in particular runs so slowly. This coincided with the retreat of an important and leading economic sector, namely building and construction sector, whose economic growth rate decreased by 11% in spite of being considered as an important sector that supports other economic sectors.
The committee warned also against failure to confine the domestic debt and decrease government borrowing from local savings. The expected government loans in 2003/2004 plan for the government and the companies and the authorities of the public sector are expected to hit 71% of total savings. This will provide private sector and public enterprise sector companies with only 4% and 3.7% respectively to finance their target investments in this plan.
Meanwhile, the dollar rate of exchange compared to the pound jumped from 340 piasters in 1998 to 538 a few months before the deregulation decision in 28 January last. Thus, the pound lost more than 36% of its value.
This necessitates that banks and exchange firms must deal with high responsibility and exert efforts to recognize the actual elements of power with respect to supply and demand.
In view of this, he pursued, it is expected to attract some foreign investments on the Egyptian market so as to easily recognize the price of the foreign currency and get it. The absence of that decision used to limit the influx of direct foreign investment.
Professor of economics at the Faculty of Economics and Political Science disagrees with these opinions. He opines that the decision did not achieve any of its declared goals. The decree timing was inappropriate as there are no production bases that can compete, not to mention the fiasco in importation and the escalating economic recession. The government neither prepared the market well nor handled the negative points to render the decision a success.
Although some ministries are justifying the sluggish repayment to those companies' failure to implement the items of the concluded contracts, thus making it necessary to delay payment of dues till handover in compliance with the specifications in the contracts concluded, it has been recently uncovered by the People's Assembly Committee on Housing that the contracting sector had been negatively affected by the hikes in the prices of building materials, as well as the rise in customs duties.
In spite of such a statement, contracting companies think that their dues on the government include not only the old outstanding debts but also the losses incurred by the companies as a result of the deregulation of the rate of exchange which created very high price differentials especially in building materials, which requires compensating contractors for price differentials for the contracts concluded before January, 2003 when the rate of exchange was deregulated.
They argued that the modernization funds were squandered by the government and that the officials in charge of that programme spent its funds on meetings and banquettes held in five-star hotels.
The total finance of the project hits 426 million euros including 250 million euros as contribution of the European Union, 103 million euros as contribution of the Egyptian government and 73 million euros as contribution of the Egyptian private sector.
Four years of the plan's schedule are remaining. However, let's forget about the past as it is clear that the project's start was not proper and was delayed for many years. Therefore, the Egyptian government and the EU decided to change the leadership.
What is more important and what everybody has to know is that the programme will not modernize the industry. * How come, while everybody pins his hopes on it?
High education outputs as well as infrastructure have influence on industry upgrade. The performance of the government and its institutions such as customs department has effect on industrial sector.
Modernization is a comprehensive and wide-range concept, which is not confined to industry only. Rather, modernization extends to all outputs of the society culture and education. What concerns and bothers me in the whole matter is that the manufacturer should understand the message.
Without such a vision, no upgrade or modernization would take place. It is the vision that would determine the working plan.
The programme term is 5 years because the term of the EU aid programme will come to an end following this period. Afterwards, there would be other programmes. But, today there is a commitment by the ministry and the government to forge ahead in this work. These five years were a starting point to execute the project, as the agreement with the EU is definite in terms of time and finance.
Article 80 has been applied to defendant, Hala Talat (43 years old) who was charged with assisting a businessman, the primary defendant in the case, Tariq Al-Sewisy and conniving with him in concealing the sources of his money and extending help and assistance to him.

The Court's report said the election results, declared on November 15, 2000, are invalid because the two phases of voting and sorting out violated the second paragraph of Article 24 of the Law on Exercising Political Rights.

The Jamaa Islamia (Islamic Group) organization dispelled the fears of resumed violence operations in Egypt. The historical leaders of Jamaa Islamia said that the peaceful attitude adopted by the group since the peaceful initiative launched in 1997 would not be backtracked on. They strongly denied that Riyadh and Casablanca blasts might push the group's elements to backtrack on such a peaceful attitude.
The statement added, "In addition to the mistakes, there are also the blatant dangers that result in such operations as they put the whole nation in a state of antagonism towards the whole world, a thing whose repercussions are explicit, because no group is entitled to put the whole Islamic world in a confrontation that will not be in its favour by any means."

ISRAEL BUILDS 2000 SETTLEMENT HOUSES SOON
Israeli Ministry of the Interior sources say that the number of settlers increased by 5000 this year.
Peace with Israel is not possible not because the Arabs reject it but because Israel itself does not want it.
That is, he who has the ability to go to war is the one who has the ability to make peace.
Dr. Ahmad Sidqi Al-Digani, a Palestinian thinker, said that the events witnessed by Palestine developed from a an uprising to a battle of Arabism for defending Jerusalem and Islamic and Christian sacred places. He pointed out that the Arab-Zionist conflict is an extensive social conflict, which requires resistance at the official and popular level and consolidation of Arab solidarity.
He said the American strategy is the greatest challenge that faced the Arab and Islamic nation since the Second World War at the external level because Washington adopted in its strategy the imperialist colonial Zionist entity.
He added that the plan acquires importance from the fact that it is aimed at establishing an independent Palestinian state by 2005 and comes within the framework of the new US policy on the Middle East and the American campaign on terrorism and with the shift in the US Administration stand on the Jerusalem issue after the US president approved a bill passed by the Congress considering Jerusalem a unified capital of Israel, which raises questions over the use and limits of this roadmap.
It also depends on the serious international pressure on Israel which should go beyond attention-drawing and statements to the boundaries of action and clear awareness of the necessity of correcting the current situation and finally the development of the internal Israeli climate to accept a negotiated solution and recognize the Palestinian people's right to State and liberation from occupation.
Rather, what can be understood from the Zionist thought is the movement towards Greater Israel, which would deal with the surrounding Arab countries just as the US deals with the Central and South American republics as it seeks to establish a tripartite alliance between the Jewish mind, the oil funds, and Arab workforce.
Al-Quds Al-Arabi Chief Editor Abdel-Bari Atwan writes an article on the future Palestinian state to say: Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon won a major diplomatic victory on Monday when he "snatched" a decision from his cabinet on okaying the roadmap, revealing to the entire world that he is really a "man of peace" and keen to offer painful concessions for a lasting political settlement.
The first stage includes a long list of requests or "orders" which the Palestinian prime minister ought to meet literally before Sharon just commences to have a look at the roadmap.
What is then the value of this deformed Palestinian state based on conceding the right of at least 4 million Palestinian refugees who have been suffering at Diaspora refugee camps for 50-odd years?
However, the Palestinian people will not be snared in such a new trick as Abu Mazen or anybody else was not elected to waive rights.
By extracting the government's approval of the road map, the bloodiest of all generals in the Hebrew state's history sent a group of messages to cover up for his categorical objection to any fair and comprehensive peace.
The general who daily assassinates peace opportunities is now launching a maneuver to let the Palestinians seem as enemies of peace.
He might have thought that the blatant imbalance of regional and international powers might allow Israel to positively deal with the road map after showing reservations, obtaining reassurances and combining the government approval on the road map with a decision rejecting the "right to return" to Israel.
With the return of Israeli-Palestinian contacts and the talk about a tripartite meeting with Bush's participation, Hamas and Jihad find themselves in a situation that requires either taking painful decisions or willingness to pay too high a price!
Syrian Oil Minister Ibrahim Haddad will sign together with the representatives of the two American oil companies the contract of exploring and developing oil production in the compound 26 Northeast Syria.
Syrian oil industry faced a crisis when the American forces stopped the supplies of the Iraqi oil to Syria during the war on Iraq, a thing that forces Syria to reduce their oil exports by 10%.

The figures were published amid charges by opposition deputies against the government to the effect that it had allocated millions of dinars to back its candidates. This was categorically denied by the government.
The small number of voters is mainly attributed to the special conditions stipulated by the constitution in 1962. A voter shall be a 21-year-old male who is not working in the security or military corps and no verdict was passed against him.
Some deputies argue that had the government approved of these proposals and franchised women the number of voters would have surged up to 350,000 approximately.
At Khartoum Airport, the forces met with the liaison officer based in Khartoum and who is assigned to lead such special forces in such a task in addition to making consultation with military officials in the Sudanese army.
GARANG'S WIFE SPEAKS FOR FIRST TIME IN AL
WILL MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD PARTICIPATE IN IRAQI GOVERNMENT FORMED BY AMERICA?
Al-Hudaibi confirmed that Muslim Brotherhood presence in Iraq dates back to the 1940s as the Iraqi Ikhwan had a representation in the Ikhwan constituent authority in Egypt. He added that the Iraqi Islamic Party is the representative of the Ikhwanite trend in Iraq currently and soon there will be contact with them. Direct contact did not take place due to the current conditions.
A: This is not true as there are Ikhwanite elements in Iraq, but the ousted Bath regime had practiced different kinds of terrorism against them, something that affected the propagation of their call.

The selection of Egypt as a new project site is due to several reasons, mainly the growing demand for polyester which hit around 200,000 tons in 2002, Egypt's high-quality cotton, exploitation of free trade agreements between Egypt and the EU, COMESA and other regional and international blocs, use of Egypt's strategic geographical position to export products and import raw materials, trade links with several countries like Turkey, Syria, as well as North African and European countries, Egypt's well-trained, skilled and cheap labour and available infrastructure, said Diwan Zia, the Pakistani group's president.

Negotiations with Pakistan have been conducted through three channels. On the margin of World Trade Organization Trade Ministers' Conference held in Sharm El-Sheikh Dr. Yousef Botrous Ghali discussed the issue with his Pakistani counterpart.
It seems that the appeal sent to premier Atef Ebeid by 45 foreign airlines operate in Egypt at the beginning of March to convert foreign airlines revenues from the domestic currency into the currencies of the countries to which those airlines belong has not been given two hoots by the authorities concerned. Those airlines have, therefore, been suffering from a crisis that would bring the activity of some of them to an entire halt should it not be solved.
1- Financial remittances: According to the companies, during the period from December 2001, till that date, only insignificant sums representing only one month sales of the revenues of all airlines operate in Egypt whose annually revenues range from LE80 and 100 million have been remitted.
2-Regarding the taxes on the official uniform worn by the personnel of those airlines and the publications and gifts coming to them and carrying the logo of the airlines and the usage of which comes within consumption framework rather than trading, serving the purposes of work and is difficult to come by domestically because they carry the airline's logo which are made in the headquarters just as what happens with the national airline (EgyptAir) whose publications and official uniform are domestically produced.
The area was then changed into 9 square meters with a rent value of LE7425. Another point that contributes to airlines losses is the payment of the fees to the authority is estimated in the dollar rate of exchange but paid in the domestic currency i.e the fees rise by the same rate the domestic value declines. The airlines revenues, consequently, corrodes while being kept in banks as they could not be converted into other currencies and could not cope with payments of fees and charges to the authority.
They added that the law contained several items that had to be discussed as they would add considerable financial burdens which most operating airlines can hardly cope with especially in the future.
Regrettably, no.
In the second half of July, a delegation of Egyptian businessmen is visiting Belorussia.
During the visit, the mission is going to conduct market studies for a number of Egyptian products that have good chances for asserting themselves on Belorussian markets in a bid to boost those products exports.
Trade exchange between the two countries has always increased and decreased since they signed Camp David Peace Accord in 1979 even after the outbreak of Al-Aqsa Intifada on September 28th, 2000. Egypt's exports to Israel hit 20.3 million dollars last year against about 20 million dollars in 2001, an increase of 300,000 dollars. Egypt's imports from Israel sharply declined, as they hit some 26.2 million dollars in 2002 against 47.1 million dollars in 2001.

The project also aims at assisting youth in marketing and expansion through expositions.
The total investments carried out in the first nine months of 2002/2003 hit 41.1 billion pounds, i.e. 4.9 billion pounds less than those achieved in the same period of the previous year, Othman said, ascribing such a decline to the fact that public and private sectors investments went down by 6.5 billion pounds. Meanwhile, the investments achieved by the government and economic authorities went up by 1.6 billion pounds. The government investments increased from 10 billion pounds, or 22.5% of the total achieved investments, to 13 billion pounds, or 31.8% of the total investments. The economic authorities investments amounted to 4.4 billion pounds roughly, or 8.2% of the total achieved investments, against 3.4 billion pounds during the corresponding period last year, i.e. 9.7% of the total investments.
International dealings in the first eight months of 2002/2003 resulted in striking the balance of current operations and remittances, thus achieving a surplus of 239 million dollars. The trade balance deficit went down by 4.3% to hit 4.9 billion dollars versus 5.1 billion dollars.
Surplus of the production revenues balance went down by 442.7 million dollars owing to a retreat in Egyptian expatriates' proceeds by 182.6 million pounds and the tourism returns by 258.7 million dollars due to the decline of international interest rates.
Manufacturing industries sector production hit 137 billion pounds, of which 120 billion pounds are achieved by the private sector and 17.7 billion pounds by the public sector.
A report by the Cabinet's Infromation and Decision Support Centre uncovered a decline in the sales of building materials last year.
Economists say that in case economic stagnation persists in a certain country for more than three years, this means that this ailing economy is impossible to recover and its collapse is a matter of time.
The social changes Egypt witnessed over the outgoing half century since the start of July 1952 Revolution failed to cancel the role of planning, said Dr Ibrahim Al-Essawi, advisor with the Egyptian National Planning Institute. Experiments, however, proved that planning is still economically necessary and that the state's role is important, he added. Markets don't work in a vacuum and practical experiments proved that the market is unable to create development in developing countries including Egypt as the market in these countries has nothing to do with the real market on which liberalism stands, Dr Essawi said.
He said the role of planning in bringing about social changes had been limited since the start of the sixties. Its limitedness increased with the open door policy.
Dr Ibtissam Al-Jaafarawi, expert with the Egyptian National Center for Sociological and Criminological Research said, "Lack of organized planning pushing forward the social change process affected the employment of labour as well. With the transfer to state administration, economic planning and the start of Egyptianizing foreigners' property and nationalization which targeted national capitalism, the state bureaucratic class was formed and the capitalist class and the private sector started wearing out and the state became the mastermind of everything in planning."
They are the collapse of the communist block and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait as well as the first Gulf war. A big percentage of Egyptian labour returned from Arab countries due to the shrinkage of the volume of foreign demand for Egyptian labour. The returnees started searching for jobs, thus affecting the agricultural labour sector as it is one of the workforce sectors that contribute to the absorption of about 17 million souls according to 1996 census.
The source pointed out that the next three months would witness the completion of talks about those issues.
An official source pointed out that the report included the most important indicators of ports performance, including a 9.4% rise in the volume of goods and the circulated containers in Egyptian ports.
EGYPT TO BE LIFTED FROM NEGATIVE LIST OF MONEY LAUNDERING EARLY 2004
There is much cooperation between Egypt and many countries all over the world in fighting money laundering, he said. Some of these countries have already informed Egypt of money laundering cases of Egyptians living there and depositing money in their banks.
DUTIES ON REINFORCING IRON ANTI-DUMPING VALID FOR ANOTHER 6 MONTHS
Al-Fayyoumi uncovered that a delegation from Anti-Subsidy and Dumping Authority had currently been visiting Ukrainian for 10 days during which they would visit a number of Ukraine factories which produce iron in order to ascertain the grievance raised by the Egyptian companies regarding the harm done to them as well as the dumping. He pointed out that negotiations would be conducted with officials in the Ukrainian Trade Ministry to discuss the dumping issues and bilateral trade exchange problems.
Addressing a gathering organized by the Arab Agricultural Development Organization on Tuesday, the minister said Egypt supported farming development efforts and provided necessary know-how. Arab countries should exert concerted efforts to tap available resources.
SPECIAL ZONES INCENTIVES MAKE EGYPT BEST INVESTMENT ZONE IN THE WORLD
He pointed to the People's Assembly approval of Egyptian-European partnership agreement, adding that Romania joining the European Union (EU) will increase its cooperation with Egypt.
The value of new investments in addition to the expansion of the existing companies investments reached 6.3 billion dollars in 2002 against 6.4 billion dollars and 6.8 billion dollars in 2001and 2000 respectively, he declared. As for the Irish companies investing in Egypt, Al-Ghamrawi said that their investments hit about 36 million dollars or 11.5% out of their total issued capital, which hits 206 million dollars.
The latest report issued by the General Authority for Capital Market, headed by Abdel-Hamid Ibrahim, pointed out that the volume of funds, which entered the market during this year reached 1.971billion pounds. While the volume of funds which got out of the market due to the war on Iraq reached 1.271 billion pounds, a positive differential of 700 million pounds in favor of the funds which entered the market.
It is worth mentioning that foreign investments in the Egyptian pound on bourse, since the foreigners were allowed to enter bourse in first October 1996 up till now, have been estimated at of 39.2 billion pounds, buying 852.3 million shares and selling 725.6 million shares at a value of 28.4 billion pounds, a positive differential of 11 billion pounds.
A Cabinet statement said that Ebid will consider with the delegation currently visiting Egypt the final formula between Egypt and the World Bank before submitting it to the board of the bank in September next.
During the negotiations the bank asked for a thorough structural reform especially after the step of deregulating the Egyptian pound lately taken by the Egyptian government, something that implies adopting other measures in the fields of trade, financial sector and insuring social security.
BANK DEPOSITS RECORD 27 BILLION POUNDS RISE! Apart from the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), bank deposits surged up by around 27.473 billion pounds over the first three months of this year.
In the first three months of this year, non-state deposits greatly shot up by around 23.256 billion pounds taking the total up to around 321.697 billion pounds late March, the sources added.

Current deposits in foreign currencies hit an equivalent of 11.429 billion pounds, and non-current deposits in foreign currencies totaled an equivalent of roughly 86.374 billion pounds, the sources added.
Al-Tikriti says that their party practised limited clandestine activity in Iraq alongside the other opposition forces after the invasion of Kuwait, but the main activity was outside Iraq though the organisation abroad was not in close and continuous contact with the members inside.
However, this does not rule out the fact that the Islamic party was present inside Iraq and there is evidence that they opened more than 80 headquarters for the party since the fall of Saddam Hussein regime, he pointed out. Also, they did not need to bring in many of the members abroad as the affairs of these headquarters are run by members inside Iraq.
Al-Tikriti admitted to the embarrassment of his party over dealing with the American Administration, which occupies Iraq. He said "We expect the US to honour the promises it made before the world that it went to Iraq to overthrow Saddam Hussein's regime and bring freedom and democracy to the Iraqi people.
Qualifications of new president The Iraqi Muslim Brotherhood Mentor objected to the accusations leveled against the Muslim Brotherhood of being an organisation seeking to achieve its aims through violence." He who reads the history of the Muslim Brotherhood correctly, will consider the conditions that generated some frustration that led to individual violence acts and the Muslim Brotherhood is not responsible for some incidents that took place in Egypt," he said.
Al-Tikriti also said they feel that the imposition of an Islamic state in Iraq was unacceptable. Although this was the aim of the party, the attempt to impose it by force would backfire, he noted.
Stressing commitment to this democratic approach, he said that his party did not mind the next president of Iraq being a Shiite provided that he would have the characteristics that qualify him for leading Iraq in a way that would not discriminate between one person and another. "We do not want him Shiite to protect the Shiite arena. What is the use of a Sunni president if he is like Saddam and what is the use of a Shiite president if he is like the Shiites who served the former regime?" he concluded.
He also called for the rotation of power between the northerners and southerners and for a secular capital.
The Sudanese parties are unanimous on the peaceful solution, expansion of participation in government and joint action towards the creation of a new Sudan.
The Central Bank of Sudan governor uncovered that SPLA had officially asked, in Machakos, Kenya, negotiations to set up a central bank and a special currency for it. He added that experts in banking organizations and international institutions as well as in the specialized committees had emphasized that the monetary authority, monetary policies and the central bank in any country are inseparable and that experts had based their decisive view on purely technical specialized grounds. It is hardly thinkable to have two different monetary authorities, central banks or currencies in the same country.
Al-Jazeera TV channel is always controversial on the Arab and international levels through its march that knows no limits. The departure of its director Mohamed Jassim Al-Ali from his position was also controversial. Many questions were raised especially as the news item of his "sacking", "resigning" or even "the end of his term as managing director" and his return to the General Authority for Radio and Television was not announced in a statement by Al-Jazeera but rather some sort of "leakage."
Some make it likely that the coming days will witness a transitional repositioning in Al-Jazeera until a new director assumes responsibility in a channel that should not have been succeeded without such a big margin of freedom that resulted from the atmosphere of this stage in Qatar. This means that the open-door policy adopted by Qatari Emir Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Than is the secret of success and the main guarantee to the channel of "the opinion and counter-opinion."
The tiring search for the "mass graves" of the former Iraqi regimes victims urged scores of Iraqis to offer their services in that unprecedented field, according to the rewards received if corpses were found in the scores of graves scattered all over Iraq. Some former officials in security and intelligence bodies who had taken part in execution operations now offer services either themselves or via brokers for their services.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guard forces stopped training pilots belonging to the Lebanese "Hizbullah", which indicates that Iran takes Washington's threats seriously, according to a source with the Guard Air Forces.
Sources said the Guard forces based in Lebanon withdrew last week the heavy weapons, foremost of which were "Raad" and "Sahin" rocket launchers and medium-range cannons, which had earlier been sent to Hizbullah and hidden in underground stores in Beqaa area.
The sources pointed out that the negotiations were run by a diplomat in the American embassy in Islamabad which was rejected by the Taliban who demanded that the American representation level be raised.
The sources indicated several outstanding positions that had recently emerged including a statement by American deputy Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs, Richard Armitage in Islamabad that the Afghan President, Hamid Karzai had failed to maintain security and stability in Afghanistan, a statement often made by other American officials in Washington, in addition to the losses inflicted on the American forces in the recent operations launched by the Taliban, Al-Qaeda and Afghan Islamic Party fighters, let alone their failure to establish a strong Afghan government in the whole Afghan territories.
It is the way of George W. Bush that includes reward and punishment and retentive memory.
A report in an American newspaper is enough to cause concern in and about a country.
The current US diplomacy has muscles and teeth and the American arm is long.
The Iranians could flock to the squares of Tehran and wave their fists against "The Archenemy", but the scene would seem old and sad.
The failure to respond means punishment, namely an amount of isolation and series of pressure to take the problems to the internal Iranian level.
Ruling National Democratic Party's (NDP) policies secretary Gamal Mubarak announced that the Policy Secretariat was considering the establishment of "a national authority" that would be concerned with "ensuring efficiency of higher education." "Raising the efficiency of education should not be confined to general education but would also include the technical and Azharite ones," he said.
Gamal Mubarak's talk came during the meeting of the Policy Committee with its members in Al-Gharbia governorate. They broached the issue of preparing for the NDP next annual congress slated for convention next September, which he described as a chance to appraise the party's activities in a year.
HAMAS SUSPENDS DIALOGUE WITH ABU MAZEN
The Palestinian Premier vowed at the summit to bring the armed Intifada to a halt and wipe out violence and terror against Israelis, leading to the creation of a Palestinian state.
The movement also enunciated its opposition to resolutions made at the Sharm El-Sheikh and Aqaba summits.
In the meantime, thousands of Palestinians gathered following Friday Prayers in compliance with a Hamas call to oppose the summit resolutions.
The U.S. military presence in the Middle East region will prevent countries in the region from possessing and selling weapons of mass destruction to terrorists, he claimed.
WHAT ABOUT DEMOCRACY?
If the incumbent U.S. administration (and even its predecessors) was involved in a conflict with countries established on the basis of religion, then its arguments following Bush's commitment have become weak, even if in form, in this conflict.
This Christian right-wing has become the staunchest supporter of Israel in the face of the Arabs, while the Israeli lobby feels comfortable as there is a lobby acting on its behalf in Washington.
Its sweeping triumph in Iraq enables it to justify whatever it does to the extent that it states openly that its military option in Iraq (compared to the diplomatic option in North Korea) came due to the fact that Iraq is an oil-rich country, as said by the U.S. deputy secretary of defense a couple of days ago, dropping Iraq's alleged WMD disarmament excuse.
However, we collected the mobiles and returned them to the candidate telling his men that the price per vote reached 3 thousand dinars!"
The case of one of those candidates, however, has made such a practice public when, according to all reports, he published a press advertisement inviting his neighbourhood population to work for him as personnel in his election campaign in return for 1500 dinars to be paid in advance so that a similar sum would be paid after winning the elections.
Deputy Ahmed Al-Sa'doun who has failed in the last four years vowed to force the government to uncover the secret funds withdrawn by government departments from the Central Bank of Kuwait during the 1999 election campaign, threatened to unravel the names of those who withdrew central bank money and uncover their identities.
A sharp criticism was launched on American policies by Muslim Brotherhood General Guide counsellor Ma'moun Al-Hudaibi just before the first visit to be paid by President George Bush to Egypt on Tuesday next to meet Arab leaders.
He added that for all the repression inflicted on the nation and although it has been for long prevented from catching up with the march of science and progress in light of tyranny, confiscation of freedoms and the employment of several security bodies to strike awe, fear and alarm into the hearts of citizens and force them to seclusion in a blatant confiscation of the people's right to express their opinions, participate in decision making and choose their representatives and officials, all that not withstanding, that nation is still motivated by its Islam regardless of long decades of despotism, tyranny and cruelty to resist the intruder and reject the invaders just as it did in previous cases of intrusion and invasion thus forcing them to withdraw and refusing to recognize imperialism imposed demarcation of borders.
To conclude, Al-Hudaibi said, "The nation's rulers have failed to take even one single step on the road to redressing the house and putting things right.
Renowned thinker and intellectual Fahmi Huwaidi said the fall and occupation of Iraq indicated many loopholes in the Arab political map and exposed Arab regimes' impotence, which, he said, pushed Arab peoples to open the dossiers of those regimes.
The extended emergency law blocks democracy and hoped for reform.
Only fair and free elections and active civil society can lead to a genuine democracy.
Yesterday, People's Assembly (PA) headed by Dr. Ahmed Fatehi Sorour approved a bill to amend the money laundering act.
He said that he supported the government when it was right, but sharply criticized it when it erred, which is the opposition's role. Kalag described the amendments as in compliance with the international developments and reality.
Yesterday, the PA finally approved a bill to reorganize Eye Banks.
The banks get corneas from the eyes of persons who agree to have their corneas transplanted free of charge after their death, the eyes of accident victims or the dead in hospitals where three department heads unanimously agree to transplant their corneas, as well as the eyes of those condemned to death subject to their approval. The corneas of the eyes that had to be medically amputated are ruled out.
Zakeya is the first woman to become party leader in Egypt, which will lead to opening the file of woman's cause to probe her rights to lead parties.
The disease can easily be detected in the developed communities which have advanced medical services and qualified doctors who can identify the disease, they said.
Tens of male and female believers then hurry for prayers.
A roamer in the university yards would notice the numbers of head-covered female students on the one hand and the bearded student on the other hand, which brings the picture of the university close to the general scene of the Egyptian street now more than ever.
We will not get into argument over whether the veil was optional or obligatory.
"What is the relationship between the veil and security threat?
Therefore, the university administration, which showed noticeable flexibility in dealing with religious demands, took a decisive stance on the veil in what seems to be late awareness of the weak impregnability of the liberal education system, which was chanted by the AUC and its counterparts in the Arab world before the torrential religious trend, which extends all over the Arab World.
If we could go backward, we would say that the place of prayer is the house or the mosque outside the university, but the issue has become sensitive today due to the fact that many bodies easily, alas, accuse an edifice like the AUC of being hostile to Islam, which is of course untrue".
They are sold in mosques at dirt-cheap prices such as the tapes of Amr Khalid, Wagdi Ghunaim, Saad Al-Ghamidi and others".
The effect of the figures is not reduced by the fact that 60% of the university students whose number nears five thousands, get scholarships according to which 10-40 per cent of the tuition fees are deducted.
However, the university administration tries to contain these orientations through stressing the principles of diversity and multiplicity and drawing clear-cut lines for the movement of the religious groups.
However, the performance of prayer is something else, as the Constitution guarantees for Muslims in Egypt, the Islamic state, the freedom of performing prayer in all government circles and official institutions. The matter extends to include most of the private companies.
Hesham, 21, does not mind the university administration accepting the request submitted by a number of Christian colleagues to establish a chapel for them on the university campus.
There is neither chapels nor mosques in the design of a new university campus".
The sources indicated that the Egyptian authorities would probably not respond to any American attempts to have the Israeli spy released before his prison sentence is served.
IKHWAN ACCUSES HOUSING MINSTER OF SQUANDERING PUBLIC FUNDS
This was confirmed by the Central Auditing Agency in 2002 regarding housing sector. Some obtained 1920 feddans in the 6th October City to set up private projects with investment cost of LE5 billion. Others, further, obtained 351,000 square meters in Taba Gulf with LE78 million as investment costs.
According to the minister's statements highlighted by a national newspaper, the government had been allowed to dispose of a number of government-owned real estates the value of which ranged from LE4 to 5 billion.
In its statement before the People's Assembly, Dr. Ebeid's government had announced that it was planning to transfer the responsibility for insurance and pensions funds to its own control rather than the National Investment Bank control in a bid to use those funds for redressing public budget positions, which would pose an imminent threat to pensioners' rights.
ISRAEL HINTS AT ACCEPTING TRUCE WITH HAMAS, ISLAMIC JIHAD
Abu Mazen has been trying since his first day in office to persuade different Palestinian factions to fully give up armed action even if for a limited period.
Any Arab or Muslim man who takes up arms to liberate his land and resist Israeli oppression is a terrorist who should be stopped and uprooted according to Washington and its incumbent administration's views.
The first paragraph of the roadmap commands Palestinian security forces to disarm Hamas and Jihad members, nab all those whom Sharon wants to be collared, and finally provide absolute security to Jewish settlers.
Selected students are scheduled to arrive in London next October with the start of the academic year.
NAME OF "SADDAM HUSSEIN" TURNED DOWN IN ISRAEL
Zahaika attributed naming his son after the name of the president whose regime has collapsed at the hands of the American forces because Saddam is an Arab country leader who believes in the Palestinian cause.
There are three crossings linking Syria and Iraq, in addition to another informal approach connecting northernmost Syria with areas controlled by the Kurdistan Democratic Party, led by Masud Barazani.
"The Palestinian people, Lebanon and Syria faced that ferocious campaign with the logic of steadfastness, perseverance, resolve and persistence, and we weathered that stage.
He also attracted attention to a serious matter, namely the insistence that Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazin) and the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state.
"Those who regard Hamas, the Islamic Jihad, resitance factions and Hizbullah as mercenaries of this or that country are making a strategic mistake, for they wrongly think that tightening the screws on those countries and applying a little pressure here and there could end the resistance in Palestine or make the resistance in Lebanon lay its arms or relinquish its duty," he said.
Will the governments of Sharon and Bush, which have crossed the threshold of economic alliance that is based on shared interests into religious alliance, stop at these serious demands?"
Q: Are there possible impacts on the political climate in Morocco in light of Casablanca blasts?
Islamic movements in Morocco don't adopt violence as an ideology, which is assured by the public authorities that hold "Jihad Salafi" trend responsible for the latest bombings.
A: The Islamic trend has nothing to do with Casablanca attacks.
Those people tried to realize their Jihad Salafi ideology on the ground, i.e. they wanted to enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong from their own perspective. They founded so small organizations or groups, which don't come up to the level of organization, like Zakaria Al-Meloudi group dubbed "As-Serat Al-Mustaquim" (Right Path), which is not an organization by any means, or Jihad Salafi-oriented Youssef Fikry group, which has nothing to do with Heresy and Exodus group at all, as the latter is existent in Morocco as an ideology rather than an organization.
A: Such incidents usually bring contradictory calculations.
I think that some leaders of Al-Tawheed wal-Eslah (Monotheism and Reform) rather than Justice and Development have committed political mistakes. At a certain period, the opposition in the party was concerned with the Islamic points of referenciality of the movement.
This means that the exaggeration in promoting a discourse presenting the Justice and Development Party as an Islamic party was not in favour of the leaders of the Monotheism and Reform movement.
STRIKING AT MODERATE ISLAMISTS STRENGTHENS EXTREMISTS
It is no secret that striking at Islamic movements pleases the US Administration, now that those who are after elimination of undesired elements have gained much influence within its ranks, and now that it has come to regard fundamentalism in the Islamic World as its first enemy after the disappearance of the Iraqi regime.
But today the Americans are focusing on "reinforcing the Algeria's democratic development," in such a manner that excludes the Islamists, as much as possible, from future plans, as indicated by the recent statement of the American Ambassador to Algeria, Richard Erdman, before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Any fresh structure that draws on the lessons of Iraq will never rise without reconciliation processes that eliminate the sectarian, ethnic and cultural fragmentation and conflicts that have torn the Arab Maghreb region for so long and lay a foundation for participation by all, excluding no one and making everyone conform to the rules of the democracy game.
The Qatari News Agency indicated that the new law only "determined the goals and functions of the new body and how it would perform its duties."
He also asked that there should be rotation of power between the North and the South during the transitional period.
Garang indicated the possibility of international forces being deployed in the region between SPLA forces and the Sudanese army during the transitional period proposed in the Sudanese peace talks.
Garang asked that the South be given 40% of government offices.
During the press conference held on Tuesday by opposition Democratic National Gathering in central London, he said that the five issues are still pending and have not been reached so far between the two parties; Sudan government and SPLA - the issue of the two armies' prospects, the national capital regarding constitution and laws which govern it, the dispute over power, the resources, the three regions and their prospects: Nubia mountains, Abay and Ankasna.
Chirac's statements came after his meeting with US President George Bush in a closed-door meeting on the sidelines of Evian Summit.
Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir's Advisor for Strategic Planning Ahmed Ali al-Imam said the enforcement of Islamic Shari'a in North Sudan and Khartoum is irrevocable.
The bureau of Al-Ansar Sect Imam Al-Sadek Al-Mahdi, leader of opposition Sudanese Umma Party denied that Cairo declaration, issued following Al-Mahdi - Al-Mirghani - Garang meeting, containing any provision about the capital Khartoum secularism or the cancellation of Islamic Sharia regulations there in order that it might become a national capital.
JORDAN DENIES STATEMENTS OF ITS AMBASSADOR IN WASHINGTON ABOUT ASSISTING ABU MAZIN IN CONFRONTING ISLAMISTS
For its part, the Islamic Action Front party criticized the statement attributed to the Jordanian ambassador regarding it, together with previous statements by Jordanian Foreign Minister, as a departure from the Jordanian policy.

These remarks were made by Al-Saeedi while addressing the ceremony held on Tuesday evening and attended by Premier Atef Ebeid, marking Nissan's chief and executive manager's visit to Egypt.
"We would put plans to control that industry under less strict protectionist measures and export orientations together with covering the demands of the domestic market to serve the national interests of that country," Al-Saeedi concluded.
For his part, Ghosn stressed that his talks with Ebeid were constructive, pointing out his company's desire to expand its auto industry in Egypt with a view to serving local consumption and exporting to overseas markets.
The meeting will be attended by Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Ebeid, and the ministers of industry, public enterprise sector, finance, state for foreign affairs, military production, scientific research, housing, electricity, supply and domestic trade and foreign trade, together with a large number of members of the board of the Federation of Industries, chairman of chambers of industry, business organizations and new cities societies of businessmen and members of the Egyptian-Japanese Business Council.
Auto industry in Egypt is very important as Egypt, over the last ten years, attracted several multinationals who invested in or transferred their high-tech to the country. There are now 14 auto plants in Egypt with available combined capacity of over 250,000 cars, but the currently used capacity is no more than 30 percent, thus affecting product cost and output economics. Therefore, significant steps should be taken to spur and overhaul this industry, mainly including the proposed Egyptian-Japanese auto industrial cooperation program.
Those projects include setting factories for producing porcelain, China, cutlery, ceramics as well as the equipment required for swimming pools in cooperation with the Egyptian-British Company for Ceramics and Sanitary ware.
56% OF NET USERS CAIRENE
The report pointed out that Telecom Egypt is implementing a plan to expand telephone services in the country as the number of the villages, which have exchanges, increased from 775 in October 1999 to 1070 in last April.
The reports demanded that the diversification policy be adopted and that no particular county be increasingly relied upon to meet the needs of the Egyptian market of this strategic commodity, in light of the anticipated steady rise in wheat prices due to the rapid developments witnessed by American and Australian markets.
Experts said that the biggest challenge Egypt was facing was the provision of citizens' needs of wheat as Egypt annually consumes about 12.5 million tons of wheat and imports about 6.5 million tons to the value of $1.2 million.
Egyptian-Canadian Business Council chairman Mo'taz Raslan told Al-Alam Al-Youm that the Council tends to put a new strategy for coordination with the existing business organizations. He also said there are arrangements for a strategic partnership with the American chamber.
It is worth mentioning that the Egyptian-Canadian Business council chose Mo'taz Raslan to take over the council management in the coming period succeeding Mohsen Badawi who tendered his resignation to the council late last week.
Highlighting the possibility of producing genetically modified produce in different states worldwide, the report pointed out that Egypt did not commercially produce genetically modified produce till now. However, tests were made for many crops such as cotton, maize, wheat, lemon and tomato.
EGYPT SEEKS EUROPEAN EXPLANATION FOR ARRANGEMENTS FOR ENTRY OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED PRODUCTS INTO EU MARKETS
It is common knowledge that Egypt produces a set of agricultural products including oil seeds, vegetables, and some fruits through genetic engineering.
Ghali will also demand immediate consultation on the decision issued by the EU recently to deny the Egyptian potatoes access to the markets over a limited number of brown rot cases, which Egypt sees as an unjustified measure from the European Agricultural Quarantine authorities.
The discussions will also cover the steps taken recently by Europe to deregulate trade of agricultural commodities and what was agreed upon by the different parties taking part in Sharm El-Sheikh meeting in this respect.
EGYPT BROACHES ECONOMIC COOPERATION WITH EUROPE IN BALERMO MEETING
Egypt is trying to be acquainted with the reasons for the European Union admitting some genetically engineered products while rejecting others according to criteria that need explanation as such products could be produced and exported in big amounts.
Ghali is trying to finish the procedures required for Egypt's inclusion in the list of countries allowed to export to the European Union fish, poultry and dairy products.
The Egyptian-British Business Council will convene in the British capital of London on Monday (July 7th) to thrash out how to rope in more British investments to Egypt, especially small and medium-sized projects, a blueprint by the government and the private sector to remove investment impediments facing foreign investors, and an Egyptian-British business to fund and bail out insolvent companies, particularly travel agents.
At the meeting on Monday, the council's Egyptian and British members will mull over an Egyptian-British concern to resource and save faltering eneterprises, especially mega tourist projects on the Red Sea and South Sinai coasts, which stopped activities owing to lack of money, he said. The new business is to run and fund these insolvent projects through banks and national and foreign financial institutions.
OFFSET AGREEMENT WITH AUSTRALIA
It is worth mentioning that the Ministry of Supply seeks to organize trade offset with six countries, namely Russia, India, Ukraine, Pakistan, Australia and Sudan as the Sudanese meat will be exchanged for Egyptian goods such as medicines, medical products and rice.
As local output has shot down to 50,000 tons only, Egypt is predicted to export more beans, they said, forecasting that Egyptian importers would contract to bring in around 1 billion US dollars' worth of over 700,000 tons so as to answer the domestic market's needs.
This year's waning beans output is due to poor beans breeds and unfitness of beans farmland, he said.
Through entering the South African market, exporters could, consequently, get access to Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland, which are connected to South Africa with a customs union, it said, pointing out promising future to boost Egyptian exports if there is a serious intention to set up a free trade zone between the two countries.
AN AGREEMENT TO EXPORT EGYPTIAN PRODUCTS TO SUDAN IN RETURN FOR MEAT IMPORTS
Further more, a contract to set up an investment joint project in Sudan will be signed to provide cement at investments estimated at about $180 million to provide the needs of building and construction in Sudan and to be exported to African neighbouring markets.
A delegation of Iraqi businessmen held talks with 16 Egyptian businessmen on investment chances and reconstruction operations in Iraq.
The meeting between the Egyptian and Iraqi businessmen probed potential cooperation and the importance of opening the Iraqi market before the Egyptian investments and trade in light of Iraq's need to investment and trade in all fields, Bayyoumi said.
He pointed out that the fields tackled on a basis of the Iraqi investors' need included the sectors of oil, hotels, foodstuff industries, banking and mobile phone services, building materials, china ware, cars, feeding industries, transport equipment, tires, garments, textiles, construction, pharmaceutical and detergent industries, household appliances and air conditioners.
In construction sector, for example, the Arab building and construction institutions are capable of rendering competitive services let alone that several Arab institutions that produce building materials are nearer and more capable of reaching the Iraqi market. Some of these institutions exist there like Ceramica Cleopatra Group that can help immediately in Iraqi reconstruction operations.
A report recently submitted by the office to Al-Said Qassim, head of the Commercial Representation Office, said that that plan aims at informing Egyptian exporting companies of the opportunities available in Indian market.
The remarks were made by the advisor at a symposium held at the Egyptian-French Businessmen Association on Egypt's trade strategy for the African continent.
Until 2001, Egypt-Africa trade exchange hit around 560 million U.S. dollars, including 345 million U.S. dollars' worth of Egyptian exports.
Egypt's Africa blueprint is based on penetration into the continent through three divergent geographical areas notably, west, east and south, and development of infrastructure for a greater presence in Africa.
ECONOMIC INDICES IMPROVE
Total Egyptian exports to foreign markets amounted to 8.9 billion pounds during last January and March against 5.3 billion pounds during the same period of 2002. Imports, however, went up to 15 billion pounds against 13.3 billion pounds during the same period last year, the IDSC report said. As for the credit facilities extended by banks other than the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE), the report stated that until the end of last March they hiked to 281.6 billion pounds against 262.4 billion pounds in the previous month.
NEW WAVE OF HIGH PRICES
The price per ton hit 12,000 pounds against 9,000 pounds late last December, they added, emphasizing that that would have a negative effect that would lead to increasing the prices of cloth and ready-made garments to more than 60% by the end of the current year.
As regards consumer prices, the report pointed out that furniture, detergents and service prices recorded a 4.7% increase in cities and a 5.9% increase in villages in the same period, while cloth and garments increased by 1.2% in cities and 9% in villages.

LOANS, GRANTS TO EGYPT DURING 10 YEARS WORTH $20 BILLION
The report hailed the volume of American aid granted to Egypt in 2002 hitting 655 million dollars against 615 million dollars in 2003. There are three financing programs with European Union (EU), including the program of backing and developing the private sector at a value of 45 million euros and the program for modernizing industry, 250 million euros.
These rates are low and need to increase to 18% and 22% in order to bridge the gap, the report added.
He noted that business facilities that accept visa cards in transactions hit 19069 facilities up 7%. The value of expenditure by Visa card hit $1.01 billion. 6 million dealings have been carried out including 3.2 million at retail outlets, something that helped increase retail sales in Egypt.
Al-Husseini attributed the low number of Visa cards to lack of awareness and understanding on the part of consumer and merchant as they prefer dealing in cash.
Cairo Far East Bank board chairman Mona Yassin said that a number of Arab investors were considering buying the bank whose paid capital amounted to LE76 million.
Putting up the bank for sale comes within the framework of a plan of the state to sell its shares in a number of joint banks, especially Misr American International, International Islamic Bank for Investment and Development, Commerce and Development Bank (Al-Tigareyoun) and Misr Iran Development Bank.
She added that the bank new administration started to prepare a comprehensive development plan, especially at the level of internal control, client services and banking systems. Such a step will help groom the bank for sale and provide it with a reasonable degree of banking services equivalent to those available at other banks.
Mohamed Al-Deeb, chairman of NSGB - a contributor to the company - revealed that it is expected to obtain the authority's approval of the company's services by next September.

EGYPT'S OIL EXPORTS COME DOWN
It imports palm oil from Malaysia, Indonesia and Kenya, sunflower oil from Argentine, the USA, Ukraine and European countries and cotton oil from Brazil, Argentine, Spain and the USA.
Egypt's exports shot up to 35.2 million US dollars from 9.4 million US dollars. Non-oil exports surged up to 13.6 million US dollars from 9.3 million US dollars in the corresponding period of 2002, he said. Oil exports recorded 21.6 million US dollars.
Egypt was preceded by several developing countries in the development area, which included health, education and income levels, the report said.
Illiteracy is still high at 44 percent; over 56 percent among women, it said.
Efforts should be exerted in order to alleviate sufferings at the economic level. The present-day economic deflation has been triggered by the 1997 Luxor terrorist massacre, the September 11th events and lastly the Iraq war.
Both employees and workers get 157 days off every year after applying the weekly two-day holiday system.
The study conducted by a working team led by economic researcher Dr. Abdel-Khaleq Farouq showed some anomalies.
In the same period the government organizational structures were largely expanded and new organizations were created as the number of sectors hiked from less than 500 to over 2500 on the level of state administrative body, thus increasing the number of general and central administrations to more than 15500 and the sub-administrations to some 75 thousand.
The study uncovered for the first time the volume of the governmental body operation costs, which includes pay, salaries and commodity and service requirements as well as the government's investment uses.
Concerning in-kind resources, the governmental resources include:
Using microfilms also surged up during the 1980s and 1990s.
The costs of these cars hit about 4900 million pounds, while their operation costs exceeded 400 million pounds per annum.
This is so evident in women in particular.
In South Korea, for instance, the worker works for 50 hours a week.
Raising pay in the government is carried out apart from increasing productivity, he said, stressing that the pay increase rate should by no means exceed the rate of productivity increase in order to create a real rise in the standard of living.
Seven years elapsed after this famous summit, which was urged by major world powers to stop violence and terrorism in the Palestinian territories. Violence, however, did not stop in Palestine, but even increased and extended to include all the Palestinian territories and all factions after it was restricted to some areas and certain groups.
The Pentagon hawks, in turn, tried to justify the utter failure to counter terrorism, which reached the US itself, by putting the blame on the Arab allies.
This, in turn, confirmed the US accusations of previous negligence and remissness.
The Arab governments have not practised yet the Israeli methods of mass punishment, siege, and demolition of houses. However, Israel, in turn, does not muzzle opinions or suppress individual freedoms and freedom of organisation.
The number of the regime's victims including those who were killed and arrested is more than the total number of the victims of the Arab regimes put together.
The mother Muslim Brotherhood Movement in Egypt and its branches in Arab countries such as Syria have witnessed political violence incidents for long, but in the end it rejected such violence and focussed on peaceful political action though it was exposed to continuous violence from hostile political forces that took the State agencies as a shield and started to practise political terrorism through them.
The mixture between the political conflict with foes who have legitimate right to run in the political competition and the illegitimate rejection of terrorism is not a monopoly of our judicious Arab governments, but also echoes the tendencies of the large partner in the war on terror, which is the US.
However, there are still enclaves of this phenomenon that can not be eliminated.
What we are witnessing now is unfortunately serious measures to confront the phenomenon of terrorism or even the settlement of old scores under the cover of fighting terrorism.
This means that there are two factors that justified the launching of this project; the first is related to the national security strategy; the second is the war of liberating Iraq.
The partnership, in its apparent form, seems to be an economic one, but it has political dimensions in as much as it is related to Israel, let alone the USA. The project aims at normalizing "economic-political" relations with Israel and the U.S. necessarily through exchanging systems that will result in political stances succumbing to the American-Israeli demands, as Israel wants to break up the Palestinian resistance inside Palestine and disband the Palestinian anti-Israeli organizations that are dispersed in a number of Arab countries including Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. It also wants to disband Hizbullah in Lebanon as a resistance force threatening the security of Israel from outside and looks forward to having the new Iraqi political regime entered into the Arab-Israeli peace march.
The main values that are consecrated by this project are market economy values where the interest will be the referentiality according to the U.S. pragmatic values, Torah's values and the partisan rightist extremism which dominates the Sharonite discourse in Israel where they bet on it while mocking the Arab culture and society whether in Palestine or in other Arab countries.
Optional projects However, the Arab countries that are included in the partnership project have plenty of time. President Bush set a ceiling of ten years to have the project implemented. Both of the U.S., the project sponsor, and Israel - the biggest beneficiary -, have two optional projects:
ISRAEL GRIPPED BY HORROR
Meanwhile, Ezz Eddin al-Qassam Brigades fired 12 Qassam 2 rockets at Jewish settlements and Israeli cities within the Green Line, sending Israelis into horror and panic.
Ismail Abu Shanab, a Hamas leader, said such statements would support Sharon in his war on the Palestinian resistance and lead to more escalation that could jeopardize the Middle East peace process.
The plan also provides for targeting Hamas leading figures to compel them to stop their "terrorist" activity or to hide in anticipation of being liquidated.
High-ranking political sources in Tel Aviv ruled out that the international quartet meeting, which would be held in the Jordanian capital of Amman late coming week, would manage to stop the bloodshed. They also cast doubt on the ability of the U.S. coordinators led by John Wolf who is expected to reach the region on Sunday to put the (roadmap) into effect.
JEWS RETURNING TO BAGHDAD FOR FIRST TIME IN HALF A CENTURY
The Jews bought real estate in Palestine Street in Baghdad at double the ordinary prices, which caused a rapid rise in real estate prices in Baghdad.
Gaddafi pointed out that the cancellation of the public sector included petroleum on which Libya's wealth is based. It should , therefore, be property of the society and should be run by companies which are not state-owned. However, those companies' owners will not have to run the companies themselves as they may task any foreign expert to run them to ensure the development of oil industry including prospecting, production and marketing operations.
Half the old members of the board failed to attend the meetings held yesterday (June 12th).
Ibrahim announced setting up an international advisory committee for Ibn Khaldon Center including outstanding international personalities, the majority of whom had adopted views in support of the movement during the trial he underwent in the last three years including representatives from Amnesty International; Human Rights, Watch and others.
6.2 POUNDS DAILY PER CAPITA QUOTA IN NEW BUDGET
Ebeid pinpointed that subsidy amounted to 12 billion pounds, serving 70 million citizens.
The indictment of the lawsuit filed by lawyer Nabih Al-Wahsh was based on the fact that Welch had become ambassador of two countries rather than one country, in contravention to international laws and conventions. He added that Welch's attitudes had made him seem to be Israel's ambassador to Egypt, besides being the head of the American diplomatic mission.
The lawyer went on, "I truly and without prevarication, flattery or even political diplomacy tell you that your rudeness had recently exceeded all limits by your intervention in my country's internal affairs, once through spying on us, especially in Upper Egypt under the allegation of getting acquainted with poor classes in Assiut for instance in a bid to offer assistance through dubious societies and again by poking your nose and demanding that Al-Azhar curricula be amended to obscure and transform our religious identity and even by asking Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh to give religious opinion tailored to serve your own mean schemes and achieve your dirty purposes.
Egyptian companies turned down a U.S. Department of Defense recommendation that Egyptian and Jordanian businesses should join Israeli companies in their Iraq reconstruction tenders.
But, his company turned them down, and asked for an Egyptian-Arab partnership, keeping Israel away. A plan is underway to hammer out reconstruction subcontracts with Jordanian contractors, the unidentified contractor said.
He was supposed to serve an 8-year prison term.
In the meetings, he also emphasized that America's credibility would be undermined in the region as a result of the U.S. administration's double standard policy, and its failure to recognize the repercussions of issues like the Arab-Israeli conflict on democracy in the region, he said.
IKHWAN, HEZBOLLAH PROD PEOPLE INTO BACKING PALESTINIAN RESISTANCE

GAMAL MUBARAK IN WASHINGTON ON JUNE 26th
Gamal Mubarak's vistit to Washington this month is considered the second visit paid by the President's son to the American capital.
NDP POLICY SECRETARIAT TO STUDY PRIVATE SECTOR'S PARTICIPATION IN EDUCATION
ADDICTS SPENT 7 TIMES AS MUCH AS SUEZ CANAL REVENUES
A religious controversy has been raised recently in Egypt regarding the excessive spread of statues in the squares of Cairo. The last of these projects are Naguib Mahfouz's statue in Sphinx Square, Al-Mohandesin area, late Taha Hussein's statue in Al-Jalaa (Evacuation) Square, Giza, late Abbas Mahmoud Al-Aqaad's statue, whose place was not determined yet and Ahmed Zweil's statue, whose place was not determined either. It is worth mentioning that Ahmed Zweil has two statues; one in his birthplace, Damanhour city and the other in Alexandria University. Many members of the Islamic Research Academy (IRA) objected to that phenomenon and considered it as encroaching upon the Islamic creed.
According to the sources, the Islamic Group decided to cancel teaching the most important of its books and curricula which used to be the primary cause of incitement of armed orientation inside the community to face the state, its ruling regime and its security bodies. Such a step constitutes an ideological and organizational coup inside the group.
Ismail pointed out that everybody hoped that the successive attempts made by the Islamic Group to convince public opinion of the credibility of its political change would reach solid ground and would not find out that it had lost its entity and Islamic advocacy status.
The Copts' card has always been manipulated for intervening in Egypt's internal affairs since Egypt was invaded by foreign colonizers (the French, the British and recently the Americans) under the pretext of protecting the Coptic minority from persecution which is alleged even though that was partly right in previous ages. American imperialism is still playing on this card through Christian and political individuals and groups, as well as sectarian newspapers under the pretext of defending the Copts' rights by citing past epochs of persecution of the Copts and projecting them on the present stage with a view to proving that there are violations of human rights and absence of democracy to the end of those slogans promoted by America to serve its purposes through interference in countries' affairs. Nor will Iraq be the last of such examples under the pretext of spreading democracy the American way in the region.
Will a sectarian division (an imperialist game) work out or turn out to be like what happened in Lebanon which ensued from practices and a reality that relied on the sectarian structure? Has such a sectarian division worked out?
I don't think so because the Egyptians are one integrated mixture.
Let alone the Freedom House group who were granted its prize in return for forged reports about alleged persecution of Copts, not to mention either the so-called religious minorities rights activists who coordinate with the American High Commissioner in implementation of the law on religious persecution by the American Congress which is the current law maker not only in America but in the whole world as well.
Now what does Khalil, the Americanized sectarian say?
More strangely even, he wanted to confine the Coptic history to the Orthodox Christian whether inside or outside Egypt as if that history was a preserve for one category of the Egyptian people to the exclusion of all other categories!
I'd like here to cite an argument by Dr. Ne'mat Ahmed Fouad, a Muslim Egyptian female, "We're Egyptians before and after religions and will remain Egyptians for ever." Magdy Khalil then deals with historical eras when Copts were subjected to persecution trying to project that on the present reality.
The evidence is quite clear when we know that 30% of Egypt's economy is possessed by Copts some of whom are consequently in control of sovereign decisions.
He argues that due to that nationalist feeling, the Christians in America did not join the Intelligence bodies in return for abandoning the Egyptian nationality branding only Muslim immigrants of that charge for which we feel obliged to thank him as he clearly showed American racist democracy that recruit American citizens in return for their relinquishing their original nationalities. However, he failed to mention the real reason which lies in America's treatment of all Muslims after the September incidents.
What would then be the reactions of the Egyptians to such intervention? Whether through the Muslims feeling of American tyranny and repression against them and in favour of the Copts or the Christians' feeling of aggrandizement and acceptance of American intervention?
Egyptian Wafdite MP Mohamed Abdel Alim asked the Ministry of Petroleum to immediately square up to Israeli attempts to prospect for oil in " Umm Rishrash" city, the Egyptian name for the Israeli port of Ielat, on the Egyptian-Palestinian frontiers and compel Israel to back off.
The Muslim Brotherhood group escalated its media drive against the Egyptian government and chose this time the US-Egyptian official relations as the topic of criticism.
However, he launched a diatribe against Sharm El-Sheikh and Aqaba peace summits, calling on peoples to intensify pressure on rulers to push them into reform.
He also called for reordering the collective Arab order through adopting an Arab-Muslim policy and rendering effective common defense agreements and economic unity, saying, "If peoples have declared on more than one occasion their bias towards the Iraqi and Palestinian causes and all Islamic issues and contributed a lot to these causes, they should exercise great pressure on rulers to push them into reform of policies".
In fact, if we review the influence of this chamber, we will find out that Mohamed Mansour or Mansour Chevrolet, his nickname in trade circles, did not mention that a big number of this chamber's members are concentrated in the NDP Policy Committee headed by Gamal Mubarak.
To show the influence of the chamber, Mansour said that the chamber members met a number of senior officials in Egypt prior to visiting Washington - Premier Dr. Atef Ebeid, Presidential Political Advisor, Osama Al-Baz, Minsiter of the Interior, Habib Al-Adli.
PALESTINIANS VISIT AUSCHWITZ TO UNDERSTAND JEWRY'S PAINS!

In his Friday sermon in the Sunni mosque of Abu-Hanifa Al-No'man in Baghdad, Sheikh Mo'ayed Al-A'zami said, "Muslim peoples are entitled to proclaim jihad to restore their usurped rights and to ward off the evil threatening them."
HASHISH, HEROIN, OPIUM SOLD PUBLICLY IN IRAQ
However, the downfall of Baghdad, led to the spread of anarchy and lack of control made such capsules spread in Iraq at cheap prices. It seems that the addicts preferred to try other new commodities that started to reach Iraq from all over the world which synchronized with an economic open-door policy imposed by the U.S. occupation. They tended to try different kinds of drugs. It might be mentioned that according to the Iraqi law, a life sentence used to be meted out to anybody who possesses or takes any kind of drugs.
Some Iraqi youth alcoholics mostly think in the spectre of drugs. Social experts warn against the spread of such phenomenon, which might be accompanied with thefts to a large extent, as when the addicts have no money to buy them at high prices they will resort to stealing. In addition, such drugs may cause an endless series of crimes, they said.
On the other hand and in an unexpected surprise which the U.S. strategy planners in Iraq and in the region paid partial heed to, political Islam emerged in Iraq with different organizations that could fill such political vacuum. However, the deteriorating and complicated situation in addition to the nature of the occupation and its desire to reset the Iraqi house in order according to its (the occupier) oil, political and strategic interests temporarily impeded the movement of the up-and-coming political Islam organizations in Iraq to attain their goals and fill the terrible political vacuum ensuing from ousting a despotic regime that used to antagonize all trends especially such Islamic ones.
1. Concerning the map of Islamic organizations in post-Saddam Iraq: facts and history reveal that the roots of the Islamic organizations in Iraq date back to almost hundred years ago. The most outstanding organizations in terms of influence and number were the Shiite ones, who fought against the foreign occupier (they revolted against the British occupation). It is worth mentioning that the Shiites represent 60% of the population or about 15 millions. The situation in post-Saddam Iraq, however, shows a new Islamic mosaic, so to speak, and reveals how numerous such political Islam organizations are and how complicated their future is.
Islamic Turkman Union 4. Kurdish Islamic Organization Movement 5.
Referential Message Movement, Mr. Alaa Al Te'ma 10.
Islamic Kurdish League, led by Dr. Ali Al-Koradghi 15.
Islamic Group in Kurdistan, led by Ali Abdel-Aziz 19.
Ansar Al-Islam (Supporters of Islam) in Kurdistan, led by Mullah Karikar with Abu-Abdullah Al-Shafei as spokesman 23.
Islamic Reconciliation Movement, Jamal Al-Wakil 27.
Besides, if we add to this the desire of some organizations and trends to be independent from each other despite their gathering frames (Shiite, Kurdish, and Sunni), this may illuminate part of the picture and explain this diversity. However, we think that the political ambition of many of such organizations and their desire to participate in ruling the country may be out of question unless they vehemently announce their presence. The demonstrations that preceded and synchronized with the celebrations of Arba'iniyat Imam Al-Hussein (a celebration by the Shiites commemorating the elapse of forty days after the date of the death of Imam Al-Hussein ibn Ali, grandson of Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him) may emphasize this fact. If we know that some of those organizations have a regional connection, the reasons for such diversification may be more elucidated.
Noticeably enough, some of them have started to change to be on effective link in the resistance front against the U.S. presence in the region extending from Iran to Hezbollah in Lebanon passing through Syria and South Iraq.
Oilfields and Hauza The Iraqi future will then witness, in our estimate, complicated and growing conflict in which regional and even international circles will get involved. This conflict will be over the oilfields and the Hauza, which is the religious and political shelter of the Iraqi Shiites. It will even include the Iraqis in their entirety as was shown by the demonstrations staged from Baghdad Sunni mosques.
Merger and disappearance We expect that some small organizations may merge or disappear from the two Shiite and Sunni parties and even in Kurdish territories. The largest and oldest organizations are expected, in turn, to continue and expand in Iraq, which lives a critical moment full of anxiety and conflict that may change into militant action within less than a year due to the current situation.
Islamic Action Front, the political umbrella of Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood group, alluded to withdrawal from the parliamentary elections scheduled in 17th June instant in protest against the government's violations that hinder the electoral process and challenge its fairness.
This, he added, coincided with summoning some of the dignitaries of administrative rulers and security bodies from different cities and towns to warn them against electing Islamist candidates. "Rather, they instructed them to elect other candidates. This is considered a clear-cut bias against the front's candidates."
"The government strictly instructed its bodies and employees to commit themselves to neutrality and not to interfere in favour of any of the candidates, otherwise they would be subjected to legal accountability," he confirmed, denying that any candidate who obtained electoral lists from the Ministry of the Interior which is supervising the elections. "Arousing such a matter forms an attempt by some bodies to put the government under continuous pressure," he reiterated.
He said the export process needs an integrated system and creating new markets abroad to accommodate production.

Firstly, participating in specialized international exhibits in Holland and Europe, foremost of which is the Rotterdam-based international annual flower exhibit, Hortifair. These exhibits help exporters to get acquainted with the situation and conditions of the Dutch and the European markets, meet all those who are interested in this trade and furnish the Egyptian exporter with information about the needs of the European market where kind, quality and price are concerned.
For his part, head of Commercial Representation Body, Al-Said Qassim said that exporting flowers to the EU takes place either through sending them to stock exchanges specialized in flower trade or by selling them directly to importers. Stock exchange system is appropriate for the companies that export huge amounts of flowers like the Kenyan exporters to the Dutch market, while exporting to European or Dutch importer suits exporters who export relatively small amounts.

Wrong perception of Islam continues to exist. The responsibility for this wrong understanding of the religion lies on the clergy and intellectuals.
That is how the Lord their God orders them, and the Torah does not accept from the conquered people an alternative to putting the sword to them, like adopting Judaism or paying tribute etc. Q: What does Islamic Sharia say on the same point?
These six peoples should be eliminated to a man, without being invited to adopt Judaism or asked to pay tribute, and without any peace treaty or armistice agreement being concluded with them. There is nothing for these poor people but the sword, death and total destruction, for not guilt on their side other than inhabiting the Promised Land before the Jews. Torah interpreters explain this text by saying "How could a merciful God order the annihilation of all these populated centers?
A: They have been applied in full. Total genocide that eliminated the peoples of that area, the Promised Land, has actually taken place. And do not rule out what the Christian Europeans did when they set foot on North America, for they annihilated the original people, the Red Indians.

Kuwaiti Islamic trend will run the National Assembly (parliament) elections with 45 candidates, 20 of whom have good opportunities to win.
To this should probably be added the fact that the power of the Islamist candidates in many constituencies is no longer be stemmed from their belongingness to a certain group or due to the adoption of a certain political programme. Rather, it is attributed to the personal abilities of the candidate and his belongingness to a tribe or a family or even to the circumstances of the constituency.
There is no coordination, nevertheless, among Islamists in 15 constituencies, as they are competing with each other, something that makes them lose many parliamentary seats.
First: The Islamic Constitutional Movement, the biggest Kuwaiti Islamic movement. It represents the Muslim Brotherhood Group (Ikhwan) trend.
This group has been suffering for many years from retreat, especially after many members have dissented and formed other rival groups.
Third: The Salafi Movement, which dissented from the traditional Salafi trend in 1996 among a batch of dissents witnessed by this trend. It started by teachers and students at the Faculty of Sharia, Kuwait University. The first deputy of the Salafi Movement was Dr. Walid Al-Tabatabai in 1996. It fields or supports six candidates in the current elections and hopes to win two extra seats.

On the other hand, the Baath Party left Muqtada Al-Sadr, gallant men of Faluja and resistance of Ali Hassan Al-Majid.
The Khomeinite rule lasted for 24 years while the Baathist one took 35 years.
In the U.S., this will redeem those who argued that Iran should be prioritized: they are a lobby including some people adamantly faithful to Israel, some conservatives who prefer old despotic regimes to military autocracy, and some others who discriminate between Arab and non-Arab Muslims - they take sides on the latter.

Under the above headline, Hassan Hardan of Al-Hayat writes an article that runs to the following effect: Now that over a month has passed since it was officially announced that the American-British forces had occupied Iraq, it does not seem that matters have taken the course planned by the Pentagon generals in Washington.
Such failure and embarrassment on the part of the American policy in running Iraq have become apparent in the failure to make progress at the level of filling in administrative and security vacuum following unseating the regime. Hardly had the temporary transitional administration appointed by Washington completed a month when the new administration took over after Garner failed to secure an Iraqi cover for the American occupation even though he had held two opposition conferences in Nassiryah and Baghdad.
Add to all that the brutalities committed by American occupation forces against the Iraqis ranging from clampdowns, detentions, random shooting, violating sanctities, disrespecting the Iraqi people's traditions, activities and leaderships.
- The availability of Iraqi cadres and capacities that constitute an important prerequisite for the development of any resistance against occupation.

REGION SCRAMBLING INTO VIOLENCE
In Iran, protests dominate Tehran and some Iranian universities in many a city. Bloody clashes took place between the protesters and the security forces. Some speak about other larger scale demonstrations. The Iranian government accuses the U.S. of instigating such protests to destabilize the regime as a prelude to launching aggression on it under the pretext of sheltering terrorism and Al-Qaeda Network and interfering in the Iraqi affair.
In a nutshell, we can refer to the bloody abortive coup in Mauritania, Riyadh, Casablanca and Mecca blasts, and the disturbances that took place in Ra's al Khaymah sheikhdom after deposing its crown prince and installing his brother instead.

The reality on the ground has uncovered genuine obstacles that were simply unthinkable and have, therefore, surprised the White House leaders.

So far, the new administration under Bremer has fared no better than its predecessor. The new administrator has failed to find Iraqi facades to run Iraq's affairs, together with the occupation authority. He had to put off holding the Iraqi National Congress sine die and decided to nominate an advisory council to assist him in ruling Iraq instead of forming a government following Washington's failure to find an Iraqi Karzai!
Since it was officially announced that Iraq had been occupied, hardly a day passes without some military operations against the American forces claiming deaths and casualties in their ranks.

However, he desired to be a bodyguard to Numeiri when the latter applied sharia.
Nevertheless, he said the hindrances facing the peace process cannot end up talks and peace endeavours, emphasizing his government's keenness to put an end to war, effect peace and achieve unity obediently.

However, that debate was settled by the republican decree stipulating the CBE affiliation to the President.
In the two cases the matter is up to the government not to the CBE governor. There are banking leaders like Dr. Ali Negm, head of Delta International Bank, who don't see the current change as a comprehensive one. Dr. Negm stressed the necessity to pay attention to a main point, which is making up for the sharp shortage in the existing cadres in banks now that cadres left the CBE to work for private banks. Therefore, he added, the change should include the human structure in banks.
Deputy general manager of the Arab Bank Ahmed Youssef said the issue of change in bank leaderships was blown out of proportion owing to the fact that the market is ready to receive the new banking legislation and the nature of change, which is characterized by conservatism inside banks. This may give an impression that such a change is an exceptional one that deserves a so much contemplation, which is the reverse of common practice in other countries to the contrary of the nature of changes that should be introduced to bodies other than the banking system.
This synchronizes with the plan currently implemented by the Ministry of Supply and Domestic Trade with a view to courting international investments in domestic trade sector along with expanding in setting up hypermarkets and attracting multinational companies to work in Egypt.
He pointed out that investment in Egypt is a very logical step because of encouraging economic environment, adding that as Al-Fatim is a major group it is important to maintain presence in the biggest Arab market and play a key role in the growing cooperation between Egypt and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
Al-Fatim and Carrefour groups would not repeat errors committed before by other groups, he noted, revealing that the commercial centers of the two groups will adopt a new mechanism to square up to the stagnation undergone by Egyptian markets and will offer national and imported products at reasonable prices.
The proposal includes developing the labs of food exports quality control in general and farm produce in particular so as to meet plant health agreement conditions.
Both parties agreed that the UNIDO would allocate the budget of that project through the second credit portion of Italian loans initiative to Egypt that is being run by the UNIDO office in Cairo.
In their requests to Ebeid, MPs Mohamed Khalil Quweita, Mohamed Al-Badrashini and Kamal Ahmed underlined the necessity of considering the link between the schemes of such banks and the involvement of some exchange firm owners in speculating in the dollar, especially those who are put in custody pending investigations into other similar cases.

The black market's quota of foreign currency do not exceed 20% of the available liquidity while the remaining quota is obtained by banks, he said pointing out that it is not in favor of banks to waive their quota to mediators and speculators.

The American senior official in Iraq is well dressed as usual and keen on his good looks and insists on wearing jackets and neckties even at the scorching temperature of Iraqi summer. A few days ago, he visited Beni Hassan clans, Arab Shiite clans spreading in Central Euphrates district from Al Hillah to Babylon and Najaf.
The reply to such an offer did surprise him, however. The clan chief told him politely and diplomatically that his demand was rather difficult to meet!
He went on saying, "The only chance left to you in order to meet your demand is to let us marry girls or women from your family."
Protests against the state of lawlessness and absence of stability and order are also a kind of resistance.
Regarded as a precedent in international relations, war was waged against Iraq without UN Security Council's consent, thus making the case liable to power politics.
The question is now: what then?
However, an end to that tragedy is not likely in the foreseeable future.
Forefront among the countries to be subverted is Pakistan as it is a nuclear country, Iran, then Indonesia and Malaysia, which are all countries targeted by Israel on a daily basis taking advantage in that of its long honeymoon with the USA. How may Israel contain Pakistan? Many of such containment aspects are quite obvious.
The third and more serious aspect, the results of which have become apparent, is the elimination of the traits of the Pakistani traditional approach to religion and the state. We would not exaggerate, therefore, if we said that Israel and the USA had thought for long about how Pakistan would be radically penetrated after they had guaranteed President Pervez Musharraf's total cooperation and ability to curb any Islamic opposition to his policies, which he managed to do during the American campaign on Afghanistan. He knew the limits of both cause and effect and offered the Pakistani people what he regarded as the best option for Pakistani supreme interests, which no body outside Pakistan can ignore. I don't think that by writing these lines I'm interfering in what is regarded as a purely Pakistani affair, but I just want to monitor threats or augurs and anticipate what would hardly need smartness so that we may predict what would become of the major causes in the Islamic world through the organized targeting of different parts of the world, crunching it piecemeal while everybody thinks that flexibility and discretion are the best part of valour and that the flood should by all means be avoided, little knowing that they by so doing are just throwing themselves into the flood of the Pakistani containment plan due to what that country represents regarding the Islamic world. Israel's wish to deprive that world of its Islamic bomb has urged it to finally concentrate on picking the fruits of its continuing policy against the major Islamic countries which simply have withdrawn into themselves busying themselves with issues that hardly yield any real good to their own peoples.
Israel has five goals in Pakistan: firstly; destabilizing the Islamic world backing the Palestinian cause after Israel managed to neutralize the Arab world. Secondly; setting up a Pakistani-Israeli,-Indian,-American alliance on a common base in the service of an enormous margin of new interests which are mostly American, Israeli and then Indian, which is containing the Kashmiri cause, taming and developing the Pakistani society just like the plans set for developing the Arab world.
Israel has done very well in that regard, while Iran has become alone in the field, which is very much unlike its experience during the Iranian-Iraqi war when it held ground and repelled the Iraqi aggression for 8 years.
Targeting Pakistan is part of a big scheme to target the Islamic and Arab worlds, resolve the Pakistani cause in the way most satisfactory to Israel.
There should be no comparison between gains and losses when the Israeli-Pakistani relations are examined as everybody would lose then so long as Israel could look, further, to the Islamic world with a view, on one hand, to undoing the ties between the Islamic world and the Arab world, which started after Israel was established, and, on the other hand, to deprive the Arab world of its attitudes and causes in the face of Israel and finally to besiege the Arab world in one of its most important security circles, the Islamic one, rather than let the Arab world act for cementing that security.
Some people may agree: does Israel need such diplomatic relations to implement its scheme given the tools of action in Pakistan through the USA?
The US military commanders are seeking to expand their presence in these countries through fresh basing and military exercise deals aiming to fight against a growing terrorist threat there, it said.
Around 1,800 US soldiers have been stationed in Djibouti since 2002 as part of the anti-terror US campaign in the Horn of Africa, the New York Times said.
Egypt thinks that what Israel has done so far regarding the implementation of the "road map" cannot be sufficient and cannot prove that Ariel Sharon's government responds adequately to the big turn in the Palestinian position.
The Egyptian source showed great indignation about the Israeli stance, regarding it as prejudicing the Egyptian leadership which made great efforts to achieve the truce agreement and persuade the Palestinians of all groups to abide by it.

CONSPIRACY HAUNTS SUDAN!
Interviewed by the Egyptian daily Al-Ahram, Dr. Rick Kai Cok, chairman of the Coordination Council for Southern States under the Sudanese government, who also chairs a new southern bloc, said Col. John Garang, leader of the so-called the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) manipulates the issue just to gain personal benefits and does not represent the south. He could deceive many people by pretending to be a Sudan unity advocate, while he actually acts against unity in the Sudan. He has recently enacted 38 new separation-spurring laws to establish an independent southern state with him to act as its president in a bid to notch up personal ambitions, involving all sovereign and local areas necessary for a viable state such as a passport department, a central bank, criminal and civilian legislation, armed forces, police, diplomatic relations and whatnot, he said.
It also wants John Garang, the head of the south government, to be Sudan's vice-president, granting him the right to poke his nose into the country's policies and affairs.
AN EGYPTIAN CLAIMS TO KNOW SADDAM'S WHEREABOUTS!
NEW CRISIS BETWEEN AL-AZHAR AND MINISTRY OF CULTURE
Deputy head of the Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs Dr Abdel-Sabbour Marzouq held several consultations with Islamic Research Academy members and a number of thinkers, including Dr Mohamed Omara, Dr Ahmed Kamal Abul-Magd, Dr Mostafa Al-Shak'ah and counselor Tarek Al-Beshri, with the aim of forming a front reply to the lies of the participants forefront of whom are Ahmed Abdel-Mo'ti Hegazi, Gamal Al-Banaa, Syrian poet Adonis, Dr Hassan Hanafi and Dr Haider Ibrahim, professor of philosophy in Khartoum University.
"The focus will be on the traditional crafts that can be exported. This requires developing the final product to be able to compete and considering availing ourselves of foreign grants to help finance the establishment of the proposed city," he said.
Egyptian economy has been stagnant for more than three years. Both internal and external circumstances have been biased against it and are about to throttle it to death.
The market in Egypt is backward and suffers from countless weak points as active capitalists don't really exist. Businessmen on the Egyptian market are completely different from businessmen in capitalist countries.
He said the role of planning in bringing about social changes had been limited since the start of the sixties. Its limitedness increased with the open door policy.
Dr Ibtissam Al-Jaafarawi, expert with the Egyptian National Center for Sociological and Criminological Research said, "Lack of organized planning pushing forward the social change process affected the employment of labour as well. With the transfer to state administration, economic planning and the start of Egyptianizing foreigners' property and nationalization which targeted national capitalism, the state bureaucratic class was formed and the capitalist class and the private sector started wearing out and the state became the mastermind of everything in planning."
They are the collapse of the communist block and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait as well as the first Gulf war. A big percentage of Egyptian labour returned from Arab countries due to the shrinkage of the volume of foreign demand for Egyptian labour. The returnees started searching for jobs, thus affecting the agricultural labour sector as it is one of the workforce sectors that contribute to the absorption of about 17 million souls according to 1996 census.
Both employees and workers get 157 days off every year after applying the weekly two-day holiday system.

In the same period the government organizational structures were largely expanded and new organizations were created as the number of sectors hiked from less than 500 to over 2500 on the level of state administrative body, thus increasing the number of general and central administrations to more than 15500 and the sub-administrations to some 75 thousand.
The study uncovered for the first time the volume of the governmental body operation costs, which includes pay, salaries and commodity and service requirements as well as the government's investment uses.
Concerning in-kind resources, the governmental resources include:
Using microfilms also surged up during the 1980s and 1990s.
The costs of these cars hit about 4900 million pounds, while their operation costs exceeded 400 million pounds per annum.
This is so evident in women in particular.
In South Korea, for instance, the worker works for 50 hours a week.
Raising pay in the government is carried out apart from increasing productivity, he said, stressing that the pay increase rate should by no means exceed the rate of productivity increase in order to create a real rise in the standard of living.
Hudhaibi launched sharp criticism against the "Roadmap" plan as it, according to him, carried only illusion to the Palestinian people.
The cause of extremism and terrorism has hung like a sword of Damocles over anybody who tries to unite Muslims and make them return to God Almighty, does well or advocate resisting injustice and oppression. No wonder, then, that the charge of Islamic extremism and terrorism has become a common brand against Islam and Muslims everywhere. Anything that would displease the Zionists or the American Administration would also be hung on the peg of terrorism and extremism.
"The Jamaa Islamia's peaceful shift was based on Islamic principles and approved by all the group's leaders and elements including Dr. Omar Abdel-Rahman who is serving a life sentence in an American prison," said Mahmoud Sho'aib who was released last year after he was detained for years in Egypt.
President Hosni Mubarak is expected to make a decree within a few days' time on forming the first national human rights council in the country pursuant to a recent law passed by the parliament before its session came to a close last month, Egyptian sources were quoted as saying.

Yesterday, in a meeting with Al-Ahram editorial staff, chief of Press syndicate Ibrahim Nafi'e who doubles as board chairman and editor-in-chief of Al-Ahram newspaper, announced the nomination of Salah Montaser as chief of journalists in the Press Syndicate coming election. This nomination is considered a clear governmental nomination.
"It is expected that the list of nominees for the membership of the syndicate board will be reviewed on the grounds that Nafi'e will not contest the coming election, taking into consideration the presence of an influential lobby inside the council, something which may make some members withdraw from nominating themselves after opening the door for nomination after the judicial committee supervising election have finished reviewing the candidature roll, the sources added.
The deal is intended to qualify women to have a political role, boost the NCW's capabilities and buttress the NCW's technical secretariat through training and promoting the management program and stepping up women's political participation activities.
EGYPTIAN ENGINEERS DEMAND RECEIVERSHIP ON THEIR SYNDICATE BE LIFTED

The new project, as propagated by Israel, aims at setting up archeological partnership with the countries located in East Africa and the Red Sea.
ISRAEL MAY RELEASE LARGER NUMBER OF DETAINEES IF USA, EGYPT RELEASED ISRAELI SPIES
Cairo informed Tel Aviv secretly of its intention to nominate a new ambassador in Israel on the heels of the "revival" of the political march between Israel and the Palestinians on condition that this march should forge ahead, Israeli Maariv newspaper reported on Tuesday. For its part, Jordan intends to take a similar step provided that the two countries (Egypt and Jordan) should set a date for returning their ambassadors to Tel Aviv after they had been recalled over two years before in protest against the Israeli war on the Palestinians, the paper added.
Interestingly, more than one international envoy who visited Lebanon recently broached the water issue, and unexpectedly so.
Sources close to Prime Minister Hariri believe that the head of the Lebanese Government also told Issa that Lebanon wanted to get back some of its expatriates living abroad, which would mean that future water utilization plans should take into consideration the distribution of water to eight million Lebanese, not just the four million who lived on Lebanese soil at present.
During the Basel Conference, Theodor Herzl described the Litani River as Israel's spirit that dwelt in the north.
Israel is seeking these days to transport the Tigris and the Euphrates water to it. It is holding consultation with the Jordanian party to let the water pass across Jordanian territories in a bid to find a way out of its water dearth crisis from which it has been suffering for years.

GAZA: CAMPAIGN FOR REMOVING GRAFFITI
Painting operations, which are expected to include cities in the West Bank later on, signal the end of the uprising at least on part of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
U.S. AMBASSADOR IN RIYADH: "WE'VE DECIDED TO APPOINT PRINCE ABDULLAH AS KING"
At that time, Gordon exploded another thunderous "bomb" when he said, "The crown prince will not be from the first generation of the royal family but rather from the second one.
The same source added that when Prince Abdullah was informed by one of his close friends of Gordon's words he said, "Nonsense," as if the whole matter does not concern him altogether.
It is noteworthy that many sons of late King Abdel-Aziz, such as princes Nayef, Minister of the Interior; Salman, Riyadh Governor and Nawwaf, Chief of the Intelligence, vie for this position, i.e. the third man.
In the Saudi forums, another theory is being circulated to the effect that in case of excluding Prince Sultan from being crown prince, one of his sons may be nominated for this position.
The list of candidates is still open. The urgent question now is whether the U.S. ambassador's "bombs" are slips of the tongue or they are meant to test reactions or they are intended leakage for the expected American changes in Abdel-Aziz's kingdom.
On the other hand, Reading For All supervisor and head of General Egyptian Book Organization (GEBO) Dr. Samir Sarhan termed this accusation as silly and untrue.
In an urgent inquiry to Premier Atef Ebeid, Qoaita said, "The US is planning to create a new generation to discharge the responsibility of managing and ruling Egypt in the coming stage in the American style." As a proof for that he mentioned the class of administrative leaders who graduated mid-last month from Management Development Center for Industry (MDCI) affiliated to the Public Enterprise Sector Ministry. Dr. Ebeid declared that those graduates will occupy the positions of deputy ministers, each in his respective sector and that the US had supervised their training.
He went on to say that the USAID only financed the programme for training 60,000 Egyptians since 1997 through workshops or advanced scientific degrees in business, economic and educational development, environment and public health.

In statements aired by the official TV, Presidential political advisor Osama Al-Baz tackled the nature of the tour made by an Egyptian high-level delegation to Europe and US last weak. The delegation included Gamal Mubarak and a number of officials, public figures, businessmen and intellectuals.
Al-Baz opined that the participation of politicians, parliamentarians, journalists and businessmen in the Egyptian delegation that visited the US lately copes with the nature of the multi-sided American society.
Salama Ahmad Salama wrote: American pressure has recently succeeded in making Egypt sign a bilateral agreement by which Americans will be exempted from trial by the International Criminal Court.
Egypts pussyfooting attitude became apparent when the Government failed to submit the agreement to the Peoples Assembly. The reasons for the Egyptian silence defied comprehension, but only until the US State Department recently announced that Egypt had joined 42 countries in signing the bilateral agreement that protects Americans against prosecution.
But the issue here is not what American soldiers may or may not commit on Egypts soil; what we have here is a system of international justice that Egypt was one of the first countries to advocate and seek to realize, particularly in light of the Israeli crimes against humanity, particularly Arab peoples.
Nobody knows, and nobody is saying!
In spite of the retreat of the poverty rate, economic sluggishness, which prevailed in Egypt after 2000, returned many Egyptians to the poverty circle again.
INVESTIGATION INTO A WHITE CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE FOUND IN AMERICAN CULTURAL CENTER
Spokesman for the American embassy in Cairo said that the American Cultural Center in Alexandria was evacuated two days ago (1st July) following suspicions of the existence of a chemical substance.

EGYPTIAN CAMPAIGN TO CORRECT YOUTH'S FAULTY CONCEPTS!
STOCK EXCHANGE FOR FOOTBALLERS!
This was due to the emergence of the fabulous rise in footballers prices as a result of clubs struggle and speculations and to put an end to some players practices in manipulating clubs in a bid to raise their prices.

Meanwhile, he added, delegations are currently paying intensive visits to Baghdad and North Iraq to meet with oppositionists of the former president Saddam Hussein and with Kurdish factions at North Iraq.

YEMENI ISLAH SECRETARY GENERAL: DISCORD WITH OTHER PARTIES ON MEANS NOT ENDS
The interview runs as follows: Q: Is Islah a party for fundamentalists in Yemen?
We preceded the GPC in the political arena and, moreover, contributed to its formation and participated in the formulation of its political program or the document that has been known later as the National Charter.
A: There is no doubt that 11 September is one of the historic turning points in our modern life as it turned the relations between the Islamic world and the West into a crystal clear state of deadlock.
A: The problem of some Islamic movements is that they dont live their reality and their ambitions dont match their potential.
A: On the contrary, we dont hide these ambitions, but we say that they are existent in our community under the constitution and the laws.
The constitutional and legal position in our country made all people live in one frame disagreeing with each other on means rather than ends.
For instance, the US dollar in 1995 equaled 13 Yemeni riyals but now it equals about 183.5 riyals.
In return, there are three acknowledged resources in Yemen, the first of which is oil, which is sold for 10 dollars per barrel. The government budget is presented to the parliament at this price, but the real price declared in overseas markets ranges between 28 and 30 dollars per barrel, i.e. a differential of 18 dollars which can achieve something.
How can we return the zakat funds into a means that enriches the poor so that they could give zakat instead of receiving it?
Our brethren in Turkey rule their country according to the positivist law of the country rather than the Islamic Sharia. However, by reaching such an echelon they would accomplish their aims through peaceful struggle, patience, wisdom and taking the line of call for Allah the Almighty and without any speculation.
Secondly, when Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) immigrated to Medina he assigned his son-in-law Ali bin Abi-Talib a certain task, namely returning deposits to their owners.
We also have constant relations with a lot of democratic organizations and bodies in the United States, foremost of which is the US Democratic Party. We maintain our ties with American politicians visiting Yemen.
Yemen is not a haven for terrorism. Actually there are some extremist elements, but only on the individual level, whereas the Yemeni people and political forces despise terrorism thanks to their formation, nature, history and belief.
Therefore, it is not confined to certain bodies. We should also confess that shura (advice) disappeared for hundreds of years in the Islamic rule, thus allowing the emergence of despotism and totalitarianism in the Islamic world.
Shura in our party has always been binding even in the stage of our clandestine activity. This is applicable to our internal institutions like the General Congress, Shura Council and General Secretariat.
The second aspect of the statement is that it pulled the rug from under the feet of the American accusations out of jurisprudential position.
To obtain a comment on Minister Kharazi's stand of prohibiting the possession of nuclear weapons, Al-Majalla made the following interview with Ayatollah Abbas Al-Kaabi, member of the Iranian Command Experts Council and professor of international law at Tehran University and Qom's hauzas (seminaries in Shiite law college):
A- Resisting occupiers and warding aggression off Muslim countries is a religious duty, a thing that necessarily requires possession of power by the nation. Actually, it is not permissible for Muslims to use lethal weapons or the so-called weapons of mass destruction against the enemy. However, if there is a big imbalance of power in favour of the enemy and the Muslim nation has become under the hegemony of occupation and such weapons have become the only legitimate source to repulse the aggressors, the use of such weapons in this case is permissible. In other words, the possession and use of such weapons are primarily prohibited, but they can exceptionally be used for the above-mentioned considerations.
A- If a Muslim country signed such a treaty, it would by no means be permissible to resort to such weapons out of fulfillment of covenants, which is a holy thing in Islam.
Q- Why does your country, then, refuse to sign the additional protocol of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) treaty?
Actually, we don't seek to possess weapons of mass destruction. Our defensive strategy is not based on such kind of armament.
Despite the official assurances made by the Pakistani government concerning the continuation of its nuclear project, which is considered the strategic weapon to face India, which possesses a nuclear weapon and threatens Pakistan with it.
However, the Pakistani nuclear weapon is considered a means of deterrence to forestall others from using it against our country," he said. He pointed out his Group's stand, which calls for disarming the weapons of mass destruction all over the world although India and the U.S. disagree, let alone Israel that possesses more than two hundreds nuclear warheads. "All countries should relinquish such destructive weapons. But, it is not justice for a powerful country such as the U.S. to possess nuclear weapons and deny other countries the right to possess them," he indicated.
SHEIKH ABDULLAH BIN BEYYAH: ACQUISITION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS IMPERMISSIBLE IF LEADS TO HARM
Rulers should ponder on that matter according to the balance of interest and evil because they need to strike a balance with the other who is not always trusted.
Sheikh Beyyah pointed out that the nuclear weapon is destructive and has, undoubtedly, illegal aspects.
The Islamic point of view concerning the issue of acquiring a nuclear bomb is currently discussed. Some Islamic scholars rendered it permissible, while others considered it a religious duty in case the enemy possesses the same weapon. In statements to Al-Majalla, Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar Dr. Mohamed Sayed Tantawi warned Islamic countries against the acquisition of nuclear weapons at present due to the international circumstances, which are not in favour of Arab peoples or regimes.

We hope that our production will hike by 100,000 barrels daily," he told Asharq Al-Awsat.
The reason for the confrontation, this time, was neither anti-terrorism or anti-Taliban remnants war in Afghanistan nor the relations with Washington, but rather Musharraf's insistence on considering the recognition of Israel.
This coincided with an opinion poll held by the station where pros and cons equally regarding reconsidering the Pakistani policy towards the Hebrew state.
A few days ago, Pakistani mass media quoted reports by high-ranking sources to the effect that Islamabad might establish political relations with Israel whose ambassador to the European Union said that, "Pakistan is a keynote player in the Islamic world and therefore a hostile policy towards it would be out of place".

As there has been much talk about the future of ruling in Egypt, especially under the onslaught by the Al-Arabi newspaper, mouthpiece of the opposition Nasserite party against what it called "grooming Gamal Mubarak (President Mubarak's son) to take his father's place," political circles in Cairo were taken aback by an unprecedented lawsuit against President Mubarak's reluctance to appoint a vice-president since he took over in 1981. The case is expected to be heard on July 29.
The legal action was lodged with the vice-chairman of the State Council and president of the Administrative Judiciary Court. Asked if the lawsuit can be accepted, he said, "I expect it to be turned down, as it is filed by a person of no capacity or interest. But, such an argument can be rebutted by saying that I am an Egyptian citizen and I want to live safely in my country, and defend its stability.
The fresh parliamentary election bill is being prepared, well-informed sources in the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP) said.
The newspaper devotes a big number of its articles to criticizing Gamal Mubarak's visit to Washington. For instance, under the abovementioned headline, it published a feature on page 9, which ran to the following effect only in part:
Al-Sawi wondered how a person who advocated the reduction of free education ceiling could possibly express the ambitions of youth or new generations who were deprived of job opportunities. Gamal Mubarak may well represent a particular bracket in society or might represent himself, but nobody can confirm that he represents an entire generation.
He added that even though Gamal Mubarak's orientations were liberal they belong to that old liberalism rather than the new one that would enhance the social role of the state.
His experience in public career was confined to his work in Bank of America (in London), which was not a political action, which makes us apparently before a case of preparation for bequeathing power. Those who have been talking in the name of reform and the new generation took more interest in the USA demands.
None of such options have taken place in Gamal Mubarak's case and therefore any such allegation would be groundless.
Dr. Al-Eryan, however, does not think too much of anybody's statements or orientations as he believes that it is necessary to continue demanding an all-out reform in all spheres. This can only be achieved through releasing freedoms that would place Egypt in its pioneering status.
There are also other new ideas, in the forefront of which are solving the problems of youth such as housing.
Ambassador Amin Yusri conveyed a message to Gamal Mubarak excerpts of which run to the following effect:
Not every citizen has your advantages being the son of the current President of the Republic.
This is particularly a violation of article 138 of the Constitution, which authorizes the President alone or together with the cabinet to draw up the general policy of the state.
Thirdly: One more thing remains, namely, your visit to Washington twice in less than 6 months.
We wished and still wish that you would give the internal and Arab dimensions a bigger emphasis than the external dimension.
We all hope as citizens that we will not see as head of our state an Egyptian Bremer like the American Bremer sent by Washington to rule an Arab country whose Arabism is well established and deeply rooted!
Western diplomatic sources closely related to Israeli ambassador in Cairo Gadoun Bin Ami said that the Egyptian authorities would allow a doctor to be delegated by the Israeli government by the end of this week to subject Azzam to urgent medical check-ups after he had some health problems recently.
On the other hand, an Egyptian Foreign Ministry official told Asharq Al-Awsat that his country was not likely to respond to a mediation offer to return the recalled Egyptian ambassador to Israel as such a return was linked to the Egyptian people's supreme interests and had nothing whatsoever to do with any foreign body no matter how close their relations or friendship with Egypt were.
Believe it or not, Egyptians spend annually LE10 billion on fortune-telling, undoing charms and treatment from jinn! The sum is double the American aid annually received from the USA, bigger than the Suez Canal revenues and higher than Egyptian tourism returns, more than double the volume of Egyptian exports but much less than the value of drug trafficking.

Hassan is auditor as well of the budgets of a number of Egyptian banks.
The source pointed out that this trend creates an atmosphere of depression inside the Egyptian banking milieus among the leaderships and cadres which are being neglected, adding that the criteria in assuming these posts are not based on efficiency as much as they are based on personal and familial connections between officials.

Economist Dr Abdel Mon'im Radhi, former dean of the Faculty Commerce at Ain Shams University, who compiled this study, said that the rate of bad debts was uncovered by the sources and studies issued by the Central Bank of Egypt. He added that according to these sources and studies the bad debt is the debt which the client falters to pay or its interests or both for three months or more due to his failure to achieve a sufficient monetary inflows from his activities to pay back the debts and the interests. Furthermore, banks had no high quality guarantees that could be liquefied in the short run to cover the whole value of the debt and its interests.
The third set of reasons behind the bad debts is related to the surrounding circumstances which the study defined in the occurrence of financial crises in some areas around the world that could influence the banking market such as the crisis of Southeast Asia, Dr Radhi concluded.
Amid this controversy the chronic crisis of exportation has been forgotten in spite of consecutive government's confirmations of increasing exports since the 1980s. These confirmations, unfortunately, were to no avail as exports and imports have remained stable at 5.7 billion dollars and 17.5 billion dollars respectively.
Experts and bankers unanimously agreed that trade balance has been affected by the decree of exchange rate deregulation on 29th January last, which led to the devaluation of the Egyptian pound before the dollar (the currency of trade exchange) by 86 piasters at one go. This decision was hoped to positively reflect in high demand for Egyptian exports as the devaluation of the local currency means depreciation in the cost of the end product, thus encouraging importers to rush on it.
He pointed out that the stability of exchange rates would be more important than the differential between the pound and the dollar, as the stability of exchange rates is the sole guarantee for supporting national industry and providing the required finance for its expansions following the increase of domestic debt and the government's failure to continue depending on that resource for financing industry. Moreover, there are sovereignty hazards as far as borrowing from abroad is concerned, he added.

FM DISCUSSES FRENCH JEWRY'S CLAIMS FOR COMPENSATION
They added that the Egyptian Foreign Ministry is mulling over that claim earnestly. "There is no objection to this demand as those Jews are Egyptian citizens even though they hold the nationality of another country, namely France.

He added, "We'd like to share as intellectuals in putting things right as we just got enough of the harangue and unspecialized jazz, which led to anarchy.
He also regarded all those killed from either side in security confrontations between the police and the group members as martyrs in sedition fights.

A gynaecologist at Al-Azhar University, Dr. Gamal Abul-Sorour ascribes the high rate of twins cases to three reasons, first is the increase in the rate of pregnancy in later years due to delay of marriage because of economic conditions. Therefore, he continues, the highest rates of twins cases take place in Africa and poor countries.
A recent study concluded by family planning and population centers in Egypt pointed out the high rate of twins cases which went up gravely in the last years as Egyptian women give birth to twins every ten minutes, thus constituting fifth of the population now that such a rate did not exceed 1.5% of the population five years ago.

Dr. Saadoun al-Delimy, a political analyst who is the CEO of the Iraqi Center for Research and Strategic Studies, cautioned that the communal game could fuel splits in Iraq and create a similar situation to that in Lebanon.
The participants considered that the July 14th means republic's win over monarchy, rather than a Bathi day that can be abrogated just like other Bathi occasions and days, rescinded by the council in its first decision.
In a statement, a copy of which was obtained by Al-Hayat, Shiite religious leaders in Iraq blasted the governing council makeup for shrugging off those Iraqi nationals at home who were persecuted and deprived though they made a long-standing struggle and constitute the population makeup of Iraq's society. Although they recognized that the council is entitled to appoint, not only nominate, cabinet ministers, and is in charge of the state public budget, they rapped the council as a rejected approach and warned against "adverse consequences".
Saudi Arabia considered the formation of this council as a constructive step towards meeting the aspirations of the Iraqi people to live a secure and decent life.

SYRIA IN THIRD YEAR OF BASHAR
A decision of appointing a faculty dean will not require the minister of education or the university chancellor to refer to the education office in the Central leadership of "Baath" Party, in power since 1963.

The change in Iraq came in a time when the Syrian efforts are focused on administrative, economic and educational reform dubbed as the "long-term structural reform".
There are now some 40 licensed private periodicals in addition to 4 radio stations under authorization. Only one political magazine has been authorized, namely "White and Black".

Saudi and Russian bodies concerned are now preparing for this visit, which is considered the first to be paid by such a high-ranking Saudi official.

In spite of Egyptian Foreign Ministry frequently denying, in the last few days, any Israeli, American or Palestinian pressure to release the Israeli spy Azzam Azzam, currently serving a 15-year prison sentence in Egypt in implementation of a judicial verdict in an espionage case, identical American and Palestinian sources emphasized Egyptian demands to release Palestinian POW's in return for releasing Azzam.
Palestinian pressure on Egypt to release Azzam increased so that the implementation of the roadmap may not falter as the Palestinian Authority and America regard such a release part of the Egyptian good offices to maintain peace in the Middle East in response to the message sent by the Palestinian POW's and their families to the Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak last February calling upon him to set Azzam free in return for the release of the prisoners of freedom in the jails of Ofar, Negev, Agroud and Ashkelon.

Wahid Abdel-Maguid, a prominent oppositionist inside the Wafd Party, said, "There are various means to confront the party chairman.

Some of those who were forced to accept this job are women and girls who got high estimates in the university but failed to obtain jobs, so they chose the shortest cut for having a secure and staple source of livelihood through resorting to female servant recruitment offices, hoping to serve an affluent family. Ibrahim Hassan, an employee of such offices admitted that masters and doctorate degree holders looking for jobs frequent the office.
Regarding the pay and whether it might differ from a servant without a certificate and another with a rare specialty, he said pay is a predetermined issue, thus there is no difference between servants as far as pay is concerned. Only when the servant serves a foreign family or when she works as baby sitter, the pay rises. Mostafa Ibrahim, a veteran who used to supply affluent families with male and female servants, pointed out that he always advises university graduates to look for a job related to their specialties and leave that harsh job.

Interference, by any means, will have negative impacts because such mechanisms are only temporary solutions to a big problem that cannot be overcome unless there is a dollar surplus that can restore rates of exchange to the aspired after balance, economist Dr. Mohsen Al-Khodairi said.
The interference of the CBE to rectify the track of the exchange market and monitor the activities of banks and exchange firms is not an invented method nor can it be considered backtracking on the liberalization of the rate of exchange system, especially as this interference forestalls speculations by some banks in the dollar surpluses they achieve and contributes to an increase in covering the documentary credits of importers.

The sources regarded the Ministry of Foreign Trade task to restore confidence in Egyptian meat as difficult as it would need enormous efforts to persuade importing countries that Egypt was free of epidemics in case of international certificates being issued to that effect.

Abul-Qumsan pointed out that contacts are underway with the Saudi authorities to explain the situation and get acquainted with the reasons why it took such a decision, particularly as the international organization specialized in that field in Paris didn't issue any report on the Rift Valley fever in Egypt. He explained that such a decision would not affect the distinguished economic and commercial ties between the two countries. He considered that decision as a temporary one that the Saudi side would backtrack on once it is assured of the soundness of Egyptian exports of red meat, sheep and deer.

The sources pointed out that the deregulation of the rate of exchange had contributed to the retreat of imports but the cost of that deregulation was high and had to be borne by the Egyptian citizen especially the low-income brackets. All basic goods prices rocketed, thus adding further burdens to the low-income classes who constitute the majority of the citizenry.

Then the PA stipulated that it would be given half the price of the villa in return for handing it over to them.
Such sources were commenting on the news reported three days ago about Syrian indications of willingness to resume negotiations with Israel over the peaceful march.
We are not for giving Syria a life belt in these circumstances.
The termination of all relations with mass destruction weapons, a charge categorically denied by Damascus, stopping armed backing of Hizbollah and not only closing the bureaus but also expelling all elements of Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
Sharon's visit came only two months before the British government's final decision on a rocket deal through which Israel seeks selling five thousand anti-tank Israeli made "Spike" rockets. The sources confirmed that the deal was one of the main issues on the negotiating table between Sharon and Blair.
In exclusives to Al-Ahram Al-Arabi, Palestinian diplomatic sources indicated the importance of the deal whose threat goes beyond the British military and logistic support of the Israeli army in contravention with the European and British laws that organize arms exports to world countries.
Israel is currently the fifth biggest arms exporter in the world following the USA, the European Union, Russia and Japan.
Next to the USA came Asian countries, then Europe and then Latin America.
The Executive Commission of the Iraqi Christians Democratic League (ICDL) welcomed in a statement issued yesterday (July 22nd) the formation of the governing council. The ICDL's cautious welcome said the council was a right step in the right direction for the Iraqis to run their own affairs.
And that's why the league though welcoming the council, does not think it expresses the aspirations of most Iraqi Christians.
Maher said that the university started to witness a new kind of brokers or procurers whose job was to persuade some girl students to head for the American soldiers' rest houses. Those girls who fell victim to the power of the dollar can easily be recognized.
We, frankly, are Sami's group. We came here to take part in parties for the soldiers and spend the night here. In the morning, Sami comes to give us our dues in full, but he is late today. He is head of a ring of women who procure beautiful girls from markets or the universities secretly rather than the way we have been brought here."
American forces are stationed inside the university campus without permission from the university rector.

JORDAN'S PREMIER SHRUGS OFF ISLAMISTS' DEMANDS IN HIS CABINET MAKEUP
Abul-Ragheb, who will also act as Minister of Defence, has selected two deputy premiers; Former minister of Justice Faris al-Nabulsi and former Minister of Economy Mohamed al-Halayka, a key architect of economic reform who is on good terms with the World Bank. Minister of Finance Michael Martu, Minister of Planning Basem Awadullah, Minister of Energy Mohamed al-Batayna, State Minister Marwan Al-Maashar and Minister of Foreign Affairs Shaher Bac have retained their portfolios in the shakeup.
With the 17-member opposition Islamic bloc in the parliament insisting on denying the new cabinet a vote of confidence, Abul-Ragheb has kept Minister of Municipal Affairs Abdel-Razek Tobaishat in his position, turning a deaf ear to Islamists' call to give him the axe as he was the main person to blame for the enactment of the temporary municipality law, which gives the government the right to appoint 50 percent of municipality members.
The committee will raise the issue of the Jordanian detainees in Israel in the parliament in an effort to make the government take strict positions against Israel to release them especially as they include detainees who have been in confinement for long years, a thing that would make them suffer from chronic diseases, said deputy Abu-Sokkar who is also the first assistant of the parliament speaker.
He pointed out anticipations of transporting negotiations from Kenya to the USA.
Such a capital would not be regarded one of the 26 Sudanese provinces and would be subjected to the National Assembly's (parliament) administration. A special police force would be formed there to hold the responsibility for the enforcement of the law there.
The government, on the other hand, rejects the whole idea and regards the capital issue as already dealt with within the framework of Machacos protocol signed by both parties one year ago.
A number of Arab officials from both the public and the private sectors held a workshop in Amman a few days ago over the deregulation of the railway transport services trade in the Arab World. They discussed the mechanisms of linking the Arab World with an integrated railway network.
The network also covers Iraq, the east of the Mediterranean, the center of Syria, the west of Iraq and Jordan and the southern Coast of the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile Delta across Moan, Al-Ferdan, Safaga, Al-Kharga, Al-Gubail, Jeddah and Doha and finally the axis of the south of the Arabian Peninsula.
The crucial point of this issue, which pushed security bodies to interfere and send this memo is that the governor's external relations have gone to extremes to the detriment of the state's security.
The second story is being publicly circulated by the regime's newspapers and mass media by day and at night. They say that the authorities have arrested 39 civil servants working in the Agricultural Directorate in Idlib Governorate on charges of corruption, receiving bribes, issuing forged invoices, distributing expired agricultural products and being negligent in their work duties, according to official Teshrin newspaper.
Both secret and public stories sum up the Syrian question in the third anniversary of Bashar Al-Assad reign after artificial rigged elections, preceded by the farce of amending the constitution (which was laid down by Hafez Al-Assad himself) in a way that seems suitable for the illegal age of the son who will succeed his father and in a way that turned the Syrian regime into a hereditary republic or dictatorship.
The killer went unpunished. Corruption the mafia way coloured the last two years of Bashar Al-Assad's reign and it seems likely to colour the coming era.
The second reason is that the young president is lacking in the human experience which urged most world countries constitutions to stipulate that the candidate for the presidency should be over forty years old.
The catastrophe is that if Bashar Al-Assad wanted to rule with a new team and different approach, he would have to practically form counter-networks that outweigh the other networks. This will put him in an expected confrontation - may be permanently - with the old guards who have not died yet.
The fourth and most important reason, "the mother of reasons," is that the regime is structurally unable to make a reform or an essential change because its structure is too solid and inflexible to bear the shock of changes. It repeats itself and stems the causes of survival from the same causes that are totally contrary to the concepts of democracy, partisan multiplicity, respect of freedoms and human rights.
The farce reached its climax when it was said that the decree implied the release of Riyadh Al-Turk (who was released more than eight months ago).
Yesterday (21st July), American Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfwitz and Iraqi Kurdish officials said that the USA sought to conclude a common defense treaty with the coming Iraqi government.
He did not rule out the possibility of Arab countries sending forces to Iraq under a Security Council resolution.
JORDAN TO SET UP FIRST AIRCRAFT PLANT IN THE REGION
All the privileges that could be obtained by the investor in case the plant area is considered a free economic zone were explained. Indeed, the area near Queen Aliaa Airport was allocated for the new airport. Approval of the Civil Aviation Authority as well as permission of the Free Zones Authority was obtained.
Under this headline, Syrian writer and researcher Sobhi Hadidi who resides in Paris writes an article in Al-Quds Al-Arabi to the following effect: A story is being circulated secretly by the Syrians saying that a short note was put on Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad's desk a few weeks ago to the effect that a governor (a retired officer who has been a governor of a major Syrian governorate for decades, but we cannot mention his name here for legal reasons only) collected an unimaginable amount of money from tributes, bribes and commissions.
The rest of the story says that the young president remained silent for a short time and said that this governor in particular was favoured by "his father's will" and that he would not offend that will by any means.
Tens of similar stories are circulated among Syrian citizens from time to time. They are meant to draw the citizens' attention away from other secret stories.
In Syria nowadays, there is a handful of gangs, who personify the "will of the father" according to Al-Assad junior, who are less than ten in number. Their number, together with their sons, may reach thirty at most. They are simply the army of the Syrian mafia.
Forefront of such reasons is "the entourage" around the president or the higher hierarchy of power where the final resolution can be taken. In 1973, or even immediately after October War, Hafez Al-Assad organized his ranks and forces and excluded the politicians and officers who stood with him and there was no need to them any more, or they became an obstacle in one way or another. He kept those whose services he needed or whom he could not oust for reasons related to security, military or sectarian balances after imposing an authority over anybody who had an authority.
It might be mentioned here that Hafez Al-Assad continued for three decades to establish a dictatorial, security, military regime as accurate as a spiderweb, whose threads are connected with the center where the heart of the web is making final decisions and drawing up policies.
So, some political Syrian forces, including secular and Islamic oppositionists alike, were deceived by the illusion of the "national reconciliation" with the regime on the grounds that the country is exposed to external dangers threatening its independence, sovereignty and security.
Recently, Bashar issued a decree to have a large number of criminal prisoners released. However, he did not take the next necessary step of releasing the prisoners of conscience (or the ten persons who became nine after releasing Riyadh Al-Turk) although their "crimes" can by no means be compared with currency and smuggling crimes or drug trafficking.
The disaster is that this single step forward can imply some other sorts of development such as importing the worst traditions of the familial mafia.
For that end, an agreement was signed on Sunday between the Company and the Middle East Aviation Academy. The agreement stipulated providing the Academy with the first production of the factory, which will be opened on 15th September next.
HALF ARAB AGRICULTURAL LANDS THREATENED WITH DESERTIFICATION
The report pointed out that the Arab world is rich in water resources although it is located in a semi-dry area in the world and its renewable water resources are less than 1 percent of the world's renewable water. The Arab per capita quota of water amounts to 1477 cubic meters annually whereas the world per capita share is 112.9 thousand cubic meters.
Israel also carried out a lot of policies aiming to control water resources in the West Bank and Gaza as most of these resources are linked with the Israeli water system.
This announcement coincided with American and Israeli intensive pressure on Iran to force it to unveil its nuclear programme.
The American Administration feels that the gravest danger to its forces in Iraq and the Gulf region in general comes from two countries Syria; and Iran, as their borders with Iraq are both long and of difficult terrain and are therefore so difficult to control.
Israel has panicked at such missiles just as it had panicked at Al-Hussein Iraqi missiles. It would never feel safe unless such missiles were destroyed or unless the regime in Tehran was changed just as it had done to Iraq.
WASHINGTON COOPERATES WITH IRAQI INTELLIGENCE ELEMENTS OF "IRAN" AND "ISLAMIC MOVEMENT" SECTIONS

FEMALE SERVANTS HOLDING DOCTORATE AND MASTER'S DEGREES
Hardly could a day pass without receiving a call from a girl or a woman of a rare specialty asking for work as a servant. In spite of the severe conditions of work, university girls thank the office officials after having a job, Hassan confirmed.
Another one called Fatima Ibrahim said that she spent long years in education till she got her master's degree in social work, but she did not get a job till she was 35 years old, so she decided to work as a servant through a recruitment office.
AFTER LATE MARRIAGE IN EGYPT, GIRLS ESCAPE SPINSTERHOOD BY DOING POST GRADUATE STUDIES
Mona, a 37-year old woman admitted that post graduate studies were the real reason. It was a sort of escape from the pathetically long wait for the suitable bridegroom. I was the incessant subject of my family's talk which made me think I was a problem. They imagined that it was much to late for me to get married at this age while I do not think so as I still feel young and marriage is a matter of luck!
The involvement in such rivalry made me reject several proposals of marriage at that time and I did not, then, realize that I was unconsciously growing older!
Dr. Abdel Khaliq adds one of the studies on the reasons for marriage and its motives showed that 4% of university girls whose age ranges from 20 to 35 years want to marry in order to leave the parents' home, 60% wish to marry to escape loneliness, 2% only marry lest it should be too late for them to marry, 2% also marry as they are pressured to do so by their own parents, 16% marry because they are in love, 30% marry because they want to set up a home and a new family and 16% marry because they want a husband to support them.
Several Egyptian beaches are seeing "semi-civil wars" between hot-tempered and jealous husbands and pretty wives longing for more emancipation through swimming and mixing with men. A lifeboat for husbands was "Islamic Swimming costumes" for women, promoted by veiled women's wear shops. Such an Islamic swimming costume consists of two pieces that enables women to swim freely, covering their nakedness.
Several beaches have seen divorce cases due to women's insistence on wearing bikini, rendering their spouses bodyguards who fervently seek to protect their wives while swimming.
A slum fashion house has recently tailored a cheap Islamic swimsuit for only 30 pounds, being highly demanded by lady employees and down-trodden parents' girls.
He said that the Palestinian image abroad is distorted due to the smart Israeli political discourse.
A judicial lawsuit, regarded as the first of its kind, will be examined by the Administrative Judiciary Court shortly. The lawsuit demands that the decree passed by President Hosni Mubarak in his capacity as leader of the ruling party to set up the Policy Committee chaired by Gamal Mubarak be cancelled.
The lawsuit pointed out that the committee's continuation of work is regarded as null and void and it must, therefore, be cancelled. The decree's implementation must also be suspended and the decrees taken by the committee, consequently, are considered lacking in legitimacy.
Meanwhile, the Zionist organization attacked the Egyptian judiciary and threatened to resort to foreign judiciary in order to collect those dues.
The new Zionist campaign comes within the framework of blackmailing Egypt in order to offer further capitulations to Israel.
The Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture bans the entry of a number of agricultural produce into Egypt for health reasons.
IRAN'S MISSILE!
By choosing this particular timing to announce its new missile, the Iranian government might have meant to reply to the escalating American threats to topple it.
The Iranian regime tried to resort to discretion as the best part of valour and in an attempt to fend off American anger, tried to strike a happy medium by exercising pressure on Iraq Shiite leaderships affiliated to it not to get involved with the resistance and even to join the governing council. Such a policy which failed in Afghanistan started to fail too in Iraq as some Shiite groups started to show recalcitrance to Iranian counsel to abide by the rule of self-control. They have even prepared to joint the resistance in a bid to acquit the national Arab Shiite group of the charges of collusion with occupation while their Sunnite brothers were valiantly forging ahead with confronting the American project.
The question is: What about Arab military armament industry! Where are the billions spent in that context? When will the Arabs possess missiles or a nuclear programme?
He told Al-Hayat that the Americans showed lack of confidence in Shiite parties and hence their forces attacks on those parties premises and detention of Shiite political cadres now jailed in American and British prisons called the "Docks."
"We are constantly harassed by the Americans," he added.
Bush replied, 'Let me put it right.
Interviewed by the Israeli Maariv daily, Powell said, "The USA president is concerned about that matter, as the fence creates a fait accompli that cannot be backtracked on, when demarcating the borders of the Palestinian state."
MONARCH ABDULLAH II WARNS AGAINST EVACUATING JERUSALEM FROM CHRISTIANS
Under this headline, Al-Hayat published an article, which ran to the following effect only in part: After the Egyptian government had lost the seat of Press Syndicate chairman, it received a second blow when eight journalists of opposition trends won seats in the Press Syndicate council, thus constituting third of its membership. The syndicate elections results were a surprise to the government, which sought in several ways to ensure the control of the chairman's seat, which was won by the Nasserite candidate, Galal Aref, who gained the upper hand over the government candidate, Salah Montaser. The final results uncovered that four Islamists won the council's elections:
Head of the judiciary committee supervising the latest electoral process, Justice Mohamed Al-Mansi said that the elections were characterized by fairness and integrity under full judiciary supervision. The judiciary committees abided by the rules of complete detachment during the election process until the results were announced in 16 polling stations, in addition to Alexandria committee, the results of which were announced by Alexandria Court of First Instance Justice. He pointed out that the number of the general assembly of the Press Syndicate was 4332.
The term in office of Egyptian journalists chairman will last for a couple of years, which are renewable for just another term whereas the term in office of a syndicate council member lasts for four years.
Arab sources told Al-Hayat that the American Administration was sure that it would soon apprehend deposed president Saddam Hussein after it had managed to kill his two sons Udai and Qusai, as Saddam had sent a message to the American command in Iraq offering stopping resistance operations against the American soldiers in return for halting manhunt operations targeting him and his family as well as allowing him and his family to leave Iraq.
ROW BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION OVER NDP's REFUSAL TO AMEND CONSTITUTION
Opposition groups stressed that the required constitutional amendments go in parallel with the desire to broaden democratic practice and eliminate the governmental restraints on new political parities foundation based on constitutional articles. Such articles, stipulated in the existing political parties law, were described by the opposition as lax.
NDP Secretary General Safwat Al-Sherif described calls of some partisan trends for constitutional amendment as destabilizing and harming the integrity of the country. He turned down all these calls. Meanwhile, Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Kamal Al-Shazli stressed President Mubarak's keenness on effectuating the 6th principle of the July 1952 Revolution that stipulates establishing a sound political life. Freedom of expression and opinion is a right for every one, Al-Shazlli said.
The sources noted that the conference would touch upon assessment of the results of the visits and grants earmarked for the democracy and partnership initiative. Some 37 million dollars of these grants were spent in 2003 and 6.13 million dollars in 2002.

HEALTH ALLOCATION IN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WASTED!
This also comes in light of the People's Assembly ignoring the reports sent to it by the Central Auditing Agency about the expenditure items of those funds obtained by the Ministry of Health and Population till 2000. The parliament failed to deal seriously with those reports in spite of the enormous funds obtained by the Ministry and its different departments in the form of grants outside the state budget, which amounted to over $639 million.
The documents, referred to the practices of lavishing money on holding training courses, hotel accommodation, per diem allowances, sustenance, pens and block notes to the end of such overheads which can amount to thousands of pounds for a two-day seminar including LE1200 as coffee expenses for 40 persons and over 1,000 per diem allowances for two persons in a couple of days.
The meeting, which was held under the chairmanship of Premier Dr. Atef Ebied to mull over a report compiled by the ministerial delegation which visited the USA last month, decided to necessarily draw upon the experience of former ambassadors to the US as well as the cadres related to Egyptian-American ties. In case this plan failed to achieve its aim to improve Egypt's image in the US, a consulting firm will be asked to prepare a general plan under the supervision of the Foreign Ministry, the meeting decided.
The new council will be tasked with sponsoring the religious discourse in Egypt and supporting the ways and means of developing and updating it internally and externally. "The new council aims at developing the religious discourse at the internal and external levels through an enlightened religious vision keeping abreast of the variables of the time being," said PA Religious Committee head Dr. Abdel-Mo'ti Bayoumi. It will include figures working in the da'wa (call to Islam) field whether from Al-Azhar or the Ministry of Wakfs (religious endowments), in addition to other personalities working in the field of da'wa from outside the religious establishments, Bayoumi added.
However, Bayoumi pointed out the proposed Supreme Council for Religious Discourse would include senior ulema (Muslim scholars) forefront of whom are the Grand Sheikh of Al-Azhar, the minister of wakfs and the mufti. There is, thus, no room for such fears and concerns, as this supreme council will be an advisory one including great theologian leaders and specialists. Its plans, studies and recommendations will depend on such institutions (Al-Azhar and the Ministry of Wakfs) whose role extends beyond the religious discourse to other affairs such as supervising religious institutions, mosques, religious education, fatwas and qualifying imams and preachers, he added.

They are primarily their registration in the database of suppliers to the UN market through the electronic mail and the purchases service bureau which is regarded as part of the UN Development Program (UNDP) and operates as a secretariat for the database. Each specialist provides the needs of UN officials and the World Bank through dealing with the databases and benefiting from the suppliers' data available with it.

"SPLM," he pursued, "stressed that the capital issue is not a geographical one. It is rather an issue of equality among citizens in all constitutional rights. It is, further, a case related to the Sudanese people's readiness to coexist and build their unified Sudan on new fundamentals. If they failed to find a unified capital, how could they unify their country?"

Under this heading, Rajeh al-Khori of Asharq Al-Awsat daily writes an article, dealing with the recent killing of deposed Iraqi president Saddam Hussein's sons Uday and Qusay, to say: Certain doors need to remain closed.
Why was, then, the story over with the two having been killed, or notably, having died?
It can also be said that claims on a trial of the collapsed Iraqi regime are unreliable and unrealistic.
So, we can say now that there should be a U.S. "Chemical Donald" just as the Iraqi "Chemical Ali."

The conference strongly warned all Arab organizations which have no plans for saving drinking and irrigational water. It considered such plans one of the most important political, economic and social issues to be paid attention. The conference also considered Arab security as part and parcel of national security per se and that discussion of Arab water security issue is not new to the agendas of most of Arab scientific or technical conferences. However, in its keynote speech the conference called for laying down a unified Arab strategy to square up to the perils of painful water challenges to the Arab world, whose population will reach 600 million by 2035.

The source was surprised at such statements, which aim at undermining the principles of Arab solidarity while the Arab nation is undergoing tough circumstances and at a time when Saudi Arabia together with some brotherly Arab countries are seeking to lay down the principles that will support collective Arab action and bolster the status and mechanisms of the Arab League.

Such exodus began in the 1970s due to political and sectarian reasons. Saddam Hussein's who strongly objected to Anwar Sadat's signature of Camp David agreement with Israel, wanted to attract the Egyptians to his country by opening it to them without entry visas.

RETURN OF FUNDS WAITING FOR PACKAGE OF REFORMS AIMING AT TRANSPARENCY, CLARITY OF POLICIES AND STABILITY OF LAWS
Economic expert and head of the Research Center of the National Bank of Egypt, Dr Mohsen Khudheir said that attraction of Egyptian funds from abroad needs a scientific carefully studied approach to be translated into reforms including laws.
Banks Union legal advisor, Gamal Askar said that the obstacles that impede the return of such funds can be found anywhere in the Arab world despite the attempts made to attract such funds whether through setting up special economic zones or customs and tax reforms. He added that it was difficult to achieve all that we wanted. The customs reform is related to the protection of the domestic product and the high interest rate is the practical result of attracting savings. I, however, believe that what can be most instrumental in encouraging Egyptian and Arab funds to come back is the achievement of some sort of transparency and investing markets with security and stability, which can not happen in the case of contradictory, confused, changeable laws.

Who will protect Egypt's scientists and who will provide them with the proper climate and scientific environment instead of the choking environment which repels and drives many scientists to escape from Egypt and employ their brains in favour of "others" who might be "hostile" to us?

Q: How did you join Egypt's Revolution organization?
A: Of course, I knew both by name, but I was, then, surprised to find Nazmi and Hamada in the organization who worked as salesmen with Ahmed Isam Eddin, brother of Mahmoud Nour Eddin, who informed the security men of the organization later on.

My meeting with Khalid Abdel-Nasser Q: Where did you usually meet together?
Who do you live with?"
A: We decided not to carry out any operation if it involved any harm or injury to Egyptians. If an Israeli riding a car, for instance, had an Egyptian companion, the operation would be cancelled on strict orders from Mahmoud Nour Eddin. This actually happened as we frequently had to back out when there were some Egyptian drivers inside the cars which carried Israeli officials.
Q: Who did discover that Ahmed, Mahmoud Nour Eddin's brother, was recruited?
Q: What happened after Ahmed returned to Egypt?

Customs Department had demanded the Supreme Council of Antiquities to pay LE7.170 million in return for the clearance of the coffin. After the issue was raised by Akhbar Al-Youm newspaper last week, the Customs Department decided not to collect any duties, apart from just 10 piasters.
Egyptian-German negotiations had started to restore the golden coffin in the early eighties till they reached such a climax that the German chancellor himself personally intervened to solve the problem. The German authorities asked for a statue from the old dynasty in return for the return of the golden coffin. The negotiations then ended in an agreement that an exhibition should be mounted including 5 archaeological items for 3 months in return for the return of the statue and the five items to the mother country. When those antiquities, however, returned in 2001, a problem erupted when the Customs Department valued the coffin at LE20 million.

The association members were preoccupied, during the first days after the war, with inventorying the damage that afflicted their faculties and institutes due to the operations of looting and the fires that broke out everywhere.
Another story says that a girl student had first left the faculties complex of Baghdad University to reach the nearby bus stop when the kidnappers' car pulled over and they carried the girl student and took her to an unknown place.
Such positive results achieved by the Jealous Students in some faculties have not reached the Education College yet.
Regarding the tendency of many girl students to wear the veil after the war though they did not use to wear it before it broke out, Anwaar Taher who completed her MA in philosophy said, "The veil has become a weapon against abduction as it makes the kidnappers hesitate a bit before they committed their crimes." She, nevertheless, added that that did not mean that some veiled girls had not been exposed to abduction.

"Note what had been said shortly after the terrorist attack and what is being said now.

Thirdly, he dare not tell them that Israel's security and ousting Iraq from the circle of confrontation with it was the reason for the war on Iraq.
This means, he continued, that the word "investigations" would be a sword of Damocles over Saudis even if they cooperated at the present time or that the current problem was solved, the "investigations" would continue so long as the anti-terrorism war is on.
A Washington-based Saudi source, who closely follows up the events and asked to be anonymous, told Al-Majalla that Prince Saud Al-Faisal affirmed during his meeting with the American president that Saudi Arabia as well wants to reach the fact and know the details of the 11 September 2001 incidents as this is part of the Saudi campaign against Al-Qaeda organization.
While American officials emphasized that American, British and Libyan officials met in London on Monday to evaluate the move towards settling the dispute over blowing up the Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, Libyan leader Mu'ammar Gaddafi made it certain that his country would accept the legal responsibility and pay 2.7 billion dollars in compensations.
As for London-based negotiations, an official in Washington said an American team left Washington on Sunday to attend the meeting in an effort to evaluate the situation after the meeting of the victims' families last week.
The agreement over which negotiations are underway includes striking Libya off terrorism-supporting countries' list.
The agreement was signed last May with the Syrian Oil Company.
Syria hopes that these agreements would lead to the emergence of groups and interests, which, in turn, would alleviate pressure some hardliners seek to impose on Damascus. Foreign Minister Farouq Al-Sharaa said recently that endorsement of the "Syria Accountability Act", which would be probed in the US Congress on 16th September next, would harm American companies operative in Syria, taking into account that the American "Conoco" along with the French "Fina Elf" won the biggest gas investment project at a cost of 420 million dollars.
At the entrance of Al-Wafraa road, 35 kilometers south of the capital Kuwait, a Kuwaiti investor has set up a private veterinary hospital on a large piece of land to take care of pets.
Care for the animals and birds includes a hairdresser's specialized in the hairstyles of dogs at the owner's demand. It also includes a swimming pool to wash them and a yard for strolling or running in the open air.
Their owners had, before the establishment of the hospital, to take them to the UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, or Bahrain for treatment there or resort to some insalubrious and medically unqualified houses, which exposed them to the danger of death, thus losing high sums of money.

Ahead of the end of the war on Iraq, it was certain that Israel would be one of the winners of this war in three fields: strategic, political and economic.
Israeli profits According to a recent study compiled by the Israeli Ministry of Finance and published in Israeli local newspapers, the Hebrew State will make profits worth 17.5 billion pounds in the coming five years due to the aggression on Iraq.
As for the private sector, Israeli companies are vying for operating their investment works in Iraq in the field of energy, infrastructure and real estate.
"The company is making ready to buy crude oil from Iraq via Turkey. In the first stage, it is expected to cover about 10 percent of Israel's total oil imports, but the quantity will increase in the future," Bazan General Director Yeshar bin Mordkhai told Al-Majalla.
Oil and dreams In the energy field in particular, there are some contradictory statements made by the Iraqi minister of oil, who told the aforementioned editor, "We have no interest in making Israel participate or cooperating with it in the field of oil pumping or reviving Kirkuk-Haifa oil pipeline, and you shouldn't dream of that, either."
Yadiot Aharonot emphasized this fact, as its economic editor said, "Pentagon sources advised Israel to seek the participation of Egyptian and Jordanian companies in bids, as this will contribute, from the political point of view, to involving Israel in Iraq's reconstruction projects which are estimated at billions of dollars.
It seems that when Israeli newspapers published news about the companies' current arrangements they were embarrassed or officially brought into account.
In an interview with Yadiot Aharonot, Prof. John Tailor, an influential economic figure in the White House said, "I call on Israeli companies to participate in the efforts of reconstructing Iraq and I hope such companies can exploit such a big opportunity."
They can also sell Israeli products in Iraq whether individually or through participation with other bodies."
Israeli Haaretz newspaper published statements by Israeli Minister of Trade and Industry Ehud Olmert following his return from the World Economic Forum in Amman in which he said that he would reconsider the issue of amalgamating Israeli and Jordanian companies in projects in Iraq.

There are also thousands of prisoners who were released by the former regime who constitute sabotage groups against public order, he added.
FORMER BAATHISTS ANNOUNCE NEW PARTY FOR REFORM, DEMOCRACY

In his customary way, Al-Azhar Grand Sheikh Dr. Mohamed Sayyed Tantawi has solved the problem triggered by a fatwa (religious opinion) passed by Al-Azhar Fatwa Committee member Al-Nabawi Mohamed Al-Esh where he banned the recognition of the Transitional Governing Council in Iraq.
Tantawi, nevertheless, preferred to trigger other issues in his statements reported by semi official Middle East News Agency when he talked about Al-Azhar's role outside Egypt. He said, "I'm Al-Azhar's Sheikh for Egypt and cannot interfere into Iraq's scholars by passing religious opinions on their behalf." He added, "No Egypitan scholar has got the right to talk about any country." This is the first time since Al-Azhar was established over a thousand years ago that Al-Azhar Sheikh has passed an opinion confining Al-Azhar's role to Egypt alone.
Political experts, on the other hand, thought that the crisis had made Al-Azhar's role in dealing with political issues open to discussion.
Yesterday, the Egyptian government started a new system aiming at the enhancement of liaison channels between the government and the Egyptian parliament and Al-Shura Council. Their political and executive terms of reference will be determined by the government to fill in the gaps which appeared in the last 30 years.
It is noteworthy that the decree has been endorsed by the Supreme Judiciary Council.
It also witnessed division of opinion over the party's attitude towards the presidential candidature system.
Differences cropped up in Al-Azhar due to a fatwa (religious opinion) issued by Fatwa Committee in Al-Azhar and signed by the committee member Sheikh Nabawi Mohmed Al-Esh. The fatwa forbids recognizing the interim Governing Council in Iraq considering it as "illegitimate".
Tantawi described the relation between all these Iraqi sects as "more sensitive than the Americans can imagine," pointing out that "the American Administration should persuade the Iraqis that they have come neither to loot the Iraqi oil nor to occupy Iraq and that they came only to liberate them from oppression and to enable them to regain stability".
Al-Hayat learnt that Sheikh Nabawi Al-Esh was expected to be referred to an investigation committee to listen to his reasons for issuing that fatwa without referral to his bosses, especially that he is not well versed in fatwa.
The second aspect is Arab and Islamic countries' dealing with that council, which is religiously impermissible, as it is recognition of an illegitimate condition. Anything that leads to consolidating occupation is religiously and legally impermissible. Therefore, any means that recognizes occupation must be totally boycotted."
The report which was prepared by the Egyptian Trade Bureau in Jeddah and was received by Trade Representation Authority in Cairo pointed out that the Egyptian exports to the Saudi market had achieved a remarkable rise in 2002, recording about $133.6 million, an increase of $17.8 million and a rate of 15% against the exports achieved in 2001 while Egyptian imports from Saudi Arabia went down in 2002 even before the issuance of anti-dumping decrees against imports of polyethylene and polyester of Saudi origin, to hit about $344.4 million in toto.

Al-Alam Al-Youm learnt that important amendments were introduced to dollar interbank rules. Forefront of those rules are allowing each bank to deal on this market and not confining it to certain banks or banking institutions as per the rules before being amended.

Article 17 also was scrapped. It stipulates, "All parties participating in the system and exchange firms may deal directly with dealers outside the system with a rate margin not exceeding 1% of the rates identified by the dealing banks, provided that purchasing and selling rates must not exceed the rate determined by the dealing banks."

EGYPTIAN HUMAN RIGHTISTS PROBE INTO LEGISLATIVE SHORTCOMINGS AGAINST TORTURE CRIMES
He added, "We are also trying to stop the implementation of the emergency law."
Participants in a recent symposium on "Small-sized Parties in the Egyptian Political System" in Cairo said all political factions in Egypt, including the ruling National Democratic Party (NDP), are small-sized. The NDP, the major party in the country, gets its survival and position as a major faction out of the existence of the president of the republic as its leader.
Such factions have made no achievements in the political system and the role of the NDP and opposition parties is still weak.
According to Ahmed Abdel-Hafiz, a cassation lawyer, although the firm constitutional foundation can create a major multiparty basis in such democratic countries as France and Germany, the political party law in Egypt imposes strict restrictions on the formation, policies and existence of new factions. Such constraints have even increased with successive legal amendments.
The first scenario includes the amalgamation of small-sized parties into major ones, based on the fact that the current situation shows that some main parities' parliamentary representation is shrinking, and that existing small factions seceded from major parties and have no weighty political activities.
According to Abdel-Mona'em Said, in spite of problems caused by the party system in Egypt to small parties, the Egyptian elite themselves are to blame for what is happening to such parties as they should move to run a dialogue with the political system and take the society from backwardness to advancement.
Misr 2000 Party leader Fawzi Ghazal ascribed the smallness of parties in Egypt to their lack of grassroots, as well as restrictions on their movement.
EGYPTIAN ELITE'S CLUBS MARKED BY DISTINCTION AND SINGULARITY
According to old members, such an about-face was triggered by several reasons, including an early 1970s decision to open club membership for all societal categories, including institution managers who were former army members and their families. This has unfavourably affected the structure and position of such clubs.
The list of the elites' clubs includes the Royal Car Club at central Cairo Qasr Al-Nile St. This club, though founded in 1924, still keeps its splendor and uniqueness.
The building houses several restaurants and bars.
It also includes Tagamo'h Party leader Refa't al-Said, many ambassadors and university professors, famous actress Faten Hamama (associate member), Central Bank of Egypt Governor Mahmoud Abul-Oyoun and businessmen.
Honourable memberships are granted to many public figures and ministers for one year.

Movie actors and actresses are denied access, except for a few being regarded as businessmen, including Nour al-Sharief, Omar al-Sharief and Samira Ahmed.
The Royal Muhammad Ali Club is situated along the Nile in south Egypt Hawamdia Town, and covers 10 feddans. It is a sports social club built in the royal style. Its entrance includes canons, chariots and a statute of Muhammad Ali.
Like aforementioned clubs, its membership dues are not high, amounting to 15,000 pounds for an individual, and 25,000 pounds for a family. It also enjoys much peculiarity thanks to the small number of its members and daily frequenters, making it a congenial and comfortable place for movie arts, artists, writers, intellectuals and researchers.
It includes heights, plateaus and hills where villas priced at 32 million pounds and rented for 6,000 U.S. dollars per month were constructed.
The club houses many globally styled swimming pools tiled with marble and granite, golf courses sprouting through slopes and plateaus, in addition to conventional halls and business centers.

The committee asked for imposing strict measures in vaccinating animals in order to ban the spread of the disease in other governorates, along with strict measures for combating mosquitoes in animal folds, open bogs and drains, and to discover and quarantine the persons who contracted the disease.
It is well known that the Rift Valley disease spread in the governorate two weeks ago.
A high-ranking Pentagon official proposed to a key officer in the Washington-based Israeli embassy that Tel Aviv offers a detailed plan of operating that pipeline provided that the request remains confidential.

A new round of American-Syrian unofficial talks is to begin today (24th August) in Damascus. The talks are held alternately in Damascus and Washington, in which American and Syrian figures, including thinkers, businessmen and intellectuals, participate in their personal capacity.
Bilateral relations, notably economic and cultural relations, will be broadly discussed too.
In its latest monthly report issued on 26th August, the US Department of Commerce said the gross value of goods and commodity exchange between Saudi Arabia and the United States totaled $12 billion roughly in the first half of 2003, up 54% or more than $4 billion in comparison to the same period last year. It is to be noted that the Saudi-US as well as international trade reported a sharp decline during the first quarter of 2002.
Analysts with the US commercial representative office noted that Saudi Arabia became, for the first time, America's biggest trade partner in the Middle East in five years thanks to the big increase in the total value of bilateral trade exchange during the first months of this year.
The date when this new mechanism would be launched is still ambiguous. Meanwhile, the cabinet declared last Wednesday that the mechanism would start operation early next November. Others asserted that the mechanism could not be launched without the approval of the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) board of directors, which has not been formed yet. It is difficult to launch the dollar interbank on the date determined by the cabinet, accordingly.
- Non-Availability of foreign exchange liquidity in banks that would enable them to actively participate in the dollar interbank. All banks suffer from severe shortage in foreign exchange resources.
EGYPT'S FOREIGN CURRENCY EARNERS OUTWEIGH SPENDING
Foreign exchange earners belong to neither exporters nor travel agents, he said, referring to some exporters' objection to supplying 75 percent of their foreign currency resources to banks pursuant to a governmental order aimed to resolve the foreign monetary crisis.
Egyptian parliamentarians agreed to submit a request for an urgent legislative amendment of the new banking act even before the elapse of one year since its application. The parliamentarians demand that the penalties on dealing in foreign exchange inside Egypt be aggravated in the payment of wages, selling of services, durable goods, etc. within the framework of activating the new government decree of banning anybody's dealing in foreign currencies inside Egypt so that dealings with Egyptians would be confined to the Egyptian pound. They emphasized that the new amendment of the penalty would emphasize that dealings in any currency other than the domestic one is regarded as a crime the perpetrator of which must be subjected to criminal penalties, besides those persons' involvement in speculations in foreign currencies on the banking market.
Said Al Alfi, head of the parliamentary economic committee said that the CBE would have an active role in the issuance of decrees regarding the market in the coming period and in light of the new government decrees. It would also minimize the circulation of foreign exchange cash outside the banking system, thus preventing foreign currency infiltrating into the black market. Moreover, dealing in the pound in Egypt would also ease pressure on the dollar which would then reach a real rate of exchange, which would also help the Egyptians pound reach its real and actual value.
He pointed out that the delegation of the World Bank and the Economic Cooperation Organization for Development which visited Cairo recently had emphasized Egypt's abidance by the application of 28% of international "governance" principles, which is an unprecedented achievement. Egyptian Capital Market Authority chairman was, therefore, nominated as official spokesman on "governance" principles on behalf of the Arab world and the Middle East region in an international conference to be held in Paris next month.
Such a bill is expected to be referred to the Egyptian parliament for endorsement in its next session.

Banks were currently studying increasing interest rates on deposits, investment certificates and saving coffers in the Egyptian pound, banking sources announced.
Al-Wafd newspaper learnt that a strong trend inside the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) was trying to pump extra amounts of dollar on the banking market.

The factory uses German and French technologies in manufacturing CDs, she said, adding that it produces around 6 million CDs annually that can be increased according to the needs of the domestic market as well as the regional one, which will be paid more attention in the next stage.
What about its successes and failures?
Unsuccessful deals To follow up the privatization program one can find that up till now the government failed to fully apply this program to 30 companies that were put up for sale, including Egypt for Car Trade, Mokhtar Ibrahim for Constructions, Febro, Helnan Hotel, Omar Effendi, Sednaoui, Rakta, Benzion, Transport and Engineering company, Al-Nasr for Tanning Hides, General Egyptian Company for Buildings and Electrical Projects, and Red Sea for Constructions.
The privatization program also could attract direct investments from 6 foreign companies, namely, France, America, England, Greece, Mexico and Portugal. Most of these countries' investors bought cement companies. Generally, 29 companies have been sold to an anchor investor at a value of LE6.796 billion.
High debts The privatization program sluggishness was ascribed by a lot of experts to the increase in debts due on Public Enterprise Sector companies, which hit, according to Public Enterprise Sector Minister's report, around LE29 billion with annual interest rate to the tune of LE1.5 billion, let alone non-banking debts of creditors including suppliers, Insurance and Electricity ministries.
LOCAL DEBTS SURGING UP: CBE

GOVERNMENT TO COMPENSATE CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES
Ministries have been assigned reviewing the construction contracts that have been affected by the rise of rates of exchange due to foreign components on condition that this should be concluded between every ministry and the contractors it deals with, Solyman said.
Total investment costs of these companies reached LE91 billion, a rate of 43%. The industrial companies also contributed to the addition of 670 thousand new job opportunities.
The program aims at providing an opportunity for training in rice production technologies as a main vital crop for the bulk of developing countries peoples.
EGYPT RANKED 3RD AMONG BENEFICIARIES OF "CAID" AID
The joint investment ventures totaled about 71 in number, the report said, adding that the Canadian contribution to that capital increased to 353 million pounds last year against 347 million pounds in 2001, an increase of 1.7%.

He said that the agreement would be signed after the end of the month of Ramadan, adding that the memo of understanding would contain the Indian party's commitment to the standards which would be specified by the Egyptian party. It will also contain the means through which information should be exchanged about livestock health and the exchange of technical delegations between the two countries to agree upon certain mechanisms for importing Indian frozen meat. He pointed out that there was an agreement between the two governments to specify four levels for control over meat to ensure its safety. It includes conducting laboratory tests by Indian government bodies on livestock before slaughtering them and the commitment to the specified standards by Indian slaughterhouses and factories.

Hussein told Asharq Al-Awsat that the Egypt-based AOI primarily aims at developing the Iraqi industry sector. The visit of AOI delegation to Iraq was positive in spite of the fact that no contracts have been signed during the visit, Hssein said, pointing out that the beginning of next year will witness the conclusion of agreements and signature of contracts.
Regarding the current and the expected competitions, Hussein said, "We went to Iraq bearing in mind that there are several companies who seek to undertake Iraq reconstruction projects particularly the American, French and German companies.

The Arab free trade zone would secure an expansion opportunity for markets, accommodation of modern technologies, orientation for increasing production, improvement of products and services quality, attraction of foreign funds, increase of inter-Arab trade and easy access to international markets.
DAMASCUS CALLS ON WASHINGTON TO OPEN AMERICAN UNIVERSITY
It is worth mentioning that JBIGP American delegation met with the Syrian president Bashar Assad yesterday. In the meeting, Assad called on Washington to better understand the region civilization and its peoples interests.
The scientists considered also the reports presented by Egypt and other Arab countries warning of radioactive contamination in the region.
Discussed too in the functions of the conference was Israeli occupation forces' use of depleted uranium and uranium-238 contained munitions against Palestinian civilians and their negative effects on Palestinian posterity, development and economy in the Palestinian occupied territories.
In the meantime, Ahmed bin Heli, AL Secretary-General Assistant for Political Affairs, said, "It is Iran and not the USA which asked to attend the official meetings of the Arab Foreign Ministers as an observer. The Legal Administration at the AL is currently preparing a regulation including rights and duties of new observers and their right to attend AL open meetings, not closed-door meetings and the inability to vote for draft resolutions".
The ten Nile basin countries are now seeing tangible progress and prosperity. There is an agreement among these countries on exploiting the annual surplus of water estimated at around 92 percent of waterfall on an annual basis, he said.

Israeli press sources pointed out that the decision of the rabbis at settlements runs counter to decisions of most of rabbis in Israel, who believe, according to Jewish religious teachings, that entering the Al-Quds at present is "illegal pursuant to Jewish teachings".
Under this headline, Abdel-Wahab Badrakhan of Al-Hayat wrote an article on page 9, which ran to the following effect only in part: This time Donald Rumsfeld did not come to Iraq to boast of victory, but rather to check how bad conditions are and to raise the morale of the American forces and the civil administration.
Rumsfeld could not promise to increase the build-up simply because there are no more forces on hand.
Therefore, Rumsfeld did not mind using this sudden visit to Iraq for poisoning regional climates the Rumsfeld's known way.
Anyhow, if there were any foreign interventions in Iraq, it would simply be the result of American behaviour and arrogance during their preparations for the war and which characterized their bearing in the first days in Baghdad after its fall.
Any country of real weight cannot just send forces to support American occupation. Nor is it likely that any legitimacy can be given in advance to American harboured regional scheme. Neither can financial aid be extended just to enable American companies to grab all investments in Iraq.
Asharq Al-Awsat learnt that the local popular councils general secretariat in 26 Egyptian govenorates started to review their members' conscription status in light of complaints about some of their members being draft dodgers.
Anybody who will be proven to be draft dodgers will have his membership dropped. All members were notified of that decision and the popular local councils started to receive any papers or documents that prove the conscription status of their members in a bid to take the legal procedures after ensuring the seriousness of the complaints and warned against any attempts to offer false documents as that would be legally punishable.
Al Arabi learnt from well-informed American sources that the American Administration and some diplomats in the Middle East are entirely convinced that Al Azhar Fatwa (religious opinion) Committee constituted a threat to the American interests not only in Egypt and the Middle East but also in the Islamic world in toto.
The sources said that the Grand Sheikh promised to take the necessary measures with the committee members and bring to book those who are responsible for such religious opinions and change the system of selecting the committee members and even cancel it altogether if necessary and try to do with Dar Al Ifta of (Religious Opinions Headquarters) and consider the latter the only body concerned with the issuance of religious opinions in Egypt.
ISLAMIC SCHOLARS : THE FATWA IS LEGAL AND IGC GROUP OF OCCUPATION STOOGES
His reverence replied that no Egyptian scholar was entitled to talk about the affairs of another country. The legitimacy of the Iraqi Governing Council (IGC) is an Iraqi affair and it is up to them to decide whether it is legitimate or illegitimate. "As Al Azhar Grand Sheikh in Egypt, I have no right to meddle with Iraq's scholars as such matters lie in their terms of reference.
I personally told his excellency the American ambassador that the Americans had better hand over government to the Iraqis.
A: Who said that? You are Egyptians and therefore have nothing to do with such matter.
Q: Yes, they are Iraqis, but they are also American stooges, are not they?
Mass media hide many things, otherwise why aren't we told the number of the Americans killed by the Iraqi resistance?
Dr. Abdel Sabour Marzouk emphasizes that Jihad against the American presence by all possible means like supporting the Iraqi resistance, which is the least we can do is an individual duty. It is really disgraceful to see the Arab region, for all its wealth and capabilities, just onlookers who content themselves with wishful thinking due to the gravity of the current situation. They would just continue their passive looking on even when the worst comes to the worst and when all the Arab region finds itself swept and overrun by the American Zionist flood!
Firstly the increase in anti-America resistance operations in Iraq no matter at what cost in terms of souls and money. Resistance of occupation, is natural and not all resistance in Iraq is carried out by Saddam's commandos.
Dean of Sharia Faculty, Dr. Salah Zeidan asks America if the IGC for which America came to Iraq really achieved democracy for the establishment of which it came to the region.
Dr. Abdel Sabour adds: Regarding the argument that such a council pays allegiance and is loyal to the Americans, which Arab ruler now is not subservient to American wishes? When it comes to the Iraqi people choice of the council and the implementation of the Shura (consultation) principle, I wonder where is that principle of consultation being adopted in any Arab country?
Youssef, adds that history abounds in examples of Al Azhar scholars who had their resignation ready in their pockets, to quote them in literally. They were ready to tell the truth to the face of everybody at whatever costs, a talent which we lack today. Al Azhar Grand Sheikh should at least have kept quiet and not referred the man to investigation. We are supposed to be living in a democratic stage as is often said so this Sheikh should have given the chance to express himself freely.
"The return to right is a favourable thing, and the presence of the Islamic trend on the political arena can by no means be ignored. Advocates of the freedom and right of political leaders to express themselves cannot ignore the presence of the Islamic trend."
Egypt's former ambassador to Israel Mohamed Bassiouni said Tel Aviv had earlier declined to work with Cairo to stop illegal activities and tunnels across their borders. He told the Asharq Al-Awsat daily that over the last years and since Egypt restored its Sinai territories, the Israeli government has been refusing to cooperate with Egypt to close border tunnels and curb activities of Israeli mafias who used such tunnels in drug trafficking and other illegal activities. Such topics were discussed during the regular meetings held between both countries' military liaison committees since the peace accord was signed.
GARBAGE TON IN CAIRO EQUIV. TO LE6000
A ton of refuse in Cairo consists of 65% organic materials (vegetables, fruit and bread scraps), 15% paper, 3% glass, 3% plastic, 3% cloth, 1% bones, 1% metals and 9% other materials, he noted, pointing out that the economic value of this refuse was very high. The cheapest component collected from refuse is scrap and the highest is copper and aluminum. Price of glass ranges between LE50 and LE80. glass ton collected from refuse is recycled and used in glass production once again except crystal because it is made from high-quality materials. Old clothes price is LE25 per ton.
The Supreme Constitutional Court's explanation, which declared as null and void the membership of those deputies who failed to join the army or were legally exempted (through setting the status of draft dodgers), has created several surprises in the Egyptian People's Assembly and civil society milieus. Dr. Hermes Radwan, a draft dodger MP, said there are around 9 million Egyptian young men who were exempted from military service or who exceeded the legal conscription age and paid a fine to obtain a relevant exemption certificate.
Parliamentary sources suspected that draft dodgers' memberships might be dropped, noting that only five members were threatened. Therefore, the constitutional and consultative committees will examine each case separately and compile relevant detailed reports in a bid to slim the number of outgoing deputies. In the meantime, some MPs said they would present a new draft law to fend off the fallout of the court interpretation, possibly allowing those draft dodgers to run for legislative elections under specific conditions and cases.
3 COOPERATIVE ARRANGEMENTS SIGNED WITH SUDAN Yesterday, three co-operation agreements were signed between Egypt and Sudan.
Minister of Supply and Domestic Trade, Dr. Hassan Khidr pointed out that the Sudanese meat would be put on the markets at the co-operatives affiliated to the Supply Commodities Authority at LE16 per kilogram.
The paper added that the value of the deal would amount to two billion dollars to partially cover the needs of the Israeli Electricity Company for 15 years.
The paper noted that Sharon justified his refusal by saying that the Palestinian National Authority should be deprived of its share in any deal to deny the alleged terrorist organizations access to such funds.
The group plans to export cars to COMESA members and Egypt's neighboring countries.
The agency question was the first step that drove Abul-Fotouh to court, pushing the BMW to seek a substitute as it was concerned about its reputation.
NEW ELECTRICITY PROJECTS BETWEEN EGYPT AND SYRIA
EGYPTIAN SOURCES OFFICIALLY DENY COMMERCIAL COOPERATION WITH ISRAEL
They added that the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Businessmen Association had set a negative list of the members who dealt with Israel in the name of the Federation and the Association as members were free to deal with any market in their names only and, therefore, nobody could have anything to do with that dealing.
The data uncover that Israeli exports to Lebanon through a third country had risen by 151%, thus reaching about $300 thousand.
Some banking leaderships asked Finance Minister Medhat Hassnein to explicitly stipulate that merged banks be given taxes advantages within the framework of the fresh bill that aims at "establishing an efficient tax reform to provide the state's treasury with necessary financial resources along with ensuring the achievement of tax justice and creating a suitable climate for investment."
The number of banks affiliated to the Central Bank of Egypt is 64 including 15 foreign bank branches.
The mini-cabinet under Prime Minister Atef Ebeid on Tuesday discussed a governmental plan to control commodity prices at markets and keep the customs U.S. dollar at LE5.35 in a bid to support basic commodities imported by the private sector.
Markets are now being followed up through emergency cells at cabinet ministries concerned.
The plan, presented by Abdel-Mona'em Bakhit, General Manager of the federation, envisions conferences, seminars, symposia and workshops on important issues pertinent to the federation and programs to boost the awareness of fundamentals of foreign trade as part of a project to reform trade and modernize information infrastructure by developing the federation's current network and building a new connection network to be carried out within 4-5 months. The modern network will link the different chambers and the federation, absorb the largest possible amount of data and activate the specialized committees' activities by working out a plan of action setting obstacles impeding industry and referring possible problems to these committees to prepare a report on them and set the federation's positions on industrial draft laws, including the bills on companies, credit incentive guarantees, income tax, small-sized projects and building.
Export suspension decrees recently taken by Premier Dr. Atef Ebeid have uncovered confusion in government performance.
These decrees have also uncovered the lack of any specific strategy for boosting Egyptian exports.
Deposits with Egyptian banks increased to about 410 billion pounds till late July 2003 against 402.4 billion pounds in June 2003 and 335.3 billion pounds in May 2003. A recent report by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) pointed out that governmental deposits hit 68.3 billion pounds during the same period, of which the equivalent of 19.8 billion pounds are in foreign currencies and 48.5 billion pounds are in domestic currency.
Governor of the Central Bank of Egypt Dr. Mahmoud Abul-Oyoon admitted to the depreciation of the pound by 81% during the period from 2000 to 2003.
"We will step in and pump foreign exchange into the market to strike a balance and meet all demands when the necessity arises," he said.
Abul-Oyoon accused exchange firms of malpractices and manipulation, saying that such firms should have been closed down during the last period due to such practices.
While the CBE governor Mahmoud Aboul-Oyoun blamed some exchange companies for the rise in the dollar rate of exchange and asked that such companies' role should be reconsidered. Exchange Division Chairman Mohamed Hassan Al-Abyadh defended exchange companies and said, "We would stop this activity at once if this were in the interest of national economy.
He added that the current price of the dollar was exaggerated and far from reflecting the reality of the economy. He said that it was a "speculative" price which would soon disappear.
The governor said, "The rate of exchange has fluctuated several times since it was deregulated till it settled in banks at the 616 piasters level. This, nevertheless, does not mean that that was the rate at which the dollar stopped.
Aboul-Oyoun pointed out that the Egyptian pound had lost about 81% of its value during the period from 2000 to 2003 due to several attempts to reform the exchange market. The CBE rate moved from 339 piasters to 370 piasters. In January 2001, it moved to 385 piasters while allowing a 1% margin for banks.
What is happening in auto market and what is the cause behind this continuous rise?
The price of 1300-class cars imported from Japan such as Lancer and Toyota exceeds 130,000 to near 140,000 pounds. It is worth mentioning that the price of such cars ranged between 80 and 90 thousand pounds. This indicates the devaluation of pound, something which necessitates fixing the customs dollar rate so that customs will decline by the same rate and then balance be achieved on market.
Deputy chairman of the United Company for Marketing and Cars Ahmed al-Basioni said that the rise in car prices is equal to the rise in dollar rate.
EGYPTIAN BANKS PREPARING TO OPEN BRANCHES IN IRAQI MARKET WHEN SECURITY CONDITIONS STABILIZE
At the top of such a group was the American GB Morgan Chess Bank.
The source regarded the entry of Egyptian banks as tantamount to a rehabilitation of Iraqi banks operative there as well as the establishment of other banks. He preferred starting such a step once the bad conditions undergone by Iraq came to an end.
LE4.9 BN WORTH OF TRADE BALANCE DEFICIT
STATE'S DOLLAR REVENUES INFILTRATE INTO BLACK MARKET!
Dr. Othman uncovered that part of the state's dollar revenues infiltrated into the parallel (black) market. He admitted that there was speculation in the dollar on the market.
Banks, on the other hand, continued refraining from providing dollars for the public, which means that the exchange market in Egypt is characterized by randomness.
"The measures taken by Egypt to remove some obstacles and restrictions before the foreign investor are not enough," it said.
The study also uncovered other international factors that led investments to geographically be diverted to other countries, apart from Egypt and the Middle East. These factors include the economic about-face in East European countries that attracted Western, American, and Japanese capital, causing a geographical diversion of investments flowing into developing countries including Egypt.
2.2 MILLION TOURISTS VISITED EGYPT OVER SIX MONTHS
The United Kingdom had the fourth place, with around 149,200 Britons having visited Egypt and spent 985,800 nights in the six-month period, followed by France (141,800 visitors and 1.84 nights), and Saudi Arabia (77,800 visitors and 550,000 nights).
Head of the Executive Body at the General Authority of Tourism Development Major General Magdi Al-Kobysie announced that the construction of 5149 hotel rooms had been completed and the rooms were expected to start operating by the end of this year.
AL-AZHAR TURNS DOWN RUSSIAN DEMAND TO JOIN OIC
How can we, then, approve of Russia joining the OIC while they are killing Muslims in Chechnya," he said.
It seems that the new academic year which will start in Egypt in the middle of this month will be heated in terms of the relation between the government and Muslim Brotherhood. Yesterday, the Egyptian authorities launched a crackdown on university students belonging to the group in Alexandria governorate.
They inquired whether arresting students enhanced the alleged democracy, the sense of belonging and loyalty to the country.
Responding to inquiries by several MPs, the Ministry of Petroleum sent a report to the People's Assembly denying any intention to hold negotiations or talks with Israel over this file, terming such rumours as totally divorced from reality.
A recent survey conducted by the National Social and Criminal Research Center showed that the number of married people who are increasingly getting violent due to social and financial pressure was on the increase.
It also showed that 86 percent of women and 96 percent of men favour the use of violence in punishing wives, she said, ascribing that to a misunderstanding of religious fundamentals.
All that should constitute an alarm sounded for three parties - those who live on the theatre of events and the people of the area, which is affected by the Iraqi role. The third party is the USA, which struck off Saddam Hussein's regime and opened the Iraqi theatre to the unknown.
The Iraqis face two urgent tasks; shortening the occupation period and closing the Iraqi arena to those who seek chances for engagement with the Americans.
The Iraqi tumult that is still in the offing augurs the exportation of fire as the character of the conflicts triggered by it cannot be controlled at international borders.
The less costly option is certainly this: shortening the occupation period and closing the arena through granting the UN a real role in expediting the transfer of power to the Iraqis.
Within the framework of the series of American provocations and pressure against Saudi Arabia, America has invented a new technique in its provocation campaign against the Kingdom. The visa forms contain provocative and humiliating questions. Women, for instance, have to answer the question: Have you ever worked as a prostitute?
Saudi perfume market topped 2.5 billion Saudi riyals ($666 million), exclusive of cosmetics, amidst expectations by trade sources to soar up to 3 billion Saudi riyals ($800 million) next year, up 30%.
SUDAN ASKS AMERICA FOR COMPENSATING VICTIMS OF KHARTOUM MEDICINE FACTORY
ISRAELI FIRMS CONTRACTED WITH US ARMY IN IRAQ
Israeli Tami Arb'a for water refinement started moving its equipment to Iraq in the recent months to launch many infrastructure projects there together with another Israeli company for producing armoured "multi-lock" doors.
The decision was taken last month after Israeli businessmen's meeting with Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The official, who asked for anonymity, said the delegation paid a field visit to Baghdad and an air tour was organized for it aboard a US helicopter over Mosul, Tikrit and Ramadi to check security positions in these cities.
IRAQ'S NEW MINISTERS: TECHNOCRATS, POLITICIANS FROM IRAQ'S NATIONALITIES AND SECTS
His presence in the Ministry of Planning will prove crucial for the form, which will be taken by the Iraqi economy, which inherited the burdens of the public sector and the state of militarization.
Some people think that the Minister of Youth and Sports, Ali Faik Al Ghaban ( candidate of Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq) and Minister of Higher Education. Zeyad Abdel Raziq Aswad (Muslim Brotherhood) represent an orientation that would lend an Islamic trait to the building of the youths' character, which secularist parties look at with some suspicion. There is a strong presence for the technocrats in the cabinet.
Some old Iraqi ministries disappeared in the new formation such as the ministries of Defence and Information (dissolved under a decree of the American top civil administrator in Iraq Paul Bremer). Nor is there a Ministry of Waqfs ( religious endowments) as the Governing Council assumied the Premier's role tended to form an authority supervised by personalities who would run Sunnite Waqfs, others who would run Shiite Waqfs and others who would run Christian Waqfs.
He expected that Major General Naguib Al-Salhi, the movement's Secretary General, would assume the leadership of that apparatus which would include professional security forces reflecting the new Iraq picture. Its personnel are respectable and would be obeyed by the Iraqi people, according to a memo on setting up the apparatus issued by the American Civil Administration in Iraq.
Those observers think that the American Administration had made two errors; the first when it dissolved the Iraqi army, thus causing collapse of Iraq's international border checkpoints and the second error was monopolizing the security file and directly supervising it without the participation of any other party.
It can also contend that the transitional Iraqi Governing Council (IGC) was born under the umbrella of occupation and carries the American administrator's fingerprints on that Arab country.
Syria can take a hardline position that may seal all doors. Such a position, nonetheless, would deprive Syria itself of having any effect on Iraq.
Nor does it have any interest in placing Iraq on the road to partitioning or in the eruption in Iraq of a long conflict that would detract attention from the Palestinian cause so that priority would be given to fending off the Iraqi danger instead of involvement in terminating the Israeli occupation.
If we take into account the assets of relations and friendships Syria has with political forces affiliated to various Iraqi players in the arena, we can safely say that the Syrian new position qualifies Damascus for a bigger role in the encouragement of Iraqis to dialogue and consensus, a role in crystallizing an Arab position that would encourage the tendency to give the UN a bigger role in Iraq to ensure a quick transfer of power to the Iraqis together with ensuring the country's indignity.
They also denied any Jordanian offer to send its ambassador to Tel Aviv in exchange for releasing Jordanian prisoners in Israel.
Sudanese Information Minister, Al-Zahawi Ibrahim Malek announced that the plane (28th August) destroyed by the army on Thursday on a tarmac near Karnoi area to the north of Darfur was rented by SPLA (Sudan People's Liberation Army) led by Dr Garang, from a British company to transport provisions and ammunitions as well as officers to support Darfur rebels who operate in the West of the country.
It also transported leaderships of Al-Dinka tribe, from which Garang descended, to Serir Mountain area in the governorate of West Darfur to participate in training other active groups in the region which are mostly affiliated to Sudan Liberation Movement security general, and to the rebellion leader in Morrah Mountain area, lawyer Abdel-Wahid.
In a statement issued by the committee, it called for releasing not only Hizbullah POWs and the sick or those who received heavy severances as well as the POWs of Al-Aqsa Mosque Intifada who led the field operations and received heavy sentences or were kept incommunicado or in solitary confinements.
He added that the development of agricultural trade between Arab countries was the only chance to boost their exports to European and international markets. Geweili warned that the standard specifications set by the European Union for its agricultural imports would deny Arab agricultural products access to European markets. Geweili said that the Food and Agriculture Organization FAO had defined food specifications, which were also approved by the World Trade Organization (WTO).
"We don't want to withdraw from OPEC, as this will not be in the interest of Iraq or its friends and neighbours," Chalabi said in statements to the Qatari Jazeera satellite channel.
Asharq Al-Awsat learnt from a diplomatic source with the Iranian foreign ministry that the ban decree had been attributed to the detention of former Iranian ambassador to Argentina Hadi Solaiman in Britain on a request by Buenos Aires and the attempts to detain the consultant of the Iranian embassy in Holland who returned to Iran one hour after his detention which lasted only for one hour after telling the Dutch authorities that he was a diplomatic passport holder. The ban covers those who were judicially pursued by foreign countries or those who were suspected of involvement in security cases.
According to such information, the plan against Arafat had 5 scenarios:
- His trial: arresting him and sending him to Israel for trial there.
According to Israeli military, it would not be possible to warn all those inside Ramallah as there is an agreement and the implementation of the operation cannot take place without victims.
Israel was not sure where Arafat would be expelled, according to the information.
According to an officer in that unit, "The death opportunity which he missed seems to have come back to him."

One of the strategies used by imperialism is triggering factional, sectarian, and ethnic sedition among Muslims in implementation of the colonialist principle.

As regards the size of support that would be presented by the fund to bankroll the procurement of modernization equipment, Al-Talatli said, "A manufacturer has to bear 30% of finance cost, while the fund will bear the remaining 70% of the cost." The fund, he said, would have more than one means of support including bearing the differential between the simple interest rate and commercial one imposed by banks on financing the procurement of equipment.
Official sources at the Holding Company for Spinning and Weaving uncovered that banks refused to open credits in foreign exchange for companies and called on them to procure their dollar needs via the black market.
The sources expected the monthly sales volume of spinning and weaving companies, which hit some 190 million pounds, to plummet sharply due to that crisis. It is expected not to exceed 90 million pounds, the sources added.
In a memo submitted to Premier Dr. Atef Ebeid, the Holding Company for Spinning and Weaving pointed out the importance of providing financial assistance to spinneries in order to save affiliate companies from incurring losses due to hikes in the prices of the cotton allocated to them this year by at least 70% compared with last year. It expected that failure to cash the subsidy estimated as at LE50 per kantar would mean losses incurred to affiliate companies alone estimated at about LE18 million every month. Deputy chairman of Textile Industries Chamber, Abdel Wahab Al Sharqawi pointed out that the yarn imported so far did not exceed 4 thousand kantars and falls short of meeting the needs of even a single company. What is required, therefore, is importing 2.5 million kantars and securing the foreign exchange required for that.

The Russian market is still insecure despite security improvement and the shift of the Russian mafia into facilitation and mediation offices. This insecurity is still a problem facing the Egyptian exporter, in addition to other problems such as the high cost of air transportation and the lack of regular routes with Russia, thus rendering Egypt's exports uncompetitive due to the high cost of transportation, Bata indicated.

REQUEST OF FRENCH JEWS OF EGYPTIAN ORIGIN REFERRED TO ANTIQUITIES AUTHORITIES
Well-informed diplomatic sources said that the Ministry of Culture and the Supreme Council of Antiquities as well as other bodies, are discussing the matter and preparing a reply to it especially how far the antiquities act would allow foreign bodies to contribute to such renovation operations. They pointed out Egypt's care about renovating all such property and antiquities whether Islamic, Christian or Jewish without any need to intervention from any party as such a heritage is part of Egypt's civilization, adding that Egypt would never let it be tampered with, spoilt or neglected. This is what the reply to the society's request is expected to contain.
Israel has been in the habit not only of destroying but also stealing human heritage especially Arab and Islamic ones as was the case with some customs and traditions like foods and popular folklore which are Arab but were alleged to be Jewish heritage.
It seems that the Israeli embassy's work has prospered so much so that head of the Jewish community in Egypt Emil Russo asked the "parent ministry" to increase the biannual quota so that work can forge ahead.
The aforesaid figures are mentioned in the Egyptian Foreign Ministry's book of the diplomatic corps members who are accredited to the Arab Republic of Egypt. The number of Israeli diplomatic members equals that of five Arab countries, namely Syria, 7 members; the UAE, 10; Qatar, 7; Bahrain, 7; and Mauritania, 4. The number of the Israeli diplomats is also twofold that of the Libyan embassy officials, 16 diplomats.

The Israeli diplomats also are eightfold that of the Mauritanian embassy and threefold that of the Palestinian embassy.
PA deputy Hamdin Sabbahi, one of the MPs who presented an urgent request for notification to the Prime Minister says that the motivations that pushed him to table this inquiry was a statement by former ambassador Abullah Al-Husseini who pointed out that the Israeli embassy had turned into a centre for recruiting spies.

Egyptian authorities picked up seven leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan), including former member of parliament Gamal Hishmat, while they were meeting together in Hismat's house in Damanhour City in Beheira Governorate in Delta.
What is happening is the continuation of a policy we hope that it will come to a halt especially at this crucial time in the country. It is illogical for a group of people to be collared for just getting together in the house of one of them to have dinner even though they did not harm anyone and no complaint was lodged by the neighbours against them."
MP Seif Eddin Dawoud demanded putting such statements under public and careful scrutiny by the bodies concerned.
While the Copts in Egypt were looking forward to the meeting of the Holy Council Synod of the Coptic Church to resolve the argument about Pope Antonious monastery in the Red Sea after the return of Pope Shenuda III from his annual visit to the USA which ended in keeping the wall, buying 350 feddans and turning the other 150 feddans into forests, the Copts were shocked at an attempt to codify homosexuality marriages and keep their clerical order in churches untouched.
A statement was issued by the church condemning the homosexuality priest appointment as the Coptic Church considered such a serious matter tantamount to a codification of homosexuality through the approval of marriages between partners of the same sex and more dangerously granting them episcopacy order with the church. The Holy Council's statement condemned such an attitude by the new Hampshire church in America regarding that as contravening the tenets of the Holy Bible and a threat to familial stability, sound matrimony, social ethics, church chastity and the prospects of church unity and the ecumenical movement. Meanwhile, the Copts decried that church's behavior and called for its closure and defrocking its personnel as persona non grata. Consequently Bishop Munir Hanna, head of the Episcopal church in Egypt, issued a statement announcing the homosexual priest installment as rejected.
In important statements to Rose Al Yosef, Minister of Manpower and Emigration Ahmed Al-Amawi said that the Ministry had closed down its bureau in Baghdad immediately after occupation especially as most Egyptian workers there either quit to other countries or returned to Egypt. The remaining part of Egyptians who are still there are mostly married to Iraqi women and are almost permanent residents in Iraq where the Foreign Ministry supervises their affairs.
The statement called on the UN Security Council to impose deterrent sanctions on the aggressors and support the Palestinian people to restore all of their legitimate rights.
Divine rules are unchangeable and unalterable and will inevitably end in victory for those who defend their rights. As for aggressors, they will be losers in the end, he pointed out.

ISRAELI FORGERY!
Under this headline, Al-Wafd correspondent in the Hague Fekria Ahmed writes a report, excerpts of which run to the following effect: The EU decision to blacklist the political wing of Hamas was made under Israeli pressure led by the Israeli Document and Information Center in the Hague, which is supported by Zionist organizations in Europe. European diplomats emphasize that this decision was greenlit by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) itself, which took a decision on last August 24th to freeze the funds of Hamas together with other 8 Islamic organizations in 39 banks and bank branches in Palestine.
Under this headline, Zuhair Qusaibati of Al-Hayat wrote an article, which ran to the following effect: With Ahmed Qureia at the head of the new Palestinian government, Sharon government's goals of burying the Roadmap and interring the resistance and its factions symbols will never alter. This, however, may not prevent some amendments in the Israeli plans in order to exploit the almost complete identification in America and Europe with its attitudes towards the resistance and branding it of terrorism as in the case with Hamas.
Naturally, Qureia's government will find itself surrounded by such a conflagration, Israeli assassinations and raids as well as retaliatory reactions. It, therefore, will not be in a better position than the hundred-day experience, which Abu Mazen had while heading the government.
Europe, which presented Israel with the gift of placing Hamas on the terrorism list, may unconsciously encourage the plans of physical liquidation of the movement leaders and slip into the American concepts that lump armed resistance factions together with criminals and drug rings.
Isn't his war and Sharon's the same?
According to a Palestinian official close to Abu Mazen, the expected scenarios are as follows:
He is given credit by Arafat, the Palestinian street and Tel Aviv.
Abu Mazen's resignation is attributed to a number of reasons at the forefront of which are accumulated differences between him and President Arafat the last of which was the issue of controlling security apparatuses, which was the straw that broke the camel's back, as US-backed Abu Mazen insisted on putting such bodies under the control of Ministry of the Interior headed by Minister of State for Security Affairs Mohamed Dahlan who is totally rejected by Arafat.
The number of officials who demanded a vote of no confidence increased to 55 out of 84 members. It is noteworthy that the number of the council's deputies is 88.
This was also emphasized by Minister of Information Nabil Amr, who is close to Abu Mazen, when he said, "There were some incidents at the opening session of the Legislative Council that strongly did harm to Prime Minister Abu Mazen."
Under this headline, Abdul Wahab Badrakhan, Al-Hayat deputy chief editor wrote an article, which ran to the following effect: Mahmoud Abbas quite obviously defined three reasons for his resignation: the failure of the USA to support his government, lack of Israeli cooperation with his concept of treating the security issue and the failure of the Palestinian President to hand over all his powers to the government!
The USA has contented itself with vague reactions in spite of the gravity of the situation which needed responsible positions on its part. It even did not care, during the last couple of days, to deny Israeli reports of an American approval of expelling Arafat!
He was ready to risk unpopular options in the hope of achieving national interests, as that would be the only possible equation!
What process and what peace?
Sharon and his gang wish that a suicidal operation would, at any moment, take place claiming the lives of scores of Israelis as that would serve as the green light to forge ahead with their plan to occupy Gaza Strip and liquidate Arafat and consequently try to run the chaos emanating from the new position without Oslo, without the PNA, without a government or a Legislative Council.
ISRAEL WARNS ITS CITIZENS AGAINST TRAVELING TO EGYPT
Moreover, some Egyptian hotels provide kosher (food ritually fit for use in Judaism) at low prices and that's why this warning would not work, they added.
In his early youth, he joined Fatah movement, which delegated him to operate within the framework of PLO. He was promoted several times till he was appointed head of the organization's economic department.
The world was, then, surprised by the PLO and Israel reaching a principle accord called Oslo Agreement.
He was thus charged with remissness.

Jordan decided to ban entry of Iraqis into its territories unless they have prior approval from the Jordanian Minister of the Interior. This step on the part of the Jordanian government aims at barring the infiltration of foreign fighters and Iraqi citizens into the Jordanian territories.
Muslim Brotherhood Group in Jordan threatened the European Union countries to boycott them economically by Arab and Islamic people if the European Union insisted on its decision to regard Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) as a terrorist organization.
The group threatened to announce economic boycotting through the issuance of fatwas (religious opinions) because the Islamic law bans supporting the oppressor against the oppressed.
This advice, coinciding with the meeting of Arab foreign ministers in Cairo, was conveyed by the French ambassador in Beirut to Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, who met with him on Monday on the latest regional and international developments.
It is a vital question which, we see, should be thrashed out within the UN Security Council framework. The council is the appropriate place for such negotiations and political approaches."
We see that the problem of Iraq's sovereignty should be in the hands of Iraqis.
An official source in Mosul city said that an Iraqi-Syrian agreement had recently been concluded to provide Mosul and its satellites with Syrian electric power in return for Iraqi oil.
During their stay in Iraqi territories, the Mossad elements enjoyed full American protection, but the American leadership got access to important information referring to Mossad involvement in Mohamed Baqir Al-Hakim as well as scores of other Iraqis' assassination in the blast witnessed by Najaf city recently as well as some other blasts.
The operation of assaulting worshippers in Al Shaab city mosque in Baghdad came in the same context to suggest that the Shiites were retaliating against the Sunnis through that assault. Information, however, emphasized that the perpetrators of such an assault were closely related to the Mossad and American bodies' agents in Iraq.
With regard to Saudi American cooperation in the field of combating terrorism, the US ambassador in an interview with American Time magazine published in its yesterday issue, said, "Now we can see excellent cooperation with the USA in this battle.

An economic survey estimated that the investments necessary for infrastructure projects in Arab countries this decade are around 250 billion U.S. dollars. Such huge investments require Arab banks being financially and professionally capable of actively contributing to securing these necessary needs. Excluding a few Egyptian and Gulf banks, the Arab banking sector, which involves banks and financial institutions specialized in investment and industrial, agricultural and housing borrowing, is still a conventional one in view of its activities, assets and shareholders' rights, the survey warned.
The list of challenges also involve international bank criteria that still regard Arab countries as high-risk nations, a thing which may force all banks in Arab nations to pay more to get financial resources from international markets, not to mention high costs of financing Arab foreign trade operations by public banks inside and outside the Arab world and a shortage of credit lines between Arab and global banks owing to their nature, distributed assets and Arab banks' resorting to cutting their money investment in the Arab world in a bid to keep a sufficient amount of the required capital. The survey termed inter-Arab bank mergers as being still limited, while Europe and America see huge amalgamations involving banks in England and France, with Japanese banks tending to buy American ones. Brokerage and stock companies, and mega accounting offices and businesses were also merged, showing that the world has been ushered into the era of giant entities capable of emulating and coping with fresh variables.
The American Administration in cooperation with Iraqi ministries of foreign affairs and the interior, the transitional Governing Council and US security agencies set up a committee to probe ways of changing entry procedures for Arabs and nationals of Islamic countries who are willing to travel to Iraq for fear of terrorist attacks against coalition forces, the sources said.
Meanwhile, they said, procedures of obtaining an entry visa to Iraq would take longer time in Iraqi embassies in other countries such as Sudan, Libya, Morocco and Algeria until security agencies with these embassies are linked with the FBI through the internet to check the data of travelers and how far they are linked to terrorist groups.
According to economic analysts, the bank withdrawal from real estate financing companies is a step backwards to the pre-1948 Act no.148 issuance stage in 2001. This may lead to market confusion and irregularity of work in the building and construction sector. Real estate financing companies were expected to move the market from the state of recession through selling and leasing operations sponsored by the real estate financing companies especially after two companies had been founded with LE900 million capital through the contribution of public funds in coordination with insurance companies and individual contributions from some contracting companies, the Wakfs (religious endowments) Authority and Housing and Development Bank. This, consequently, boosted hopes of the possibility of solving the problems of Egyptian real estate market and the debts accumulated on the companies to the banking apparatus when the idle stocks of flats and villas are sold out.
The companies linked their contribution with the actual start of the companies' operation and success to avoid losing or freezing the remaining part of the contracting companies' capital after the excruciating crisis which Egyptian real estate market faced.
Officials say that if matters went on as they are, especially under the inability of the government to increase the price of selling electricity to people and stability of prices since 1992, electricity sector would be exposed be to heavy losses, as the Ministry bears 2.4 billion pounds annually as differential of producing and selling electricity in the unified grid. A lot of people including officials in the Ministry of Electricity, People's Assembly (PA) Industry Committee and key businessmen in the (PA) called for reconsidering the prices of categories. It is to be noted that the Ministry of Electricity's Policy Committee called for increasing the tariff of the categories that consume more than 200 K/h. However, well-informed sources said that the Cabinet refused to adopt this proposal for the time being, especially following the deregulation of the exchange rate, which resulted in hiking the prices of some staple commodities.

Premier Dr. Atef Ebeid held a meeting on Sunday with leaders of the four public banks; National Bank of Egypt (NBE), Banque Misr, Banque du Caire and Bank of Alexandria.
PUBLIC BANKS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY AROUSES ARGUMENT
Others opine that each of the two companies had its own competences. The establishment of an investment management company represents a kind of support to banks to raise their investments in the joint ventures.
Deputy chairman of the National Bank of Egypt Hussein Abdel-Aziz denies any discrepancy between this company and public banks board of directors. He expects that it will play the same role that will be played by banks holding company. "We have to wait to see the actions that will be taken to start the company's business and, afterwards, we might judge on it when the vision is clear," he added.
Establishment of the new investment company will cancel the role of previous representatives of public banks in the joint ventures, as the new company will play a role in appointing new personnel, he added, pointing out that the new company will include the four public banks only, while the other banks finance structures will be devolved to shareholders.
Experts called for a strategy committing the government to replacing imports with local products in order to reduce the effect of the rise of dollar's rate of exchange on local prices due to the importation of production and foodstuff requirements, of which 75% are stable commodities.
Head of Sadat Academy Dr Hamdi Abdel-Azim said that there are indirect means that can be adopted, including laying down regulations for importation such as defining a certain year of production in order to give access to such products or stipulating the presence of an agent or maintenance inside the country or to confine the access of these products to certain periods, following the suit of European Union countries which give access to Egyptian agricultural products to their markets only in certain months.
Businessman and MP Mostafa Al Sallab pointed out that among the files expected to be highly controversial is reviewing the track of privatization programme and the government policy to put up public property quotas in companies for sale in the coming period, as well as the instability if rates of exchange and the dollar hikes.

Seoudi demanded that new mechanisms should be available in order to attract Arab and foreign investments, which would help to solve the problems of unemployment and production. He pointed out that the importance of making use of the successful models in some countries which have identical conditions with ours.

Seoudi pointed out that it was necessary to purge all free trade agreements whether Arab or with the COMESA in order to achieve the interests of both parties rather than serve the interests of one party at the expense of Egypt's interests as is the case now.
Zaki reviewed the values of direct foreign investment in 1999/2000 when the value of direct foreign investment hit $1 billion and 953 million. In 2001/2002, it became $528 million and in 2002/2003 it reached $428 million.
On the other hand, Engineering Industries Chamber chairman, Nabil Farid Hassanein pointed out a decline in industries' contribution to the national income to 17%, which constituted a real problem as industry is the pivot of national economy in various countries.

Al-Zayat sees only one reason for such harassments, namely the government considering them the only viable opponent of the National Democratic Party and, therefore, it loses no time in arresting them under the pretext of their departure from legitimacy.
Al-Zayat emphasized that America was the sole beneficiary of such abortive strikes against Muslim Brotherhood or Islamic organizations. The Egyptian government is regrettably the hand that implements American demands whether directly or indirectly.
Should Muslim Brotherhood be granted free elections, they would reach the Parliament in big numbers.

They pointed out that there were good but limited and hushed up gestures of the Movement agreement to join the government through "independent candidates". Al-Hayat learnt that Qurie would head for the Jordanian capital, Amman to meet the Jordanian monarch, King Abdullah II to get acquainted with the results of his visit to the USA.
Palestinian sources told Al-Hayat that Abou Alaa was having talks with all factions of the Palestinian movements for the formation of a broad-based government combining them all including Hamas movement and the Popular Front.
Even before the end of the consultations he was having with Hamas leaders, Abou Alaa had announced intentions to have Mosa Al Za'mot, an independent Islamic deputy in the Legislative Council, participate in the micro cabinet.
Abd El Qadir considered Hamas' joining the Palestinian government a positive bid for the movement for aborting the Israeli attempts to strip it of the legitimacy of resistance through talking about destroying its infrastructure.
The talk about dismantling the infrastructure of terrorism actually means a civil human structure, which is connected with the dismantlement of occupation structure and the return to the point which had been reached by former prime minister.
The doctors added that that was the first time in the Arab World a woman had given birth to six twins.
SYRIAN FM: READY FOR COOPERATION WITH WASHINGTON
BAGHDAD: FIRST CULTURAL- ARTISTIC FESTIVAL SINCE SADDAM DEPOSITION
SAUDI ARABIAN DEPLOYMENT OF FIGHTERS IN TABOUK COMES WITHIN ITS NATIONAL INTERESTS
The Hebrew state almost resorts to such an approach to banish any, even limited, threat that can face its hostile air force, which violates the international law in the region. When an Arab country such as Kuwait and the UAE, no matter how distant it is from Israel, asks for a weapon from the USA, heated debate is always raised by the Jewish lobby and sympathizers with the Hebrew state to influence the demand, try to delimit some of its systems and details of its armament, or even determine its usage and deployment.
The Israeli air force also includes very sophisticated systems of electronic support and antiaircraft ammunition, in addition to some other offensive kinds to attack targets of different fortifications and sizes using different systems and ranges.
In the Gulf War II, the Saudi air forces fought courageously and gained good experience during carrying out their joint operations with the coalition forces, especially the Americans. AWACS planes together with tanker aircraft and F-16 fighters constituted an effective team that covered distant spaces within their zone of operations.
Saudi Arabia has vital interests in deploying such types of aircraft in any of its airbases in order to protect its sovereignty, facilities and vital centers with a view to not letting Israel - or others - to carry out penetrations to implement surveillance or offensive tasks.
Politically, Israel accuses Saudi Arabia of supporting the Palestinians and of being opposed to the establishment of relations with it. Concurrently, it influences other countries within its vital political environment to coordinate common stands in this respect.

Al-Ahram Al-Arabi interviewed General Director of Toyota-Egypt, Ra'fat Masrouga who attributed this phenomenon to lack of confidence in the Egyptian pound, as people turned into considering the car as an investment commodity and a coffer of value. "This, however, reflects the market's confusion and contradicts with the economic concepts that point out the devaluation of the car after sale," he said. The following is the interview:
A: We believed that the liberalization of the dollar rate of exchange would decrease sales by at least 15% because we expected price hikes. Prices have actually risen to unexpected levels due to instability of the rate of exchange. The dollar rose from 5.35 pounds to 7.25 pounds, while the prices of some kinds of cars have doubled to the extent that a car black market has emerged because people lost their confidence in the pound and all other currencies. Instead, they are investing their funds in buying what they believe to be assets.
Q: How high have passenger cars' sales risen?
Q: What is the reality of the auto-industry?
Q: Why isn't the car assembling industry unpromising?
He probably means this agreement) Q: Even if customs and duties are cancelled?
A: Never was the car a coffer of value. But, it turned to be so due to a state of despair on the market. It is illogical to say that the car is a coffer of value because its price decreases in the course of time. I feel compassion for those who buy a car to store it.
A: If I've money, I'll buy it now because the cost and rate of exchange are on the rise, like the dollar, for instance, which has never retreated against the pound even when it (the dollar) is in its weakest conditions against other currencies.

The World Bank (WB) warned against "challenges" that Egypt would face in the coming period, including improving the exchange rate management, decreasing budget deficit, taking more steps to liberalize trade, cutting customs tariffs and increasing transparency in order to make optimal use of the partnership agreement signed with Europe and the free trade agreement signed with the US.
Addressing the conference, he said the government, in cooperation with the WB, is seeking to improve the management of monetary and financial policies and raising labour efficiency in government departments so as to help complete all investment measures in addition to improving the governmental services provided for citizens.
He said there is a large number of external factors that led to the retreat of foreign investments not only in Egypt but also in all developing countries. Such factors included the tense situation in the Middle East, Palestinian Intifada, war on Iraq and the 11 September 2001 incidents.

Egyptian banks have been affected by the exchange rates deregulation decree at the beginning of this year and the flotation of the pound, as they failed to provide their clients with foreign exchange and even the domestic currency deposits tended to decline. This made the banks refrain from taking some measures to reduce interest rates which inflicted heavy losses on them due to a nosedive in lending rates and the withdrawal of most foreign investments from the market because of foreign exchange difficulties in Egypt, the Iraqi war, the Palestinian uprising which affected tourism revenues.
They also take the lead in total assets, deposits, loans, property rights and fixed assets. The National Bank of Egypt came first, followed by Banque Misr, the Banque du Caire, Principal Bank for Development and Agricultural Credit, Egyptian Arab Land Bank, Misr International Bank, Suez Canal Bank and Faysal Islamic Bank.

"Socially unfit". Abdel Hamid committed suicide because he could not stand this phrase after he successfully passed all tests he had to take in Trade Representation.
To the end of a set of questions which we should have posed and assimilated their bitter yield! The surprise which Abdel Hamid did not know before his departure, the surprise which might not be known either to his thousand colleagues who were also rejected was that fourth of the forty two who were selected were relatives of personnel in the same authority, foremost among whom is the authority chairman himself, Al Said Qassim who took great care before he left his office to ensure the selection of his nephew who was ranked 160th in the written test, but transferred to the 7th position. This incident has not been the first nor will it be the last to happen, according to some personnel in the authority. The five batches that joined the authority in the last years have taken it for granted that a number of the personnel's sons and relatives would be appointed in the vacancies especially as the authority chairman usually participates in the test board, in addition to some public figures, state dignitaries, politicians and university professors.
Generally speaking, I'm terribly worried about what is happening in Egypt. The Egyptian rich are now without culture or history and yet can rule the country through the power invested in them by money while the rest of the people are weighed down by favouritism and connections in addition to the fact that anything can be bought so long as the only standard is how much money you possess.

The overriding importance of such a subject has been even more highlighted by the successive blows we have received from foes and friends alike confirming the argument that if you do not have your own food, you cannot claim any right to independence of free will nor can you fend off the foe's arrogance and meanness!
The Arabs, nevertheless, content themselves in utter stupidity, with voicing amazement or shock at such an American Israeli provocation.
Although Dr. Ahmed Abou El Nour had offered us his book " The Most Serious Years of the Globe" issued in 1999 where he demanded that the Jews should pay enormous compensation to the Egyptians for the gold they had stolen on their exodus from Egypt, a case triggered by Al Ahram Al Arabi, he transcended the dispute with Dr. Nabil Helmi, Al Zagazig Faculty of Law Dean over who was the originator of the idea, and offered us an integrated project for the means to claim such stolen property as well as objective replies to other Jewish allegations.
Abou Al Nour said, "They have the right to defend their position. They also have the right to bring legal actions against us in this or that regard. However, they have no right to assault any Egyptian who raised questions regarding valid Egyptian rights. They have no right to close files or create sanctions with a view to closing files and sparing themselves the trouble of confrontation. Their illusory cases can be refuted through solid evidence whether by citing religious or historical references which are commonly approved as true and social.
The course period is two years exploded rather than continuous as the Egyptian law bans Egyptians who stay for more than three months in Israel from joining any military colleges. The trainee receives a monthly salary of 2000 Shekels or the equivalent of LE2250 throughout the scholarship period at the end of which he is granted a certificate by the Israeli Ministry of Tourism testifying he had completed and passed the course. The certificate is also endorsed by the Egyptian Chamber of Tourism.

Sheta, furthermore, said that the volume of trade between Egypt and Russia had declined to about $200 million last year against about $3 billion in 1990. This was mainly due to the Russian market opening up to the whole world and dealings concentrating on free currencies and also due to the strong competition with other countries like Turkey, Korea, China and Italy, besides, the weakness of the Egyptian party's marketing operations.
The plant labour will be 100% Egyptian. The Romanian party will undertake the marketing and distribution operations to meet the Romanian market's needs and some European countries.

The People's Assembly is expected to see a heated debate on Sunday between members and the government on the export issue.
The performance of exports has become abysmal due to their dwindling competitiveness, while several other developing countries managed to raise their exports over the last three decades, it unveiled.
A depreciating pound may lead to a hike in exports in the short run, but cannot be relied upon as a policy targeting a boost in exports in the long run. The effectiveness of this policy will be related to the flexibility of supply of local production and flexibility of demand for Egyptian exports, it said.
This improvement is attributed to a number of factors foremost of which is the continuous improvement of the balance of trade by 12 percent as a result of a rise in exports and decline in imports, the report said.
During the period from July to September this year, the trade balance deficit amounted to $1.6 billion, a decline of 22% against the corresponding period last year.

In his meeting two days ago with representatives of the Egyptian Industries Federation, head of the Commercial Representation Body and a number of Egyptian businessmen and investors, the European official said the EU gives due attention to increasing the competitiveness of the Egyptian economy and rehabilitating it to take part in the Euro-Mediterranean free trade zone to be launched by 2010. He noted that a package of measures should be taken to encourage European investors to increase their investments in Egypt. Canceling customs duties is not enough to provide the proper climate for attracting European investments, but there are other measures to improve productivity and raise the competitiveness of the Egyptian products in order to prompt investors to enter the Egyptian market, he added.
He pointed out that the statement would contain carrying out the financial reform plan through the implementation of decisive and untraditional solutions to control the budget deficit and develop public treasury resources.

The bank will play an important role during the coming stage to boost Egypt's exports to African countries, as Egypt has high productive capacities, capable of competition in addition to advanced technology, Ebeid said. African markets are promising, as African countries are expected to witness an increasing growth rate during the coming years, thus increasing demand on their markets.
"The bank intends to expand its operations in the future in the field of financing exports for African countries and promoting them in international markets. It will also help the African continent in squaring up to the challenges facing its external trade, in addition to cooperation with international organizations with a view to supporting and developing the economies of Africa."
The report added that the capacity of the affiliate contracting companies was much higher than the size of current investments on the domestic market.

The political crisis between Kuwait and Libya on the one hand and the Arab League on the other hand reflected on the aggravation of the situation in the Arab League budget. Neither country paid off its quota in the 2003 budget amounting to $4 million and 200 thousand in Libya's case and $4 million and 900 thousand in the case of Kuwait, thus representing together about 25% of the Arab League budget. Although Kuwait failed to pay off its quota this year, it demanded that a Kuwaiti personality, Abdulla Al-Mansour be appointed as assistant secretary general for financial and administrative affairs, which is one of the high ranking positions currently vacant in the General Secretariat. Moussa, however, thought the appointment issue had better be dealt with in next Tunis Summit within the framework of a plan to restructure joint Arab action. The Secretary General also postponed the tests which were supposed to be done in October to occupy the vacancies in the General Secretariat for which there were over 2000 applicants from different Arab countries.

It is still unclear whether those who will be released on Monday are the same meant by Al-Adli or representing a new batch.
AL-QAEDA TO ITS MALE AND FEMALE FOLLOWERS: SKIP ROPE EVERY MORNING
According to a report by the People's Assembly Committee on Education, the costs of private tuition ranges between LE7 and LE12 billion annually. This phenomenon leads to the marginalization of the regular school role and constitutes a threat to the whole educational establishment. It also undermines the citizen's confidence in the feasibility of the educational system, thus defeating the purposes of free education while part of the state budget is simply wasted. Education, therefore, is degenerating to become more of a trade, thus eliminating the principle of democratization of education and equal chances among citizens.
Doctors and experts specialized in treating sexual impotence carried their researches and went to America to participate in "The International Conference on Urinary Tracts Surgery and Masculinity Diseases". On their return to Cairo, they felt it is incumbent upon them to help Arab men and raise their morale through acquainting them with the results reached by the conference as well as the details of its discussions (especially after it turned out that 50% of men in the world are suffering from sexual impotence with that percentage rising even higher among Arab men to reach 60%). They, therefore, wanted to assure them that all solutions are available even for frigid women. They also warned that such a disease might aggravate among Arab men if they insisted on having takeaway like pizza and hamburger.
Smoking, according to Dr. Al-Abd, is one of the causes of sexual impotence as the chances of smokers developing that disease are ten times as many as those in the case of non-smokers. Strikingly, takeaway turned out to cause arteriosclerosis which consequently cause sexual impotence.

The Congress pointed out that the way the Minister of the Interior, Habib Al-Adli politically dealt with security extremism and terrorism issues was absolutely satisfactory. Ever since the man stepped to power on the heels of Luxor incident in 1997, he has run his ministry in a way that ensured the maintenance and enhancement of calm, which means the possibility of the achievement of a real political reform after the exchanged violence bullets between the fundamentalists and the police were silenced.
"REFORMIST" TREND IN NDP MAKES PROGRESS
Such fears may be the reason for the opposition parties coordinating their action ahead of calling for an expected dialogue with the ruling party.
Under this headline, Managing Director of Al-Hayat newspaper Zuheir Qusaibati wrote an article, which ran to the following effect: Pessimists doubt the ruling National Democratic Party's (NDP) seriousness as it moved, after long hesitance, to the stage of reforms admitting to the need to involving parties in the country's public policy-making, economically, politically and socially.
Those whose hopes for a start of a reform stage were dashed after having betted on an era of serious shift to permanent rather than seasonal democracy, see in the retention of martial laws an introduction to "regulating" participation so that flexibility in implementation may be the resource whenever the authorities' interests are at logger heads with the orientations of a party, trend or syndicate.
Certainly the fact that the majority of Egyptians are heavily trodden by living burdens is a danger that outweighs even the nightmare of bloody conflicts with hardliners in the street. It has also top priority in the file of dealing with human rights.

Foreign Ministry is exerting strenuous efforts with all parties in the UN, Washington and Baghdad to win export and investment contracts for the Egyptian companies in Iraq as the pretexts extended by Iraq Program Bureau with the UN are unconvincing.
The foreign minister uncovered that Iraq Program Bureau with the UN said that the Egyptian companies were excluded due to the long period they would take to ship cargoes to Iraq, which made Iraq Program Bureau officials prefer other contracts to be implemented in a shorter period.
It was agreed as well with the officials of the Food Program in Rome and Geneva to notify the Egyptian embassy of the needs required within the framework of the program in order to guarantee quick notification of the Egyptian companies of these needs at the appropriate time.

EGYPTIAN BUSINESSMEN: SUDANESE BANKS DECLINE TO GRANT CREDIT TO EGYPTIAN-SUDANESE COMPANIES
Head of the 6th of October Investors' Society Mohamed Al Munufi says that Sudanese customs house collect tariffs for several Egyptian commodities which were set on negative lists although Egypt and Sudan are members of the African COMESA agreement.
Thabit adds that the problem of documentary credits constitutes an obstacle to trade development between the two countries.

Negotiations are underway with the 1948 Palestinians (Israeli Arabs) so that the public opinion might not be incited during the negotiation stage, he said, pointing out that negotiations are held through the government, rather than businessmen.

The environment-friendly project will provide 60 job openings for Egyptians. Al-Ghamrawi also said the GAIFZ approved another two projects for producing garment within the framework of encouraging labor-intensive projects. The first project, whose capital and investments will hit 500,000 dollars and one million dollars respectively, will be established in the general free zone in Alexandria on an area of 8500 square meters. This project will provide 700 job opportunities for the Egyptians and will export its whole production. The second project will be established in the general free zone in Alexandria on an area of 500 square meters.

NEW CBE GOVERNOR: FOREX MARKETS STABLE
The same thing happened in the case of the dollar at the times of high demand for it by businessmen to consummate their import contracts. Al Ukda emphasized that getting rid of those speculators was not a problem as there would be enough permanent liquidity of foreign exchange with banks to meet the requirements of their clients when the complementary measures of the rates of exchange system are taken such as strict control ensuring free dealings and the linkage of banks as well as exchange companies through an electronic data network with the CBE follow-up room and on the activation of the dollar interbank system which has been out of order for two months. This will be accompanied by taking several decisions which will be discussed at the next meeting between banks leaderships and the CBE board of directors.
Mohamed Hassan Al Abyadh, head of the (frozen) exchange department of the Egyptian Federation of Chambers of Commerce, understated the importance of the recent changes of CBE leaderships, adding that the problem did not lie so much in who would undertake the post according to the applied policies and whether there were real changes or not.
Thus, more than half of the companies, registered with the Exchange Division at the Chambers of Commerce Federation have already stopped operation, as 61 companies froze their bank accounts and closed down as of last February. In addition, 20 other companies have been penalized, as their operation has been suspended for a year because of administrative violations.
CBE officials did not take this into account, he pointed out. Instead of supporting these companies that accommodate one thousand workers approximately, they kept threatening them with closure and rejected the request of the companies' owners to postpone the enforcement of that law that provides for increasing capital to LE20 million, he said.
"Many company owners have turned to other fields of work, like car trade, import and export in preparation for submitting requests for having their licenses repealed," he said, indicating that he himself is looking for an alternative economic activity.
The decisions were announced by Mowafaq Al-Fayoumi, chairman of the Central Administration for International Trade Policies under the Ministry of Foreign Trade. He added that they made this decision following a full one year of investigations and revisions. The Egyptian Iron and Steel Company and Al-Ezz Steel Company and Dekhila Iron Company, which all represent national iron and steel industry, lodged a collective complaint with the minister of foreign trade in December 2002, calling for keeping dumping duties, which hit 40 percent of the value.
EGYPTIAN ECONOMY JULY-SEPTEMBER NEW INDICES
The report uncovered a rise in the banking system net foreign assets by 6.5 billion pounds to reach the equivalent of 31.9 billion pounds in addition to a rise in local credit by 12.8 billion pounds to hit 400.2 billion pounds. The increase of local credit might be attributed to a rise in credit offered to the government sector by 10 billion pounds to reach 113.5 billion pounds.
In the domain of supporting faltering farmers, the report says the period of repaying the loans of the Development Bank has been extended to ten years and the debts of 6866 clients have been rescheduled. In addition, the State contributed LE276 million to the costs of cotton cultivation. It also boosted the prices of purchasing sugarcane, wheat, red beet and corn.
The State shoulders the rest. The report points out that the government is committed to not touching the prices of the first bracket of gas consumed at homes (about two million users). The oil sector extended a subsidy of LE27.5 billion in 2003 against LE17.4 billion in the previous year.
He added that raw materials and cotton exports surged up to 3216 million pounds against 2091 million pounds. Semi and fully manufactured commodities' exports climbed to 10042 million pounds versus 6602 million pounds. Free zones exports went up to 1576 million pounds compared to 1202 million pounds.
A state of anticipation is dominating Egyptian exporters, as accusations are leveled at some of them that they temper with the value of their exports and that they do not present the actual value thereof. They are also accused of refusing to exchange the revenues of their exports with banks according to the Ministerial Decree no. 506 and trading in them on the black market.
On the other hand, the Foreign Trade Ministry is assessing all exporters' certificates, as well as the policy of supporting exporters, because such support is aimed at increasing monetary revenues and taking care of the social dimensions (conditions). Such assessment is being made because the results are passive, particularly those of orange exporters, who have the largest share of subsidy. This urged the Ministry to review subsidy and exports' revenues, and adopt deterrent measures against those who have not remitted their revenues to the banks and those who have mentioned a value lower than the real one of their exports. All documents, obtained by the Foreign Trade Ministry from banks and states, will also be reviewed.
Sheta said the banking form of exporters, used in the past, might be a means of controlling this operation, provided that the penalty should not be criminal. It is better to impose a moral penalty, like removing the exporter's name from the Commercial Registration.
Where are the documents that prove manipulation? If there is manipulation, it cannot be compared with the efforts that are being exerted."
Egyptian General Authority for Investment and Free Zones Mohamed al-Ghamrawi said public textile projects under the public free zones system rose up to 74 with issued capital of 77.6 million U.S. dollars and investment costs of 172.9 million U.S. dollars.
Constituting a large proportion of exports, textiles produced by free zone projects amounted to 300.4 million U.S. dollars, 30 percent of free zones' total exports which hit 1.3 billion U.S. dollars in 2002, or 25 percent of Egypt's non-oil exports, he said.
The report mentioned the monthly rates of transactions carried out by institutions at the bourse, pointing out that they ranged between 37% and 77% as follows:
The 4-year loan includes 675 million pounds in local currency and 132 million U.S. dollars in foreign currencies.

BARCLAYS ALLOCATES LE1 BILLION TO BUY BANKS IN EGYPT
It might be mentioned that Al-Alam Al-Youm exclusively uncovered on March 16th the start of negotiations between Banque Du Caire and British Barclays on purchasing the former's share in Cairo Barclays.
"We seek to buy Egyptian banks of strong financial positions in order to expedite turning Barclays into the biggest foreign bank in the region," he indicated.
"The possibilities of increasing our activities are focused on only two African countries: Egypt and South Africa," he said, emphasizing that Barclays aim is not to compete with Egyptian banks but rather contribute to the development of the Egyptian banking sector through introducing fresh products and financing giant investment projects.
The second reason is the difficulty found in applying the new banking act, which stipulates that branches of the foreign banks operative in Egypt should hike their paid-up capital to $50 million before mid 2005, he noted.
The meeting was attended by head of General Authority for Investment and Free Zones Dr. Mohamed Al-Ghamrawi who said that the meeting was very fruitful and that the delegation conveyed a message to President Mubarak from the Italian Premier Silvio Burlesconi stressing Italy's desire to cooperate with Egypt and increase its investments in it.

Gouhar said that obtaining a licence for ground broadcasting is the most important step in Hawa project. He went on to say, "The main source of income is expected to be the revenues of advertisements on reconstruction efforts at a time when the economic and social concepts of the Iraqi people are being reformed and a new advertisement entity would be introduced for the first time." At the same time, partners will establish an advertising agency in Iraq in parallel with Hawa TV.
The economically feasible agricultural projects of any country that do not cause harm to any other country would be approved, he added, revealing that there is a part in the High Dam which is devoted to receiving the Nile silt and it was agreed with Dr Yousuf Wali to transport part of this silt to reclaim around 5000 feddans.

Although Egypt is ranked third in terms of broad beans productivity following France, Germany but preceding Turkey, Italy, China, Ethiopia, Spain, Mexico and Tunisia, the great increase in population and the dependence primarily on broad beans does not enable Egypt to have a surplus for exportation or even self-sufficiency. Besides, there are other factors related to broad beans being cultivated in an agricultural round concurrently with the basic crop for citizens, i.e. wheat, and for animals, i.e. clover, thus making it very difficult to expand its cultivated area.
The misbehavior of many Egyptians led to such a state of price rise, as 80 percent of Egyptians' purchases is thrown at dustbins as leftovers, he pointed out.
The main problem of broad beans is that it is cultivated simultaneously with the basic crop, i.e. wheat, and with the basic animal food, i.e. clover, which spares no strong opportunity to expand its cultivation. The second problem is that the government does not interfere to allocate certain areas for broad beans cultivation, he indicated.
However, I do not say that foreign military presence should be ended abruptly, but a reasonable timetable is necessary for the transfer of power and sovereignty to the Iraqi people. The U.S. administration has apparently started to realize the significance of linking the military presence to a timetable, reflected by recent remarks by U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell who set six months as a timetable for wording a new Iraqi constitution.
It is a principled position on the situations in Iraq and Sudan. We want them to have a political unity that can absorb racial, sectarian and religious diversification.

Q: How do you look at the decision of expelling Arafat?
Q: Some people believe that Iraq reconstruction will undermine Egypt's ability to draw foreign investments, is it possible?
The government is committed to providing subsidized commodities to low-income people.
Al-Baz: This issue is not under consideration and Gamal Mubarak, in line with any other Egyptian citizen, can exercise politics at any anytime and in any post, including the presidency if he contests elections and wins a constitutional majority.
She pointed out a number of significant issues between both American and Egyptian sides which should be solved prior to entering into official negotiations. Reaching an agreement should be preceded by large scale reforms, she noted.
Dr. Osama Al-Baz, political advisor to President Mubarak, said that Iraqi and Palestinian issues were of paramount importance on the Arab arena. He pointed out the significance of September 11th incidents in playing a role in the region's goings on as the USA started its so called anti-terrorism war on the heels of such incidents.
SAAD EDDIN IBRAHIM : I HAVEN'T ASKED FOR AMERICAN PRESSURE ON EGYPT TO IMPLEMENT DEMOCRACY
He added that change involving individuals would not be in our favour, as we have to do the change on our own according to our priorities instead of letting it be imposed upon us from abroad or according to foreign priorities.
The Palestinian cause was the pivot of the last visit paid by King Abdullah II to the US, he said.
Al-Tayeb told Al-Alam Al-Youm daily that Haj and Umrah journeys should not be repeated if relevant expenses are needed by the Muslim society to answer the needs of the poor, the needy and the sick, and to improve the country's conditions.

Observers see that Zuhdi's adopting this orientation outside prison would make groundless doubts about the credibility of the peaceful initiative he led inside prison six years back along with other comrades.
It seemed that the Gamaa Islamia leaders wanted to affirm their opposition to the American policies in general lest their attitudes are construed wrongly. They said, "One may say: Did you forget what America has done to Islam and Muslims?
