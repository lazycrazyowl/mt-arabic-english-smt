By Christoph Podov - International Space Station Biggest Structure Assembled in Orbit
The delay in building this module due to financial reasons has so far resulted in setting the entire program back six months.
Upon completion of the station's assembly process, six or seven astronauts who will be able to conduct medical, physical and other experiments to observe planet earth will inhabit it permanently. The station, with its solar panels, will look like a bat the size of a football field, and it will be visible to the naked eye from earth as a meteor at an altitude of 400 Km.
In the face of mounting budget difficulties, the United States sought to find partners. In 1993, the Russians joined the American project which was named the International Space Station, after the Russians failed to finance the "Mir II" project.
It is expected that the space station will be operated initially for 15 years, but the example of the Russian Mir Station, which was originally launched for five years and is still operating without interruption for 13 years, calls for optimism.

Germany Seeks to Improve Image against Spain, France to Reinforce Reputation against International Stars

Spain's coach, Jose Antonio Camacho, has kept eight players from the squad which played in the European finals. They are Ichibiria, Abellardo, Gerard, Guardiola, Vlasko, Raul, Mendetta and Paco and he gave players from small clubs a chance, especially goal keeper Ovidion Esteban and midfielder Malka Rofetti.

Disputes have arisen whether in the form of coolness between players because of not being allowed to play or because of delays in announcing the team's line-up for the new season, or in the form of players objecting to the salaries offered by management for contract renewal, or due to Tsobil's temper in dealing with players both during training and in matches, a matter which has been very obvious to everyone recently.

In spite of a 1500 dollar fine against Hanafi, Mohamed insisted on a public apology to restore his dignity, something Hanafi refused to do.
For the first time too, al-Ahli is witnessing rebellion in the form of one player refusing to hand over his passport to the club's management, which banned travel to Senegal to play against Senegal's Joan d'Arc team in the third round of the Africa Championship, as well as another player claiming injury in order not to travel.

Three local broadcasting stations, Alnur, Lebanon Alhur and Sawt Alghed, will broadcast the matches live and Radio Monte Carlo has applied for broadcasting rights to the matches in the Middle East.
Al-Thahir also said that "the opening ceremony will be displayed on the front pages of all Arab and international newspapers and this means a lot to Lebanon. In the past twenty years, the media has persistently reported that a missile fell in this or that area 20 kilometers from Beirut Airport but next October 21, these papers will be saying that the opening ceremony for the Asia 2000 Cup was held at the Sports Village Stadium which is just one kilometer away from Beirut Airport."

The theory that the Russian submarine, Kursk, sank in the Barents Sea as a result of an explosion looked more likely today Tuesday even though the authorities are still suggesting that a collision with another vessel was a possible cause of the accident.
Russian newspapers reported that military experts said the explosion could be due to water leaking in from a crack in the submarine's hull or because of a defect in the water-resistant layer in the torpedo firing cylinders.
Collision theory:
However, no foreign fleet has reported the presence of a submarine in the area where the accident occurred and the Russian Navy has not announced finding any sign of an unknown submarine which may have been damaged as a result of the collision.
Operations to rescue the submarine crew have been delayed since Monday because of a storm.

The match was very exciting with Lebanon in control most of the time although at the beginning the advantage was with the Iraqis who stole two surprise goals, the first as a result of a defense error in front of the goal and the second from an exemplary counter attack. Apart from this, the Lebanese team played with great enthusiasm and were in control for most of the time, scoring a goal and nearly increasing their harvest in the first half had it not been for a hasty end to the attack. They tied in the second half, which saw them lose opportunities across-the-board.
The start of the game was heated, especially on the Lebanese side which charged into an attack from the start, but was stunned by an early Iraqi goal, in the fifth minute to be precise, when Qahtan Jathir exploited a mistake by Abbas Shahrour in clearing the ball, passing it to Abbas Abeed who in turn passed it on to Sabah Jaeer who headed it into Ahmed Saqar's net.
The first dangerous Lebanese opportunity was from a free kick to the left of the area executed by Moussa Hajij which reached Jamal Taha who headed it across the goal to be kicked high by Ahmed Numani instead of into the goal (9). Taha came back with a powerful shot which passed to the left of the goal (10).
Newton de Oliveira took a pass and penetrated with the ball form the right but held on to it, resulting in the defense kicking it away from him (36), then the most brilliant opportunity of the match came when Moussa Hijaj jumped to head the ball from the edge of the rectangle but the crossbar stopped it, saving goalkeeper Hashim Khamis, and it bounced back to Haithem Zain who tried to follow it with a header but it passed by the right post (37).
The first opportunity in the round came as a result of chaos in front of the Iraqi goal where the ball reached Taha who kicked it from a distance over the crossbar (51).
Hajij lifted a ball from a fixed kick that Mohamed Halawa headed to Taha but the latter also headed it high when he was less than 2 meters from the goal (81).

The Egyptian film "The Storm," the first by director Khaled Yusif, through a tale about an ordinary Egyptian family, reinstates respect for principles that have been ignored under the weight of the western storm which blew over the Arab world during the second Gulf War and the Arab citizen who has been ignored, shattering his basic human dreams.
After this introduction, the film's events move along three dramatic storylines illustrating the human breakdown and dreams of a better future, leading to a depiction of the breakdown Arab societies suffered after the second Gulf War broke out (1990-1991), through the love affair between the younger son and Hayat, the close relationship between the mother and her history teacher colleague (Hisham Saleem) and the life of the eldest son in Iraq.
The director places these storylines within the framework of the breakdown in Arab society to its farthest boundary when both brothers are forced to direct the fire of their guns at each other while the tears that fill their eyes are complete evidence of the total lack of choice of the Arab citizen on both sides.

Urgent  Israeli Air Raids on Four Palestinian Targets
Tallahassee (United States) 11-15 (AFP) -

Finally, in the county of Palm Beach, the count showed 4695 votes, 33 new votes, for Al Gore and 14 new votes for Bush.
Israeli Air Raids on Four Palestinian Targets
The statement added that these bases were located in Tulkram and Silfit (northern West Bank) and in Hebron (southern West Bank).
Democratic candidate Al Gore stated today Wednesday that he would accept the results in the state of Florida after the hand count of votes in a number of its counties and would not resort to judicial proceedings.

Washington 11-16 (AFP) -
Jerusalem 11-15 (AFP) -
An army statement said that three of the targets fired on by combat helicopters were bases belonging to "organizations," by which the Israeli authorities mean Palestinian militia groups, including the Fatah movement led by Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.
It is clear that these four targets were struck as a result of decisions made by Israel's security cabinet yesterday evening Wednesday.
The Vice-President told journalists in Washington, "I will accept the results and will not initiate legal proceedings to oppose them nor will I back any judicial proceedings to this end."
Gore said in a statement carried by the major television networks in America that "it is up to the two of us to ask our supporters to abide by the result of these elections, whatever it may be."
Florida's Secretary of State, Republican Katherine Harris, yesterday rejected the request made by three counties to include the votes of ongoing hand counts in the results of the presidential election.
Urgent  Bush Rejects Gore's Proposals
American President George Bush declared that the first stage of the air campaign has been successful.
Kuwait considered the statements read by Abu Ghaith in the name of "Al-Qaeda" as tantamount to the admission of guilt.
Despite assurances that the first phase of the American-British military operation will focus on Afghanistan, some Arab states still fear that the next phases of this operation will target such states as Iraq and Arab organizations and that this will be reflected on  their internal stability.
Relief agencies affiliated with the United Nations were unanimous in warning against the repercussions of the war against Afghanistan and neighboring countries. United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson warned of an impending tragedy "similar to the one in Rwanda." The World Food Program's Director in Tajikistan, Ardagh Meghdissian, considered that "a race with time is going on to provide food to the inhabitants of remote mountainous areas, which the trucks would not be able to reach after the snow starts falling."
The last victims fell yesterday when three persons in the Sheeka neighborhood were burned ¡¦.
Dar Al-Jadeed seized the opportunity of the American-British war against Afghanistan to exhibit the book, Bin Laden, by journalist Imad Naddaf, after a long slump it has suffered since its publication three years ago.
He attributed that to the "general economic situation and the priorities of life," which made books a luxury.
Several officials at publishing houses explained that the interest of the Syrian reader stems from following up "recent developments in computers and all that is linked to informatics and communication," followed by "literary books and works on religion and heritage and finally political books."
"In the name of God the Merciful, peace and prayers be on our Prophet Mohammad, may God bless him, his family and companions."
We announce our complete support of this emirate and the Muslim Afghani people in the face of this vicious attack with all our financial and moral support under the leadership of the Prince of Believers Mulla Mohammad Omar. May God preserve him and support him with decisive victory.
Bush must learn that in his arrogance and in media promising lasting freedom, which he drawls about, not to forget the scene of Mohammad Durra and his young Muslim brothers in Palestine and Iraq.
Those that supported this crusader campaign must know the truth after it has come out, and it became clear that it was a crusade attack against Islam and Muslims.
The Al Qaeda Network also declares to the Americans and the heathens in the Arab Peninsula, specifically the Americans and British, and orders them to leave the Arab Peninsula.
As for the warning issued by Bush and the US Administration, and the decisions that were aimed at limiting the role of the satellite channels and the international news agencies carrying our voice to the world, it is only clear evidence of the US Administration's fear that the truth behind the Tuesday events will be revealed ? the truth that reveals that Bush is an Israeli agent, and is sacrificing his people and economy for the sake of those people, and is helping them in occupying the land of the Muslims and oppressing their children.
Finally, we say as a token of advice and a sign of confirmation, telling the Muslims in America and Britain and the children who reject the United States' unjust policy, that we advise them not to ride in planes and not to live by high buildings and towers.
Saturday, an official French newspaper published, within a decree, a list of 39 people and associations suspected of having relations with terrorists, with an order of an immediate freeze on their accounts in French banks or French financial institutions.

The free world must not underestimate this danger."
This long awaited scrutiny into the controversial two hundred thousand votes, should have been published last Monday, but the "Times" told its readers on Sunday, through an interview by political reporter Richard Burk that "this step might cause tension and seems absolutely inappropriate now."
President George Bush slipped and said that a Crusader war must be declared on international terrorism, then backed down from what he said. After him, the Prime Minister of Italy, Berlusconi, made the same mistake. He in turn stated that the Western civilization is superior to the Islamic civilization, and then denied that he had uttered this prohibited talk.
We were contacted by some Lebanese who requested, in partnership with other foreigners, from the government the necessary licensing for the establishment of a hound race track in a suburb of Beirut, where the gambling would be similar to that in a horse race track.
He declared that the Ministry is currently working on three priorities, which are the reduction of interests on loans, providing operational capital for industrialists, revising the prices of energy and oil derivatives, and providing industrial land at nominal cost.
In his speech, Sarraf confirmed that the road taken by industrialists with regard to developing exports is sound, and revealed that Minister Afram charged a company with studying methods of enhancing exports to Africa and other areas of the world.
He declared that the Industrialists Association plan in the next phase is summarized in trying to increase cooperation with the government and the Minister of Industry, to enhance the competition abilities of the industrial sector and to develop exports, clarifying that the Association will continue to seek opening new markets for Lebanese products.
2. Reconsider the prices of energy and oil derivatives with a view of the rates implemented in the Arab countries linked with Lebanon through free exchange agreements.
Afram reiterated "The head of state is with national industries, and we must keep up with the government and support it in its work to achieve what it promised in its government statement concerning our sector."
General Manager of the Lebanon Electric Company George Mu'awwad told "An-Nahar" yesterday that the current program has become the normal status of the current, "unless there are breakdowns, similar to what happened at the Al Jamhour Station last Friday night, when the 'neutral line' (lightening line) was disconnected due to the factor of time."
It also known that the network of lines between Tyre - Al Zahrani - Armoun - Bsaleem - Deir Ammar, which was franchised in April 1999 (during the takeover of Minister Suleiman Trabulsi at the Ministry of Energy), is expected to be completed, according to the contracts, in two stages: the first in the middle of this June, and the second at the end of the year 2002. However, work is facing problems in appropriations in those areas.
It called on the media to collect the correct information from the concerned sources at the company "to avoid confusing or misleading public opinion."
Government movement since that date has focused on the economic aspect of the subject in two areas. The first is marketing Lebanon as a center for attracting capital and deposits seeking a safe investment, and as an alternative attraction center on the tourism, educational and medical levels for European countries, which have been in the past years preferred by the Arab countries. The second is the government's attempt to overlook the financial and economic crisis, which was the pressuring element before September 11th, and seeking to divert attention from the existing negative aspects to the new positive aspects.
But there are positive indications that cannot be overlooked, which were recorded in the past two weeks, and reflected the market's responsiveness to the new government promotion. They can be summarized into four:
- Second: Conversions from the US dollar to the Lira, which could be noticed as a result of the return of some centers to the national currency for fear of repercussions of the American events on the green currency.
The rate of increase was recorded as continuing in the last two weeks, with the increase not only a result of the flow of capital from abroad but also as a result of the Bank of Lebanon implementing its instructions compelling banks to keep a foreign reserve.
And in this regard, the round of talks held by the IMF delegation that visited Lebanon last week and met with a number of officials and bankers in preparation for issuing the final IMF report, which will be presented to its administration in Washington the day after tomorrow, Wednesday, must be noted.
1. Continued weakness of the economy, and the need for enhancing it.
The international community has moved forcefully to do that by directly confronting terrorism and increasing security reserves.
The biggest long-term challenge facing the international community in building a better world is fighting poverty and encouraging the spirit of sharing.
Minister of Industry George Afram warned that the national economy would remain unable to provide opportunities to halt immigration, if the development of productive sectors does not become a government priority.
Government movement since that date has focused on the economic aspect of the subject in two areas.

The employees at "Ojero" Company staged a warning sit-in the day before yesterday (Saturday) in all offices, departments and branches in the Lebanese areas, in protest over approving article 50 of the Media and Communications Committee.
During the sit-in, Richard Saliba, a member of the Association's council, spoke. He listed the demands, namely the continuation of work, the maintenance of earned rights, creating incentives and including services, and explained that the sit-in aims at maintaining income and declared openness to dialogue.
They also hoped that the maritime agencies would contact the suppliers and owners of ships to reduce the reflection of insurance installments and their additional fees on the prices of transportation to the lowest possible rate, and hoped that airline companies would stay in constant contact with insurance and re-insurance companies with the aim of seeking to decrease the installments of insurance against the various dangers of war, to reduce the load on the Lebanese consumer.
The Ministry of Tourism called on cabarets, nightclubs, and dance halls to install sound insulation to avoid disturbance, after an increase in complaints by citizens over the noise of equipment and musical instruments during late hours at night.
Al Hariri repeated that achieving that is a basic prerequisite for confronting the violence phenomenon that is surfacing in more than one place, and that international resolutions must be implemented, especially resolutions 242, 338 and 425.
Peres is a supporter of the creation of a Palestinian state, and he had previously stated on more than one occasion that he supports the creation of an independent state one hundred percent, or else why did Israel withdraw from a number of villages and hand them over to the Palestinian Authority? He defined the mission of this independent state as deciding everything with regard to its housing policy and others, but it is a country without arms.
Technological development contributed to that, and politics no longer dominates decisions, economy does.
And there is a new generation in the Arab World and in Israel that will be able to spread the spirit of peace if it is allowed to express itself.
After Bush repeated his support of the creation of a Palestinian State and the implementation of Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 to reach a just, comprehensive and final solution for the Palestinian issue, will Bush present an initiative in this regard as Al Hariri expected?
Palestinians want to go back to the 1967 borders and the Israelis oppose that because their interpretation of resolution 242 is not the same, despite the fact that Lord Caradon, the creator of this resolution, confirmed in an official memorandum that the resolution called for "the withdrawal from the occupied territories." The essence of the issue is identifying the occupied territories, but that was not open for discussion.
The spokesman for the Norwegian Foreign Ministry told the Saudi "Al Majallah" magazine of the success of the meeting between President Yaser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, and described it as extremely important for rebuilding trust between the two sides and stabilizing the ceasefire, and that an open hotline continues between them and US Secretary of State Colin Powell, in order to overcome obstacles that can prevent implementation of the agreement and beginning implementation of the Mitchell Committee recommendations.
The Crisis of Systems and Streets Nabil bou Munsif
If the reactions are measured in demonstrations, then the silence in most of the Arab streets reflects, more than anything else, the serious trouble in which the regimes are living.
But, on the other hand, the problem with this repression is that in the case that these regimes succeed in surviving the war on terrorism peacefully with a maximum of repression of feelings, even if these feelings were misled by instinctive religious motives, the regimes will acquire a dangerous precedent for generalizing repression to include all other internal areas. This is the most serious threat to the future of democracy in the East, if this democracy was ever meant to see light as a final fundamental solution for the countries of the backward and poor world.
And if there is a place that truly reveals this reality, it is in the streets of European countries, not in Islamic-Asian streets, where instincts turn on their anger.
Washington hastened at the end of last week to control the rush of reports that rumored a climate about "a new peace initiative" by the United States to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict. This is expected to be announced by its Secretary of State Colin Powell during the General Assembly meetings of the United Nations due to start this month, and that he would do that after postponing them to the next month.
Also, the Arab and Egyptian hints did not specifically fail, as did the Palestinian ones, in enhancing these climates and spreading them in the Arab countries. They also included Lebanon as well after the last visit by Prime Minister Rafiq Al Hariri to Egypt and other countries.
It might be in the interest of these countries to "feed" Americans positions expressed lately, and to give the US President a chance to put this new conviction of his Administration into implementation.
There is a latent unlikelihood for what is farther than the positions declared so far. Dr. John Alterman, a researcher at the "Research and Studies Program at the American Institute for Peace" and specialist in the affairs of the Middle East, told "An-Nahar" over the phone that there were several points concerning the last position of President George Bush on the Arab- Israeli conflict:
Alterman says that he met a while ago with a journalist working in the Israeli "Jerusalem Post" newspaper who told him that he reported information about the new American decision regarding bringing an end to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict before the 9th of September, and it is possible to go before that date to check this information.
It remains that the first step - according to what Alterman believes - is in both sides reducing violence and then providing a legitimacy for the negotiations which can be resumed from this point."
The serious American return to this issue remains, in turn, subject to the results of the ongoing military operation against Afghanistan, as everything depends on these results.
Perhaps among the ruins of the "World Trade Center," an unexpected victim of the September 11th attacks and the war on terrorism that was launched in response to it.
The "Taliban" movement does not know the picture civilization, so how can it realize that the West, which produced this culture, is in the process of restructuring its relationship with the pictures.
Everything that we imagined was part of excitement was gone, but the excitement remained.
It is a factor from which we have suffered in this part of the world, even if its usual expressions to us are primitive: national directive.
In war, commenting is on various civilization activities.
The belief in the necessity of the picture seems wrong in another phenomenon we have seen every day for a month.
Post - September 11th made most international televisions Lebanese televisions, yet with greater capabilities, more reporters, and deeper specialists.
No, it is the lack of pictures.
You find others like it, or slightly better, or worse, on all Arab satellite channels, all according to their resources.
The news is not from outside Afghanistan, as the viewer/listener finds it at MBC, Abu Dhabi Channel, and could also find it on Lebanese screens if those in charge of them did not mix media manufacturing with the calculations of a small merchant.
But the presence in Kabul is an economic and political success, not a media success.
The history of this star is immense, as she was a cabaret dancer for fifteen years and a singer and solo dancer for eleven years.
Marissa's father ,an engineer, and her mother ,a nurse, did not encourage her to practice this profession "but if that is her choice then let her proceed to a better place."
The show that she presented was entitled "The Spectacular". It lasted twelve years and she performed it six thousand times, at the rate of two times every night and six days a week. She was very affected when this show was stopped.
The cabaret girls dance with a wide smile drawn on their faces, making us feel we are at the beginning of the twentieth century with La Goulue, La Mome Fromage, Grille d'Egout and Mistinguett.
At the end of every show, the curtain comes down and Marissa goes back to her trailer to rest for twenty minutes.
"Prepare for the next show", a call comes from behind the scenes.
The film "Thirteen Days" tells the events of the war that almost erupted in 1962 between the United States and the Soviet Union, and pictures the White House's movements in the midst of crisis.
In the past, Jean Renoir's "French Cancan" (1955), and today "Moulin Rouge" by Baz Luhrmann, bring back to our memory the influence that profligacy had during that age in cabarets in the Parisian Place Blanche, which was frequented by people from various classes and nationalities.
The history of this star is full, as she was a cabaret dancer for fifteen years, and a singer and solo dancer for eleven years.
If the credit behind the launching of the American CNN network into globalism goes back to the Second World War, there is no doubt that the first war of the century on Afghanistan folds in its gusts an extraordinary soaring of the "Al Jazeera" channel in the information space of the universe, thrusting to it from the widest door through a small office in Kabul with a correspondent and a few technicians in an unprecedented record presence in harvesting breaking news from the Afghani land, in the shadow of the absence of any trace of foreign correspondents, who were vacated from there days before the beginning of military operations, which made the reporting of the news on most of the major global networks and news agencies, starting with CNN, the BBC and the French channels and ending with the "Euronews" station, accomplishable strictly through the correspondent of the "Al Jazeera" there, branded with its logo that dominated all the channels that circulated the video of the speech of Osama bin Laden and the consequences of the bombardment and destruction inside Afghanistan, in a journalistic and information scoop, which Al-Jazeera exploited, in the best possible manner, thus achieving for it a quantum leap in its success, penetrating Arab geographic frontiers and imposing itself forcefully on the map of the international information network and surpassing in many cases its counterparts agencies, such as "Reuters", the "French News Agency" and others.
The programmed and successful selection of guests, who are chosen at the appropriate time and place, comment on the event in two detailed bulletins during twenty four hours. The first is entitled "Midday", and the second is entitled "Daily Reap". They both contain a detailed calendar and presentation of the events in sometimes boring, meticulous and objective detail all at the same time, seeking to attract first the Arab viewer then the Western viewer in a vicious media battle to prove their existence. Reserving a permanent seat among the giants resulted first in an agreement signed with CNN to make use of its successful experience with regard to the news aspect, despite some mistakes and slips. Al Jazeera, after all, achieved in a few years what major decade old Arab satellites were unable to achieve. It was able to become a news source, not just a receiver from international agencies.
In which belles used to work in their lace dresses, dancing to the demonic rhythms of Jacques Offenbach's music, so that their legs rise towards the chandeliers hanging from the ceiling.
This place was frequented by young girls, especially at the end of the month, to test their luck in the air filled with smoke and lights, or to meet a rich man or member of the Jockey club or any other club, who was generous to them.

But the police prevented the continuation of these behaviors.
The film "Thirteen Days" narrates the events of the war that almost erupted in 1962 between the United States and the Soviet Union, and pictures the White House movements in the midst of crisis.
"Thirteen Days" is a strong dramatic-documentary film characterized by good direction, and presents the point of view of Kani O'Donnel, a close companion of John Fitzgerald Kennedy "J.F.K", based on the archives of the White House.
Oliver Stone tried in the movie "J.F.K" to show John Kennedy as a balanced man, political and exciting.
The movie "Doctor Stragelnoff" is a caricature of the president, so was the new movie "Los Angeles 2013", with a president afflicted with mental weakness, anxiety and Christian fanaticism.
And the strange thing is the continued presence of men of religion in the White House and their inseparability from American presidents in most of the cinematic films.
Martin Sheen plays the role of the American president who does not care about all these things.
"God created man with eyes that look to the front, so that man can only see himself in a mirror (...) the mirror is the other person that sees you and that you see."
American President George Bush rejected a "Taliban" proposal to hand over fundamentalist "Al Qaeda" leader Osama bin Laden to a third country if the movement receives evidence implicating him in the attacks on New York and Washington on September 11th.
"People in America are afraid of the unknown", that is what US Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson declared, after the weekend witnessed a rise in the number of those afflicted or carrying the anthrax virus from 4 to 12 people, and the circle of danger expanded from Florida to New York and Nevada. More than one American official pointed a finger at the "Al Qaeda" Network, and its leader Osama bin Laden, without directing an outright accusation of launching a terrorist attack with biological weapons.
He added: "They are being treated and that does not mean, and I am careful to confirm, that they have the anthrax disease."
American President George Bush rejected a "Taliban" proposal to hand over fundamentalist "Al Qaeda" leader Osama bin Laden to a third country if the movement receives evidence implicating him in the attacks on New York and Washington on September 11th.
Last night, US fighters launched a new raid on Kabul after bombing it during the day, and it targeted "Taliban" positions on the front line with the opposing Northern Alliance troops.
It said that the raids targeted Kandahar airport, the New Al Qishleh Barracks, an army base east of the city, and other areas.
Officials in the "Taliban" confirmed that the front line north of Kabul did not change, and no conflicts between the "Taliban" and the Northern Alliance were recorded during the night.
The UAE News Agency "WAM" reported "media sources" in Islamabad as saying that Mutawakkil might be representing separatists in the the "Taliban" ranks after a conflict with Mulla Omar.
He added, "There is no need to discuss innocence or guilt."
He pointed out that the president participated in national security meetings in which an early plan for a regime that will succeed "Taliban" was discussed, and explored issues like security, forming a transitional government, and economically rebuilding the country.
The "New York Times" reported that Bush discussed lately in at least two meetings of the national security council a way for the United States and the allies, in their "war on terrorism", to help Afghanistan form a new government.
With the continuation of military strikes against Afghanistan, the internal pressure on Pakistani President Parvez Musharaf mounts. The protests of fundamentalist Islamists moved from the demonstrations and speech mobilization stage to the stage of security challenges, whether by attacking military basis, massing fighters ready to go to Afghanistan, or threatening to kill any American soldier that comes to the country.
The second base is located in the city of Basni in Baluchistan province, parallel to the border with Afghanistan, inhabited by a majority of Pashtu tribes to which more than half the people of Afghanistan and the followers of the "Taliban" movement belong.
But army troops and police had anticipated the matter, blockaded all city entrances, and deployed tanks in the main cities. The army also imposed a strict siege on the base, and nearby citizens were asked to leave the area.
At least one person was killed and 24 were injured, among them 2 policemen and 3 citizens in critical condition.
Pakistani newspapers say that the Northern Alliance supporters in that province, opposed to the "Taliban", as well as supporters of the return of the former Afghanistan King Zaher Shah, who is currently residing in Rome, are being subjected to threats from the supporters of the movement.
But the difficulty of Musharaf's situation, who has provided complete support to America and was the only president of a Muslim country to declare his conviction of the evidence produced by Washington on Osama bin Laden's involvement in the September 11th attacks, will increase as the American campaign on Afghanistan goes on, and as the number of civilians killed as a result of the Anglo-American strikes increases.
He stressed that "we do not have anything against the Northern Alliance (...) the issue is that there is balance, meaning that the ethnic groups must be represented in the future government."
So will the US Secretary of State offer what Musharaf hopes for to stand firm in the face of internal storms?
Friendship and cordiality brought me together with the esteemed Hamiyyeh family in Ein Annoub for a not-too-short  period of time, especially with the late Judge Fouad Hamiyyeh, father of the former Minister of Finance Adel Hamiyyeh and then with the late Ambassador Abbas Hamiyyeh, whose traits and attributes we are now discussing. He was chosen by God on Saturday 22nd of September 2001, suddenly following a heart attack from which he suffered greatly, and slightly recovered from, a year ago, until he died after a life filled with continuous work in his diplomatic job, moving among several European and Oriental countries. Before his retirement, he was Lebanon's Ambassador to Spain.
Ambassador Abbas was a man of honor, loyalty, and love, with no competitors. He was a man of nobility, high morals, and good origins.
I visited him in his home in Verdan every once in a while, and he welcomed me profusely and promised to give me documents and transcripts on his grandfathers, so that I may have an aide in my research on his family history, which produced scientists, literary figures and intellectuals.
Falah Maroun:  A Lebanese State in the Sky of the West by Nawal Al-Barazi
In the outburst of this foggy uproar and what they attribute to us falsely and slanderously, honoring Falah Maroun comes a bead of light, added to the beads of a long rosary of Arab and Lebanese names, which shined in the sky of the West over many centuries, whether the European West or the American West. Would they remember! Perhaps their remembrance of these will erase from the minds of many in the West that ugly picture which they were meant to imagine about the Arab human being and thwart their disdain of our capabilities and denial of our worthiness of joining the procession of science, progress and civilization.
From Patriarch Altienne to Patriarch Sfeir By Elie Aswad
Because of Prince Basheer Al-Shihabi's apprehensiveness of the growing influence of Jiryes Baz and his brother Abdel Ahad, he, in agreement with his brother Prince Hassan and the two Sheikhs Nasser Eddine Imad and Ali Talhouq, arranged for a conspiracy to finish off the two brothers in one day, which was Friday, the fifteenth of May, 1807. The first was to be killed at Deir Al-Qamar through an arrangement by Prince Basheer and the other at Jbeil through an arrangement by Prince Hassan.
At the palace, the Prince ordered four of his men, belonging to the house of Zein Eddne, to enter the hall and stifle Jiryes Baz.
But he ordered stripping Baz of his clothes and throw him at the garden of the Lady of the Mount Abbey.
Abdul Ahad realized the goal of the attack. A battle ensured during which Sheikh Ali Talhouq and Sheikh Nasser Imad Eddine were injured and Abdul Ahad Baz was hit with a bullet in his flank and the attackers finished him off  and looted the assets of the palace.
Yesterday, history repeated itself and the massacres were repeated between the sons of the same team from Ihden, to Safra, to the uprising that preceded and followed the tripartite accord, to another oath swearing at Bkirki, until to "war of cancellation".
The first was represented by what was called the Yazreh Army, and the second consisted of militias that were considered to be a popular reservoir that acted as a reserve for it.
This is a matter that has repeatedly obligated us to focus the light on the current Christian situation in accordance with the following criteria:
Minister Suleiman Frenjiet enjoys a leading moral role in this case, which could open the door in front of many conciliations.
The partisan experience has been harsh on the Lebanese public opinion, particularly the Christian and serious statistics do not give more than the ratio of ten percentage to those who wish to join political parties.
Atallah's book on "French-Lebanese friendship" is his second investigation-reportage book after "Poisonous Garbage in the Land of the Cedars."
Randy Nahleh is the only Lebanese mentioned in the 2002 edition of the "Guinness" encyclopedia. He may be the only Lebanese to be mentioned in the encyclopedia as "Lebanese", not "of Lebanese origin".
Tripoli ? "An-Nahar": The Picture and the Techniques of Expression in the Primary School Cycle" is the title of the training course launched by the new Director of the French Cultural Center in the North, Phillip Ardouan, at the beginning of educational activities for private school teachers in the North for the scholastic year 2001-2001.
Safadi stressed the need of the region for enhancing these activities in order to guarantee openness to the World.
Minister ghazi Al-Areedhi represented the President of the Republic, Emile Lahoud at the annual dinner of the "Press Club" (Society of Graduates of the Faculty of Information and Documentation) at the "Regency Palace" hotel at Edma Friday evening, in the presence of the representative of the President of the House of Deputies, Deputy Ni'matallah Abi Nasr; the representative of the Prime Minister, Minister of Social Affairs Ass'ad Diab; the representative of the Deputy Prime Ministry, his Information Advisor, Christian Oussi; deputies Farid Makari, Nabil de Freij, Faris Sa'id and Mansour Al-Boun, and colleagues Antoine Chediac, representing the presidents of the journalists and editors syndicates,

The "Racism Between Durban and Beirut" Seminar Gregoire Haddad: Familism, Sectarianism and Regionalism Are All Racist That Find Their Solution in Comprehensive Secularism
She considered that "intensifying information, providing testimonials, and attending to the provision of education and culture, based on the principles of human rights, are the protective shield against savagery and abominableness."
Al-Hajj lectured on the "psychological and social roots of the emergence of racism" and said" "Racism started at a narrow scale in the shape of individual practices perpetrated by persons, who are wrong in their negative behaviors with their brethren in humanity.
He added, "Racism has gone beyond the philosophy of color and race. It is an intellectual philosophy that has its bases, elements and methods and is spread in the world. Discrimination has become a philosophy of the contempt of the human being."
In Lebanon, sectarian racism appears in particular.
Alongside the seminar, an exhibition was held entitled "Pictures and Racism", which included a set of pictures published in France in 1880 to promote France's plan to colonize Africa.

Spoke About the Annual Dinner of the Press Club Areedhi: We Are Against Terrorism In All Its Forms And The Situation Started To Take Dangerous Directions
Then, Minister Al-Areedhi delivered a speech, which included: "Our meeting with this club is a meeting with a gathering of communicators, who yearn for giving and for developing the profession. They are all colleagues, with whom we went through the most difficult days in all the ordeals to which Lebanon has been subjected. Their appearances have had a good impact through following up those events; working always in the different locations under the protection of a homeland, which is the homeland of freedom, democracy and diversity; working towards advancing Lebanon and defending its unity and cause in the confrontation with Israeli aggression, on the one hand, and achieving victory by liberating the land and supporting the resistance, in order to lay down the foundations of freedom and democracy inside and coping with the people's issues and their suffering.
We are not to evaluate the causes now, or to talk about the stations of this war, but to talk about what concerns us as Lebanese, on the one hand, and as Arabs living in a region that has suffered much from terrorism, particularly, especially and specifically Israeli terrorism.
Nor should we forget, whenever we point to this matter, that Lebanon has lost Lebanese and skilled and prominent citizens in that aggression. We also have been hit in the aggression against the United States of America by losing a number of our prominent young men."
What concerns us is our security and our stability in the shadow of this confusion, this ambiguity and this war under an ambiguous heading, as nobody has resorted to hearing the position of the Arab and Muslims, as well as a large number of States, calling for determining the concept of terrorism in order to find out what this war is all about, against whom, from where, and where to?
The attitude is therefore obvious and the intentions are obvious.
Tribute in Sidon for Prince Khaled Al-Faisal
Deputy Al-Hariri began the celebration with a word, in which she said, "what we are exposed to is nothing but misuse of our capabilities and our salvation comes through the interweaving
He called every Arab to strive to exert an effort in the service of his homeland by all means.
"Amal": America Generalizes Its Laws and Exempts Israel From Them
He criticized "American policy that tries to enact laws and codes for implementation in one place and non-implementation in another and the exemption it exercises in relation to Israel".
* Deputy Ali Bizzi announced that "We are keen on fighting terrorism, provided we define it and fighting it is carried out under the umbrella of the United Nations, despite our remarks against it."
At the invitation of member of the Party's Political Bureau, Ibraheem Reesha, an expanded Falange meeting was held at his home in Jarran, during which Baqardouni spoke. He said: "The recent elections were political in the first place and the Falangists chose between two lines: the line of modernization and unification and the line of tradition and secession. The advocates of modernization and unification won and the traditionalists and secessionists withdrew. The Falangist elections heralded the birth of a new Falange Party with a new methodology and a new project."
He concluded: "The new Falangist Leadership is determined to implement the modernization and unification project at the Party and the Homeland. It promises the Lebanese and the Falangists that it will do so and will not pass on the Falange Party as we received it and tomorrow you will witness a new Falange Party."
He renewed Lebanon's condemnation of terrorism, but he had reservations about the policy of the United States of America in the Middle East. He observed that the terrorism of individuals and organizations comes "from the womb of the terrorism of the State" and called on the American Administration to address the causes that led to the September 11th attacks.
He was afraid that "there are in this matter bribes from both sides," noting that one of the images of terrorism is also embodied in washing one's hands of implementing international resolutions.
For Islam does not need to defend its existence.
He considered that "it is not in the interest of the United States of America for the battle to be a battle of civilizations.
The United Nations at this stage is a witness, whom we need."
Sa'ad disapproved in a separate statement of the decision by Interior and Municipalities Minister Elias Al-Murr to ban motorcycles in Sidon and its surroundings.
Legal Opinion Office Commemorated Anniversary of Isra' and Mi'raj Qabbani: We Will Not Tolerate Slaughtering Muslims Qablan: We Refuse Accepting American Fate Gheith Qablan Qabbani "The Islamic Group"
Our enemy practices the ugliest forms of terrorism and he still practices them on our people in occupied Palestine, and before that in Lebanon.
And that it is what caused the death of many Americans? (...).
The destruction of cities, villages and structures in Afghanistan with modern American tools of destruction is absolute exactly the same as terrorism (...)
What justice is this?
As for us in Lebanon, the Lebanese, both Muslim and Christian, as declared by their political and religious leaders, have unified in rejecting terrorism and protecting the resistance in order to liberate the homeland from the occupying Zionist enemy.
Al Khatib said in his speech:
We Muslims are ready to demand an international humanitarian charter that suppresses terrorism in all its types.
Farewell Party Held at Qalawiyyeh Tower Finnish Battalion Leaves Today Leaving Behind Memorial Monument for its Victims
The memorial monument also bore the names of the commanders, who led it, one after the other since 1982. They were 18 colonels, the first of whom was Colonel Matta Skina, who served from November 4, 1982 until to the first of April 1984.
Colonel Hiki Holma delivered a speech in which he welcomed everyone and said: "The Finnish Battalion worked in the south for 19 years as part of the international force.
And before our departure, we called you as friends to leave a memento of us to remind you of our presence in your region.
And this monument will remain a witness in the future for the youth as an affectionate and friendly proof of our cooperation, which has lasted a long time and will go on."
And the images are still in my mind of the school children going to school under certain danger.
Let us ask ourselves how have we been able, as two nationalities and two religions, to be friends and one family.
We hope from our hearts for the Lebanese people to live in peace to make this beautiful country an advanced and wealthy country as it was before, and better (...)."
Everyone was invited to a lunch banquet that was decorated with Finnish food.
He saw in a statement by the "Central News Agency" that the uncovering of old files by the United State is "for placing pressure on officials in Lebanon and get to what it wants.
And America does not understand this situation, nor does it understand it, but tries to surmount it."
And on whether he saw a settling of accounts in reopening the file in light of the conclusion of the elections at the Falange Party, he replied: "If this is the tendency, then it is wrong. I am always against the spiteful policy against anyone and from any party.
The "International Day of Francophone Pharmacists" opened yesterday at the Pharmacists Syndicate in the presence of the Minister of the Emigrants Marwan Hamadeh, Minister Pierre Helou, the president of the Pharmacists' Syndicate, Ghassan Al Amin, the president of the Syndicate of Pharmaceuticals Importers, Armand Faris, the President of the Social Economic Council, Roger Nisnas, Former President of the Pharmacists Syndicate Layla Khouri, Francophone lecturers, and medical and pharmaceutical personalities.
Then there was an address by Khouri, in which she spoke about attachment to Francophonia and to everything it represents, and about the efforts being exerted to maintain its status in Lebanon.
"Secular Meeting" Gave Legal Opinion to Supporting Afghanistan, Prohibited "Opening Lands of Muslims to America"
The meeting was held at the Islamic Da'wa College in Beir Hassan at the invitation of the "Coalition of Muslim Scholars".
We refuse to let America define what is meant by terrorism, and that this matter should be a sword it wields on the necks of peoples when it wants. The concept of terrorism must be identified through an international accord, far from American hegemony, and at that time, they will find that America is the most prominent source of terrorism.
As Muslim Sunni and Shiite scholars, we consider that America wants the head of Islam, not that of the Sunnis and Shiites. We will not fall for any attempt to win one category over under the pretext that the other category is the target. Therefore, all Muslims must rise to defend themselves.
At seven in the evening, Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri received the Chairman of the Progressive Socialist Party, Deputy Walid Junblat, at his mansion in Qreitem, and discussed with him the local situation and international developments.
He renewed Lebanon's condemnation of terrorism, but was reserved on the policy of the United States in the Middle East. He noted that the terrorism of individuals and organizations comes "from the womb of state terrorism", and called on the American Administration to deal with the causes that led to the September 11th attacks.
He expressed the apprehension that "the matter involves bribes from both sides", and pointed out that one of the images of terrorism is represented as well.

It reported that Chairman of the "Labor" Party bloc at the Knesset as saying that when President George Bush tries to establish a new world order, it is hard to imagine how Israeli politics will be able to maintain the previous balance inside the Knesset.
On the American pressure on Israel, political commentator Rovik Rozenthal wrote in "Maariv" yesterday: "All evidence points to increasing pressure by the Bush Administration to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by creating a Palestinian State within boundaries and conditions that guarantee security for Israel."
Sharon can apologize for the "Chamberlain Speech" over and over, but the meaning is clear. Bush does not believe that the Palestinian State represents a threat to Israel, like Nazi Germany was a threat to Czechoslovakia.
The Roman Catholic Community in the Rashaya El-Wadi region celebrated the one hundred and twentieth anniversary of building The Lady Church in the city. On the occasion, a celebratory mass was held, officiated by Bishop Antoine Hayek, who gave a sermon in which he stressed "This historic church exercised an important role during the period of Ottoman colonialism." He said "The church whose anniversary we are celebrating was the refuge for youth from most of the sects escaping unpaid work and compulsory conscription. It has educated generations and graduated many intellectuals, members of parliament, and people of position in the state. Many of its children are spread in the two Americas, some of whom have important jobs."
The Parson of the Sidon Maronite Parish, Archbishop Tanyos El Khouri, officiated at a celebratory mass at the Mar Elias Church in the town of Ba'zaran   - El Chouf, on the occasion of laying down the corner stone for the church hall.
After the mass, El Khouri, El Bustani and the representative of Deputy Walid Junblat placed the corner stone of the new hall.
The participants remembered those lost on October 13, 1990 and the imprisoned colleague, Habib Younis.
And why does the United States insist on including the names of strugglers and resistors of the Zionist occupier in the lists of those accused of terrorism, while we do not find one name of those leading Zionist war criminals and terrorists in these lists?"
He reminded of "attempts by the Jews since the beginning of the twentieth century to portray our nation as an uncivilized nation" and was of the opinion that "fundamentalist Muslims helped give credibility to this Jewish deception, because they still believe in the twenty first century that Islam is a religion and a state."
President of the Union, Ibrahim Nafe', gave a speech in which he spoke about the work of the Union.
Earth Day in the Palestine, the anniversary of the 30th of March 1976. On that day, six Arab Israelis were killed.
It is a day that is repeated every day in Palestine.
Is Ariel Sharon prepared for a dialogue that will bring him down from the tank and remove his hand from the gun?
But everyone wants America to be just.
And the Arabs are not terrorists and the Palestine must become a Homeland, a state and a capital, which is Jerusalem".
The Secretary General of the Federation read a report on the activities of the Federation in the past year.
Opening Third Seminar on Modern Administration Al Sa'ad: Reducing Legislative Restrictions
Our administration has suffered from indigestion in legislation and regulations. While many states have tended to reform legislation through amendments and repeals, in order to reduce restrictions and facilitate the work of the public employee and the life of the citizen, this aspect of the Lebanese public administration has remained over the decades a driving force for, and an objective for many attempts. It is high time to deal seriously and objectively with the issue and exert pressure on the political administration to expedite passage through legislative channels.
Then followed speeches by Dr. Gerard Timiset, Dr. Louis Habeiqeh, Dr. Anthony Macriomitris, Britney O'Hannan, and Maron Kisrouani.
They noted that he has been doing this for months, not just by directing appeals through the media, but also with personal contacts in Israel in cooperation with Kofi Annan's personal representative to the peace process, Terry Rod Larson, which included Israeli Defense Minister Benjamin Bin Eliazer and other officials, in order to stop Israeli violation of the "Blue Line". Despite reaching an agreement in this regard, the Jewish State has not complied with it.
They drew the attention of the governments of their countries that that is unacceptable; that Israel must be asked to stop them because they may lead to unjustified tension in this emergency international circumstance after September 11th, and that there is no need for a regional explosion, especially at this time, to divert attention from the process of fighting terrorism undertaken by the United States, with Britain's help.
The sources gave evidence of the Jewish State's desire for this role, which was that in any step declared by Washington after September 11th, Israel hurriedly announced its opinion and readiness to be among the countries that wish to fight terrorism.
The Antonian Order of Monks Commemorated the Anniversary of Shurfan and Abi Khalil Atallah: We Pray to Jolt Consciences and Demand What is Right
In the name of inclusive brotherhood and love that knows no bounds, in the name of justice and peace, we come to raise our prayers to the God of peace, love and justice, so that our prayers may jolt the consciences of those who have power, by right or without right, over the fate of people and individuals, so that they may go back on their injustice and arrogance, and work for good, peace, right, and blessings.
We are dealing with governments and official institutions that say they believe in right and promise justice.
Justice is a virtue and equity is practicing it."
Deir Doreit (Al Shouf) - "Al Nahar":
Father Nimer stated following the meeting:
This is encouraging that the mountain will not be divided from the inside, even if we were divided for a while from the outside.
Minister of State Pierre Helou noted that "the State is inoperative and waiting for implementing the appointments." He attributed the cause to the "Troika case, about which we have been complaining for quite some time."
When asked on whether he had any information on the possibility of a government change, he said: "I don't have an answer, because I am not informed about that. The last of my concerns is where I will be discharged from this cabinet. Today, I am a deputy and I could be more free if I go back to being a deputy."
That is why I would not be surprised if they send me home in the first cabinet reshuffle, or even to the parliament."
Concluding consensual agreements includes agreements with the government of the United States of America and other friendly governments and foreign companies recommended by their governments to purchase, after approval from the Council of Ministers, materiel, equipment and spare parts, and to provide training on them, which are not available in Lebanon.
At the invitation of the Upper Matn Organization in the Community Party, a dialogue meeting was held last Saturday with Secretary General of the Party, Farouq Dahrouj, at the hall of the "Social Center for the Masri Family" in the town of Saleema. In addition to party leaders and members in the Matn and Mountain regions, the meeting was attended by the representative of the Progressive Socialist Party, Farouq Al A'war, groups and delegations.
He noted that "America is using the tragedy that befell it on September 11th for other calculations and purposes. Up till now, it has not revealed its entire strategic or tactical objectives."
He also touched on the "positions of the Americans after what happened in New York and Washington, namely, President George Bush's support of implementing resolutions 242 and 338, and creating a Palestinian state." He saw that "these positions are tactical and must not fool us, because the Americans want to stop the Intifada and guarantee the support of the Arab states in their unjust war, and they also want to quiet the Arab and Palestinian streets.
Minister of Public Works and Transport Najeeb Miqati and Minister of Justice Samir Al- Jisr inspected projects being implemented by the Ministry of Public Works in Akkar, at a total cost of approximately five billion pounds.
They met with the people of the region of Akroum.
The delegation also stopped at the home of Deputy Wajih Al Ba'rini at Wadi Reehan, and then toured the Jurd-Qatee' regions, where they were received by a representative of the Deputy Prime Minister, Issam Faris.
He pointed out two important projects by the Ministry of Works in cooperation with the World Bank, which are Abda-Areeda road and Abda-Fneidiq.
Jisr said: "With regard to the Ministry of Justice, we are working on meeting the shortage in the number of judges and this is the first time the Judges Institute took a number that reached 29, while in the past it did not exceed twenty."
Until now there is no official request, and we will deal with any request if it is within the concepts of sovereignty and international agreements."
Miqati said, "The inauguration is temporary in response to the demands of the people, and in order to find a solution to the daily traffic problems in the area." He pointed out that "work will go on extensively until the work on the said bridge is completed as soon as possible."
In the currently disturbed regional and international climates, there are attempts to transform the conflict that resulted from the attacks on the eleventh of last September on the United States to a sectarian conflict between Islam and Christianity.
We are pleased to see that the majority of the Arab Islamic states are understanding of this reality and make a distinction between Islam and the crimes banned and condemned by the Holy Quran.
For the continued watching of those killed is an abominable crime that must be stopped for good.
Might we bring to mind the Arab Prophet's words to Imam Ali, may God make his memory pleasant, in the area of singing the praises of his attributes and characteristics: "You have a similarity with Jesus, son of Mary?"
Preparations for the conference to be held by Mr. Fouad Malek to demand restoring the license of the "Lebanese Forces" Party are not separate from the general course started months ago and crystallized with the elections of the Falange Party.
For until now, the blend with which he plans to launch the new party has not matured, in view of the attracting forces that control the group he meets with, with the goal of obtaining the license.
Although Malek and Administrative Board member Richard Jreisati are careful to say that the request will witness the inclusion of those in the general amnesty so that they can go back and participate in the new party.

Germany, Lebanon and "Hizbollah"
Here, Schroeder says, "Germany has different points of view".
The other prominent indicator is Germany's advanced position regarding Lebanon's preoccupations and economic concerns, meaning the partnership with the European Union and, more than that, the financial Paris-2 conference, at this exceptionally sensitive international phase.
As for in this specific field, the division is a form of unjustified imagination.
Lebanese dialogue with European countries is a need outside the wooden game that it can resemble at some stations.
The question before us to day is: How do we adapt the circumstances of the stage to serve the unity of Lebanon and the safety of its land and people and its equally important values which are democracy, protecting public and private freedoms, and launching the creative civil society forces to balance the permanent readiness to security slips at every basic juncture.
Political circles wonder whether the reassuring comments by Prime Minister Rafic Al-Hariri concerning Lebanon's relationship with the United States and his saying that they are relations of friendship, dialogue and cooperation, and that there is talk of helping Lebanon economically, are statements based on information or whether they are merely wishes and analysis that must be stated from his position as an official?
The reality is that President Hariri is depending on the interference of President Chirac with American President George Bush in order to protect Lebanon from financial punishments if he does not respond to what the United States is demanding of him regarding "Hizbollah", and on whether the French President obtained from his American counterpart what is reassuring and makes him understand Lebanon's situation and its position towards "Hizbollah" which is a political position related to internal harmony and the security situation, aside from the legal position that makes "Hizbollah's" behavior not applicable to describing it as terrorist.
But if President Bush and President Bush agree on one opinion, there are inside the American administration those who have a different opinion and insist on dealing with "Hizbollah" and the opposition Palestinian organizations, especially "Hamas" and "Islamic Jihad" movements as terrorist parties and organizations against whom all measures of fighting terrorism are implemented. Inflexible individuals inside the American administration support expanding the strikes after Afghanistan so that they include Iraq, which is a source of threat to the interests of the United States in the region, that Washington does not present any initiative to achieve peace before terrorism activities are stopped, and that the war on Afghanistan and joining the international alliance is not a bargaining chip for any party, like stating the resolving of the Palestinian issue as a condition to joining this alliance.
Therefore, Lebanon must not provide an excuse to America or to Israel to take measures that harm it.  As a result, it must concentrate, for the time being, on arranging the internal house and organizing its affairs, and to treat the problems it is facing with reason, wisdom and knowledge. As former minister Michel Eddeh said in an interview, Lebanon cannot benefit from the new conditions in the international arena if its citizens continue fruitless conflicts against each other and between the leadership and inside the authority.
For the Lebanese have a resistance that is not available to other peoples.
Qandahar falls exactly like Kabul and before Mazar al Sharif fell, but victory in its true, deep and beneficial meaning needs more than this fire show amid all this painful emptiness and all this dust and all this poverty and misfortune.
There is no meaning for shedding stupid tears in the world of the savage world relations, and saying one day for example that the cost of the American bombing or an hour of these costs could have changed the features of the Afghani picture to a degree that does not allow the Taliban experiment to continue and stabilize, and does not pave the way afterwards for "Al Qaeda" or the Arab Taliban or the thoughts of Osama bin Laden. And there is no need to remind that ten Cruz missiles equal the budget of the entire Afghani "state". But it is necessary to remember that all this bloody dust and the features of the Afghani picture drowning in "misfortune" is the present of America's hands that created the defeat of the Soviets with the unhappiness of the Afghanis and created the defeat of the Afghanis with the unhappiness of the thoughts of Mulla Omar and Osama bin Laden.

The right to search individuals and homes in secret, suddenly, and without warrants.

By Rozanna Bou Munsif:
The reason for this bewilderment is that critical and reproachful official voices appear when Powell or others tour the region absenting Lebanon from his agenda over what happened months before and what happened with British Prime Minister Tony Blair who also dropped Lebanon from his Arab tour.
It would have been possible to be lenient regarding ignoring Lebanon by the Americans in New York and giving the Syrians priority to discuss the "Hizbullah" file if Lebanon had not been there or if ignoring it did not constitute an actual insult to it, as issues that concern it are being discussed with others while warnings are directed to it over its economic situation and issues similar to that.
Therefore the political support to the visits of Prime Minister Rafic Hariri to Russia and the European countries, which is a support witnessed in differed previous different circumstances, should have endorsed for Prime Minister Hariri in coordination with Syria to head Lebanon's delegation to New York and meet with Powell and others, according to some people's opinion, in order to clarify the Lebanese-American differences in the matter of the American list regarding "Hizbullah", and what it entails of Lebanon's falling short of convincing Syria of a certain role for it in the negotiations with the Americans on the issue as long as it is in the forefront and will be the helpless one and not Syria or Iran, both of whom the United States needs to settle the matters of the region or in its war against terrorism.
But according to non-local diplomats, the danger is in what Lebanon is showing of giving in to the status quo, which no longer comes only at its expense, but also cancels any outside presence for it.
First, Turkey's sharing with these republics, or a large part of them, a mutual language, and the former's feeling that it has a responsibility towards the latter and its peoples that were in the past a part of the people of the Ottoman Empire.
Fifth, the Turkish regime's care to spread its influence to that region to face the dangers threatening it, namely the fundamental Islamic currents taken in the past by the Iranian Islamic Republic and supported and promoted later by the Taliban movement after controlling Afghanistan with the help of Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden and its "Al Qaeda" Network.
Second, to benefit from the situation that arouse to double the efforts in order to remove obstacles and difficulties that stood in the way for a long time and still stand in the way of Turkey's "joining" the European Union.
As for the careful or late reading, based on the same information and sources, it indicates that the actual concern currently prevailing in Turkey is gaining the approval of American President George Bush and his administration, especially the Department of Defense the "Pentagon", and ensure their sympathy with the Turkish interests and demands.
And as a result they do not want it to merge with their countries.
It was also a move aimed at showing readiness to work with fighters who abandon Taliban and bin Landon and have things in common with Turkey whether in belonging to the same race or the same religion.
And third, that America, specifically the Pentagon, must spend a lot of money on the Turkish army because it can play the important roles in the entire region.
From Montesquieu in the eighteenth century, to Helen Carrier Dankos in the nineties, under a remarkable title "The French Academy and Lebanon", the reader can follow the course of history through literary paragraphs and with the pens of French academics who came to Lebanon on several missions, political, diplomatic, archeological or tourist and left invaluable documents on Lebanon, the Lebanon of the cedars and waterfalls and a life of plenty, to a pitiful and torn apart Lebanon, the theater for religious wars, confusion and violence.

He added, aside from the fighting going on in the south, there are operations continuing in the northern city of Qandaz in which fighters from "Al Qaeda" are mostly participating and not the "Taliban" forces.
He said that the Department would investigate the matter.
There is a large reward (...) millions of dollars to arrest him."
Frankly, aside from that, we know nothing.

He pointed out that an official at the United Nations, Fransisk Fendril, might travel Friday to Kabul.
Ambiguity Towards "Hizbullah" Germany Brings Back Heat to "Paris-2" and the Partnership
As for our calendar of Hizbullah, we have different points of view."
But this ambiguity did not include two economic files that are sensitive to Lebanon, as Schroeder promised Hariri supportive German participation of Lebanon in the "Paris-2" Conference early next year.
The sources noted that the German officials directed repeated questions on the security situation in southern Lebanon, and Hariri answered them that it is alright and that a fragile stability prevails, blaming Israel for keeping its occupation of Lebanese Shabaa farms and its daily violations of the Lebanese airspace.
Doha Conference Success in Launching New Round of European Commission Trade Negotiations
India had objected until the last minute on some paragraphs in it, especially with regard to preparing for negotiations after two years concerning the part related to trade and investment, which raised concerns on the possibility of the failure of the conference.

He Will Present to Lahhoud, Assad, and King Abdullah Chirac Prepares "Appropriate Exit" that Pleases Palestinians and Does Not Anger Israelis
De La Misuzier will hand the letters to Lahhoud on Tuesday and Al Assad on Monday after meeting with King Abdullah II at the end of the week.
Efforts were exerted to issue a joint Arab - European - American statement on the conflict in the Palestinian territories on the sidelines of the proceedings of the General Assembly of the United Nations, but Washington preferred to issue its own position at this stage.
And there is serious effort based on finding satisfactory settlement for the Palestinians regarding the declaration of the state that does not anger the Israeli government that is reserved on President Yasser Arafat's declaration of his sought country.
Consequently, the idea of "Gaza first" proposed by Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres becomes more acceptable for the Palestinian side because it is listed under a new political framework.
Third, Sharon and his government enjoy the support of the Israeli streets, and there is no room to maneuver to exert actual pressure on the current Prime Minister.
The criminal court in Beirut sentenced, in a ruling yesterday headed by Judge Lebeeb Zwayyen and with councilor members, Wael Murtada and Ghada Awn to prison detained Palestinian Raed Mohammad Suleiman to 15 years mitigated sentence after it sentenced him to death, and convicted him of killed his grandmother in Ein Al Hilweh Camp by throwing a hand grenade at her for greed and revenge.
The defendant on the eve of the day of the crime on 7/20/1996 spent his time playing Flippers, riding the bike and sitting with his neighbor Mahmoud Shreidi at a watermelon stand, and then returned to his grandmother's house around twelve thirty after midnight where his grandmother was sound asleep on a mattress on the floor of one of the two rooms of the house, near the door leading to that room.
Then people started to crowd.
He stated to Beirut criminal court that he did not file a personal complaint against the people who threw the grenade, and that his uncle told him a week after he was detained the names of the perpetrators, and that the conflict between him and those who threw the grenade is not political.
It was clear that, at the moment of the crime, the murdered woman was sleeping as usual on a mattress on the floor inside the room.
Ambassador Le Courtier introduced the honored in a speech, and referred to their achievements in the security field in order to enhance cooperation relations and exchange of expertise between the two countries.
Army command, while confirming its concern for the safety and comfort of the security of our brothers inside the camps, warns these groups of going too far in these provocative attempts, and stresses it will strike back with the means it deems appropriate at any aggression attempt that happens later, whatever its form, in order to arrest the perpetrators and refer them to justice, and holds all forces inside these camps the responsible for the results of that."
It also issued a verdict of three months imprisonment and a two million lira fine for Samir Antoine Ahad and conscript soldiers Butros Eid Ghanem, Rabi' George Younis, Elie Farah Fleifli, Ilias Saleem Al Farran, and former conscript Elias Suheil Yamein for taking drugs.

A young man, who grew up on the love of helping others and supporting his human brother, inspired by instinct and principle.
What makes my heart bleed the most is when I hear a news story on the radio or television that some ignorant people claim Islam burned a church here and killed the innocent in a church there.
Attacking a church is an attack on the Messiah, Peace Be Upon Him, and attacking innocent people in the church, or in any sacred place, is an attack on the People of the Scriptures and, consequently, an attack on the Messiah, Peace Be Upon Him, and, as a result, an attack on Islam.
Jesus, son of Mary, said: "O God, Our Lord! Send us from heaven a table spread set with viands that there may be a feast for us, for the first of us and for the last of us, and a sign from Thee. Give us sustenance, for Thou art the Best of Sustainers."
These are the teachings of the Quran, and this the Messiah, Peace Be Upon Him, in our Quran, so do you not believe?
And we gave Jesus son of Mary proof and supported him with the Holy Spirit. The Almighty God said what was true.
The case will now be returned to the Military Judiciary for their opinion.
The petitioning party requested acceptance of the petition in form and merits, nullification of the verdict against which the appeal has been submitted, and interrogating both Deputy Faris Buweiz and Henry Sfeir as witnesses, but not under oath, in order to obtain clarifications for information only about what has been said in the current investigations regarding them.
In pursuance therefore, in form (...) whereas Article 78 of the Military Judicial Law No. 24/68, intending to expedite cases referred to the Military Judiciary, specifically identified the verdicts passed by military magistrates which the Government's Commissioner at the Military Court may appeal, to wit, verdicts on preclusion of prosecution, verdicts related to competence, and verdicts that are inconsistent with his submission.
Whereas the Military Examining Magistrate's verdict in this respect deals with dismissing a request by the Government's Commissioner aiming for the adoption of an investigative measure in the case, which, consequently, cannot be classified within the verdicts specifically identified in Article 78 of the Military Judiciary Law, which may be appealed by the Government's Commissioner before the Court of Cassation, nor can the inconsistent stipulations included in the Penal Procedural law in this respect be applied for the aforementioned reasons.
First: To dismiss the petition in form.
"A Small Country" Not "Small Homeland"
And Lebanon the homeland is its history (and what a glorious history!). It is its resident people and their immense energies and its people in the diaspora and the influence they sway around them.
How do we make them aware that the "small homeland" is their homeland, meaning the homeland of their geopolitical state, within which they (barely) have an influence in it and on it, but only within its internationally-recognized borders, while Lebanon the homeland spreads over an area of time, past and present and the homelands of the entire world (and politicians have no power or role in it).
You want to annex Lebanon to France?
How many among our politicians know the phrase by Gabrielle Hanato (author of the book "History of the Egyptian Nation"): "If Lebanon's mountain is not the highest among the mountains of the world, it is the most exalted nation in the history of civilization."
"Read in French and Music" on its Sixth Day - Ebb and Flow painted by Basseely Sahnawi - The Isolation of Women in "The Privileges of Death" by Khouri Gata - Khouri Gata, Jabr Muawwad, Al-Khouri Odeh - The Program
In the introduction to the book, literary erudite Fifi Abu Deeb wrote: "I wanted to regain my innocence" ... from these intimate words, Muna Basseely Sahnawi made a charge of magnificent emotions.
In this new collection of paintings, entitled "For the Cause of Professions and Talents."
Muna Basseely embodies this, once through Gutenberg's original printing press as the theme of every elitist, who is keen about the printing vocation, and once again through the computer and the magic of the Internet, the instant carrier of all the words of love across the globe: Venus in front of the computer.
which I have not found until today. The woman in my novel is the weaker link or the prisoner.
The ceremony was preceded by a lecture, in which Antoine Khater shed light on the person of Gabriel Ibn Al-Qila'i of Lahfad and said that "he was the first Maronite to try to introduce genuine reforms to the Maronite Church in Mount Lebanon."
It is to be noted that Odeh (28 years old) won the Young Writer Award for one of the stories included in the book under the title "When the Projectile Blew".
Also at the signing ceremony, Claude Lorieu autographed at the Eastern Library, Francoise Tudorovitch at the Le Point Library and Jerome Loro Collet at Istifan Library.
In response to the complaint published in "An-Nahar" yesterday and signed by the students Joseph Sa'b, Mazen Kurdi, and Husam Al Rassi, regarding scientific scholarship at the National Council for Scientific Research, we received the following reply from the President of the Board of Directors of the Council, Dr. George Tu'meh and its Secretary General Dr. Mu'een Hamzah:
The Council resumed its activities in this regard as of the 1999-2000 school year, according to a scientific mechanism and through specialized committees that handle the classification of applications to be later reviewed by the Council's Board of Directors, which announces the names of the accepted candidates.
And in view of the attempt at libel led by the afore-mentioned students against the National Council for Scientific Research, we feel it is our duty to clarify the following facts:
3. Messrs Husam Tawfiq Al Rassi and Mazen Zakaria Kurdi did not receive the Council's scholarship because they did not meet the criteria. Most importantly, their grades were below the level set in the criteria of the scholarship.
Issues 89 and 90 of the "Scientific Research Newsletter," published by the Council during the past week, may be checked to get familiar with the quality of candidates and their scientific qualifications.
The "Lebanon Prize for Creativity" committee at the Makhzoumi Foundation organized a ceremony to hand out to winners for the year 2001 of the awards, whose value is 40 million liras, distributed in the following categories: Arts and Music to Gabrielle Yared, Arts and Heritage to the Lebanese Tourist Folkloric Troupe, represented by Nasser Makhoul, Medical Research to Professor Joseph Allouf, Education and Scientific Research to Dr. Bassima Al Hajj, Emerging Talent to Ruba Al Amin for the category of Arts and Artistic Direction.
The Honorary President of the Foundation, Fou'ad Makhzoumi, then distributed the awards to the winners. After that was followed speeches by the winners. Solange Yared spoke on behalf of her son and apologized for her son's inability to attend due to his presence outside Lebanon and considered that the best way to express thanks to the Foundation and the attendees was to listen to a piece of music by Gabrielle.
At the end, Al Amin thanked the Foundation for its moral support that encourages youth, confirming that the advertising posters for which she received the award are not for boastfulness, but a message to awaken the child in every human being.
The result was marginalizing the project.
Her work, including a field study, "an anticipation of dangers and challenges, and identification of terminology and synonyms, and the quest to benefit from these techniques in order to achieve growth, stability and the protection of human rights, these matters cannot be the responsibility of an individual, but they are the responsibility of the state and all its societal institutions."
Sinno then signed her two books "Television in Lebanon and the Arab World" and "Communication in the Age of Globalization" at the pavilion occupied by the Arab Renaissance Publishing House.

Al Ahliyyah published Ziyadeh's complete works, which are available at the exhibition. The writer will autograph again for those who wish.
He was apprehensive of a transformation from an open culture of openness to an enclosed culture of enclosure, especially in the United States itself, of the danger of exploiting the event to suppress liberties and the right to be different and of imposing an intellectual economic vision of the essence of the world.
He called for fighting the concept of civilization divide, and working towards solving the basic problems that led to terrorism, of which poverty is the most prominent.
He asked, "We don't know the difference between calls of this kind, and the current practices in dictatorships that were always criticized by the US and the parliament democracies. And we do not know the difference between what is going on now and what went on between the years 1946 and 1952 when Senator Joseph McCarthy held the American democracy by the neck on the pretext of fighting communism, and so the names of wanted people appeared, reminiscent of the wanted lists now. At that time and in that rude era of American history, such names as Dwight Eisenhower, who became a national hero, appeared on the list, as well as Charlie Chaplin, Oppenheimer and others."
He predicted that the scope of these results "will increase with the passage of time, and that the world has become in great need of the industrial countries approving agreement plans that will contribute to recapturing growth in the year 2002.
A poll was conducted to obtain opinions of Americans regarding their refusal or support of steps that limit the freedom of Arabs living in the United States, similar to what happened to the Japanese during the Second World War. 35% of Americans supported these steps, which is a high and scary percentage at the same time.
He concluded: "These requirements might be more far reaching that what we hope to achieve, but the world has in fact changed after September 11th, and the invisible divide between the industrial west and the poor east is now more clearly visible."

Berri Raises With Him the Question of the Fate of the Faqara Decisions and the Surpluses of the Administrations. Lahoud to the French delegation: Lebanon Is Far Away from the Events and America Has to Change Its View
He renewed his call upon the European Union to "assume a role in finding a just and comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict in accordance with the principles laid down at the Madrid Conference," drawing attention to the fact that "the situation cannot continue as it is and the continuous Israeli escalation will not lead to any result other than the escalation and expansion of acts of violence into the inside of Israel as has been happening for some time now."
He reiterated "the necessity of guaranteeing the Palestinians' right to return to their lands and Lebanon's rejection of settling any Palestinian on its land," pointing out that "many solutions to the Palestinian cause can be adopted, the most significant of which is the implementation of international resolutions issued in this respect."
Earlier, the President of the Republic received at 10:30 a.m., the Speaker of the House of Deputies, Nabeeh Berri, with whom he reviewed the recent developments.
Berri also raised the causes of restricting the question of surpluses in the ministries and official administrations to the Ministry of Information, especially that there are ministries, administrations and municipalities that complain of shortages in their staffs, but say that can benefit from this surplus in the ministries and public administrations.
He pointed out that "President Lahoud's position on the resistance has provided an unconditional national consensus, especially in regards to adhering to, and legitimacy of the approach of resistance, on the one hand, and condemning terrorism on the other hand."
Management Discusses Opening Branches of the Casino - Dhaher: The Company Has the Last Word
But during the discussion with the Banque du Liban, whose representative was present, and with the Ministry of Finance, and after an in-depth reading of this subject, it became evident that the Council of Ministers may decide to approve the opening of branches and, consequently, the Company, if it wants, may decide whether to open this branch or not.
In answer to a question, he said: "We will meet with those concerned and after that, the Committee may decide or not decide. But what I have indicated, is the lack of clarity in the text referred by the Government.
- There is independence in the committees. Each committee has its own contentions and the questions will be posed to those concerned and in the light of the answers, the Administration and Justice Committee will decide.
And said in an interview with the Central News Agency.
Abi Nasr warned that opening branches will destroy the Casino "which has given the State a financial revenue of up to 80 billion Lebanese pounds."
He added: "There maybe a project for privatizing the Casino and the branches will not add to the value of the privatization. On the contrary, chaos will prevail and the economic feasibility will be diminished in view of several considerations, like the intervention of the local authorities, favoritism and the lack of financial control."
"The party that identifies itself by ages enters old age, but the party that sets its age with the years of struggle will certainly gain an historical attribute, and will probably be victorious, even if it comes after pain, martyrdom and bitterness, and the exorbitance of despising the boldness to confront.
Seventy years against the Zionist colonialist cancer, and still is.
Lebanese - Palestinian Meeting in Support of Intifada Al Hoss: Who Holds America Accountable for Injustice? Al Hoss, the Closing Statement
He added: "Hizbullah is no longer a political party; it is a choice we are committed to and for that, all those who offered martyrs are sacred and we are honored to be related to them. We accuse the United States of America and the Zionist entity of terrorism."
It is natural that procedures for implementing of the decision should come from the resolution's source, the United Nations.
It hurts us to say that in the jungle of the new world order, the principle of might is right prevails, and there is no room for the principle of right is might, to which the weaker and smaller countries and peoples cling (...)."
In case America is alone in imposing sanctions on Lebanon, Lebanon has the right to go to the Security Council."
They indicated "the necessity that the Authority lifts its control of the Intifada and releases those imprisoned in its prisons (...)"
Lebanese officials did not underestimate the third American list, which categorized "Hizbullah" as a terrorist organization and asked Lebanese authorities to freeze its financial accounts.
On his part Schroeder declared Germany's support of the efforts aimed at reaching the partnership agreement between Lebanon and the European Union, setting an initial date for that next week.
The Director of Guidance Department at the Army Headquarters Colonel Elias Farhat, also attended representing the Army Chief of Staff, in addition to Arab and foreign ambassadors, and military, diplomatic and media personalities.
Political groups suggest conducting a judicial appointment movement before the issuance of the verdict in the Al Dhaniyyeh incidents.
They were of the opinion that the evidence was revealed as a result of the contacts that started with Washington to stop the pressure it is practicing on Lebanon and Syria because of  "Hizbullah" and harboring Palestinian organizations in Syria, which it explained to the American side that the Palestinian offices in Damascus are for media and political promotion only.
They pointed out that the problem lies in that any American decision to be taken has several parties involved and stems from various preferences and approaches that leave a place for accepting pressures and taking interests into consideration.
The sources indicated their reassurance due to the French President Jacques Chirac's support of the Lebanese position, which considered the Security Council the only party that has the authority to categorize any party or organization.
Calling for Assimilating Surplus Employees in Administrations Berri: The Interior Must Be Fortified to Confront Challenges Hammoud Reiterated Adherence to Fixed Policies and Meets Vidovin, Moratinos and Sabri
Berri also focused on the importance of executing the real estate survey in Lebanon because that forms a basic buttress for investment, pointing out that more than half the area of Lebanon is un-surveyed.
He also sent a cable offering his condolences over the airplane victims to the Speaker of the American House of Representatives Dennis Hastert.
He focused on the European-Russian contacts, which revolve about the Palestinian cause.
Commandment for the Age
The fall of the Taliban with this fragility can only be justified by the fall of its enemies in 1996 with the same fragility, as if the one that owns tanks wins the war.
Any regime, no matter how hardened it becomes, would be worth living, even if nothing but music were left for him.
Why should the implementation of the Islamic regime be backward in Afghanistan and open and developed in Iran, where institutions work with relative democracy so that the people elect to office their representatives?
Joseph Basil.
The Party's Council of Commissioners held its periodic meeting under the chairmanship of the deputy leader of the Party, Dureid Yaghi, and issued the following statement:
Regional and international organizations, which still continue to issue reports and bulletins about democracy and human rights, are now called upon to interfere to stand firmly on the side of the right of Azmi Bishara and what he represents in confronting the democracy of racial discrimination and racial exclusion. Or to put it more exactly, the responsibility of the League of Arab States comes in the first place as Azmi Bishara is a Palestinian Arab citizen who defends resolutely and courageously what those Arab values really and actually represent.
The Chief of Protocol at the Presidential Palace, Ambassador Maroun Haimari, issued a memorandum providing for commissioning a number of ministers to represent President Lahoud in laying the wreaths on 21st November as follows:

* Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Michel Faroun lays a wreath at the tomb of the late Salim Tekla at Zouk Mkayel, at eleven o'clock before noon.
As for Thursday, 22nd of  November, Minister of National Defense Khalil Hrawi lays a wreath in front of Grand Prince Fakhr Eddine Al-Mu'anna at the entrance of the Ministry of Defense at half past twelve noontime.
The "Loyalty to the Resistance" block said it considered the "American request to freeze the balances of "Hizbullah" as "a Zionist-flavored decision aiming at blackmailing Lebanon in one of the most important element of its strength."
At the time when the Block condemned this terrorist measure against the Lebanese people and the Lebanese State, which have strongly refused it, it denounced the way of informing the Lebanese authorities of this measure because of its disregard of the fundamentals of dealing with states.
It dealt with the demands movements stressing its stand in principle by the side of every rightful demand and called for the "necessity of constructive handling in order to be just and to avoid any tremors it does not need."
While witnesses affirmed that, a security source denied the news and stressed that the army was conducting exercises with anti-aircraft guns in the region.
He expressed his great concern about "these recurrent violations, which could threaten to aggravate the originally-tense situation."
Tanks stationed at the post had participated in bombarding Tlal Arqoub and the surroundings of the town of Kufr Shuba during the last operation, which the: "Islamic Resistance" implemented last month.
The most Erudite Sayyed Muhammad Hassan Fadlallah sees that "The American Administration will not exert any weak to lift out Lebanon from its economic crisis, because the question for her is the need of Israel for security inside occupied Palestine and along the Lebanese front. It tries to exploit what happened on September 11 to activate new tracks of pressures in all the directions, especially in the Arab and Islamic countries, and to create the atmosphere for political climates in the region that will pave the way for the post-war stage in Afghanistan.
He concluded that "America does not possess the absolute power in the region and it is difficult that it secures a world mandate in any economic or political war that targets the Lebanese entity in a comprehensive manner, where Lebanon still enjoys international affection from more than one axis.  But, the matter is not in what others plan for it, but in what the Lebanese should all do for it at the level of internal unity to confront the dangers surrounding their country economically, politically and security-wise."
Then the General Coordinator of the "Beirut Development Conference", Deputy Muhammad Qabbani, delivered a speech in which he said: "Your conference is one of the conferences of the Capital, which are being organized by the Beirut Development Conference, because the big role we want for the Capital is a big role we want for Lebanon and for all Lebanese.
If it was inevitable to terminate the current format, which results in duplication between the governorate and the elected municipal council and negative reflection on municipal development in Beirut, then this format, which was imposed by President Riad Al-Sulh to prevent the domination of one person over the capital, which means the entire country, must be replaced by a format that guarantees the transfer of executive authority to the municipal council on one hand and also guarantees the respect of the specificity of Beirut in terms of balances on the other hand, as it is not the suitable time for entering into mazes. The unity of the sons of Beirut remains the basis for fortifying Beiruti and national stability.
He added: "We, the dignitaries of Beirut, will be committed to crystallizing the law in a reconciliatory atmosphere inside the house of deputies, because the unity of the sons of Beirut remains the basis for us.

So, will we continue to see the high clouds gather without raining until the 23rd of the current month?
Yesterday the Guidance Directorate of the Army Command issued the following statement: "On the occasion of the beginning of the blessed month of Ramadan, blank artillery shots will be fired on the night on which the first day of the month is announced, and daily at the times for the suhur (after which abstinence begins) and maghreb (breaking the fast).  They will likewise be fired at the times for some of the ritual prayers during the period of the happy 'Id al-Fitr, which is to take place in areas of Beirut, the north and the south."
The "document and constitution consultation" held its periodic meeting attended by President Rashid al-Sulh, former ministers and parliamentarians Nasri al-Ma'luf, Mahmud 'Ammar, August Bachous, Rafiq Shahin, Michel Ma'luli, Anwar al-Sabah, Pierre Dakkash, Tariq Habashi and Edmond Rizq.
The consultation scheduled its next meeting for Wednesday November 28th, with the agreement that the sub-committees would continue their work in their respective domains.
Parliamentarian Walid 'Ido called for the adoption of a sound administrative, scientific and development-related perspective when discussing the draft municipalities law, since this will enable us to engage in an objective reading of the considerations upon which the draft law is based and its effects on Lebanon in general and Beirut in particular."
At the same time, we see the abolition of advance accounting surveillance of the municipalities' work as a step in the right direction that is in keeping with the overall trend toward modifying the public accounting law in the direction of abolishing advance surveillance, and the complications that it creates.
Three new members will be elected to the union council, and two to the disciplinary council.
He added: "I repeat what I have stated on previous occasions, that the return programs and the executive plans relating thereto will not be influenced by any events or hindrances.  The clearest evidence of this is the reconciliation gathering today, for which we (Shadi Mas'ad and I) obtained a blessing yesterday from His Excellency the President of the Republic and His Excellency the Prime Minister.  This, of course, is due to the concern which we feel about this matter, beginning with His Excellency President General Emile Lahoud, Prime Minister al-Hariri, Walid Bek and the members of parliament and all organizations, to facilitate steps and to close this file in its entirety in the shortest time possible.  This is what we are seeking to do in the Ministry and the Fund with doubled, consuming efforts, and with coordination with Shadi Mas'ad without neglect, and without preferring one region over another.  Our task, which is to eliminate the marks of war and to obliterate its effects on both the people and the land, is arduous, but sacred, and we believe in it.  At the same time, we   realize that the difficult financial situation through which the treasury is passing, and which may have some influence on our programs, will never stop us, especially with regard to the priorities of this cause, foremost among which is to conclude and implement the peace treaties.
He also said, "We still have five files, the first of which is al-Ghaboon, with which we are bringing the peace treaties to a final conclusion on Lebanese territory.
He said to the returnees, "Let it be a genuine reconciliation with its people and its land to the sound of your footsteps and the strokes of your pickaxes."
League member Joseph al-Gharib spoke, emphasizing the importance of continuing communication among the residents of the area.
From the Israeli press:  Is Arafat still a fundamental participant in the dialogue, or is it time to look for a replacement?
Consequently, Israel must be very cautious about the notion of ousting Arafat from the political arena.
Former Minister of Foreign Affairs Shlomo Bin Ami believes that there is no hope of arriving at peace with the Palestinians so long as Arafat occupies the presidency. Minister of Defense Binyamin Bin Eliezer states with regard to the peace process that Arafat has, in fact, concluded his historical role, and that if it were up to Sharon, he would issue orders for him to be expelled from the arena.
After presenting Arafat's role in escalating the Palestinian position against Israel, the writer states, "Nevertheless, military intelligence claims that Arafat is the person who is capable of changing the direction.
After Arafat, will the situation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict be worse?

A statement by the Arab League said: "Amro Musa received a telephone call from Koffi Anan and overviewed with him the developments of the explosive situation in the occupied territories. They agreed on the danger of the explosive situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and the importance of immediate effective handling of this explosive situation."
He warned in a statement of the contradiction in the Israeli position "which reveals malignant intentions aimed at avoiding the return to the negotiations table to implement the international legitimate requirements, implement their decisions, and enabling the Palestinian people to determine their future in an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital."
It said that "the Syrian response was based on the principles of the United Nations and respecting national sovereignty.
* In Ankara, the spokesperson for the Turkish President said: "To us Arafat is still president of the Palestinians," and hoped for "putting an end to the use of power." He also called for "taking a route that will guarantee the return of dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians," even if he believes that "the route towards the establishment of a Palestinian state seems blocked because of the Israeli military operations.

The demonstrators marched in the streets shouting: "Down with the United States, Israel's first partner", "Down with Israel the symbol of terrorism", and "The Intifada will be victorious over the Zionist regime." They also burned American and Israeli flags.
This kind of event is not unlikely."
* In Beirut, the "Democratic Front for the Liberalization of Palestinian" issued a statement on the occasion of "Jerusalem Day" in which it called on Arab and Muslim peoples to protect "the city of Jerusalem from the dangers of settlement and Judaization" that it is being subjected to at the hands of occupation troops and settler militias.
Afghan fighters opposed to the "Taliban" Movement, supported by American Special forces and air strikes, closed the noose more and more on the fundamentalist "Al Qaeda" Network, led by Osama bin Laden, fortified in the Tora Bora mountainous area near Jalalabad.

Yesterday, American President George Bush described the latest video by the leader of the "Al Qaeda" network Osama bin Laden, distributed by the US Defense Department, the "Pentagon", and aired by television networks worldwide the day before yesterday, as a terrorist's admission of guilt.
In the United States, New York Mayor Rudolf Guiliani said that the tape clarifies that the military campaign waged by the United States has what justifies it.
On the streets of America, there was a tendency to believe that the tape is evidence of conviction. One said: "When you hear with your own ears and see with your own eyes, it becomes different, and makes us more trusting of what our government is doing."
The closing statement of the Islamic-American Relations Council said the contents of this videotape "must put an end to all the doubts of every person that was not convinced of Osama Bin Laden's involvement in the September 11th events.
The British "Daily Telegraph" Newspaper published that the tape "constitutes the most prominent evidence" of Bin Laden's involvement, who the French "Liberation" Newspaper said is "the man actually involved in the killing of thousands of people."
The spokesperson for the Pakistani government stated that Bin Laden's comments justify Islamabad's supporting position of the American military strikes in Afghanistan.
These are not the words of normal person (...) Our prophet says that accusing some with infidelity equals killing him (...) Describing someone as an infidel is a big sin that is equal to killing that person."
In Afghanistan, where owning a television set was considered a crime during the "Taliban" era, some Afghanis were able to watch the tape, but none of them were surprised with its content.
In Qatar, the "Al-Sharq" Newspaper was the only one to comment on it.
"Marines" Deploy in Qandahar Airport Two US Soldiers Wounded in Battle at Tora Bora Washington Still Uncertain About Bin Laden's Whereabouts
One of the field commanders directing the attack on "Al Qaeda", Haji Hadrat Ali, spoke of his fighters' control of a cave where Bin Laden may have been a short while ago.
And the bombs cannot reach it."
He pointed out that journalists were unable to identify the injured Americans because they were wearing Afghani clothes and had grown out their beards.
The American CNN television network quoted American military officials as saying that Bin Laden is located as it seems inside a complex of caves surrounded by forces opposed to the "Taliban."
In answer to a question, she replied that she was not aware that the American administration obtained samples of Ben Laden's de-oxygenated ribo-nucleic acid in order to identify his body if he was killed, as previously reported by the American CNN television network.
Mulla Omar disappeared on the eve of Qandahar's surrender ten days ago, and American forces have not been able to find any trace of him so far.

No group claimed its responsibility for the attack, which caused tension in the relationship between India and its neighbor Pakistan.
Parliament Speaker G. M. C., Balayogi, said in a short speech: "This attack is not only aimed at the parliament, but is aimed at freedom in the country as well."
He said "in view of these circumstances, we asked Pakistan, before anything, to put an end to the activities of Asaker Attaybeh and Mohammed's Army, arrest their leaders, and freeze their accounts."
When Singh was asked about this earlier, he answered "no country reveals the mechanism that it uses to gather information (...) we consulted with the United States and other countries with regard to the information we obtained."
Their spokesperson said that India must use an "extensive and active search policy" in Kashmir, in direct reference to direct raids that go beyond the disputed borders with Pakistan.
It seems that currently the Americans are more prepared to make sacrifices for the sake of their country's national security. National zeal pushes them to buy more American-made products, while they have ceased from mocking President George Bush, went back to smoking, and became more skeptical about others.
The manager of the "Rand McNally" store, in the center of Chicago, Linda Fish, noted that "there was something that awakened" the Americans, who doubled their purchases of books, maps and earth models, whose sales rose three-fold last year.
and maybe in the end more tolerant."
In a letter, which lawyer Isabelle Cotain Pierre addressed to him, she said that Moussaoui would not enjoy a fair trial in the United States.

In Portland, in the state of Oregon, police found two guns and ammunition in the car of Lebanese Ali Khalid Steitieh (39 years old), who was arrested Tuesday.
Amid Anti-Globalization Demonstrations and Introducing the "Euro" Into Circulation, European Summit Considers Arafat Sole Negotiator with Israel, Agree to Participate in Peace Keeping Force in Afghanistan Afghanistan - Middle East - Anti-Globalization Protestors - "Euro"
But the main objective of the summit is to issue the "Laeken Declaration," which will contain a common European vision and launch a new reform of the European institutions before the accession of 10 new states to the Union in the year 2004.
He said that "All the states of the Union will participate in it (...) And that is very important."
A European source explained that the force will work under a mandate from the United Nations and will be charged specifically with guaranteeing the security of the new Afghani administration, without interfering between the different Afghani groups.
He said: "We confirm that Palestinian President Arafat, who was elected democratically, and the Palestinian Authority, are the only negotiators in this conflict in front of Israel, which needs a partner (...). And we do not believe that weakening the Palestinian Authority or its President Arafat will help in any way in pushing the peace process." He pointed out that the European Union's High Commissioner for Foreign Policy and Mutual Security, Xavier Solana, would head to Washington soon to present a new initiative with the United States to reduce the violence in the Middle East.
And this is not a new policy.
The spokeswoman for the police, Elis Climpot, said that the situation "is completely under control and we are in the phase of withdrawal." She confirmed the arrest of  several people.
Peaceful organizations, several unions and associations of the unemployed also joined the demonstration.
Millions of metal coins were sold in initial sealed sets or plastic bags so that their ringing could be heard in pockets in a bar in Amsterdam or post offices in Dublin or bought by people as Christmas gifts in French cigarette stores.
Embarrassing Questions Without Answers!
Then comes the answer: This depends on the administrative time limits that define the life span of this tragedy and the date for determining an actual end to it.
The groups which make projects in Lebanon are known. They consist of an influential person and his brokers and of the poor workers who implement orders with minimum wage and are almost chocked by the dust.
National health planning identifies the taboos theoretically, but it has not built the fixed system for monitoring, prohibiting, and even punishment.
The President of the Union of Independent Enterprises and Private and Public Institutions, Bishara Al Asmar, confirmed, in his capacity as president of the syndicate of Beirut Port employees and workers, stressed that "the north eastern suburb of Beirut city has witnessed severe suffering for over 20 years at the environmental level, as symbolized by chronic garbage disposal, which have turned into invincible mountains in the region.
Not to mention the popular markets, the fish market and the tanneries."
On this occasion, we called for an environmental conference, which was accomplished late last month under the patronage of Minister Mousa and attended by representatives from the Ministry of Environment, the Development and Construction Council, Beirut Governorate, the capital's municipality, and Jabal Lebnan governorate.
What is needed is a bold plan that will be represented first and last by the purchase of the deposits station immediately and training the available human elements to operate it."
The root of the problem lies in presses, that amount to 300 presses, throwing approximately 65 thousand tons of olive jift, and 250 thousand square meters of zeibar waters in fields and river courses, causing a repeated environmental and health disaster.
The International Coldage celebrated Arbor Day by distributing in the kindergartens department a tree for every student, to be planted near his home, so that he may learn how to take care of it.

He also called the Environment Public Prosecutor in Jabal, Lebanon and informed him of the content of the complaint and what the Ministry is doing in this regard.
The Ministry of Agriculture implemented a project to plant 3 thousand forest trees in Tarsheesh and the Southern Matn region, in cooperation with the municipality and the Faculty of Education at the Lebanese University.
"Scientific study, with environmental and economic benefits, whose implementation will provide a comprehensive solution for the problem of olive peat and industrial waters, of which Lebanon suffers annually, and will lead to adding its name to the list of countries that present advanced research."
Oweini mentions that the presses used in the past to use a petroleum product called (   ) to produce between 6 to 8 percent of the oil remaining in the peat, but the Ministry of Environment banned its use years ago after it became known that it had negative environmental effects, specifically in polluting the air.
It is based on the process of fermenting, which raises the percentage of protein in it from 11 to 18 percent, at a time when the protein ratio in wheat varies between 18 and 20 percent.
That is aside from the financial advantage, which the owners of the presses will gain from selling olive peat instead of discarding it.
During the fourth year, the study will become ready and can be put to implementation through the construction of small regional factories that transform pet into fodder with the required scientific specifications."
Pollution and the Responsible Party, Sin and Punishment
For that is when responsibilities accumulate, even if they are false, behind the walls of the repressed silence, the repressed silence, until it explodes.
The spread of the smoke of diesel oil in the air of Lebanon is the same as cutting down trees, for both tear Lebanon apart and pollute its tourist reputation.
You were trustworthy with little, and so I will entrust you with much.
Enter Lebanon's merriment."
>From the war on terrorism to withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missiles Treaty "ABM", President George Bush is shaping the world as viewed by the United States.
With the United States' projection of Iraq, North Korea and Iraq as "renegade states" seeking to develop programs of long range missiles and to acquire weapons of mass destruction, the treaty, from the American point of view, became a restriction that prevents Washington from developing defense capabilities to confront what Bush considers new dangers facing America in the post-cold-war era.
The American campaign on terrorism proved that it has supporters among almost all countries.
>From here, Bush's excuse in desiring to dispose of the effects of the cold war does not seem plausible, which comes as part of his explanation of the reasons that lead him to withdraw from the "ABM" Treaty before finding an alternative that reassures both the allies and adversaries of yesterday.
And if Moscow after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and its economic collapse remained a hard number in the arena of international balance, that is due to its ownership of a nuclear arsenal that, if it is not superior to the American arsenal, it is not much less than it.
And it realizes the true magnitude of the abilities of these countries.
Before these attacks, Bush's policies were the most criticized in the world, even on the internal American level.
And it is the same war that lets Ariel Sharon eradicate the Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, amid Arab and international silence that parallels the silence that meets Bush when he makes decisions that undermine the strategic security of the entire world.
But those who dream and yearn were in reality denied the opportunity to realize the American gain based on thinking well of "Taliban" and Al Qaeda, and the objective miscalculation of America's ability in colonialist creativity and destructive creativeness...
It seems that the President wanted to generalize this impression, the evidence being his allowing this exhibition, with later plans to print pictures of these paintings in a calendar for the year 2002.
that modern life and its requirements imposed the existence of group participation, which has come to be known today as the concept of political parties.
More precisely, we will study the opinions of David Apter, Claus Van Beimen, and Samuel Huntington, and how much they are compatible with the Lebanese reality with regard to the presence of political parties and their role in political life.
Modern life and its requirements imposed the existence of group participation, which have come to be known today as the concept of political parties.
More precisely, we will study the opinions of David Apter, Claus Van Beimen, and Samuel Huntington, and the extent to which they are in harmony with the Lebanese reality with regard to the presence of political parties and their role in political life.
The parties, Apter continues, push the people to join their political stream, not just through the attractiveness of their ideology, but also through incentives they provide when they are in power, like employment in the various positions.
2. The historical "crisis" status theory: It works with the creation of a new state or with constitutional changes.
As for Huntington, he believes that political parties appear as a result of modern life and its complex circumstances.
This reading into the contribution of parties in the political process is not necessarily suitable for developing countries.
Even the elections that took place in the years 1992, 1996 and 2000, which sent the largest number of party elements to parliament, are not the result of a healthy state in the Lebanese political system.
The problem here is that the equation imposes a pattern of relation between the citizen and the State that does not evolve except through linkage to the religious sect.
At the legal level, the establishment of parties in Lebanon is based on a law issued in the year 1909, and is the same law that allows the establishment of associations.
If we are optimistic about the possibility of the creation of political parties on strong national bases that are open to all citizens, there remains ahead of us the most important question, which is: Will the Lebanese legislature (parliament) allow the existence of a party law that affects the interests of the existing groups?
Yesterday, the Beirut Stock Exchange issued a circular related to the decisions of the Extraordinary General Assembly of the company, whose agenda included reading the Board of Directors' report, endorsing it and changing the name of the company.
Here, a large number of shareholders proposed omitting this reading after the comments which the Chairman gave on the matter.
Then Mr. Janho asked whether any dues needed to be paid to change the name.
He told the "Central News Agency": "It is rumored that the "mechanism" of appointments stipulated the need for justifying the replacement of one person with another and that did not happen.
He asked about the reason for "replacing general directors before their terms ended, which caused them a shock."
He pointed out "the new appointments did not create 'joy' and did not have the expected effect.
If that is done, the effect will be positive".
We hope to achieve success, but in action, not words."
Sabra announced that "Promo-Liban Company will organize the festival and that the meeting aims at coordinating with the hotel and restaurant syndicates to make it a success and at cooperating within a studied and comprehensive plan." He quoted Minister Fleihan as saying that "cooperation between the public and private sectors is aimed at restoring Lebanon to its former role in the region."
The President of the Hammoud Traders Association, Paul Iyanian, renewed  in letters he addressed yesterday to President of the Republic Emil Lahoud, Speaker of the House of Deputies Nabih Berri, Prime Minister Rafiq Al Hariri, Minister of Finance Fouad Siniora, Minister of Tourism Karam Karam, Minister of Economy and Trade Basil Fleihan and Minister of Information Ghazi Aridi  his demand regarding "the necessity of postponing the implementation of the value added tax in view of the difficult economic and living circumstances."
This exhausts the State's treasury and the private sector."
Outside, the dollar continued to decline compared with other major currencies, except the yen, continuously negatively affected by the manifestations of economic weakness in the United States despite decreasing interest rates for the twelfth time this year from 6.5% at the beginning of the year to 1.75% last Tuesday, without resulting in its leaving the economic recession cycle.
- 0.9040 for the Euro to 0.8935 day before yesterday in New York.
- 1.6305 Swiss francs to 1.6515.
The prices of silver also rose, the ounce closed in London at 4.38 dollars compared with 4.2650 dollars day before yesterday in New York, after it stabilized at 4.32 dollars at noon.
Previously, in the morning, the Tokyo bourse transformed to a rise after profits in the car sector exceeded losses in the banking sector, supported by the weakness of the yen, which encouraged the purchasing of stock in Japanese photographic companies. As a result, the Nikkei index closed with an increase of 78.20 points over 10,511.65 points.
He said "the elections took place at the height of confrontations faced by the Labor Federation against the Government's unjust policies vis-à-vis the workers' causes, as if it sits in the same ditch with the employers and abides by their directives."
Once again, by uniting behind our demands, much of our objectives will be realized and by our unification, our movement on earth will be enhanced and strengthened."
It has been known that, since its launch, the Presidential position has led to moving the ambiguity surrounding this establishment by initiating an audit of its accounts and other subsequent measures.
Among the indicators that may be considered:
- Preparing a draft law that stipulates exempting establishments from due and undue subscriptions.
Hospitality and Food Exhibition "Horeca 2002" between 9 and 12 April
In this context, the director of the organizing company, Jumana Damous Salameh explained, "The exhibitors used to go to the exhibition either to attend specific meetings or to get specific products.
As regards the International Food Exhibition, it will focus more on food and beverage exhibits pertaining to the hotel industry, which include the different hotel foods, fresh and frozen foods, dairy products, fruits and vegetables, juices, drinks and food packaging.
A series of seminars on vital subjects is being prepared.
He hinted that "this tax has the capability for self-monitoring and, consequently, it prevents income tax evasion."
Before looking into the effect of the tax in itself on the market, we must not forget to work on improving the general budget and finding solutions to the permanent deficit in the treasury."
He said, "Twenty-one percent of the national product is the size of the annual deficit in the budget and no country in the world can continue to tolerate this deficit in the long run.
The Lebanese Maritime Transport Association appealed to the Minister of Public Works and Transport Najeeb Meeqati to float two tenders: one for the purchase of the equipment for the containers' station at Beirut Port, and the other for operating the station at the earliest possible opportunity.
It considered that this exemption should be similar to dockage fees, in conformity with the Government's policy, and by virtue of the Prime Minister's regulations regarding the provision of the best services through Beirut Port to cruise ships.
It stressed the necessity of forming a committee to assess the compensation due to unloading contractors and owners of the machinery "so that the error that happened previously with the Dubai Ports Authorities does not recur."
The volume of revenues also decreased to more than 250 billion liras, and the percentage of deficit in the same budget recorded a reduction that amounted to 21 points as well.
It must be pointed out here that of the total revenues of the real budget as of the end of November, the collected customs revenues in the first eleven months of this year totaled approximately 1458 billion, compared with 1643 billion for the same period last year, a decrease of 185 billion, which means on one hand that the decrease in customs revenues is much less than what was expected when the customs tariffs were reduced, and confirms on other hand a marked improvement in the volume of external trade, as an increase of 23% in the movement of exports was achieved, as well as an increase of 14% in the volume of imports during the first eleven months of this year compared to what it was in the same period last year.
"Hizbollah" Lebanon and Lebanon the State
Yesterday, "Hizbollah" Lebanon was in the "quasi military" show in form, and in the military show in content and soul more present, even more permeating in greater Beirut more than Lebanon the state, and the independence day show barely exceeded the limits of a military barracks outside the capitol.
They are legitimate questions, regardless of our initial supportive position of "Hizbollah" and its initial position towards the Palestinian cause and of its loud voice amid this Arab vacuum and panic.
We say this based on our support of "Hizbollah" and our exalting of its role, and for the blood it spilled to liberate southern Lebanon.
First is that we will be alone in the arena, and second we will pay the price alone, and third because sooner or later we will divide amongst ourselves over "Hizbollah" Lebanon.
By Rozanna Bou Munsif:
There are no concessions on what was repeated by American officials on various levels repeatedly from President George Bush to his Secretary of State Colin Powell and his national security advisor Condoleezza Rice and then Ambassador Patel in Beirut regarding foreign reinforcements for "Hizbollah", in view of clear and strong evidence the Americans say and confirm is available to them.  Their positions arise originally from the presence of this evidence they likely presented to Syrian and Lebanese officials.
Diplomacy performed by Burns is supposed to be translated in the area of American openness to the countries of the region, in view of the diplomatic and media concern shown by the United States to prove its complete "non aggression" towards the countries of the region parallel to the Afghanistan war (it is noted that large posters were published of pictures of mosques in America), and distributing recordings conducted by "Voice of America" radio station with Islamic personalities, and at the same time obtaining cooperation of these states to fight terrorism.
Perhaps the deterioration of the situation constitutes an additional reason for reminding all parties of the political goals that lie behind this conflict.
As the American administration continues to cooperate with Arafat, it sees the priority in the movement of Palestinians against violence because it affects them negatively in the first place, as it reflects on the possibility of going back to peace negotiations.
Between the latest video for Osama bin Laden and the television series "Hajj Mitwalli Family", there is a common denominator that embodies the continuance of the most dangerous disease in our Arab societies: the lack of reason.
Then he tells about three people who saw in their dreams the plane crash into the New York tower before the operation.
A horrible thing, but what is worse than a culture of invisibles controlling decisions, is their rooting in the society and even its continued promotion with the more popular and widespread methods instead of fighting it.
And without thinking of the situation they have already accepted for themselves, they cannot find a way to make their decisions except by resorting to fortune-tellers or augury.
Washington - Riyadh and Washington - Tehran
Many wondered about the future of Saudi-American relations.
The information coming from Washington through informed Western diplomatic sources indicates the presence of some flaw or rather the rise of some flaw in the relations between the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, since fundamental Islamists targeted American nationals in the latter.
It also reached more accurate information that indicates that some in the royal family are involved in donations to bin Laden without being aware of the reality of his goals.
This includes Washington's need for Riyadh and its role in the region, especially in view of the negative development of the situation in the Palestinian territories.
But they point out the presence of several unresolved large issues between them, which are supposed to make the normalization of American-Iranian relations slower or late, such as the negative Iranian position on the peace process and Iran's attempt to obtain weapons of mass destruction and the like.
But it is also true that they have been stopped since that date, which may negate any connection of Tehran to relations between bin Laden and the Taliban, and what they have committed.
But are the Lebanese obsessions to be cursed?

Diplomatic sources in Washington reported that he sent American President George Bush an invitation to hold a summit between them in Russia from May 23 to 25.
He noted that "such unity led to a successful war against international terrorism in Afghanistan."
After the meeting, Ivanov stated that Russia is aiming at "a real, fundamental and transparent reduction in strategic weapons open to monitoring."
Kasyanov stated that one of his tasks was to agree on the lifting of current restrictions on trade between Russia and the United States and coordinating the lifting of restrictions on supplying Russia with advanced technology, especially cutting-edge computer equipment.
He said that weapons were usually discovered during criminal investigations.
Khamenei describes Bush as "bloodthirsty" and Europe to continue dealing with Iran
He added: "Iran is proud to be on the receiving end of the anger of the greatest and most hated satanic power in the world."
We Iranians are the victims of terrorism and do not accept American accusations."
In New Delhi, the Indian Foreign Ministry rejected Bush's statements on Iran.

I think targeting Iraq will greatly destabilize the whole region."
In Moscow, the official Russian agency Itar-Tass reported that Azziz cut short his trip to Moscow and cancelled several further meetings he had intended to hold with Russian officials in order to attend meetings of the Iraqi leadership in Baghdad.
Russian-American discussions on "intelligent sanctions" on Iraq are expected to be held in Geneva on February 6-8.
Other officials said the two parties had not yet resolved auditing problems but would continue working on the matter even if funding was reinstated.
The inspections carried out by the Agency, which is based in Vienna, are aimed at uncovering any attempt to use nuclear materials for military programs.
The American administration is preparing itself for a legal confrontation with Congress which is attempting to uncover the circumstances of the financial scandal involving the energy company Enron which was declared bankrupt last December 2.
A White House spokesman said "the president intends to stand by principles and will defend his rights and the rights of future presidents to obtain advice without having to turn it into a press statement later on."
Michigan's Democrat representative John Dingle said: "I support the Office in its defense of the right of Congress and the people to know who contributed to the administration's oil policy."
In the second day of his appointment as the new chief executive of Enron's board of directors, Steven Cooper said he would not waste time on investigations into the company's bankruptcy because what was important was its future not its past and that he intends to move on with "lightning speed" to re-organize what was left of the company which was until yesterday one of the seven top companies in the United States.

He criticized Israel's demand for Syrian support for Hizbollah to end, saying that "it is not acceptable for resistance to be called off while the occupation continues."
He stressed the need for a just and comprehensive peace based on the Madrid agreement and the principle of land for peace and total withdrawal to the June 4, 1967 line "because without this, there will be no resumption of negotiations whatsoever."
He referred to Israeli demands for Syria to stop supporting Hizbollah and saw this as an "indication of the lack of seriousness" of the Jewish state because "to Syria and the Arabs, Hizbollah is a legitimate resistance movement against Israeli occupation [...] if Israel wants real peace, it would have made attempts to resume the negotiations where they left off."
American Secretary of State Colin Powell announced yesterday the United States' refusal to comply with the demands of American journalist Daniel Pearl's kidnappers in Pakistan, who extended the deadline they set to kill him on Wednesday by 24 hours, and warned that they would declare "a real war against the Americans."
The American State Department told its nationals in Pakistan to take precautions.
The cycle will carry on and no American journalist will be able to enter Pakistan [...] the Americans will get what they deserve."
It added that it would send food aid to Pearl's family "as America did [...] we hope his family is grateful just as the Americans expected the Afghans to be grateful for the food dropped over their heads."
Indian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Neropama Rau described Pakistani accusations of her country's involvement in Pearl's kidnapping as "silly" and "a further example of Pakistani military spokesman's General Rashid Karshai's excessive imagination" who had declared "there is an Indian link in this matter.
Only coincidence would have it that the American president gave his State of the Union address to Congress, and through it raised to a crescendo the tone of accusation against Hizbollah listing it in the terrorist "axis of evil," at the same time as the Lebanese assembly was dissecting the state of the Lebanese nation which is drowning under increasing crises.
Raising the probability, covertly or overtly, of changing the government, whether denied, confirmed or postponed, is a reflection of the collective confusion in the search for solutions whereas the various authorities, submerged in their personal battles daily provide further examples of their edgy and unprepared treatment of events. This confirms the lack of any clear decision or the inability to make a decision to confront the state of siege, external and internal, into which they have dropped themselves together with a beleaguered Lebanon hence becoming its hostage.
Between these two factors, another dangerous aspect comes to light in the form of Lebanon being listed as one of America's objectives, albeit through Hizbollah only, in an unbalanced war in which Lebanon has no active choice.
It also means a government change, whether this happens or not, an internal consumer affair which neither advances or hinders finding a solution to the economic crisis nor protects Lebanon from the war on terrorism.
All this anger could not hide the jovial look always present on George Bush's face.
For it was as though we were sitting in front of a television screen listening with awe to the "sole leader" of the new world, and as though Congress, enraptured and applauding, were the universal revolutionary council supporting its leader and practically chanting "with our blood, with our souls we sacrifice ourselves for you Bush"!
We can not know where this zeal will lead to; and it is not limited to Bush's speech or Congress's applause, bewitched by words of power, because it extends to American public opinion whose overwhelming support for its president has reached 83% which means it will give its outright support to the arrogance of power.
From the Israeli press  Sharon concedes need for Palestinian State British magazine: Israel prime suspect in Habiqa's assassination
However, he expressed his regret that Arafat was not assassinated during the war in Lebanon. A decision was made not to eliminate him at the time.
The magazine said the expert manner in which the assassination was carried out points to a professional intelligence service being the executing party.
In a gesture of solidarity with American President George Bush's speech, Hertz said Sharon held a special session to discuss Israel's policy toward Iranian threats.

It also means that they had better not export terror to America and her friends and allies; otherwise, we will come down on them with the laws of this country."
He declared "the world needs to be with us [...] because such weapons could be directed against us or them and we can not allow terrorism to blackmail the United States or any other freedom-loving country."
To this end, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told the National Defense Institute in Washington that the United States must be prepared for further terrorist attacks that would be bloodier than the September 11 attacks.
He added: "We know Iran is implicated in sending terrorists to Damascus then onto the Bakaa Valley where they train in camps and from where these terrorists launch operations against countries in the region and elsewhere."
American television network CNN reported that the attack was meant to take place last week on a nuclear installation in the state of Virginia, using a passenger plane and that it was to be carried out by non-Arabs recruited at camps run by the fundamentalist al-Qaida organization led by Osama Bin Laden.
Conference of the 32nd World Economic Forum discusses vision for a shared future
This year, the Forum moved from the resort of Davos in Switzerland to New York for the first time since its creation.
Arab personalities also responded to the  World Economic Forum's invitation, at the top of them Jordanian monarch King Abdullah II Ben al-Hussein and Queen Rania, Qatar's Prince Hamed Ben Khalifa Al Thani, Bahrain's Heir to the Throne Sheikh Salman Ben Hamed Al Khalifa, Saudi Arabia's head of general intelligence Prince Nawaf Ben Abdulazziz, Jordan's Prime Minister Ali Abu al-Raghib, Lebanese Deputy Prime Minister Issam Faris and a number of other figures from the worlds of economics and business.
An important stop in Arab terms is the seminar today on Arab-American relations and the future they point to.
Only the government?
But many witnesses confirmed the fact, although they were unable to explain it.
According to a reliable account (of course), the phenomenon took place when Arab Interior Ministers took part in a closed and unofficial session (forbidding any written reports about it) held on Lebanon's initiative to inform the honored guests of an experiment shown at that time on television screens under the attractive title of "A Discussion of the Budget in the Chamber of Deputies."
What did he say?
Like someone with bullets coming out of his mouth, he fired off words rapidly: "The meaning of the experiment, eh? Ha... ha... ha..."
So in addition to relaxing its Arab guests, they who only laugh in closed and unofficial sessions, the host country wanted the concurrence of the meeting of Arab Interior Ministers with the budget discussion session to be an occasion for marketing a new Lebanese invention called "television democracy."
But it would appear that the Lebanese delegation did not have the opportunity to present all its marketing arguments and this is something the informed source regretted.
The source went quiet, then mumbled: "only the government... only the government...only... ha... ha... ha..."
Many interpreted this prior session and its decisions aimed at citizens in order to lessen the burden of the new tax affecting them as also being a political message saying that the time for a government change is not here yet, especially after the president of the republic Emile Lahud clearly hinted two days ago to the ruling out of any change prior to the Arab Summit.
Ministerial sources saw the aim of this reduction as also preventing smuggling on the one hand and protecting local industry on the other.
After the session, President Lahud signed the official documents for application of the law on value added tax.
Muawadh said "the security services even allow themselves to classify the representatives," pointing out that a very, very important and high-ranking officer allowed himself to classify our colleague Boutrus Harb."
The elected Phalange leadership is to hold a closed planning meeting at ten in the morning tomorrow at Central House in al-Saifi, the second closed meeting following the political closed meeting held last December 19.
The opening ceremony was attended by delegates from the Free Nationalist Party, the Lebanese Forces and the Free National Movement as well as by a delegation of Canadian Phalangists.
The head of the Detroit branch, Shawki Jamil, made a speech welcoming the Phalange addressees and presented reports received from Lebanon.
While the meeting's work proceeds tomorrow, it is expected that President Amin al-Jamil will address the audience with a voice message in which he discusses the Lebanese and party situations.
A first reading by responsible sources of American President George W. Bush's State of the Union address to Congress identified a dangerous speech "that can be regarded as a warning to some governments lacking in courage toward terrorism" in his reference to terrorist training camps in 12 countries run by groups such as Hamas, Hizbollah, Islamic Jihad and Mohamed's Army set up in remote woods and deserts and hiding in large urban centers.
and that party activists carry out operations against Israeli military sites in the occupied Shaba' farms.
They confirmed that Lebanon would not step down from its position of resisting occupation in the farms and that it is not afraid of the speech, which a number of officials took to be a serious warning with regard to Hizbollah, since there has been much criticism in recent months and this has not changed the Lebanese position.
It would also be hard to convince him to reconsider his position as this would require a capable and influential quarter not available among officials at present.
They once again confirmed that Lebanon would not change its position in spite of increasing intimidation of the party and that it adheres to the need to distinguish between resistance and terrorism.
President Emile Lahud reviewed internal and regional developments with the leader of the chamber of representatives Eli al-Farzali at Babada Castle.

It was natural that we should share the questions of Dutch tourist Steven (who plays the clarinet): "Where are your musicians?
He talked with some reticence about the details of his experience: "There we have a working team for each subject.
It is no exaggeration to say that this piece, which none of our television stations have done, including the regrettable Lebanon Television, is a living expression in concrete buildings and their social mores of "where we live" and an extension of "who we are."
But the burning question remains: Where is the individual in our heritage?
Fuad Ubaid, the director general and chairman of the board of directors, says on the subject "we are making a big effort to collect national memory in terms of works of art, daily events, documents, paintings, plans and the like but we do this with some hesitancy as we do not have adequate and suitable buildings.
He explains that "the greater part of our history is outside Lebanon.
This is why Ubaid is inviting Lebanese citizens and their relatives who know of Lebanese icons to provide the Archives Institute with information "in order to preserve the national memory which is a public right."
Ubaid points out that in the past, no newspaper, radio or television archives were protected and that this is also true in terms of government departments.
The Jewish national state, which was in theory simply a humanitarian issue, now appears to be turning into a small Mediterranean force in the heart of the Near East but is in reality a big force.
President Hussein al-Husseini, one of Taif's architects and the head of the "steering committee," was unambiguous in his presentation of the agreement's poor implementation, and the exploitation of its terms and their subservience to the interests of the three wise men who devised the "troika," replacing institutions with themselves. They gave personal, factional, ethnic and religious interests priority over the interests of the country, taking from Taif only its slogans and bypassing the constitution which was not correctly applied. He halted at the disregard for the balanced development which was aimed at alerting the citizen that the country was for everyone and that everyone had a duty to look after it.

This has been the slogan adopted by the Hong Kong Trade Center (semi-governmental organization) since its foundation 35 years ago. The channels it is attempting to open in the Middle East, via Lebanon, appear to be destined for success, especially as Hong Kong expects to be a world trade center.
The possibilities of joint trade cooperation are based on the recorded volume of exchange between the two countries, which peaked in 1998 at 85 million dollars in favor of Hong Kong since imports from Hong Kong amounted to 84 million dollars versus one million worth of exports from Lebanon.
The result was the assurance of definite possibilities for cooperation and concessions to Lebanese traders by Hong Kong, in addition to an invitation for a Lebanese delegation or mission to visit Hong Kong to expand the framework of discussions aimed at initiating close cooperation.
"Lebanon, like Hong Kong, is a bridge to neighboring countries."

Elsewhere, the president of the Bakeries Union, Anis Bashara, announced that there would be no increase in bread prices after value added tax comes into effect. This came as a result of the meeting at the Ministry of Finance yesterday between the Bakeries Union and ministry officials in the course of which the Union received official assurances that value added tax would not affect the cost of producing bread.
Shortly before it came into effect, complaints were received from some applicants who came in large numbers to register.

Then there is Michel Wilbeck who disturbed the literary season with his tale interspersed with not particularly systematic sexual sections but which are nonetheless clear and expressive.
"A new adaptation of 120 Days in Sodom would do it" he says.
An example of this is the Museum of Modern Art in Lyons, which was censured for pornography in December 1999 when it showed a videotape on the theme of "science - fantasy."

The first verse of this poem has a footnote in the margin for another poem which the reader might first take as explanatory notes such as one finds in research or translated books: "The place that is impelled toward emptiness announces the bells of time, time that is impelled toward the clamor of the place, itself impelled toward emptiness where time, empty of place, never stops jostling time toward emptiness."

A Toulouse Lautrec retrospective at the Maillol Museum in Paris (February 8 to May 6) includes thirty-two posters as well as preliminary sketches, starting with the image and ending with the word and engraving.
Lautrec's posters take the varied world of culture from theater, music and literature to the street, night, festivities and occasions.
Lautrec's knowledge of brothels and dance halls opened up many creative opportunities for him, be it murals such as "Dancer and Audience" or the traits of dancers, singers, customers, artists and musicians.
He revealed their radiance in his works and remained enchanted by the world of theater, musicals, circus, dance halls and bars throughout his life.
And while he admired Renoir and Monet, he felt his style to be closer to Manet and Degas.
The court charged Sliman with the premeditated murder of Salim in accordance with Article 549 of the criminal law and ruled that the death penalty sentence should be dropped and the sentence reduced to 12 years' imprisonment with hard labor to include the period during which he was under arrest.
After this ended, he joined the Armed Resistance branch in Beirut until 1980.
During his service, a number of prisoners he was responsible for guarding escaped and he was punished by being put into prison until 1990.
This is how he became a member of a group comprised of thirteen people.
But as the latter tried to flee, the defendant shot at him, hitting at the top of the back.
As he was taking him to hospital, he asked who had shot him and received the answer "Armed Resistance shot me in the heart."

Artist William Hasswani recited a poem where he described Sunaifer's qualities.
The students' union branch of the Free Nationalists Party regretted the dispute in the second branch of the Science Department at the Lebanese University and indirectly supported the position of students affiliated to the "free nationalist movement" because it said in its statement that there was no law preventing any student from voting and that a given law can not be applied in a discretionary manner.

A diploma program in Community Health ( ) for nurses working in primary healthcare centers has also been agreed with the Nursing Sciences Department at Saint Joseph University."
However, two basic factors were the final word in this area: the Minister of Health's total determination that the project would succeed and the Italian government's enthusiasm, starting with the Lebanese University and the further studies diploma through the Jesuit University and its social health studies, taking in private and public hospitals and the opening of further education sections, and ending with the ministry and compulsory union laws and  the technical accreditation campaign."

"No corruption," the Lebanese Society for Increased Transparency, organized a workshop yesterday at the Commodore Hotel on the importance of moral and ethical codes in company practice. It announced a new charter on work ethics and management which covers the aims of the society and its basic values and general principles, and a management charter to regulate members' relations with each other and its implementation through a disciplinary committee set up by the society.
The society's Ghassan Mukhaiber spoke about the position of moral codes in legislation, especially with regard to company law and their fundamental or internal regulations and presented an ethics charter followed by the liberal professions, such as the medical profession and others, and explained that many of the standards followed are not laid out by law and comply with professional codes yet leave the field wide open to discretion.
He considered that it was necessary to develop legal and moral standards within the basic regulations governing companies in order to limit corruption.
The aim is not only to protect oneself but also to encourage other companies to follow the example.
In the framework of looking for funding for our society, we found that we could not cooperate with a company or agency where corruption had taken hold and this is why our condition for collaboration is that the company we want to work with must agree to the charter. In addition, we are looking into preparing an impartiality charter between us and companies and agencies."
In case of doubt, the committee will look into the compliance of one of the signatory parties or members of the ethics charter.

He asked the media taking part today in the first day of the private-government partnership to monitor prices during the month of application of value added tax.
Al-Hariri knows why "Paris-2" has not been held yet and must be aware that the French president is powerless to persuade his European partners to save Lebanon from its crisis as long as the American administration imposes impossible conditions on Lebanon helping itself and as long as the first and last word in the region is Israel's.

It was inspected by the foreign and Arab security delegation which included French officer Jean Renon, American Jeff Wagner who came specially from Cyprus with an official from the embassy in Lebanon, Australian Peter White and Saudi Khalifa Khalifa.

In reality, L.Sh. has trade dealings with Yusif al-Bustani which is what caused her to write the check.
We therefore ask your esteemed newspaper to publish these facts which represent the truth of what occurred retaining all our claims against L.Sh. and anyone proven to be involved in her fraudulent attempts and false accusations in order to avoid paying what she owes."
He added: "The wave of attacks against Gulf and Arab visitors, who opened their countries, arms and hearts to welcome the Lebanese throughout the misfortunes and to this day, is unjustified and causes great damage to the Lebanese economy and to the tourism sector and its vitality. It could lead to negative repercussions affecting the welfare of Lebanese in the Gulf States and harm the Lebanese's reputation there."
The loss of life and injuries resulting from traffic accidents in Lebanon, as an annual average according to available official figures, is around 350 deaths and 3000 injuries. However, it should be kept in mind that the first figure only covers deaths resulting directly from the accident or in the following few days, since the statistics do not include deaths at a later date or disabilities, and also that among the 350 cases mentioned, we do not have figures for deaths that might have been avoided had the competent services been brought in to perform the necessary first aid and to transport the injured to the nearest hospital or medical center.
* Transferring victims by military helicopter in cases requiring urgent intervention at the site of the accident so that victims can be taken to a suitable hospital under medical supervision providing first aid to save lives.

Among the Lebanese villages in which Milki found amber are Baqaaqfara, Haqil, Miroba, Harajil, Hamana, Thahir Albaidar, Jazeen and others which is why amber has Lebanese names ("Libaniya" series) and why a type of amber called "cedars" is registered at the natural history archives in Washington, as well as another type called "Milki."

We ask the Minister of Education, Abdulrahim Murad, and through him the three presidents and all ministers and deputies who believe in the constitution and the rule of law, we call on them all to unblock this just and legitimate case which has gone on so long and, with it, to end our suffering and torment. It is with heartache and pain that we ask: "How long will our rights be made hostage by the council of ministers to sectarian and political extortion, not released until the ministers' problems are solved and all their demands met, until all the country's social and sectarian problems are resolved, and perhaps in time the outcome will become linked to complex Arab problems.
Is it that a legitimate and just case like ours defies resolution and is so complex that all solutions and exits have closed on it?
Justice for us and justice for the victims of injustice like us is a sacred charge under your responsibility and the salvation of a state of law and institutions, so who will answer the call?"
The physicians training in the College of Medicine of the Lebanese University demanded expediting completion of the Beirut governmental hospital so that they can practice in a place especially for them, instead of enduring the defects that affect the contracts with the private hospitals.
"2- Since the establishment of the College of Medicine in the Lebanese University, the issuance of Decree 4690 to build the Bi'r Hassan hospital, and its affiliation with the Lebanese University, the resident and training physicians in the College of Medicine in the Lebanese University are performing clinical training in a large number of private hospitals that the college made contracts with, according to a temporary agreement, until the opening of the Lebanese University hospital with its two branches in Baabda and Bi'sr Hassan."
"c- The insistence of the hospitals to discriminate between the resident and training physicians in the College of Medicine and the colleagues in the private colleges operating in Lebanon, and depriving the affiliates of the Lebanese University of equality from the livelihood aspect with their colleagues in the private colleges by refusing to increase compensation allowances to come close to the lowest of compensation allowances in the other universities, and depriving them of health insurance in the hospitals."

"d- Forcing the appropriators of marine and river properties to pay the suitable fines (it is possible to collect what comes near to 20 billion dollars), with continuation of feeding the treasury later from this sector."
"In this area we emphasize:"
"If the officials proceed to ignore the constructive dialog, then our Authority, in alliance with all forces, will continue to move to develop the solutions that lead to realizing the state and society of justice, democracy, sovereignty, and independence."

King Abd-Allah II, who will visit the United States in the middle of this month, emphasized that "Washington has started to deal with the Palestinian case as a political not a security problem."
Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan Al-Muashar stated the day before yesterday that the king will ask Bush to apply pressure on Tel Aviv to move directly to negotiations of the final settlement between the Palestinians and Israel.
"Except the legitimate elected leadership and on top of it Arafat, and that any attempt to replace him is a conspiracy against the Palestinian people and will be a disaster for the entire area... and our efforts have succeeded" in this regard.
"There is no Jordanian citizen and first of them I, personally, who does not feel anger for what our folks are being exposed to of killing, siege, and starvation, because I know that every citizen and Jordanian family has a family relationship with our folks in Palestine... but their support will not be with marches, demonstrations, and donations alone, but rather by influencing the world to support Palestinian rights and forcing the Israeli army to withdraw immediately from all Palestinian cities and territories without any conditions."

Meanwhile, the former king of Afghanistan Muhammad Zahir Shah (87 years old) joined the line of ongoing dealings to stop the gruesome confrontations between  rival warlords in the province of Paktia.
He was asked if he is willing to go personally to Gardiz in the framework of this mediation, and he answered, "I came (to Afghanistan) to help."
It is known that the Afghani conflict resulted over the years in the flight of approximately six million Afghans from the country.
The decision was resented by Washington.
A fighter said that he spent days with some of his colleagues under the debris of a house that was destroyed by the bulldozers and that they were saved from detention by disguising themselves in women's clothes and sneaking to the outside during the medical evacuation operations.
Alaa (23 years old), who belongs to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Battalions connected with the Fatah movement that is led by the Palestinian president Yasser Arafat, said, "It is a miracle that I survived this destruction that is unimaginable."
"I will remain hidden from sight as much as possible, and I will sleep in a different place every day."
"Our number was small and their number was large... on the eighth day, the armored vehicles and the huge bulldozers and with them were snipers who started firing from the roofs of the highest buildings, which reduced very much our ability to move, and the number of our killed began to rise.... We started to move quickly from house to house, and we opened holes in the walls to be able to move."
"All we had was mineral water.... And on a day things were quiet, we heard people speak in Arabic, so we understood that the civilians had returned and that the Israelis had gone."
"But I managed to tear my identity card before going out, and for that when they interrogated me I impersonated my brother; he is not a fighter, and I said that the person you want is dead under the debris."
"So some of us wore women's dresses and went out with them."
"We lost a lot of our weapons."
The American President's advisor for national security affairs Condoleezza Rice repeated yesterday the classification of Iran in "the axis of evil," announcing the failure of efforts exerted by partners of the United States to end the "destructive" policies of Tehran.
She spoke of the existence of "positive forces in Iran, but these positive forces are not able yet to change the nature of the way followed by Iran."

Diplomats reported yesterday that the Security Council is close to reaching an agreement regarding correction of the sanctions imposed on Iraq, which could lead to increasing the pressure on Baghdad to allow the entry of weapons inspectors affiliated with the United Nations.
The program was approved five years ago to alleviate the impact of the sanctions on the Iraqi people, but it includes complicated procedures in the verification process.
The official Russian Itar-Tass agency reported yesterday that "Iraq is willing to discuss tangible details related to the return of international surveillance" for disarmament and that "many of the matters are now pending the results of the New York talks."

I know that "the third world" has become a junkyard for all types of tobacco rejected by the American and the European.
But the matter if limited to commodities will be deficient or temporal, with its effect expiring as the popular rage against the American policy fades away.
But the Arab popular sensitivity of the importance of joining this international wave remains a marginal sensitivity and has not reached the pulse of the street yet.
That is good.
And it is not to be answered with a European cigarette, while the mind sleeps in the desert...
After the cycle of time turned a whole decade, Lebanon became a disarmed country that abandoned romantic illusions.
What is worse than that is that the parliament itself did not take long to announce its boredom with consumption of "talk" as after less than two hours it interrupted its session and pushed it to an indefinite time to complete the discussion of other inquiries included on its agenda!
For adaptation is no longer the epidemic of the people, but rather it is the epidemic of the authority that has adapted to that language and lost one of its typical components.
Some rush now the extraction of features of a "symbolic victory" from the traces of an "obtrusive defeat," the chapters of which have not yet ended.
But the exciting aspect of this important development is that there is a large number of statements and comments dealing with his emergence as if it represents a victory sufficient to compensate the enormity of the defeat that the Israeli occupation army continues to cause not to our folks in Palestine only, but to all this Arab nation and to the international legitimacy whose decisions and desires have been ripped under the chains of the tanks exactly like the bodies of the innocent in Jenin and Nablus.
If in the framework of the "arrangements paper" that organized his exit, those accused of killing Rahabam Zaifi should go to the prison of Jericho and under British or American guard, then it is not exaggerating at all to assume that the Palestinian law with its symbolic sense at least remains there, maybe to condole the Palestinian sovereignty that is also put under incarceration, in turn.
And in the horizons are the features of a political investment of the massacre that will be more brutal than the massacre?!
It added that the Ministry of Defense has no evidence indicating that Damascus tried to control the party.
Peres mentioned that he presented requests among which was for Israel to receive copies of the testimonies of those who will appear before the committee, but the United Nations refused that, as it refused the request to discuss the terrorism operations that led to the Israeli army's entry into the camp.
As to a member of the Knesset, Bail Dayan from the Labor Party, he said: "Moving from agreeing to the investigation committee to full non-cooperation resembles a suicidal move in foreign policy and proves that we have something to hide."
"The great damage that was caused to this sacred place and to clerics detained inside it and the difficult circumstances they suffer, all of that can raise a wave of anti-Semitism in all parts of the Christian world."
"Also, the raids on the Palestinian cities and villages in response to the terrorist attacks does not form an alternative for a strategy that must put a limit to the violence and save Israel from the largest of economic and social crises that it witnessed."
From the Inside Is Different From It on the Outside
Whether this talk has factual foundation or the truth is in another place, its essence indicates that the issue of relations between Washington and Tehran is moving in both capitals contrary to the direction indicated by the externally observed givens of these relations.
But who in Iran is holding the dialogue?
Rafsinjani is known for his tendencies to establish relations with Washington among conditions and specifications, and he was ahead in this matter in the mid-eighties when he entered into a large deal with Washington and some Arab states to end the Iraqi-Iranian war as part of what has come to be known as "Iran Gate."
The reformist representative Muhsin Mirdamadi, who heads the foreign and national security parliamentary committee, says that the committee is considering the issue of the relationship with Washington and, specifically, the relationship with American representatives who do not have a hostile position toward Iran.
Yesterday, Egyptian President Husni Mubarak accused implicitly Washington that it used the international campaign for combating terrorism to the benefit of Israel and failed to meet its commitments to guarantee establishment of a political settlement for the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Israel insists on stopping the Palestinian attacks totally before returning to the suspended negotiations with the Palestinians.
He added: "The major powers and on top of them the United States must assume their responsibilities in immediate stopping of all Israeli provocative practices and imposing Israel's respect for the democratically elected Palestinian authority and its people and the immediate withdrawal from its occupied land in a framework of immediate implementation of international legitimacy resolutions."
He noted that "in the world are many satellite channels whether in the United States, South America, Canada, or Europe, and in the Arab nation there also many satellite channels."
The Emirates news agency reported that the Egyptian President arrived in Abu Dhabi on a "business visit" to the state of the United Arab Emirates.
He had paid on Sunday a brief visit to Libya during which he reviewed with the Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi the situation in the Palestinian lands.
Both the Russian Ministry of Defense and the Kremlin office in Chechnya declined to comment on the matter.
"There are many rumors now."
It is noted that after the announcement by the Russian security authorities last Thursday of the killing of "leader Khattab" of Arab origin, a spokesman for the rebels questioned that matter.
Moscow accused Basaiev, who was born on January 14, 1965, in Fedino in south- eastern Chechnya, of a wave of attacks in Russia in the summer of 1999 that killed 293, but the Chechen leader denied his involvement in these operations.
He said that bad weather and poor vision hid that line, apparently.
Telecommunications Draft Bill's Dilemma Is 4700 Employees; Al-Hareeri Called Lahud, Assuring: Our Relations Will Not Reach a Dead End
Al-Hareeri conveyed from Lahud his comfort with the results of the session of the committees.
Al-Hareeri had received in Quraytam the head of the national bloc Carlos Iddeh and the chairman of the Marunite League Harith Shehab, and discussion took place on some local issues among which was privatization. The Prime Minister said: "The impression must not be that matters between me and His Excellency the President about these issues are going to a dead end, and we will not reach a dead end."
He called anew to "keep the economic affair away from political exploitation and link it with the logic of personal profit and loss instead of giving priority to the interests of the country and the subjects."
It seemed that there were no reflections of the recent inquiries session on the atmosphere of the committees, as if nothing had happened in the parliament two days ago.
This item opens the door for brokers, which could hinder attracting investors.
The amendments of the committees included also Article 19 in the section related to "licensing for telecommunications service providers and their obligations" and in the section related to "international fixed telephone services."
In the vicinity of Sheba and Kafr Shuba, American Ambassador Vincent Batel launched an invitation for calm, stating that the operations of Hezbollah "cause violence," and announced Washington's stand "against violence and against terrorism."
Batel's tour also included Khlawat Al-Bayada where Sheikh Fandi Jamal El-Deen Shujaa interrupted the reception.
He referred to the political situation and said: "President George Bush is working hard in agreement with Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and Israel to bring peace to the region," noting that "peace is not made except by negotiation and not by violence."
During the presence of the American diplomat in the area, Israeli military aviation breached the skies in the south. The Israeli fighters flew at medium altitude above Hasbia, and Batel at that time was inside its municipality building.

Present were the secretary general of the party Antoine Shader; members of the Phalanges political office Ibraheem Risha, Antonio Khuri, George Maghamis, and George Shaheen; mayors of Al-Remeil; Area President Michal Makhluf; and a throng of Phalanges, amid security measures taken by internal security forces.
"And were it not for the steadfastness of the Phalanges, there would have been a Palestinian state instead of the Lebanese state, for if the Battalions did nothing, it has preserved this homeland for all the Lebanese."
By Your Lord, Enough and a Thousand Times Enough
and some others became silent to make way for the officials in the pursuit of partial salvation by finding a partial solution.
The officials attack with all weapons and of all caliber.
They took excuse in the crisis so all the promises of all the projects and development evaporated.
We understood that the world pressures us with all means to make us accept the solutions that it drew for its benefit and the benefit of the enemy of this country.
We understood, we understood, we understood everything that is being said,
For if the people remain silent today,
Khalil Fayhan wrote:
It focused on the type of the aggressor which is Israel the racist state, and also its intention to commit extermination crimes by premeditation and predetermination, by using internationally prohibited weapons such as cluster bombs and napalm.
They mentioned Sharon is in disagreement with the European Union because of his occupation of the Palestinian territories too, and he did not stop at that but also insulted it by preventing the Foreign Minister of Spain Jose Pique, whose country presides over the Union, from moving to Ram-Allah to meet with Arafat. They stopped at Sharon's practices in Lebanon, for he was the one who extended his invasion to Beirut in 1982. He has not ceased to threaten launching a harsh military strike if the resistance strikes lead to the killing of Israelis, military or civilians.
Al-Herawi Accused Al-Husseini of Obstructing the Session: How Was the Cairo Agreement Rescinded With One Minister?
Al-Herawi said to "Al-Nahar": "I followed carefully the recent session of the parliament, and its topic was the questions and the answers."
"They asked that day where is Prime Minister Rasheed Karami (the forgiven) so that we can ask him the question and we can reach later a confidence vote."
"Let President Husseini kindly reveal the proceedings of Al-Taif and place them at the disposal of the parliament and the politicians, as they contain no secrets."
"Everyone attended that session."
"I also ask President Al-Husseini: How did he rescind the Cairo Agreement in the presence of one minister in the session, and today he wants the presence of all members of the government and its head to ask questions?"
They were joined by the Minister of State Beshara Mirhaj, and all set off on an exciting trip in the world of the cathedral and its secrets, accompanied by the head of the restoration committee Ghassan Tweini and the members of the committee Treasurer George Eseili, Michal Fernini, Engineer Oaul Jubeili, and Nabeel Azar.
There was admiration of what was accomplished, particularly in terms of preservation of the cathedral's heritage and revival of its history.
He emphasized that "this religious edifice will be, after completion of its restoration, one of the major heritage features and will thus attract visitors from all over Lebanon and the Arab world."
Lahud Renews His Call to Keep the Economic Affair Away From Political Exploitation and Personal Logic
He added: "The economic situations through which the country is passing makes this occasion an opportunity to emphasize the necessity of participation of all, laborers and employers, and political, economic, and social figures in the rising process, in close collaboration between the two sectors, public and the private, and not at the expense of one sector without the other, because the two sectors are partners."
"As also was our call to keep the economic affair away from political exploitation and linking it to the logic of personal profit and loss, instead of giving priority to the interests of the country and the subjects."
"We had to praise the role being performed by His Excellency from his position as the president of the fourteenth Arab summit, through the contacts with the Arab officials and the international references to confront the extermination campaign to which the Palestinian people are being exposed at the hands of the Zionist enemy in one of the most violent episodes of the gruesome serial continuing for more than five decades."
Lahud also received before noon a delegation from the organizing committee for the thirty-seventh medical conference for the Middle East, which is sponsored by the President of the Republic and which starts its proceedings tomorrow at the American University in Beirut. It was comprised of the Vice-President of the university for medical affairs and dean of the college of medicine Dr. Nadeem Qirtas, the conference chairman Dr. Ghazi Zaatari, the conference vice-chairman Dr. Ghassan Hamada, and the director of media and public relations in the American University Ibraheem Al-Khuri.
Hammoud received two calls from the Secretary-General of the Arab League Amr Moussa, during which they consulted about the development of the situation in the area, and about the ongoing contacts to hold a meeting of the delegates of the League's member states next Tuesday to develop a mechanism for the monitoring and moving committee as it was approved by the Beirut summit.
"And of course I sensed from Minister Hammoud every concern and appreciation, and he promised me that the Arab summit presidency will move to ensure the implementation of the Beirut summit decisions."
"It is known that we are demanding of Iraq the necessity for cooperation with the triple committee and the Red Cross, and there is no other mechanism to deal with this issue."
Meanwhile, the Secretary-General of the ministry received the Swedish Ambassador in Lebanon resident in Damascus, Viola Forfbeilka, in a protocol visit.
He added that the volume of the American commercial trade with the Arab world does not represent more than 3 percent of the overall American trade.
He expressed his objection to the oil embargo that has been adopted by Iraq. He announced that "the good convergence" is to move toward public opinion in the states in which that opinion influences the decision-makers, as "these states control the weapons, the equipment, and the means of making changes, and that is the only way for us to reach a balanced and fair view of what is happening in the Arab and Muslim states."
"My grandfather is Riyad Al-Sulh, as Al-Hareeri knows, and I carry Lebanese citizenship. It seems that this reality of mine is what angered Al-Hareeri, so he drove demonstrations against me and inspired the statements against me."

The Marunite Patriarch Cardinal Mar Nasralla Boutros Sfeer received in Bakraki yesterday a delegation from the Mikhyeer family presided over by Ghassan Mikhyeer, who said after the meeting: "The visit is to place the Patriarch in the atmosphere of the my candidacy for the orthodox seat in Al-Matn, which I had the honor to gain from the family of Mikhyeer and the friends of Dr. Mikhyeer and his current."
"The target in our point of view in this battle is the base of Dr. Mikhyeer, because the vacant seat is the seat of the opposing Dr. Albert Mikhyeer and not any other position."
He said: "My opinion is that the battle has become between the opposition and the opposition over the seat of Dr. Mikhyeer, and not over the seat of the Almer family present currently in the parliament in the person of representative Michal Almer."
He denied being the candidate of the state, emphasizing that "the influence on me of the state support will follow the example of the effect on Albert Mikhyeer in the recent elections. We antagonize whoever antagonizes us, and we support whoever supports us and thank him."
Between the two years 1993 and 2000, the number of unions affiliated with the General Laboring Union rose from 22 unions to 36 unions, and with it rose the number of members of the council of delegates in the general union to 144 members and the members of the executive board to 72 members, where all are equal in the right to vote in isolation of the actual representative magnitude of the representatives of the unions.
The nineties were also a field for party and political control that was intensified in different forms.
Therefore, keeping away from them or not being able to understand them according to their scientific rules is considered injustice to culture, history, and civilization.
For that, this project is what creates the terms of homogeneity for relations, thaws all factors of dissension and dispersion, and establishes the capacity for progress and development.
Discussion took place concerning the bill that was prepared to amend this law and place the final touches on it from its drafting committee.
"What concerns us about it is the part related to the owners of free professions, those professions that have been affected more than others by stagnation, unemployment, and deterioration. The law came unjust to those affiliated with them such that it burdens them with a load they sink under, and they have no capacity to rise with it."
"- A socio-economic factor stemming from the deteriorated status quo and the necessity of taking it into consideration within the reasonable and the acceptable, meaning with fair amounts for the treasury and not burdensome to the payers."
"In addition to several factors for which there is no room to plunge in and elaborate, all of which ultimately end in supporting our point of view that it is imperative to make the required amendment that we developed jointly as association presidents a proposition bill with its demanding reasons. We have sent its text to the representatives, the association presidents, and other colleagues, pleading our representatives to give it their concern, approve it, submit it, and follow it up until it is sanctioned."
Lebanon and the world celebrates today Labor Day, and the General Laboring Union is organizing an oratory festival before noon on its premises.
It called for adoption of an industrial, agricultural, and service-productive policy that accommodates a large number of Lebanese laborers and for finalizing the issue of the presence of non-Lebanese labor as soon as possible, because it has become an element of competition for the Lebanese workforce and has driven it to the brink of starvation.
The Democratic Youth Movement talked about "aggravation of the economic and social crisis and has come to warn of total collapse and bankruptcy."
The Executive Bureau of Working Women in the Palestinian Democratic Women's Organization referred to the tragic situations that are lived by the Palestinian people on the occupied lands.
That will be in the premises of the League in the Tareeq Al-Jadeeda area.
The Cabinet presidency received yesterday the suggestion of the Economic and Social Council regarding amendment of some articles of the social security law. That is one day after their approval by the general board of the Council.
Nisnas hoped that the amendment bill of the social security law will be the first product of cooperation with the government for the sake of amending bills that have become in pressing need of development and modernization, particularly after the Economic and Social Council proved its ability to deal seriously with issues of public concern.
2- With regard to the retirement and social protection system: the formulation was suggested based on three corners, the success of the first requiring (an obligatory corner with the guarantee of the state) a new specification of the minimum limit for wages that takes into consideration the economic, social, and financial developments on one hand, and on the other hand, "the content of Article 44 of the Labor Law that stipulates the following: The minimum limit of the wages must be sufficient to satisfy the necessary needs of the employee and the needs of his family, provided that the type of work is taken into consideration, and it must be no less than the official minimum limit."
Montreal bade farewell days ago to the Canadian artist Jean Paul Royobil, who died at seventy-eight years of age.
A novel with the "and" conjunction from the first line, separated and linked with the "comma" and both matters are equal.
Elwia Subh is the author, and she is at the same time one of the characters inside the novel.
A life running like a river from a source to a mouth,
then fruits for the first time.
Many of its flowers
Accused of nostalgia for childhood: I knock.
But I
And did we really part? I
and in the depth it is an indivisible one.
Snow was falling thickly on the funeral followers of the late artist to the church on Papino Avenue in Montreal. They applauded at length as the coffin passed by, then silence prevailed in the snow-coated churchyard.
He was done justice by the positions of Quebec artists. The Parisian comrades of his track unanimously admitted to his significance as an artist in France, as he lived there for approximately forty years.
Walberg is the compiler of the introduction of the catalog that summarized the Canadian artist's works.
Jean Paul Riobil was born in Montreal in 1923 and spent most of his life in France (between 1949 and 1989) and in Paris, specifically.
Among his friends who also left their marks in their time: Jiaco Miti, Samuel Picket, Nicola Pustal, George Mathhew, Hartong, Zawah Wu-Ki, Faira Dasilva, and Joan Mitchell, the rich American woman with whom he lived for more than twenty-five years. Their relationship was tumultuous and stormy to the extent that it was said that author Edward Albee was inspired by them for the idea of his play "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"
There is an opportunity available today to discover his art in the Fine Arts Museum in Montreal and the Quebec museum (next autumn) where his major works will be exhibited.
Free and against selling obstinate
in the size of the palm
even if it is weighed in diamonds and rubies
If they cut open that passionate sufferer of your love
encircling your tender forearm and your severing forearm
And may the emaciated body be blessed when they inhume it in your breast
If the part of you that is not for sale becomes
The pomegranate of the heart
then we become everlasting, glorified, O Amman
leave for me the face of Amman as I loved it
Her arms, and the arms of a mother who suckled me her love.
If my mother dwells on the slope of the hill in "Naour"
Do not remove, from the face of Amman
The mosque plaza, Al-Bukhari markets
Its houses the roof of which is the "yard" of the other
staying late in its shades a boy
passing by all still hearts
do not fell the blooming trees
complaining the absence of one woman of the country folks!
the expanse of the valley, in the ring of chatters, is truly small
So let us drop
to identify the features that since years have dwelled
please.

The joint force composed of the judicial police, the anti-narcotics bureau, the internal security forces, and the army with the assistance of the Security and Reconnaissance Authority in the Syrian forces, started yesterday the second stage of the campaign to eradicate forbidden plants in Baalbak-Al-Hermel and particularly the plants of green poppy (opium) in the framework of the Ministry of Interior plan.
It was found in Bawadi valley that fields surrounding the poppy field that was destroyed are planted with hashish and recently irrigated. It is in its first growth, and each plant does not exceed five centimeters.
In Beirut, the central anti-narcotics bureau distributed a schedule of the lands planted with poppy within the areas of Deir Al-Ahmar and Al-Hermel as follows:
On the date 5/4/2002: Al-Saeeda valley, 120 donems hashish; Al-Suweidan farm, 2 donems.

As the victim was returning from the house of his uncle, he was decoyed by Sheikho to a wheat field after making him believe that a harlot was waiting for them at a time when Ibraheem was hiding amid the wheat spikes. Upon their arrival, Sheikho stabbed Hussein in his abdomen, and Ibraheem took care of stabbing him in his back so he fell to the ground. When he tried to escape, Ibraheem slaughtered him.

Russe was referring to the belief of Saada, as Qubrusi said.
He mentioned, "Were Antoun Saada assigned to one judge of the caliber of Judge Qublan in the trial of 1949, it would never have proceeded at the speed with which it proceeded, the right of defense would not have been breached as it was breached, Antoun Saada would not have been executed, Kamal Junbulat would not have questioned the government, and we would not have born the shame of what took place in that trial."
The attorney Taqqiy El-Deen emphasized, "The trial of Saada is a mark of disgrace in the history of our nation, and his blood shed in the dawn of that day  (July 8) flowing on the sand granules of Al-Ramla Al-Baydaa beach will continue to ask: Have you given me a fair trial?"

The obstacles are not restricted to legislative and other measures.
The director of the European branch of the non-governmental organization Human Rights Watch, Jean-Paul Martous, wrote that the war against terrorism represents a test for journalists, and "contrary to the absolute assurances of corrupting historians of press in the time of war, the freedom of press and the freedom of expression represent an opportunity, not an encumbrance, during emergency conditions."
Participating will be journalists from different parts of the world who are exposed in their daily work to the danger of terrorism and violence, and representatives of international governmental and non-governmental organizations and professional organizations.

But Haffilang surprised everyone on May 31, 1996, with his statement that the principle of joint hosting was approved "in respect for the work of the two candidates" in preparing their files, so the latter two found no escape from submission.
*The two Americas: Uruguay 1930, Brazil 1950, Chile 1962, Mexico 1970, Argentine 1978, Mexico 1986, and the United States 1994.

The American administration is demanding extradition of the Egyptian activist on the charge of sending funds to the family of Abd El-Rahman, the leader of Al-Jamaa Al-Islamiyya, who is incarcerated in the United States. It issued a warrant to that end in May 2001, stating that he knew that the funds he sent to Afghanistan were going to be used for "terrorist" purposes.
It was mentioned that Al-Serri was detained in October and was accused of conspiring to assassinate the Afghan opposition leader Ahmad Shah Masud on  September 9, two days before the attacks on New York and Washington.
"Dialogue" Between United Nations and Iraq Resumed in Vienna on Fourth of July
He explained, "The word 'dialogue' is not negotiations but rather an attempt to reach a common understanding or converging on the understanding between us and between the Secretariat-General of the United Nations about the issues of the relationship between Iraq and the Security Council."
The members of the Iraqi delegation discussed technical questions with two of the senior arms experts in the United Nations, who are the head of the international organization's committee for inspection, observation, and verification, Hans Blix, and the director-general of the international atomic energy agency, Muhammad Al-Baradei.

He announced that Baghdad has started investment in the two huge oil fields of Majnun and Al-Qirna Al-Gharbi in the south of the country, and that no foreign companies have participated in the process of developing the two fields.
It seemed that the disorder in the performance of the Bureau, whose director Robert Muller admitted that it was able to prevent the attacks of September 11, actually affected American public opinion, as the most recent opinion poll showed that the majority of American have become less confident in winning the war against terrorism, in spite of the keenness of senior White House officer Andrew Card to assert that American President George Bush dedicates two hours daily to reviewing the terrorism issue.
It reminded of the "ugly history" of the Bureau in monitoring local affairs and its infringement of public freedoms before the issuing of the First Amendment of the Constitution.
Director of governmental affairs in the Council of American Islamic Affairs Jason Arb stated, "Mosques like other religious institutions are open before all Americans and have nothing to hide, but this must not be taken advantage of to use techniques to spy on religious minorities who are committed to legitimate activities."
He said: "The incidents of September 11 have truly changed the way our government works."
However, it came in an opinion poll that was conducted by the "USA Today" newspaper, the American CNN television network, and the Gallop Institute that Americans have become less optimistic about the war against terrorism, as only 40 percent of those included in it said that the United States and its allies will win; the percentage was two-thirds in January.

The Army Lifts Emergency Status Off Two Kurdish Areas; Pressures Increase on Ajawid to Step Down Because of His Ailing Health
Ajawid, who was hospitalized twice in May, remains subject to the observation of physicians in his house, since his return to it on Monday.
But even the newspapers that for long explicitly supported the Prime Minister appealed to him to resign to preserve political stability.
Analysts fear that Ajawid's resignation might lead to a ministerial crisis that will require holding early elections that could hinder Turkey's efforts to emerge from a profound economic crisis.
Yesterday a group comprised of eight physicians examined Ajawid in his house for the period of an hour.
The newspapers also speculated that the Prime Minister has Parkinson's disease and another disease that causes weakness in the nerves.
Syrian newspapers published yesterday for the first time in the headings of their first pages news of the trial of the opposing Syrian Riyad Al-Turk that is taking place before the state security court with the charge of offending the constitution.

The European Commission prepared yesterday its strategy in the conflict in progress between it and the United States regarding the increase of fees on steel imports, threatening to launch the sanctions mechanism on June 18 without applying them immediately, hoping to reach an agreement with the Americans.
The source explained, "The issue to the European Union is related to reporting an increase in its custom duties on American products at a time no later than June 18 without realizing that immediately."

The elections, be they general or secondary, are an occasion to return to the popular will when this is able to express itself in freedom.
In Al Matin there is commotion.
But in spite of that, it is blank because it conceals what is truly political to the benefit of what is personal and temporal.
2- The strife between brothers, cousins, and relatives elicits pity and particularly when it is subjected to the factors of mutual curses, grudges, and scandals of every type and sort, and the loss falls on everyone without exception.
And this is a reality that cannot be denied by words of "arrogance" from here and there.
And here the "chief exile" is equal with the "chief regretful."
A last prayer: May Allah make them grow!
And how could three of the fighters for the public interest have lost in the context of the cellular privatization discussions the possibility of putting a separating line between the owner of authority and the opportunities of benefiting from the dedication of the state and the public liabilities?
Really, how could they have said the text that calls for separation of an official from the opportunities of authority abuse for personal interest is an unconstitutional text?
We do not know if those who fought and are fighting to drop the ranch status off Lebanon, and in their forefront are Al Husseini, Dhaher, and Harb, have recalled the slogan of: "From where did you get this?" which we hang like a vessel for deceptive decoration on the walls of the state that is submerged in plunder and thefts and to the degree that made us resort to privatization in attempts to lift the situation from collapse.
They can, of course.
"Ha'arts": Hezbollah Will Continue Its Military Operations Even if Withdrawal From the Farms Is Accomplished
"Supporting this position is the head of national security, General Uzi Dyan, who said to the newspaper, 'As long as the Golan Heights remain under Israel's control, then the Syrians will find a way to remind us of that.'"
"And although such a position is not good in the long term, upon considering the public interest we must not forget the fact that Syria is now on the way to entering a confrontation with the United States, as long as the war against terrorism continues."
"It was written on the signs carried by the demonstrators: Al Abbassia and Shiba farms will return to the homeland only by resistance."
He added: "But it seems that such estimation does not take into consideration the position of the party that on the Lebanese internal level lays a state of self-defense and is trying to preserve its importance."
"And that is the reason for which Lebanon deployed in recent months hundreds of soldiers and elements along the length of the borders. They have established barricades and have detained Palestinian elements that were intending to carry out operations against Israel."
We apologize in advance that the intention is not the Al Matin elections.
For ultimately not more than nine million voters went to the polls and the results revealed the victory of the National Liberation Front that ruled the country for approximately 30 years of the majority of seats, while the Democratic Assembly party who enjoys majority in the current parliament came in second.
And that is not little.
In this sense the war has not ended yet or at least has not ended to a result that satisfies the Algerians, which means a convincing formula of accord for which they can present sacrifices.
It is remote that the Algerians do not want a solution for their problems, regardless of differences in their opinions and affiliations.
Minister of Defense Adopts Minister of Interior's Warning about Al-Matin; Bakraki Calls for Voting Attendance with "Patriotic Responsibility"
As to former secretary-general of the Communist Party George Hawy, he responded with a vengeance to the threats by the Minister of Interior to him warning of its consequences.
The Marunite Patriarchy
In that context, the candidate Ghassan Mikhyeer and the head of the Lebanese National Bloc party Carlos Iddah will hold a joint press conference today.
Questions to General Oun
Much was said, much was written, and we remained silent, the defamation increased, the gossip multiplied, and we remained silent.
Enough defamation for an "isolated cell" that they attack on the eve of every election event.
Who is the occupier?
Or does he mean by his words the Tashnaq party that maintained the inhabited and residential areas with its diligence and sacrifices, and the authority represented by the presidency of the republic, the presidency of the parliament, and the presidency of the cabinet that has expended everything in its capacity after the Al Taif agreement to set the bases of democracy and dialogue?
Has the General forgotten that the Armenians have in Lebanon a role more important than the election events?
To General Oun and Representative Naseeb Lahud, we say: Politics is a science and art, for politics does not mean degradation or defamation.
And it is enough of expressing one time as an isolated cell and another time as a ghetto, and as a digression we ask both the General and the representative: If the Armenian citizens had voted or were to vote for the opposition, would the description of the isolated cell and the ghetto remain applicable?
Has the General become recognizant today of the authority that he once considered illegitimate?
Departure from Lebanon is not the way to save and salvage it, General.
The upper council of the party held its weekly meeting yesterday, presided over by Douri Shamoun, and issued a statement that included:
"Therefore, all attempts at dialogue were aborted, and before them the national settlement and accord that aggravated the crises, and ahead of them the crises of confidence that we live."
"2- We renew the demand for revealing the obscurities of the Engineer Ramzi Eirani crime and his killing, and imposing the severest penalties on its perpetrators."
The Test in Al Matin
The voter has awareness if he demonstrated: logic in his thinking, care for his dignity, independence in his choice, ambition in his aspirations, loyalty to his country, and concern for his area and the future of his children.
Are those the leaders who will prepare for us a promising future and a blooming spring?
The slogans they release are a factor of misleading and maneuver.
For there they are adopting means of extremism instead of moderateness and the logic of maneuver instead of transparency.
Exclusivity of decision is dictatorship and abandoning allies is betrayal.
With the magic of a magician they recognize the legitimacy of the state and decide to participate in the elections.
All of that for the sake of shattering a person who advocates accord, not strife, and unity, not division.
The opposition challenged the voter in his independence because it overlooked harmony, understanding, and aspirations.
And what salvation and rescue await us?
The Lebanese Society for Democratic Elections: The Law Confirms the Requirement of the Secret Chamber
"Law number 144 issued on 5/6/1992 rescinded the first clause of Article 15 of the employees law that prohibited an employee from practicing political affairs, joining political parties, carrying the emblem of a party, etc. However, the rescission of this clause pursuant to the amendment that occurred in 1992 aimed at not depriving the employee of his legitimate right to express his political opinions, and that is a constitutionally warranted right within the framework of applicable laws and systems, and particularly via association with political parties and societies."
"b- The Society regrets what was said by the Minister of Interior that using the isolator (the secret chamber) is optional in voting, and the Society states the following:"
"c- The threats that were directed by the Minister of Interior to arrest a number of politicians concerned with the elections in the northern Al Matin area are very serious and can diffuse an atmosphere of terror and fear on the eve of the election day, which might discourage the voters from participating in the voting and the representatives of candidates from monitoring them and threatens accordingly the soundness of the elections and their freedom and fairness."
"And from that starting point we announce the following:"
"His assassination has led to increased anxiety of the expatriates with all the effects that have on their motion toward Lebanon on the economic level or on the social level."
"His killing has led to the escalation of fear among a section of the Lebanese and their relatives in the expatriation, particularly since Mr. Hedeiqa was not in the state opposition square."
"We also wish for the establishment of peace and stability in the south and for the return of its people from all Lebanese lands and from beyond the borders."
"And accordingly, we address our call for a comprehensive and just solution for the Palestinian issue under international legitimacy."
Even if they squash under their feet the orthodox (the owners of the seat) and all of the Christians and on top of them the Marunites.
- Who allowed you to exploit Qornat Shahwan?
Who decided that this battle is a battle against the President of the Republic?
And the greatest evil is the war of those leaders, one against the other, after the elections on the day when the drums wane and the lovers disperse.
As to the close contacts of Syria and those who swallow their tongues sometimes, those are among you and your partners, and regretfully Syria esteems them and receives them and you envy them, but the people do not respect them.
And how I wish that you win for constructive and reasonable opposition, and that you win for the reputation of the Christians, particularly the Marunites, some leaders of whom want to show them to the world as if they were retarded people.
President of the Republic received yesterday at Ba'abda Palace, MP Marwan Faris, accompanied by members of the Higher Emigrant Committee of the Syrian National Socialist Party. They informed him of the preparations underway by the Party to convene the Expatriates Conference on the 21st of next July in Beirut, which will include representatives of expatriates of the world. It will pave the way for the convention of the 12th international conference of the Expatriates League on the 25th, 26th and 27th of July.
The delegation included national expatriate and former ambassador Fouad Ghandour, Mansour Azar, Farouq Abu Judeh, Qasem Saleh, Jamil Rajeh and Jihad Al Aqel.
President of the Arab Dentists' Union and Union Leader of the Hashemite, Kingdom Dr. Ahmad Al Qaderi, also spoke and presented the President of the Republic with the congratulations of the participating delegations on the 2nd anniversary of the liberation.
The Communist Party answered some of what came in the interview of Elias Al Murr with the "Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation" the night before last, especially with regard to the Party, considering it rude and explicit interference in the side elections of Al Matn, and exceeds "the necessity for objectivity and impartiality imposed by his position".
At this time we consider it a side battle not separate from the ongoing political struggle in Lebanon and Al Matn.
It seems strange, above all this, even if we are not surprised, that explicit and public threats are issued by a responsible minister, a lawyer, against citizens who practice their democratic right guaranteed to them by the constitution in an election battle, on the pretext they are preparing to "create problems".
We were and still are calling for the reform of the political system, and initiators on the basis of our national position to correcting the relationship with Syria, and establishing it on the basis of respecting the sovereignty, independence and special relations within a framework of comprehensive confrontation to the Zionist-American project.
Solana Promised to Inform Officials of the Truth About the Israeli Position
They added that Lebanon took its time in taking any position on participating in any international conference before finding out its criteria, frameworks and topics.
They explained that those familiar with the atmosphere that prevailed in Solana's talks in Ba'abda, Ein Al Teineh, Qreitem and Bustrus concluded that there is no single Lebanese understanding of what he wants.
They said Solana believes, in answer to questions of the officials in Lebanon, that there is American movement in the right direction to push the political process of peace.
But if there is agreement on its topics, date and location of convention, it can convene on the level of foreign minister aides in an initial stage to start discussions and exchange points of view.
Condemnation Statements Authority
As for the Middle East, it was not one of the direct priorities on the agenda of the Bush and Putin's negotiations, and was spoken of in passing, from the angle of the expression of the American President of his fears that Russia will supply Iran with nuclear weapons.
And one of the first duties of President Arafat and the National Authority is to hasten to issue condemnation statements of these attacks even before the Israeli statements are issued in this regard.
That is the situation of the current American administration that seems in a state of permanent internal struggle with the self over the policy that must be adopted towards what is going on in the region, especially the daily side-effects of the Palestinian-Israeli struggle.
Despite the fact that such a saying is polite courage from Arafat, it is a mistake that led and will lead to diluting accountability.
Or is the object the required service of the security of Israel and the Israelis, and consequently the Americans?
If coexistence has prevailed in the relations of the factions in their different beliefs during the past period, the coming days have new facts and beliefs that are completely different than those in the past.
First Investigation Judge in Beirut, Hatem Madi, continued his investigations in the kidnapping and murder of Engineer Ramzi Eirani, and listened to five eyewitness statements.

Mousa Inaugurated First Cedar Forest in the South: Civilized Answer to Residues Israel Mousa "Environment Day"
Minister Mousa gave a speech in which he commended the initiative of the pioneering "Coca Cola" company, considering it a model of the relationship that should be between the public and private sectors. He pointed out that this "green gift" is evidence of the interest in the southern region - nationally, environmentally and touristically. He stressed that the greening of Lebanon in general, and the south in particular is considered a civilized reply to the ghost of death left by the Israeli occupation of our land, represented by planting approximately half a million mines that kill the innocent daily and leave behind the maimed.
At the end, everyone moved to the cedar forest where Mousa, Azar and Abu Aqel planted a cedar tree. Then, they inspected the forest and examined the phase that was completed in it.
Seminar in Rashayya on the Problem of Mines; Hrawi Overviewed Used Measures; Qablan scolded the Money
The forum was held at the Hall of Educationalist Dhaher Al Ma'alouli in Rashayya.
At the international conference, we convened and established four committees: one for taking care of awareness, the second for bringing in aid from abroad to help the injured, the third to bring aid for the army, and a fourth to bring in aid from abroad for social development."
Al Rayyes said: "We are still in the first phase of dealing with victims of the mines, and we are coordinating with the National Office."
With a simple comparison and more than 25 years after Vietnam's liberation, there are two thousand injuries annually because of American mines, as we have. The matter needs a large workshop to stop this depletion and so that we can, after many years, remove the mines."
The other matter is that all limbs injured by mines and other Israeli attacks are assembled at the expense of the South Council. The third matter: during the past ten years, lump sum compensation was provided to the injured for injury or disability that reaches the limits of 19 million liras for anyone who loses any of his limbs. That matter is fixed in our files.
The matter needs a field workshop, because we have had enough costly conferences and forums. This money, if it is available, should go to the required place," Deputy Ghanem asked the Minister of Defense: "Are there no programs to remove political mines in the country?"
The meeting was held at the Grand Lectures Hall with a number of the Association Council's members and female lawyers attending.
Masoud Nader expressed her "gratefulness for Shadid's efforts to raise the level of the Association to the highest level, and to keep the Association elevated and liberated from any restraints".
In turn, she commended Masabki "the pioneer in being involved in the Association's work and practicing the trade 50 years ago, in addition to her journalistic and cultural activity that was crowned with her novel that deserved three appreciation rewards in France".
She went back in memory to the age of fifteen when she dreamed of becoming a lawyer "and my father died and I had to help my mother and continue my education. I found  a job in one of the municipalities while I enrolled in the Jesuit University and obtained a degree in law.
Finally, Association President Shadid spoke, saying: "I am a champion of women,  I support her, I want her at the forefront, and I believe in her as a mother, a sister, a daughter, a mate and a worker.
He praised the characteristics of "our friend and colleague Masabki".
He said: "When I was elected, I promised a program, part of which I implemented and whose results will show in due time."
I was surprised that this writer committed morphological and grammatical mistakes that could not be believed by anyone.
It transcended it to eliminating the letter ya' from names and words, and replacing it with alef maqsoura, so that the name "Hilmy", for example, becomes "Hilma" and the name "Ali" becomes "Ala".
"Al muhamoon" is written as "muhameen" and "mustashpha" is feminine instead of being masculine. The letter"L" has no existence in their dictionary, except for a few, who graduated from French schools, such as Rushdi Abaza, Jamil Ratib and Sana'a Jamil.
* An official at the Al Hazimyyah Municipality confirmed that in two weeks at the latest, the streets - subject of the complaint - will be paved and that the delay is due to a crisis that will be resolved soon in providing asphalt.
He wondered how a company could set conditions for obtaining a bill, especially since he has subscribed to it and it has his file and all the necessary information about him.
He pointed out that the amount of five dollars is set because the owner of the complaint has not subscribed to the monthly detailed bill service, which costs two dollars a month.
Preemptive Strike?
More importantly, perhaps he pushed the American Congress to increase its military aid to Israel to face the dangers of the Iranian land-land "Shihab 3" missiles that can reach any point in Israel.
As Israel does not accept the principle of any other country in the Middle East obtaining nuclear ability monopolized by it alone since the year 1963.
The commentator says that the real danger is loading the said missile with nuclear warheads, adding, "according to the information available to us, the main assistance Iran obtains comes from Russia.
The writer believes that the best way to stand in the face of Iran's obtaining of nuclear capability is to depict the line resulting from that as a threat to Russia and the United States, as it is a threat to Israel.
All of this requires radical change in the Israeli deterrence theory based on monopolizing the nuclear ability in the region.
2- In a varied society, the administration, specifically, constitutes the bridge through which reconciliation occurs between the citizen and the regime, and therefore legitimacy is built, grows and is enhanced, overcoming initial loyalties, that are all legitimate but certainly not conflicting.
In the tax field, especially, the renewal of trust in governments is necessary, through providing the feeling in citizens that taxes are distributed equally, and so is collection  and assignment.
We discuss the subject through the following points.
To provide these interests the laws give them the right to impose fees equal to their services, and additionally they utilize taxes to provide the balance of their payments.
But without completely succeeding in his mission.
In every "missile" experiment, the inciting Israeli talk, about the danger of the Iranian armament of it escalated to Washington and the other Western capitals, , despite the fact that the farthest range of these missiles does not exceed three hundred kilometers, while the Israeli side owns what is farther in range, in addition to weapons of mass destruction, before the eyes and ears of all the world's capitals.
On the eve of the elections, the battle seemed heated, contrary to the previous cycle that witnessed a harmonious list that led to the election of the former council, especially with the declaration of a single list headed by former Union Leader Muwaffaq Al Yafi, which includes Ali Al Jarmaqi, Anis Qansouh, Nash'at Abed and George Mubayyed. Meanwhile, individual nominations were registered for Fawzi Hamdan, Antoine Abu Suleiman, George Zakhour and Elie Rizqallah.

President of the "Lebanese-Russian Friendship Society", Jack Sarraf, revealed a visit of a Russian economic delegation to Lebanon next month, highlighting the importance of this movement in enhancing economic cooperation and investment between the two countries.
He spoke about the problem of entry visas of Russians into Lebanon, which he had raised with Minister Bishara Mirhej last week, stressing that he is "seeking, with officials, to find solutions for it."
The Union said in a statement that the two sides "insisted on the continuation of cooperation in handling all issues to maintain the interest of patients and rights of citizens, and in service of everyone's interest.
Communication skills consultant, Zein Ghanma, lectured in the course and 20 employees from 12 banks participated.
The delegation is scheduled to visit the Prime Minister next Wednesday.
Salameh said in his conversation about the policy of currency stability that "The Central Bank faced difficulties in providing this policy due to the budget deficit and the public debt, which constituted two elements of pressure on the currency market. But, he was able, through successive procedures and various acts of financial engineering, to have enough to ensure the continuation of this policy, and there are no expectations to change it".
He pointed out the existence of two opinions in the country, one is pessimistic and skeptical whatever procedures are taken, and the other is optimistic that a launch is possible. He highlighted that Lebanon "did not activate its abilities yet, and even if most of its income is from non-resident Lebanese, it at the same time did not abandon these capabilities which were, for example, similar to what happened in Argentina."
He stressed on the other hand the strength and safety of the banking sector, and its distance from pessimistic scenarios.
He considered that the style of changing the debt from the lira to the dollar is new, expecting that the Bank of Lebanon will receive deposits, whose value he has not determined, next June, "that will contribute to improving its dollar situation."
The Board convened its period meeting headed by Abboud, with the members in attendance, and presented "ways of activating the implementation of the bilateral trade agreement signed with Iraq".
Yesterday, the following clarifying statement was issued: "To defend our national causes and rights is a holy duty that we must work for with firmness and faith, but in return, we must watch every step we take in this direction so that we do not cause damage to the national economy, and they do not reflect negatively on the citizen and society.
Foresight and acting responsibility are what is needed from us in this critical stage.
What is required is being victorious over closure for constant spiritual rejuvenation.
From these starting points Father Dr. Yousef Muwannas participated in the Libyan Dialogue Conference that was convened in Libya to discuss issues of Christian - Muslim dialogue, on initiative from the Islamic - Christian Calling College in Libya, and the Papal Pontifical Council for Christian - Muslim Dialogue. Its valuable interjections were entitled "The Basis of Christian - Muslim Dialogue and the Contemporary Issues of Media and Development."
In addition to three indices according to subject, names of editors and sources.
This troublemaking muscle, that prefers noise to silence, acquired characteristics and names that do not belong, in essence, to its significance.
The true profession of this pretentious heart is no different than the profession of the porter or carriers in ports, despite the fact that the porter does not pretend to have written a divine comedy or that he has discovered the stability of the sun and the rotation of the earth. The claim is done by the heart; it is an indicator of love, a store of faith, and the subject of the soul.
The most wronged is the liver, this isolated superior silent being. As it does not make the noise the heart does, like the brain, it suffered negligence and scorn, and that is why in the Arab language the verb toil is derived, which is reference to the suffering and torment issued by the liver.
From the movement of the heart that is called beating, the heart's name became the beater, despite the fact that the act of beating is given to any process of mixing eggs with water ... the porter is a porter ...
The more we put the claim of the heart to the test, we discover its blackmail, origin, and low value. It does not stop, in return, inflating (let us remember, also, that one of the heart's handicaps is inflation, it is said the inflation of the heart, which is the disease which caused the death of poet Abul Qassem Al Shabbi!), pretending and arrogance, only because it provides organs with nutrition.
52 Doctors Graduated from American University; Franjieh: Your Role Elevated Level of Profession

Hospitality in Iran ... and Other Things
Good hospitality was clear in what the Iranian government provided for the guests participating in the conference, including accommodation at the best Tehran hotels, trips organized to most Iranian cities (Mashhad, Tabriz and Esfahan), accommodation in them in their best hotels, and visits to their most important landmarks.
One of the men of religion participating in this conference, who is of the scientific shrine in Qom city, expressed the opinion of Islamic shari'a on the subject, that the rights of the author, like any other financial or moral rights, are protected according to shari'a principles.
Aside from this beautiful wide expansive place and the civilized airs, what also draws attention is the immense turnout by the Iranians to visit the exhibition and buy books. Tens of thousands come to it daily, and you see them leave burdened with what they are carrying.

How we need honest witnesses who leave illuminated documents on Lebanon in the second half of the twentieth century for our coming generations, so that the true Lebanese memory will not be lost in the mazes of those who are defeated and surrender to something other than the Lebanese entity in spirit, thought and heritage.
And congratulations to our great colleague, George Skaf, on the publication of his complete writings, supervised, verified and accepted by him (from the Lebanese whiff in his analysis, to the literary whiff in "The Bells of Nostalgia Valley", "Symbols of Poetry and "Our Orchard at Elleen", to the political readings), which makes the group among the most precious of what we treasure for our children in Lebanon's future memory.

We are also aware that the ordinary judiciary is subject to the hegemony of the executive authority and its machinery."
Also, the Court of Misdemeanors in Damascus passed a verdict in April, imprisoning Deputies Riyad Seif and Ma'moun Al-Humsi for five years, and indicting them with the charge of "targeting changing the Constitutions in illegitimate ways".
He overviewed, with his guest Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, military equipment made or assembled in Sudan.
The crowds have realized after the bitter experience that the war has lost its meaning and reasoning, and are now the only means to the public killing, sabotage, hunger, homelessness and backwardness. The reasoning of peace today is safety, security, development and progress (...) The Nuba Mountains have come out of the war, and Eastern Sudan has come out of the War. The southern states will come of the war as that is the destiny of God and that is the will of the people, and they will be victorious in the end, God willing (...)

He was asked whether the American threats to Iraq are affecting the talks. He answered, "The United States does not want the international organization to act according to its charter, and does not want international law to take its course.

At the hotel Atta called a cellular number most probably in Hamburg.
"El Payes" mentioned that two people accompanied Al Shihi, which prompted investigators to believe that approximately six "conspirators" could have possibly attended the Tarragona meeting.
Arafat Understood Bush's Message and Will Not Run for Elections, But Will Sharon Accept Creation of A Palestinian State?
The newspaper reported a senior Palestinian source saying that even if the plan is not implemented, merely presenting it for discussion means the Palestinians have realized that Arafat can no longer escape the international pressure that is exerted on him by maneuvering as he did before.
Among the candidates, aside from Abed Rabbo, is "Abu Al Ala'a", President of the Palestinian Legislative Council.
And that the official in the State Department, Aaron Miller, one of the old members in the crew of the peace negotiations from the days of President Bill Clinton, presented the plan to Powell to implement the speech.
Until now Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has not said that he agreed to the entire speech."
As for Benyamin Ben Eliazer, he believes that the Israeli right did not understand the speech, which seems in the short run to support its point of view,  but in the longer run is seeking to present concessions that are like a disaster to the right.
Yesterday, the American administration continued yesterday its efforts to topple Palestinian Leader, Yasser Arafat, and urged the Palestinians to refrain from electing him in the elections scheduled early next year, because that would endanger the possibilities of the establishment of a Palestinian state.

The same official stressed that "there is no possible doubt on the cooperation between Hizbullah and Al Qaeda in the logistics field."

The International Criminal Court will not have the authority to pursue individuals who committed crimes before 1st of July 2002.
He said: "All those who believe in democracy, justice and the authority of the law can celebrate (...). This is truly one of the greatest developments in international law since the establishment of the United Nations 57 years ago".
The International Criminal Court, established according to the Rome Statute signed by 139 countries and ratified by 47, among them all the European countries, allows the pursuit of individuals - not countries - accused of genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity, before a permanent international judicial panel.
I do not believe people at this stage are ready to back down from the Court."
British Minister of International Development Claire Short stressed that the American decision ruins the attempts to build a more just world.

Called on the State to Provide Work for Workers; Sfeir Sorry that Los Angeles Resolutions Were Given More Weight Than They Can Handle
We are speaking today about the duty of averting strikes, respecting the dignity of humans, and the duty of providing weekly rest. If that is available, the earth will rest, and you can start hymns, says the Prophet Isaiah."
Working, to workers, is a means of living for which there is no other means, and it is the duty of the government to provide them with this means so that they are able to preserve their dignity as creature in the image and form of God. It is the joint duty of the state and them, to preserve the holy quality of the Lord's day, for them to rest and perform the duty of obeying God, undertake social duties towards companions, especially the poor and the sick, and the unfortunate, and to encourage them to face the hardship befallen them, in the spirit of belief in God and surrendering to His will.

Desperation belts that the late national leader Kamal Junblat warned and cautioned about since the early seventies, and before that, are what constitute the current challenges for you and us.
The positions of Walid Junblat emerge from this conviction and he will continue to expand the circle of dialogue, dialogue with Syria to entrench relations or what could distort them, and dialogue with the regime and with the President of the Republic, after extensive crises you all remember, so that harmony can return and so that they are employed not in the service of renewal or extension, or political gain, but in the service of Lebanese harmony and national commitment in Lebanon.
Lebanese officials believed that a call for an international Quartet meeting tomorrow in London to discuss the ideas presented by American President, George W. Bush, in his speech last Monday to settle the conflict in the Middle East, is American recognition; even if the meeting is at the representatives level, that the committee is still present, although Bush did not refer to it in his speech, and that the United States still considers itself a member in the committee that also includes Russia, the European Union and the Secretary General of the United Nations.
They said that the basic point that will be discussed tomorrow in the British capitol is the convention of the international conference as soon as possible, according to what was decided at the Seville Summit of the European Union leaders.
They were surprised at Boucher ignoring the Arab support Bush's speech received from Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Jordan, while mentioning notes on it and only referring to the fact that Bush received wide support from Europe and the Middle East, without naming the supporting or non-supporting Arab countries, like Lebanon and Syria, despite the call of the Jordanian King Abdullah II for the necessity of allowing them to participate in the peace efforts so that peace is comprehensive.

But the restriction of the Party's activity in the farmlands area and the limiting of its threats against Israel to the bombing of settlements and cities with long range missiles that the Party obtained from Iran after the withdrawal, with words, made the situation on the northern borders within a new "status quo" based on one or two operations undertaken by the Party against concentrated and controlled bombing of the Party's positions that could have been evacuated, which does not usually result in the fall of victims by the two sides.
All Israeli journalism reports in this regard can be entered within this frame, the last of which is the report published by the "Washington Post" yesterday and passed on by newspapers in Israel on the presence of close cooperation between the Party and "Al Qaeda".
But, it seems - according to what is published by Israeli newspapers - that there is another movement that enjoys wide support from army command, especially from the new Chief of Staff Moshe Ye'alon.
With the relative calm witnessed by the Palestinian front at a time when it seems the Palestinian situation entered the unawareness stage, the fears on Lebanon increase in light of the worrying indications and the Israeli campaigns on the armed presence of "Hizbollah" in the south.

The fourth session of the Social Development Committee at ESCWA (United Nations Economic and Social Committee for West Asia) will be convened next Wednesday, inaugurated by Minister of Social Affairs Dr. Assad Diab, with the guardians of the social development policies in the Arab region attending. The session's business will continue until Friday.
It is expected that representatives of member countries (Jordan, UAE, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Kuwait, Lebanon, Egypt and Yemen) will present interjections in which they refer to the most important developments, achievements, procedures, measures and obstacles that took place on the national level in the field of social development, within the framework of comprehensive, multi-dimensional national reports.
It must be pointed out here that the Social Development Committee was established by an ESCWA resolution on May 31, 1994.  The Economic and Social Council at the United Nations approved it on July 26, 1994.
The Director General of the Roads and Buildings at the Ministry of Public Works Fadi Nammar toured the roads of Baalbak city that need rehabilitation, paving and building, accompanied by Head of the Municipality Ghaleb Yaghi, and engineers.
- Reconstruction of the existing roads network, which is one of the important vital matters to prevent the occurrence of additional erosions in the network, and raise them to an appropriate international level from the service aspect.
This study is based on renewing the area division of the Lebanese territories and representing the work of the roads network in a computer model which is able to guarantee connection between transportation areas, construct a traffic counting system to count cars and their movement from start to the finish, as well as collect all required data, including identifying recent social-economic variables that will be the basis for identifying new road requirements of the country.
The Administration is also giving special attention to the joint projects between Lebanon and Syria at the transportation level, whether in the area of the construction of roads or railway projects, because of the positive economic and developmental benefits for both sides. But, these works come as a consecration of the reality of cooperation and coordination between the two countries.
In order for the role of this channel not to be limited to the crumbs of local news and for it to regain its information esteem in the face of those who accused it of neutrality, it took advantage of the warriors break that settled on "MTV" after Al-Matn storm and stole the lights from it, anew, through the rebounding political "tremors' of the opposition abroad, starting in Paris with General Michel Awn via the "People's Talk" program and on to coping with the proceedings of the World Maronite Conference in Los Angeles and the daily dispatches from there, to hosting many pillars of the opposition to explain their viewpoints concerning their attitudes, which they unleashed before, during and after the conference. This opened the door wide about the role of the emigrants and the descendants of Lebanese origin.
Between the malady and the remedy (the question raised by Marcel Ghanem), the guests recalled many of the questions about the identity and the concepts of Lebanon and the role of the emigrants. The "People's Talk" program opened an aperture in the wall of the relation between the resident Lebanese and the emigrants, in spite of the minimized image of the political situation in the homeland. It also showed the attachment of the emigrants to their homeland and their following up of the finest daily details through the Lebanese information, which was not saved from the criticism of the participants in the episode, who placed part of the responsibility upon such media, especially the "Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation", whose chest was open despite the criticism directed at it saying that its employees are of one sectarian color, bearing in mind that this is a defect that does not reach this channel only.
The commencements started with the national anthem and the entrance of the graduates, the deans, and the administrative staff, followed by a welcoming speech delivered by the master of ceremonies, the director of public relation at the university, Cynthia Gabriel, then the speech of Father Salim Abbo, in which he said: "Dear Graduates, tomorrow you will leave the university, but it will never leave you.
He concluded, "I invite you to pursue your studies and encourage those in charge of institutes to revise the programs to be in line with the developments of the age and what they impose in the way of moral respect (...) I congratulate your families and thank your professors and all the workers, who followed up your education throughout the years of study. I wish, for patriotic reasons, that you practice your careers in Lebanon and not abroad."
The Ministry of Public Health, the National Fund for Social Security and the Cooperative of State Employees constitute a real triangle that looks, to the greatest degree, like the Bermuda Triangle.
When I see you, I become certain that Lebanon can regain its position in the Middle East and become one of the pioneers in the medical sector.
In conclusion, Yara Ruhayyem of the Faculty of Pharmacy delivered a speech on behalf of all the graduates, in which she praised "the freedom of the individual, which coincides with what we have received on the campus of the Jesuit University, including balancing between study, scientific preparation, and maturity in seeking knowledge and facing life ... We shall not forget the help of the administrative staff, the professors and our families, who have provided us with the spiritual support in order to get where we are."

The Roman Catholic Bishop of Tripoli, George Riyashi, heading a delegation from the North, accepted the invitation of Mrs. Randa Berri to visit the South.

This falls under the responsibility of all citizens from the South over the country."
After touring the cave and its surroundings, Scholar Al-Amin welcomed the visiting delegation emphasizing that "Lebanon remains the home of Islamic-Christian coexistence, and that Qana is reiterating today its commitment to the divine messages that were found to serve man."
The delegation then visited Al-Shaqeef Castle in Al-Nabatiyya and looked at its ruins and touristic sites, as well as the consequences of the Israeli aggression during the occupation.
The students' parents then enjoyed watching their children performing the roles of different professions and crafts in the community: The physician in his traditional uniform, the fireman, the policeman, the sailor, the baker, the cook, the janitor, the circus clown and the musical bands.
After a tour of the exhibition, the students presented an artistic variety show, which included expressionistic dances, varied singing dialogues, vocal sketches, and the playing of musical instruments. The finale was the traditional Akkari debkeh.
* Under the patronage of the Head of the Educational Northern Region Fawzi Nimeh, the official school of Kosba for girls opened its artistic exhibition in the presence of a number of interested people and supporters.

The ceremony ended with a speech by the Minister of Health, delivered by Dr. Waleed Ammar, in which he said: "The health sector in Lebanon is distinguished by its dependence upon the private sector in providing services. The Ministry of Health covers costly hospitalization eases and medicines with the aim of minimizing the financial burden incurred by citizens who are not subscribing to any other insurance body.

Talk About Bombing Bushehr Reactor "Purely Hypothetical"; Moscow Demands from Washington Tangible Evidence on Tehran's Seeking to Develop Nuclear Weapons
The independent Russian "Interfax" Agency reported them as saying that Russia has "advanced relations with Iran based on mutual interest, and it will continue that".
Washington expressed its concern Monday on a new cooperation program between Moscow and Tehran that was revealed last Friday, which provides for building two additional reactors at the Bushehr Nuclear Station in southern Iran by the year 2012, and building a new station that includes two reactors in Al Ahwaz in the west.

Prison for Former Minister and 30 People in Biggest Corruption Scandal in Egypt; "Muslim Brothers"
In the year 2001, the Court of Cassation cancelled the verdicts issued in June 2000 to imprison the defendants from one to 15 years.

Observers said that there is no evidence yet that the accounts of "America On Line Time Warner" are inaccurate, but the fears of an expansion in the investigations led to a decrease in the value of its stock.
The Crime that Reveals the Defect
It is our belief that the future has many surprises in store for us in this file.
Of course there are exaggerations in showing the feelings of repression of Christians, but the policies followed in the country do not contribute to weakening them, but increasing them, despite the fact that the social, economic and political oppression is a reality for all Lebanese without exception.
And so the current barricades between the Lebanese do not offer anything but more mortgaging to local organized looting, following the outside which rules in actuality, the mutual readiness to take advantage of coexistence, scientific and cultural shallowness, and the pathetic "conviction" with living in the shadow of the general state of general deterioration on all levels.

The American presence on the cellular line was sudden and exciting for more than one reason: First, because it called strongly for approving the privatization process because it is "a main part of the reforms" that the World Bank and funding institutions are calling for. Second, because it is related to the position of the donor countries and "Paris 2". Third, because he stressed the desire of the American companies to participate in the cellular sector, which is a surprising matter that conflicts with the recession, faced by these companies in America. Fourth, because it did not link the presidential conflict with the technical matters only, but with the political matters, meaning the eternal conflict between Lahoud and Hariri.
The explosion that occurred inside the cafeteria of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem captured the interest of the Israeli newspapers yesterday.
In the newspaper's opinion, "it was difficult for the Palestinian organization in the past six months and during the implementation of the Israeli army military operation to undertake new attacks. The heavy presence of Israeli troops on the West Bank areas inside the cities and around them, in addition to the siege, made the movement of "saboteurs" very difficult.
On the Lebanese front, the "Maariv" newspaper quoted yesterday a senior Israeli source as saying that extremely important developments effected the communications taking place between Israel and "Hizbollah" with regard to solving the problem of Israeli prisoners Alehanan Tananboim and the three soldiers imprisoned by the Party.
Among the striking comments published by "Haartz" yesterday was the article written by reserve Brigadier General Aharon Le Bern who in the past was one of the officials in the military intelligence department, and he is working today in the field of strategic research.
Iran patronized a strategic arm for it in Lebanon, which is "Hizbollah", the terrorist organization responsible for killing hundreds of soldiers and American citizens in Lebanon and outside it, which constitutes an unlimited danger to the area and the West.
It is possible to subjugate "Hizbollah" in various ways.
8 Killed, 5 Injured at Teachers' Fund Center and Financial Explanations of the Crime; Who protects the People from Unrestrained Weapons?

In the court, Ahmad Mansour said he executed the crime willfully "and I was not pushed by anyone to do it".

We notice with amazement the repeated attempts by Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri to impose a status quo:
Experience has proven in Lebanon, like abroad, that economic stability is certainly related to maintaining the monitoring ability of the state, providing the conditions for correct competition and expanding the base of contributors, and that privatization is not turned into a monopoly transaction that endangers the interests of the people, economic stability and even the state's sovereignty over public services.
What is strange is that the complaint, filed by the Minister of Communications to the Financial General Prosecution through the Cases Commission at the Ministry of Justice over a month ago, is attached to the Audit Bureau report. This complaint has not reached the Financial General Prosecution yet.
Baqardoni: We Agree with Al Qurneh on the Objectives and Disagree on Internal charging and Hostility to Syria
Baqardoni directed his talk to the Brigades saying "You are the real children of the founder and the honest children of the institution.
First: Demand the Minister of Interior to take measures to prevent the use of the name "brigades" and all that is derived from it, or similar to it, or taken from it, and effecting the severest punishment against violators, in accordance with the memo presented to him on 7/16/2002.
We respect the other, and we listen to him and interact with him.
From the position of dialogue and resolution we extend an open hand to the opposition, especially at the "Qurnet Shahwan Meeting", a strong hand to the rule and the government.
We offered martyr after martyr, the last of whom was our comrade Tony Ba'kaloony; we offered absentee after absentee, the last of whom was our comrade Boutrus Khould.
As for the performance of the government it has not provided national interests, nor balance in representation or balanced development.
Calls for Diplomatic and Information Movement; Israel Marketing Itself in Washington as "Policeman" in the Region to Fight Terrorism
He suggested that Bush has started to become convinced of the proposal which is the focus of discussions in the American administration. There are supporters, rejecters and there are others who are reserved, in view of its negative reflections on the Arab states. They said, when probed unofficially for their reactions, that they strongly reject charging Israel with such a mission, at a time when it is still in serious military conflict with the Palestinians.
While anything contrary to that reflects on opening the door wide to wider confrontations whose results no one can predict.
He hinted that an American test of this proposal is currently taking place with the Palestinians, with evidence that the killing of civilians with American made planes is allowed, and so is the economic siege and starving people.
Lebanon celebrates Army Day today, and a central celebration will be held at the Al Fayyadieh Barracks during which officers will graduate.
At the Benoit Barakat Barracks in Tyre, Position Commander Staff Colonel Ismail Hamdan read the "Order of the Day" before a group of officers, then he received holiday well-wishers, and thanked the media for their support of the Lebanese army "that is the fence of the nation and the address of its strength and unity."
In the north, a celebration was held at the northern military regional command in the Bahjat Ghanem Barracks headed by Regional Command Brigadier Ramzi Abu Hamzeh representing Major General Suleiman. Governor of the North Nasif Qalloush, the Mufti of Tripoli and the North Taha Al Sabunji, Bishops Bolus Bandali, Yohanna Fouad Al Hajj and Francis Al Beisari, Tripoli Shari'ah Judge Sheikh Malik Al Sha'ar, Appeals District Attorney in the North Judge Rimon Oweidat, President of the Intelligence Department in the Syrian forces working in the North Brigadier Mohammad Khallouf, Tripoli Mayor Samir Sha'rani and officers participated in it.
The "National Islamic Forum" declared that it will conduct the necessary communications with the Islamic groups "to explain the national goals of the Forum and the steps planned to be taken to enhance the internal front, on the basis of considering this initiative a first step towards a comprehensive national forum that fortifies the national front in confronting the waves of extremism that threaten the security and stability of the country."
At the end of the meeting, the Secretary General of the Forum Al Mufti Al Sabunji read the following resolutions:
The Forum would like to remind all on this occasion that coincides with the anniversary of the establishment of the brotherly Syrian army as well, of the current cooperation experience between the two brotherly armies and the sacrifices of the brotherly Syrian forces in order to deepen the basis of security and stability in the Lebanese territories in implementation of the initiative of the late President Hafiz Al Assad.
After the meeting Al Sabunji was asked for his comment on the member of the "Qurnet Shahwan Meeting" member Samir Franjieh saying that the members of the "Islamic Assembly" are moved by Syria. He answered: "We are moved by our feelings of nationalism, Arab Identity and morals, and we ask Samir Franjieh who moves him internally and externally?"
This is completely rejected; it is even rejected in the Al Ta'if agreement that established the new constitution.
We are against any kind of sectarian talk and extend our hands to all parties for dialogue.
* Deputy George Nijm: "We hope that the hopes of the Lebanese will be accomplished with the liberation of Shaba'a Farmlands, and the army remains the strong arm for the unity of Lebanon."
The Public Relations Division of the Internal Security Forces distributed the following notice: "In addendum to our previous notice regarding taking traffic measures on the occasion of Army Day that will be held at the Shukri Ghanem Barracks - Al Fayyadieh on the morning of Thursday 1/8/2002, and due to the possibility of the occurrence of traffic jams on the following roads: Al Hadath - Gallery Sama'an Road, Gallery Sama'an - Chevrolet, Jisr Al Basha - Al Sayyad - Ba'abda Crossroads, Mar Mikhail - Gallery Sama'an, Ba'abda Crossroads - Gallery Sama'an,
Israeli military air force jets flew yesterday over the southern skies and were confronted with resistance anti-aircraft missiles.
While edges of the Bastra farm, Shanouh, "Bawwabet Hassan" and Birket Bi'tha'il were subjected to Israeli heavy artillery rounds.
When Sukarno assumed the rule in Indonesia, he wanted his country to be in the ranks of the advanced countries. He knew that the nature of democratic system is the reason of the advancement of these countries, and the constituents of this system are based on multiple parties and free competition to reach power and work on achieving the wishes of the people.
After the passing of several years in this state, chaos spread, damage increased, a climate of terror prevailed and the country reached the brink of a civil war. So Suhartu executed a military coup to stop the tribal conflict and bring back stability to the country.
It is said that the Lebanese government made a grave mistake when it allowed party members to enter public office.
The Imam wanted the Movement to be a democratic movement in action and practice, not a movement of an individual and reconciliation; for the attendees not to believe that the institution is the image of the president and who the president wants; that the movement is from him, for him, and to him, and all he wants is obedience to feel that everyone without him; and that the leader knows everything and is able in his party to do everything.
And so it was.
The tragedy of remaining silent towards the sectarian practice that is tearing up the body of the homeland.
Inauguration of Joint Halaba-Tripoli Transport Line; Miqati and Deputies in Ukkar, Discuss Area's Developmental Needs.

First, the continuing coordination between Lebanon and fellow country Syria via its representative on the Security Council (Ambassador Mikhail Wahbah), who passed on to the Council some of our clarifications and observations, many of which were accepted.
He added, "Resolution 1428 clarifies the impression left by the report of the United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Anan, in which some saw many negative points.
"1. The first paragraph adopted what was included in the report by the Secretary-General, in particular the recommendation for an extension.
4. It expressed its strong concern at the dangerous (Israeli) air, sea and land breaches and violations of the withdrawal line.
7. It referred to the importance of United Nations force completing its third mission for restoring international peace and security in the region.
The Ministry noted that, during the period between the report and the passing of the resolution, Israel, by means of its representative to the international organization, determined to direct charges and slander at Lebanon, the resistance in particular, as part of a clear attempt to exploit this interim period and influence the decision of the Council.
The Director of International Organizations at the Ministry, Ambassador Antoine Shadid received Chinese Ambassador Liu Zhentang on the occasion of the latter's final transfer from Beirut.
The delegation congratulated the Commander of the Syrian Forces operating in Lebanon, Major General Ahmad Ali, on the occasion.
He saluted the Lebanese and Syrian Presidents Emil Lahud and Bashar Al-Asad and the command of the two armies, calling for "a strengthening of fraternal ties and links imposed by the interests of the two fraternal countries".
2. Return of Palestinian refugees to their homes in Palestine.
Governor of the North Nasif Qalush then handed Brigadier Abu Hamzah and Colonel Nabil Hashimah two commemorative shields in recognition of the role of the command of the two armies.
What concerns His Eminence concerns us all, namely that all Lebanese should be Lebanese citizens in prosperity and affluence, enjoying social security and stability, that Lebanon should return to its brilliance and magnificence, that the tourist industry in Lebanon should be a distinguished industry, one appropriate to Lebanon and the Lebanese, and that the economic cycle should progress in line with the needs of us all, citizens and officials."
The number of tourists coming to Lebanon is increasing every year. Last year saw an increase of about 15% on the previous year and we expect this year's increase to be in the region of 20% above last year."
Did he discuss with Archbishop Awdah the matter of the cell phone?
The "Charter and Constitution Forum" held its meeting yesterday morning on the occasion of Army Day. It addressed congratulations to "the organization of sacrifice, honor and loyalty, hoping that it will continue as a model for the unity of the nation and undertake its natural functions without obstacle or double standards, over all Lebanon's territory".
The open struggle over the so-called privatization, alongside the attacks, insults and slander that accompany it, provides an ugly picture of the present authority, amid the barricades of confrontation at the heart of the government and in the chamber, the palaces, government offices and headquarters. The reports of mediations, intercessions and interventions, and the odor of brokerage, shares, bank deposits, fantastic profit figures, both declared and undeclared, and the program of theft from public funds at a time of frightening debt, deafens the ears and blocks the nose.
Lebanon is progressing haphazardly in critical political, security, social and economic crises. It needs a noble legitimate authority, one that is qualified to bear the responsibility of government. Do the present officials realize the harm they are inflicting on their nation?
The largest was the fire that swept through the fruit-bearing pine forests in the town of Qaituli (Jazin), which broke out last Tuesday.
This was attended by Deputies George Najm and Antoine Khuri, representing the office of the Speaker of the Chamber of the Deputies; Deputy Samir Azar, the district head of Jazin Nabih Hamud; the head of the Maronite diocese of Sidon, Archbishop Tanius Al-Khuri; the head of the Catholic Media Center, Father Abduh Buksam; and the Commander of the South Regional Area.

But I advise citizens not to change their car engines before the law determining the internationally approved specifications is promulgated", indicating that this would happen soon.
In 1976 the uprising of the "Arab Lebanese Army", under the command of Captain Ahmad Al-Khatib, set out from them, which resulted in the military base there being moved to the Marjaiyun barracks.
Given this reality, a serious plan must be drawn up by the Ministry of Public Works, or any other official organization, to refurbish the buildings in view of the importance of this work on more than one level, bearing in mind that, in light of the deteriorating financial situation of the exchequer, it will save tens of millions of lira as an alternative to the buildings presently occupied by official organizations, and reduce the burden on the citizen, who spends his day moving from one building to another to complete his business.

What distinguishes this site is that its walls were painted in green, which has protected it from the air and water. The owners have gifted it to the endowment of the Sayyidah Mashmushah Monastery in Jazin.
The letter sent to me by Dr Nadiyah Mustafa, Professor of Political Sciences at the Faculty of Economics and Political Sciences and Director of the Dialogue Between Civilizations Program, which includes critical observations on the draft letter of Egyptian intellectuals that I drafted, holds broad hopes for the possibility of formulating a national consensus between all Arab political currents in diagnosing the present situation and conceptualizing the potential alternatives to confront these challenges.

- A hundred years of Zionism.
* How do you describe the operation to assassinate Sheikh Salah Shahadah, which resulted in the deaths of a large number of Palestinian civilians?
- We, in the political apparatus, cannot decide the nature of the response. This is the responsibility of the military wing of the Movement, which will describe where, when and how the response will be made to the Zionist attacks.
In 1961 the "Al-Jaridah" newspaper published surveys about "sectarianism", in which I did not find a clear answer.
This is the transcript of the interview:
* How will "Hamas" respond to this massacre and what will be the nature of the response?
- We said that if the enemy is prepared to stop the aggression against the Palestinian people, withdraw from the Palestinian towns that the Israeli army has reoccupied, stop the assassinations and attacks on Palestinian civilians, end the policy of demolishing homes and cutting down trees, and free all Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli prisons, then in this instance we will study the possibility of stopping martyrdom operations.
No, no contacts have taken place between Saudi Arabia and us.
- No, there have been no contacts between the Palestinian Authority and us in this respect.
America is always biased towards Israel and cannot serve our cause.
For it defends the honor of the Arab nation, and the ambitions of the enemy do not stop at the borders of Palestine, but aim to gain control over all the nation's capacities.
The scene of American preparations to change the conditions in Iraq is perplexing.
No two officials or leaders meet without the position on the American decision on Iraq being present.
On the international front the United States has won no one over to its side beyond British support, which, in turn, faces domestic difficulties.
So does the United States possess such proof?
How can Washington jump over all these diplomatic barriers at the appropriate time, the puzzle that the American President continues to refuse to solve?
If we recall the time taken to mobilize the American forces in the Gulf in preparation to strike Iraq in 1991, we can understand the meaning of the time needed to assemble 250 thousand American soldiers.
The plans leaked recently about starting with Baghdad first, recalls, with the exception of "Gaza and Jericho First", the attempt of former American President Jimmy Carter to intervene in Iran to save the American hostages, which ended in the disaster that is well known.
Thus, what is required is an American consensus, but on what plans put forward can such a consensus be obtained?
It is a failure that may be decisive for a President who needs something to compensate for the domestic chaos that has begun to sweep the American interior with the return of the Republicans to government.
Following a welcome speech by Mrs. Mubaiyad, Minister Al-Sinyurah gave a speech in which he praised "the efforts of Dr Buasiri and his experience, given that he has occupied various posts, the most prominent of which was Director of the Banks Oversight Committee for two consecutive terms".
Now we have the modern and sophisticated mechanisms and lines in the management of money, which reassure the states and organizations with whom Lebanon deals. These new mechanisms have been necessitated by the massive developments and major changes that have taken place and continue to take place in the ways of dealing with financial, banking and economic instruments."
If the "Coccyx" of the title symbols in her book those who are subservient in society, upstarts and the irksome, the story focuses more on close relationships and family and social relations.
His pictures contain some dramatic atmospheres. It was as if he knew what the innocent among his people would suffer, they who continue to suffer and pay the price in blood.

SS is the title of his disc, and a title for his spirit, noble art and the behavior of an artist who has perfected the mix between mechanical engineering and music as he likes it: Blues and Jazz.

The second research is "Administrative and Financial Corruption: Causes, Results and Methods of Treatment" by Yusif Khalifah Al-Yusif. It deals with the topic of administrative and financial corruption and its effect on economic development, linking theoretical analysis with the practical lessons learned from the experiences of industrial and developing countries. The research is divided into three sections: the first presents some examples of administrative and financial corruption and analyses the reasons for its spread; the second discusses the implications of financial and administrative corruption on the progress of development in Third World states; and the third part proposes methods for tackling this administrative corruption.
The results of the research show that the extension of social relations is linked to a reduction in blood pressure rates.

Sergio Bukhaazi takes us back to the 1960s by way of the "Blues". His playing is soft, compliant, tinted with compassion.
The disc includes eight songs as a pledge of loyalty to all who walked with him on his mission.

From the beginning he joined the jazz group with Isa Gharib, Hani, Fadi, Rami, Alan, Philip and Steve, to the point where the instruments called them to brotherhood and friendship.

But what Jabir did say about the incident seems to have been derived from the topic for which he had been invited: economic anxieties and the cell phone issue, etc.
Of course, Jabir does not mean to justify the crime in terms of poverty, thereby allowing every poor person in Lebanon and the world to kill.
Mansur committed his crime armed to his teeth.
The statement made by Minister of Justice Samir Al-Jisr when he came to the place of the crime raises a number of questions. He said, "This is an exceptional incident. Security arrangements cannot be made for every individual."

Recently, they had begun to put pressure on me to return the money that I had borrowed or they would deduct it from my compensation. I have children and I have no money left. My circumstances are wretched. I bought a car but was forced to sell it at a lower price.
In response to a question, they answered: "The person who opened fire does not appear to suffer from a nervous disorder. In fact, he appeared to be a normal person with firm nerves. He confessed simply and said: I determined to kill them. I have nothing to hide. No one knew that I would commit this crime because I planned it and carried it out on my own.
They explained that the sum borrowed by the accused was about 12 thousand American dollars of what is considered to be public money. The two floors occupied come under the official administration.

"And History Remains Open"; Nagib Al-Baini.
The author has recorded in it the lives of people who traveled through history, who left their clear imprint on it, who made events and changed affairs, who were its true preachers.
The book sheds light on twenty distinguished personalities who played a role in political life and had a major influence on many of the international events in their and other countries.
He says that history actually ended with the collapse of Soviet communism and the victory of Western liberalism or capitalism.
Here, another question is raised: How did the writer choose these twenty and come to view them as the most influential and powerful figures of the twentieth century, specifically in the political arena?
From this basis, the writer tries to find the "key" to the personality of the most influential people in the political arena in the twentieth century.
The third and final measure is that of the prevailing circumstance, the importance of which lies in its relationship with the way the hero dealt with it, in that by its interaction with the factors of personality, it results in the achievement in its final form, by which it appears historically.

It does not respect the resolutions of the United Nations (...) Consequently the European Union says that the Iraqi regime must allow the return of weapons inspectors immediately, in order to verify whether there are Weapons of Mass Destruction or not."
Muller said, "No one asked to mount a war against Iraq.
German Foreign Minister Yoshka Fischer was the strongest opponent against sending a warning to Saddam, bearing in mind that it is his country that appears to have the greatest determination within the European Union against the idea of American military intervention in Iraq.
He said, "Any solution must take place within the framework of the Security Council."
He said, "Everyone agrees that if the inspectors return and are able to complete their mission in full, the risks presented by Iraq will be reduced and the need for a military attack will have diminished."
The new academic year began with the Palestinian Intifada that broke out on 28 September 2000 entering its third year. The pupils have been a key factor in it.
He noted, "During the last two years, the severity of Israeli violations against the educational family in the Bank and Strip has increased considerably. 239 male and female pupils have been martyred, 7 schools have been closed by Israeli military orders and education disrupted in 850 other schools. 197 schools and three Educational Directorates have been shelled and raided and three schools converted into military barracks in Hebron. 25 schools were occupied during the Israeli invasions and converted to detention centers. This is in addition to the detention of 166 pupils and 75 teachers in the Bank and Strip."
The impact of the Israeli siege is not limited to the progress of the teaching process, but also effects that economic situation and the income of Palestinian families, for whom the provision of school requirements has become very difficult in light of the destruction inflicted on the national economy as a result of the policy of the Israeli army to close and encircle different Palestinian towns, villages and camps.
The Day We Faint! Rajih Khuri.
Put simply, because political agreement has allowed the draft budget to be published early.
In any case, the discussion was not limited to "thanks and praise", but swiftly turned to "complaints and anger", especially when the conversation turned to the unbelievable state in which the public sector finds itself, and which, in addition to the figures for serving the public debt, constitutes the millstone grinding the public finances and consuming the major part of the budget.
In this context, Adnan Qassar was explicit when he said, "A country laboring under debts must cut its expenditure, not pay salaries that are unprecedented in the region to senior officials and employees, not to mention paying salaries to employees who do not work.
We do not think that an affirmation of the government's incapacity to reform the areas of wastage is easily digested when we are faced with a budget that puts its fingers deep into the worn and threadbare pockets of the poor.
Diana on Her Fifth Anniversary: A Force for Change in British Society; Force for Change.
Bouquets of flowers were laid behind the barriers surrounding the flame, which resembles the Statue of Liberty.
Five years earlier, the Royal Family was experiencing one of its greatest crises since the Second World War.
At the time some questioned the future of the Windsor family, with 72% of Britains in an opinion poll believing that the Queen had lost touch with the people, whilst only 42% wanted her to remain Queen until the day of her death.
Shortly afterwards he visited those injured in a train crash in hospital.

It would have perhaps been easy to have forgotten the past and begun a new life, but she returned to Afghanistan repeatedly to hear the whining of the children, to see the effects of hunger and the suppression in the eyes of the women...and also to set up a women's magazine (Nahar), which, according to Hashimi, is the first to tackle "The living affairs and daily lives of people in Afghanistan".

He reminded them, "A betrayal of Syria is a betrayal of Lebanon."
Yesterday morning Gemayel visited Shalita in the town of Kafr Ubaida to congratulate him on his release from prison. He believed that his detention for this period without trial "was the best example of what we complain of in terms of the judiciary in Lebanon, irrespective of the issue for which he was detained.
Elsewhere, in an interview with the Kuwaiti "Al-Rai Al-Am" newspaper published today, Gemayel revealed that his "life is not safe since he returned to Lebanon two years ago". He noted, "There are those trying to harm me whether politically or physically."
He doubted that the dialogue would lead to the results desired, asking, "How can there be a sound dialogue when the State allows some of its agencies to act haphazardly, without monitoring, being called to account or accountability.
He explained, "His absence from the "Al-Qarnat" delegation when it met with President Lahud was for personal reasons.
He mentioned that as a Deputy and President of the Republic "I met deceased President Hafiz Al-Asad on more than twenty occasions. My experience enables me to understand the Syrian mentality and I fully understand Lebanon's interest in a way that serves the interest of joint relations." He said, "I have not asked for a date to visit Syria.
Gemayel expressed his belief that "Walid Bek Junabalat must one day return to the document that we signed together in Al-Mukhatarah, following my return to Lebanon because the contents thereof are not limited to circumstantial matters but deal with the fundaments."
The birth took place in the clinic of the Chamber of Deputies at the hand of the physician who has remained. The father is Lebanon, the mother Mrs. In Defiance of Them. The mother and child are well and in good health, so far.
And because the youths disagreed from the start as to who should head their first "get together", they retreated and agreed to make the first one to see this world their leader given that he is the eldest. From the evidence we can also conclude that there was a disagreement over the place of birth, between a five star hotel or a freebee, at the expense of the Council's hospital and clinics. But so that they don't slip up, because whoever does will end up paying the bill for the birth, they decided that the bill for seeing the light should be paid by those who have neither light nor electricity.
Calming Diplomatic Contacts With Beirut Show No Fear of Escalation; Written by Khalil Falihan.
This time, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon did not comment on the Al-Samaqah and Ruwaisah Al-Ilm operation. Minister of Defense Benyamin Ben Eliazer and Chief of Staff General Moshe Ya'alon made the threat and warning to Lebanon, Syria and Iran at the same time.
They believed that Ben Eliazer had tried in this meeting to exploit Hizbollah's recent attack and use it to expand Israeli attacks against Lebanon and Syria at a time suiting the Hebrew State, and not in response to last Thursday's attack specifically.
They mentioned that the Israeli threat, published by the Israeli media, which Ben Eliazer charged Satterfield to communicate to both Syria and Lebanon, was no more than "saber-rattling" because the Lebanese diplomats and officials who know Satterfield well, who had direct links with him, say that the American diplomat has told them on more than one occasion, following each incident of military tension in the south, whilst conducting his missions in Lebanon, that his country did not communicate military warnings to any state, with all that this implies, because that is not its mission; it points out the danger of the situation and calls for the exercise of self-control.
Qaisar Muawwad Hosts Politicians in Ahdan: Lahud's and Consultative Forum Positive.
A number of security leaders, northern figures and media figures also attended.

Let us be clear. If the taxes are to come from the pockets of the poor, then this is unreasonable because the scope of taxes should be broadened to incorporate those with large incomes.
But in light of the wage rates present in Lebanon, there are employees who work two jobs and this will "cut off their livelihood".
There follows the text of the ruling:
And whereas the applicant has had imposed on him a punishment of fifteen months imprisonment as a result of the ruling for which an explanation is sought, and this punishment does not form part of the context specified in the aforementioned Article 63,  does not lead to civil removal in any form, and does not give rise to any of the consequences set out in Article 49 of the said Law.

Minister of Public Works and Transport Najib Miqati stated that Tripoli's decision "will be preferential to no one". He expressed his understanding "of a forum of interests and the intrusion of political cover in finance and authority".
Miqati then gave a speech, in which he said, "Since we took on the responsibilities of the Ministry of Works and Transport, before we entered the Chamber battleground, we have heard talk and many accusations and rumors.
Today, however, we are facing a new stage, one in which the attempts to claim an exclusive monopoly over the city's decision are repeated. We say to them that Tripoli's decision will be the exclusive monopoly of no one(...).
Let the competitors compete, for competition is natural in the service of the interests of the city."
Al-Sabunji (...) criticized "the sectarian ideas that abuse stability (...) and manipulate the gains achieved by the people in respect of constitutional reforms (...)."
There is no dialogue for the reconstitution of the nation.
Dialogue should be with oneself, with the self, in order to escape delusions, falsehoods, malice, provocation, aggravation, seclusion and isolation (...)."
The occasion was attended by his wife, Mrs. Nura, Ministers Fuad Al-Saad and Marwan Hamadah, Deputies Nimah Tamah, George Dib Nimah and Nabil Al-Bustani, and a large number of university officials and diplomats.

Minister of Defense Khalil Al-Harawi said in his statement yesterday that last Friday's meeting between President of the Republic Emil Lahud and the "Deputies Consultative Forum" resulted in a "confirmation of the desire to engage in dialogue with all political forces within the framework of the Al-Taif Accord and speed up abolishment of political sectarianism, implementation of decentralized administration and formulation of an elections law, with which all political forces can feel at ease".
Zaitar expressed his belief that the Consultative Forum "could be the first step in a thousand miles".
He confirmed, "Attempts made to abuse the subsistence of the citizen will not be accepted by anyone." He noted that the citizen could no longer bear additional taxes because the deficit in the budget and debt was not his responsibility.
At the opening Minister of Justice Samir Al-Jisr, representing the Prime Minister, the Secretary-General of the Union of Arab Rights Specialists, former Iraqi Justice Minister Shabib Al-Maliki, and member of the Permanent Office of the Union and President of the "Arab National Forum" Muhammad Al-Majdhub will speak.

The Jazin area is the foremost in the Middle East in terms of its woodland resources, which include both fruit-bearing and wild trees, making it a green oasis, rich in trees and plants, an enjoyable sight and a priceless national treasure.
The losses to the woodland resources of Jazin during the occupation are estimated at 30%, mostly from the fruit bearing air pine trees, not to mention the oaks and the Malool, which were hundreds of years old.
It is noted that fires used to begin in forests parallel to private land, whose owners had determined to clear their land by burning the grass and chaff. The increase in temperature in the summer seasons and strong winds have also helped to expand the area subject to fires.
This fire covered over 150 dunums of pine forest and consumed about five thousand pine trees over an area of about five hundred thousand square meters of territory under the authority of Qituli municipality.
As we wait, the fire continues to consume the vegetation and the ground.
Year of publication: 2002.
This national treasure suffered greatly during the occupation, the shells from which started fires in the mountains, fields and plains. To date it continues to suffer a more deadly enemy, however, represented in the fires that consume the earth and desiccate its flora.
As an example of this, Mt. "Aburkarb", which overlooks the village of Armati from the north, which held thick forests of oaks and wild pines, was completely burnt. "Khallat Khazin" was also severely damaged, with about six thousand dunums being burnt from a total of ten thousand.
Sources confirm that the fires in the last three years have focused on the forests of Ariyah, Bahnin, Malikh, Al-Aishiyah, Mt Safi and the areas of Basaliyya, Birtai and Rimat, most of which are oak and wild and air pines.
Among the most obvious reasons for the fires are the impossibility of clearing the forests from branches and dry grasses which help spread the fire and the fact that the Ministry of Agriculture will not allow the forests to be cut down and agricultural roads built in them to facilitate the movement of fire engines to the site of fires.

Publicly, Ankara opposes any war against neighboring Iraq, fearing the damage this war could do to the economy, which is facing difficulties, and the danger of transferring any resource of the Kurds to Turkish territory.
Gurel said, "We expressed all our fears (...) and they are now aware of them."
The American Embassy in Turkey stressed that there was no connection in the timing of the two visits. Aziz's visit comes as part of Iraqi diplomatic moves on the Arab and international front to confront the American threats. It comes 24 hours after a similar visit by Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri Al-Hadithi to Tehran.

Forces loyal to the Government in the east of the country took control of a key base of one of the leaders of the Badsh Khan Zadran group following violent clashes lasting 24 hours in which more than 10 people died.
Following Qarzai's return to Kabul, a spokesman for the Afghan President, Tayyib Jawwad, said that the tour, which included Saudi Arabia and the Emirates, was "very successful".
The Afghan President told the Qatari "Aljazeera" channel, "The problems and explosions are certainly the work of terrorists who do not want Afghanistan to live in peace."
Meanwhile, Commander Diya Al-Din, one of the prominent war leaders loyal to Qarzai in the region of Baktia announced that infantry supported by heavy artillery and rockets had at dawn taken control of base under the control of Zadran, near Gardez.
It quoted witnesses who confirmed that Diya Al-Din's forces were in control of the base. But they said that the fighting was continuing five kilometers from the Shakin area.
It now appears that there is a coordinated effort to get rid of Zadran, who has openly opposed Qarzai's authority.

Speaking calmly about the night of Friday, 20 September, after the Israeli attack, he said, "We were surrounded, about 150 security men, in a hall directly opposite the office of President Arafat linked by a suspension bridge, which the Israeli bulldozers began to destroy."
Shamasnah explained, "I was the last to cross the bridge. I felt the bullets penetrating the walls and glass around me. At that point I did not feel that I would get out alive."
Shamasnah, who witnessed the death of his colleague Hamudah, said, "Martyr Muhammad Hamudah, who held the rank of Lieutenant, came down from the upper floor of the hall to the lower floor in order to pray the dawn prayer. As he was coming down the stairs, he noticed that one of his colleagues was standing directly in front of the window and that he was in the line of fire of Israeli snipers in a nearby building (...) Hamudah tried to move his colleague from the window but a bullet fired by an Israeli sniper hit him in the head, killing him immediately."
We thought the building would fall on us if the bulldozers of the occupation continued to dig" after reducing most of the buildings in Al-Muqataah square to rubble (...) "The worst moment was when the bulldozers began to demolish the headquarters of the Governor, which is directly adjacent to the Chairman's Headquarters. At that point, we began to feel that something major would happen."

Iraq requested the samples on the pretext that it needed them for legitimate medical research.
The details were revealed in a report by one of the Congressional committees in 1994 and in a letter sent by the Center for Disease Control and Protection to the Senate in 1995.
He asked the American Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld about this at a hearing of the Armed Forces Committee in the Senate. The latter cast doubts about the information published by the "News Week" magazine in this regard, but he added that he would ask his aides to review the records of the Ministry of Defense and other government organizations to find evidence for the transfer of samples.
The export destination was Baghdad University, which inspectors confirmed was used as a front to obtain the required samples.
It admitted producing 5300 gallons (20,062 liters) of botulinum toxin and placing the material in missile warheads.
The road from Quraitam to the southern district is not wide enough for more mines and ambushes set up by the fervent, the last of which was the tale of the "gap" on the margins of American intervention along the Al-Wazzani "track" as witness.
And ultimately, at least for this stormy phase, it is essential that it be clear both at home and abroad that Lebanon does not want to withdraw from its stance and slogans on the resistance and that "Hizbollah" cannot and should not be allowed to withdraw from its stance and slogans on Lebanon.
Since the story of the "mistimed operation" in the Shabaa Farms, and the subsequent debate about the background of Hong Kong and Hanoi, through to last week, the borders between the State and the resistance have not been proficiently drawn, despite the fact that the interests of both parties require this.
Why?
If such talk holds a signal to the enthusiasm of Nasrallah, which appears much more developed than the message of the traditional "enthusiasts" in the region, who have cloaked their message in velvet since 11 September, Al-Hariri has tried to sketch out a difficult third way between two easy paths within Arab reach.
The Israeli press tried yesterday to shed light on the motives behind Ariel Sharon's current official visit to Russia, especially given that it is taking place in crisis conditions both in respect of the situation in the Palestinian areas and in relation to the American preparations for the attack on Iraq.
He will also ask the Russians to use their influence with Syria, to put the brakes on Hizbollah and pressure the Lebanese government to stop the works to transform the Al-Wazzani source.
The Intifada has put them under great hardship, with the number of Palestinian dead approaching two thousand. There are more than 40 thousand wounded, a large number of whom will remain disabled.
In spite of this, an opinion poll conducted by the Al-Quds Media Institute shows that more than 80% of the Palestinian public supports the continuation of the Intifada."
The Borders of the State...and the Resistance.
It is now time to draw the connecting borders between the State and the resistance using the methods and theories of political repulsion.
Like connected veins, the State embraces the resistance and the resistance firmly establishes the opposition of the State.
His enthusiastic speech about the "Great Satan" and his statement that "our resounding slogan will remain: Death to America" are thus the "foundation columns of the house" for "Hizbollah", which is not only ranked "number 1" on America's list of "terrorism" but has become a target for daily threats, the last of which was pronounced by Richard Armitage, Deputy Secretary of State, who appears to have been behind the pressures brought to bear in Congress, which led to the suspension of aid to Lebanon.
"Israel wants to put the Arabs in confrontation with America. The interests of the Arabs lie in achieving the opposite to this."
The Prime Minister is opposed to confrontation by force because of the imbalance, and also against prostration. He calls for us to enter the existing system, to influence it and not to remain on its margins...but two matters prevent this involvement: unity of stance and clarity of conception. This is the extreme difficulty in Lebanon, and in most Arab states.

During talks held between them in Cairo Egyptian and Syrian Presidents Husni Mubarak and Bashar Al-Asad urged the Security Council to shoulder its responsibilities towards the Palestinian issue and the return of international weapons inspectors to Iraq.
Presidents Mubarak and Bashar Al-Asad called on the Security Council and relevant international forces to work to force Israel to respect its commitments and undertakings and make it implement Security Council resolutions without double standards, in particular the recent Security Council resolution demanding that Israel withdraw from the areas it has occupied, on the basis that this is sufficient to halt the deterioration in the situation and create an atmosphere conducive to rescuing the peace process in its different tracts, pursuant to the international reference formulated by the international community.
* In Damascus the Director of the Foreign Media Department at the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Buthainah Shaaban stated at a press conference that the aim of Asad's visit to Egypt was "to activate Arab solidarity" and that "Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia will work for anything that avoids a strike against Iraq".
(WSF, ASHA).
The Secretariat-General of the "Qarnat Shahwan Forum" will hold a meeting next Thursday, when the bishops' statement is issued, under the chairmanship of Bishop Yusif Bisharah to study the coming steps of the Forum.
Let's wait and see what the contents of the file are first."
Among the steps resulting from the talks are a study to establish a free market between Lebanon and Yemen, to facilitate the travel of businessmen and investors between the two countries, the possibility of establishing joint industries, and the setting of a date to convene the Joint Committee for its first meeting next November.
Despite the cautious satisfaction which the Lebanese President sensed in the Yemeni President and the Omani Sultan towards Iraq's agreement to the return of international inspectors to Baghdad, this Iraqi stance may, on its own, be insufficient to stop the American strike unless new international positions were forthcoming, especially from the major states, though naturally excluding the United States, to make political solutions dominant over military action. The source explained that Lahud, Salih and Qabus had agreed to move to create an international situation that would make the United States turn away from its step or, at least, lighten the degree of tension. Perhaps time might help relieve the some pressure. The move would be towards European states, Russia, China and other states.
Iraq's fate stands at a critical juncture.
If Baghdad says that Washington will not be satisfied by anything and that it is searching for a pretext to strike Iraq, then such a statement holds much truth, for Bush's administration has declared the overthrow of the Iraqi regime a clear objective and the elimination of Iraqi weapons does not seem to quench its thirst for revenge.
What is proposed is a method for sparing Iraq a war that Washington has determined to wage, under international cover if possible or alone if necessary.
The reasons for this are many, first of which is that Washington relies on the Iraqi rejection of this condition to justify its strike and so views it as the first test for Saddam.
To maintain it requires full cooperation with the United Nations.
So what decision will the Iraqi President take?
Although, and may God be praised, our tank is filled to the top, the measure overflows to the very edge, and we are not glorifying God for the past.
From a jump to its sister, the sister of this condition, which doesn't have the decency to leave us with a pleasant odor.

Government sources yesterday confirmed that Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri is to visit Tokyo on the 9th of this September as part of the framework for the preparation for the Conference of Donor States to Lebanon (Paris 2).
He also received Deputy Sayyid Aql, followed by former Minister Michel Adah, President of the World Catholic Federation for Press in Lebanon, Father Tony Khidrah.
He said, "Tourism in Lebanon has varying characteristics according to the seasons and between the coast and the mountains, and in terms of services, from entertainment to shopping to medical treatment." He noted the positive effect of the influx of visitors to Lebanon for its economy generally and for the commercial, agricultural and industrial sectors in particular.
And now those who predicted the catastrophe they hurried to call upon us have seen that their predictions were not correct.
He announced, "We want to continue to reduce the interest rate on the debt so that the servicing of the debt will be equal to or less than the level of the first excess in the budget, in order to stop the deficit."
The "Southern Aid Association" yesterday visited the Al-Wazzani source in a solidarity initiative in the face of Israeli threats to prevent Lebanon pumping its water to southern villages.
A number of members of the delegation then prayed at the Al-Wazzani bank.
We are the followers of Imam Ali, who when prevented by his enemies from drinking from the water hole and defeated them, allowed them to drink, take and pump the water.
By these noble sects, represented with us today, we have come out to the assembly and we say that there is national unity in the south. All Lebanese, from the extreme north to its four quarters must follow the examples of the south and the Southern Aide Association.
The land is ours, the water is ours. We will take our right irrespective of whether anyone comes.
The delegation passed by the Roman Orthodox Partriarchate in Marjaiyun before heading for Al-Wazzani.
Sidon - "Al-Nahar":
1. "We call for the activation of political life in the Al-Zahrani area by activating popular forces therein and by encouraging them to play their role and to reject all attempts at containment and political hegemony over the towns and villages of the area.
5. Call all the media to appoint media representatives in the Al-Zahrani area, as in other areas, and to undertake to cover the political and cultural activities therein, thereby helping to activate the political life.
9. Demand that the Elections Laws be settled before voting by a sufficient period. Warn against any law that looks to the major constituencies without adopting proportionality as its democratic basis.
Birri received the new Iranian Ambassador Masoud Al-Idrisi on a protocol visit.
As we stood in the past, we stand today, and in the future, alongside Syria, Lebanon and Palestine. We believe that the region of the Middle East is passing through complex, sensitive and dangerous conditions, all of which is on account of the one-sided policy pursued by the United States on the one hand, and on account of the aggressive and expansionist policies of the Zionist entity on the other.
Following the meeting, Ghandur referred in his statement to the "importance of meeting with Speaker Birri at this stage, given that the Lebanese community in the Ivory Coast is facing new difficulties and challenges.
Birri sent a telegram to German Chancellor Gerhardt Schroeder congratulating him on his victory in the elections, as well as to the Speaker of the Columbian Senate Luis Alfredo Ramos Botero and to his new Columbian counterpart William Filiz Fera congratulating them on their election.
A series of contacts with Ambassador Farid Abbud were conducted to find out the circumstances of and reasons for this decision, in order to mount an official move in this regard.
It also means that American officials are not happy at specific positions in Lebanon and view the criticisms directed against them in connection with their refusal to infringe on freedoms to be unreasonable.
Those irritated in the American State Department have given the impression that this is a possibility on account of it not being notified by Lebanon of the latter's intent to increase its share of the Al-Wazzani water.
"The Qarnat Shahwan Forum" did not need more than the expression confirmed by Maronite Patriarch Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Butrus Safir that he and the forum "were part of the same retinue" for the political and media wave that prevailed last week, announcing Bikirki's withdrawal of its cover from the Forum, which is headed by Archbishop Yusif Basharah, to disappear.
But these atmospherics had scarcely begun to bring pressure to bear on the political arena when the first signal of support came from the Maronite Patriarch as he received the "Consultative Forum" and his confirmation in a written statement of Bikirki's maxims, recalling the three calls issued by the Maronite Episcopal Council and clearly defining the relationship that links it to the "Al-Qarnah".
It confirmed its adherence to its maxims, which will, in all probability, be restated in the statement of the Maronite Council tomorrow, Wednesday, after Safir realized that the third call "had not been properly heard" as a result of the closure of the "M.T.V." station on the same day it was issued.
Consequently, Basharah will chair a meeting of the Secretariat of the "Qarnat Shahwan Forum" after tomorrow, Thursday, which will discuss a range of steps, chief among them dialogue.
According to what these circles say, the political ceiling remains the same and the "Al-Qarnah" will not stop seeking everything set out in its statements before the "M.T.V." issue and thereafter.
But the lesson lies in the steps by which Safir will address his "dialogue" messages and the possibility of benefiting therefrom in order to lift the load from the "Al-Qarnah" members.
At a meeting of the Central Council yesterday Baqraduni reiterated the support of the Party for the President of the Republic, "in whom we see the symbol of the unity of the nation and who stands vigilant over the Constitution, the Accord and Order. We see in the army an organization that protects the peace of the people, law and sovereignty and in the judiciary the source of authority for guaranteeing the rights of citizens and their various freedoms."
If it becomes apparent to the judiciary that there was no criminal act involved, then the innocence of all those over whom suspicion hangs, including President Amin Gemayel, should be declared.
* Phalangist Party Circles mentioned that President Amin Gemayel sent by means of his agent, attorney Antoinne Muarbas, a letter to the "President of the Phalangist Party Karim Baqraduni" asking him to deposit a copy of the decision to expel him from the Party, after "we heard" the news via the press.
Maronite Patriarch Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Butrus Safir received yesterday in Bikirki former Deputy Jamil Al-Shams, who afterwards said, "I am delighted to visit His Eminence Patriarch Safir, who has demonstrated a high degree of wisdom, patriotism and sense of responsibility at this difficult and dangerous stage."
Everything that is happening is patriotic heresy.
If there remains some 1% of hope in Lebanon remaining, then call all the Maronite leaders and all Muslim and Christian leaders to fear God and pray to Christ and the Prophet Muhammad; to follow the approaches of Patriarch Safir and gather around the national President of the Republic, lift all pressures from him and provide him with all support, confidence and compliance without return; and to go beyond their personal interests and cooperate sincerely, with love, courage and the spirit of tolerance, in order to allow him to lead them in purity, justice, patriotic values and sacred responsibility to restore life to Lebanon and allow it to continue. Or say farewell to Lebanon."
He said, "The issue was at the point of give and take up until yesterday, when suspicions increased following the statement by the Minister for Water and Electricity Resources and the demand of all colleagues for a fundamental solution to be found for the electricity. For we, as Deputies, were asking the people in our areas to pay millions of lira due for this house or that when we know that the house is not capable of using all that amount of electricity.
Today the electricity bills have become an annihilation despite the massive efforts made by Kamal Al-Hayek, Director General of the Organization, although he is not responsible for this stage, but merely dealing with its consequences.
He said, "In adding my voice to the voices of the Deputies and prominent figures of the Tyre area calling on citizens in the south generally not to pay the electricity bills until the truth of the falsification becomes apparent, I call on the judiciary to grasp this serious social issue, uncover the truth and those responsible and hand down the harshest penalty on them, to deter those who wish to tamper with the economic, living and developmental security of the citizens.
In a meeting yesterday in the Chamber of Deputies the Secretariat of the "Consultative Forum" approved the Forum's draft constitution after amendments were incorporated.
There follows the text of the Forum's draft constitution:
Article 4: The Secretariat: The function of the Secretariat shall be performed by a committee comprising six members elected by the General Board by mutual agreement for a renewable term of one year
- Prepare draft proposals and statements for submission to the General Board for study and approval thereof.

Article 10: Amendment to the Constitution: The Constitution may be amended at any time by request of at least ten and no more than two thirds of the members. The proposed amendment shall be included on the agenda and previously submitted to the Secretariat, which shall send it to members for their perusal at least two days prior to the meeting being convened."
They include:
- At Palmand University: a "Masters" in.
It funds a number of operations, such as bringing in lecturers and experts, funding training courses for Lebanese lecturers abroad, providing books and reference sources, providing grants for the top students and organizing exchanges between researchers.
The aim of all these programs is "to encourage universities and students to opt for French studies, and for lecturers and researchers to teach in French", Pensar explained.
There are 14 universities in Lebanon who are members, among a total of 54 in the Arab world.
There attended Deputies Qablan Isa Al-Khuri and Jibran Tuq, Bishops Frances Al-Bisri, Yuhanna Fuad Al-Hajj and George Kuwaitar, Bishop of Dallas in the United States of America Charles Grahmann, Secretary-General of the Catholic Bishops and Patriarchs Father Khalil Alwan, Sheikh Banwa Kiruz, Attorney Rawi Isa Al-Khuri, Monsignor Yuhanna Tarrad, responsible for the complex and completion supervisor, in addition to a group of municipal heads, village leaders and personalities.
Archbishop Al-Indari then gave a sermon in which he said, "What can we say about this great work which you have undertaken along with those generous people who offered and encouraged donations from God's munificence to them, at the forefront of which is Bishop Charles Grahmann, who has come from America to participate in launching this complex fit for social and educational service for the good of Birhaliyun, to reinvigorate life here and consolidate residency and permanence here.
The bishops then blessed the complex and toured its environs.
A speech was then given by the Municipal Head of Birhaliyun Bashir Tarrad followed by parish priest Abdallah Yazbek.
The action on the "Al-Buma" deal file at this specific juncture is an explicit invitation to President Amin Jemayel to leave Lebanon and join Brigadier Michel Aun in exile, after he "dared" to cross the red line "agreed upon" regionally and internationally (?!).
I answered him: When we recover the freedom to dream of a better tomorrow and our children can escape from the nightmare of traveling to places that allow them to live in affluence and dignity, and the miracle that frees the giant who is able to remove all the Pharisees from the Temple.
*The Secretary-General of the National Council for Scientific Research Dr Muin Hamzah told us that the decision taken to award a university grant to the top outstanding pupils in the General Secondary Certificate was not retroactive and its continuation in the coming years depended on credits being made available.

The people of the area have called on the Minister of the Environment, who helped resolve the difficult problem of the refuse dump in Majdaliya, to solve their serious environmental problem, especially given that it affects both eye and nose.
Minister of Environment Michel Musa, represented by the Director of the Awareness and Guidance Department at the Ministry Antoine Gharib, acted as patron of a workshop on the twin problems of refuse and waste water under the title "The Problem Between Obligation and Compulsion". It was organized by the "Environmental Development" Association in Rashiya at the Wadi Al-Tim School hall. Representatives from the Ministry of Municipal and Village Affairs Hasan Hatit, representative from the Ministry of the Environment Bassam Sabbagh, Director General of the Al-Laitani Department Nasir Nasrallah, and a number of municipal, village, club and association heads attended."
He added, "On the level of protecting coasts, coastal areas and the sea, Lebanon, in signing the Barcelona Agreement to protect the Mediterranean from pollution, has prepared a national guidance plan for waste water. Treatment plans and programs to monitor pollution along the coast have begun.
Hatit pointed out, "The proper disposal of used water is a key issue for the public interest and the environment." He added, "Lebanon is facing numerous and serious problems in this sector. The treatment of this water is a partial solution to the problem of the shortage in irrigation water.
Amidst the flood of American and international preoccupations with the first anniversary of the American events of 11 September, including learning the lessons, significance, causes, roots and uncovering the secret behind the hatred of a large number of countries and peoples of the world for the United States, including allied European and western states, there are perhaps few who will stop to consider the historical-political significance of another tragic political event that took place on the same day, in 1973, namely the bloody military coup led by General Pinochet against the Government of Legitimate Socialist Popular Unity in Chile. Its parties won in the constitutional multi-party elections in 1980 as a result of joint planning with the American Central Intelligence Agency, and the fact is that no analyst, observer or researcher anywhere in the world, including America, questioned it.
Coinciding with this contest, one of our local newspapers republished a historical statement previously published in the "Al-Adwa" newspaper by a group of Deputies on the eve of the disbandment of the National Council in 1975. What truly astonished me in the statement was the provocative and challenging tone by which it dictated its conditions to the government to withdraw the State Security Law and the absence of any compromise solutions to the tight crisis that took place at a historical time that witnessed the greatest struggles of the Cold War between the two camps and the increase in Gulf fears that the "infection" of the new experiment would be caught by the neighboring states.
Despite the right of all political forces to demand full activation of the 1973 constitution, which gives all legislative rights to the new council, no one has paid attention to the constitutional impasse contained in the article allowing the government to disband parliament and thereby repeat the same problem, but this time quickly on the basis of the anticipated ingredients!
The link is clear between lifting the siege from Arafat's headquarters in Ramallah and the preparations to launch an American war on Iraq, a war which all the evidence suggests is around the corner and perhaps the most obvious example is American haste to resolve the problem of the "embargo" in Ramallah.
If Tel Aviv had been able to continue its war in Palestine in parallel to Washington's war in Afghanistan, the American war against Iraq would not have started with the fires still lit in Palestine.
Israel responded not in order to please the White House Master and not because the strike against Iraq is, ultimately, in its interest.
It consolidated its qualitative superiority over its neighbors, to the extent that this is immeasurable.
These scenarios, maps and roles will not save any country, from Iraq to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Algeria, Sudan, Syria, Iran and Turkey.
Since 11 September, Israel has been promoted from the rank of America's policeman to that of advance scout and is now a first-rate provocative mouthpiece for those who listen to it behind the stage at the White House, Congress and the Pentagon: It has incited America against the Palestinians and succeeded in its efforts. It has deafened the ears of the world talking about the Iraqi danger until it got what it wanted. Today it has no concern other than Iranian nuclear capability and the dangers of "Hizbollah", "Jihad", "Hamas" and the "Al-Aqsa Brigades" and to gain control of the waters of Lebanon, Jordan and the Golan, in the hope that Washington will respond to these, its calls, and effect its wishes.
At this juncture, it is worth mentioning once more Assyrian nationalism, the history of which stretches back thousands of years with its people living on the historical land of "Assyria" (Iraq today) and who were subject throughout history to disasters and massacres whether on account of their national or religious affiliation, which thereby allowed some of the peoples of the twentieth century to achieve more than they deserved whilst the Assyrians paid the supreme price in terms of their number. In return, they obtained nothing more than nationalist marginalisation and emigration from their historical land. On account of all of this, there are no more than about one million Assyrians on their land, representing the third national group in terms of number, but which constitute the most important part on which today rests the hope of the Assyrians for establishing the Assyrian national presence in spite of all the difficulties surrounding them.

He stressed: "The need to establish chambers of agriculture in Lebanon that will manage the agricultural register and be a start for active agricultural guidance, allocation of land use, enrollment of farmers in social and health insurances and guaranteeing special prices for electricity and fuel oil."
Regarding the issue of "Ideal" and its program for supporting agricultural products, the Association demanded from the Ministry of Finance "the need to secure funds quickly to pay exporters dues within a period not exceeding two months.
It expressed amazement for "the non action of any of the officials to hold the Ministry of Agriculture accountable or questioning it on the incorrect information it released to polish the image of the agreement, and passing it without having the virtues it depicted. Consequently, what's required from the Council of Ministers is to open the record of this agreement, review and amend it to lift the harm inflicted on Lebanese farmers, or compensate the vegetable farmers in the protected agriculture at the same rate of that of price reduction that will occur because of the implementation of this agreement."

This player must realize the key event that grows and develops through a game of alliance and conflict until the theatrical work reaches a peek and accomplishing the best results... even if the star falls.
Marital partnership is not an absolute physical material act between two people, a man and a woman; otherwise, it would not have differed from the instinctive contact between animals.
We cannot have a discussion on the starring role without remembering that among the stars on stage are those whose role ends by martyrdom, death, assassination or even reclusion, since the star is not always the master of the game, but he is the master of reflecting his role on others. In a tale such as "Les Miserables" by Victor Hugo, we see Jean Valjean as the star of the entire work, albeit the weakest on the life stage, while everyone, even those who Valjean sacrifices for such as Cosette, is stronger, more resolved and determined than him, but he is the star whose name was immortalized by the tale. Similarly, the star in marriage is not always the decision-maker, but he is the star when he is able to transform to be a focal point of life for the entire family, the pivot on which rest its building and continuity. If the husband plays that role, then he is the star, and if his wife plays it, then she is the star. Otherwise, there is no meaning for a life without a role, no quest for stardom, no looking forward to or becoming fond of it.
The Minister of Higher Education took a tour in the Akkar region during which he dedicated three official schools which are a middle school in the town of Ayyat, a high school in Jebel Akroum and a high school in the village of Rajm Khalf in Wadi Khalid.
The purpose of all this is to prepare the student better to play his role in life in an ideal way."
He said that he was faced with two options in this regard, either delay the school year or use the set fee to pay for contract salaries, school supplies and other school needs, and begin the school year on time.
He regretted that the minister's decision to collect the registration fee in the official schools caused a non-positive shock and raised protest by many social classes, especially in the poor areas, and wished it would be reconsidered.
It added in a statement: "Perhaps one of the worst parts of this chain is adopting religious association criteria in the new full-time employment project for 34 hourly contract professors, which makes the full-time employment process at the university turn into a "Mullah Council", bringing back memories of the ill-reputed Ottoman Mullah system."
The "Commission has concluded the following opinions and positions:
Third: Re-enacting university regulations and academic standards concerning full-time employment of professors who have met the legal and academic conditions in the name of transparency and indiscretion, and to launch the path of their full-time employment from the department to the branch to the division and on to the university board.

The events of the documentary film revolve around re-investigating Ciro Bustos and the French intellectual Regis Dubray, who accompanied Guevara for a while in the Bolivian forests and were arrested days before his death in 1967.
The film also includes a meeting with an official at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), who was assigned to uncover Guevara's whereabouts, in addition to the Bolivian military commander who carried out the order to kill him, immediately after his arrest and at the location where he was arrested.
The film uncovers a number of sad and funny ironies, pointing out that children are more mature and closer to what goes on in the real world than adults in their reactions and the fleeing of some of them to join the Intifada and confronting Israel.
He went on to say that "Israel is a virus that is killing us, and, therefore, we must expose our vision in order to confront ourselves and be able to rebuild our history in a real manner where Israel becomes outside the equation since she will be eliminated by our strength and giving up the elements of our weakness."

Third: Working on the establishment of one national institution in lieu of the ethnic institutions, starting from the school, university, through the hospital, clinic and boy scout and youth organizations that have become ethnically or religiously colored instead of being organizations that unite, not separate."

He said: "This disease is the most common among women and most fatal than  others, but what is encouraging is the possibility of diagnosing it early at a certain stage of spreading that allows medicine to treat it in the non-advanced stage."
It showed that breast cancer represents 29 percent of cancer cases in Lebanon, making it the most common cancer, followed by lung cancer, which represents 11 percent of cancer cases.

Opinion differed about the outcome of the United States Grand Prix race, which is the 16th semi-final round of the world's car championship, "Formula 1", for the 2002 season, when the "Ferrari" German driver Michael Schumacher let his colleague in the Brazilian team, Rubens Barrichello, win, after it was clear that he locked up the win as he was faster in the free and official trials and led the race from start to finish, pursued by Barrichello without ever succeeding to passing him.
Chang had announced that he will retire at the end of the current season after his elimination from the first round of the Hong Kong International Tournament last week, but he later said: "I have not set a date for my retirement yet.
In the first round of the women's championship, Croatian Silvija Talaja won over Japanese Shinobu Asagoe 6-4, 3-6, 6-0.
Wembley Stadium was built in the year 1923 and witnessed the biggest football win for England when its team won 4-2 over Germany in the 1966 World Cup final.
And if some excessively exaggerated talk would justify to the state with all of its institutions and apparatus to jump the opposition, under the cover of committing a coup attempt, the true realities of the conflict seem leaning toward exploiting this logic but without reaching the level of a full coup against the Lebanese reality, in response to a mythical talk about a coup attempt that even those who launched it do not believe it, and it necessitates the lowest degrees of self-respect and that of others.
The state appeared with a rare irony that it is adopting all international "standards" in place now in most countries that offer security, even if repressing, coupled with religious diversity, the symbol of Lebanon's gleaming in the requirements of the global war on terrorism.
The state picked up a critical international moment, where national conflicts are not taken into consideration and are thrown on the shelf, and where democratic "principles" tolerate waiting and ignoring violations.
No "mobilization" would have occurred in Lebanon without being a warning for violent shredding and shaking up of the internal fabric.
But the enlargement of the opposition's rock and its "danger" made it overcome its weakness to be at least at the level of the popular sympathy with it.
This is the first balance of the long journey, and the rest shall follow in turn!
True, they are many and big, but there is no magic button that will solve Lebanon's economic problems with one click.
In other words, giving the opportunity to "Paris-2 Demonstration" to take place in atmospheres that convince the participants in it that the Lebanese deserve support and help.
And how could it bolster confidence in Lebanon and its economic conditions, which deserve support because they possess the elements of health and prosperity, while it kills the last token of confidence in the possibility of internally arriving at what will restore power to national unity, the only base of health and prosperity.
There is no need to list what he has done so far in preparation for Paris-2 and what preceded it, will accompany and follow it, considering that Al-Hariri, in his recent talk, purposefully contradicted the prevailing talk that Paris-2 is the last chance for a cure, and, if it fails, it means disaster. He said that the above-mentioned conference represents a cornerstone in curing Lebanon's financial problems, but it is not the only corner, in a reference to the deficit-reduction programs, spending curbs and revenue boosting, which provided in two years "useful support for the situation, while he" was practically and technically preparing for making the Paris-2 Conference successful.
We ask our friends to give us a chance to finish what we started and fulfill our commitments, and we might as well help ourselves(...). We ask them to trust us, but we might as well trust ourselves.
The newspaper indicated that Sharon, at the same time, is getting ready to face a proposition to withhold confidence from the government, presented by "Meritz" and "Shinoi".
From now on, Sharon is a prime minister of a government which does not enjoy a majority, and in the best of cases, a prime minister of a narrow rightist government, subject to the mercy of marginal parties in Israeli politics, and forced to maneuver in order to face the leftist and middle parties, who want to topple him.
His popularity hit the sky when he opposed the Likud's Central Committee, and declared his position in support of establishing a Palestinian state, and also when he fired ministers from the Shas Party.
Sharon secured himself with regards to the popular demonstrations against his cruel actions and his political bankruptcy.
Sharon, who enjoyed the political heaven so far, will know from now on how does the coalition hell look like with all the blackmail, the demands and the threats, without talking about the left's opposition."
No, it is the state that it won over.
The state is my own and yours, but it is certainly not exclusive to those who promote its policy, no matter how high they rise.
For that, it is sufficient to review the published statements and press interviews of government officials and representatives who are loyal (to whom?), not to mention the gossip of "informed sources", which seemed to have been informed just about everything except about what is happening in the world, not to forget the foolish "security sources".
This scenario may be funny, especially when it is repeated like the practical jokes of Ghawwar Al-Touche, even if it did not stem out of the corrupt mentality that Ghawar is clear of.
The decadence of the state is not felt except by statesmen, who are very rare, and the republic is not mourned except by republicans, who, once they step down from rule, no room is left for regret, sadly enough.
The Director of the Non-Government Agencies Department at the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, Yousef Al-Sharqawi, spoke about steadfastness that "needs more continuous support..., on the basis of the land-for-peace principle, United Nations resolutions and the enforcement of the Palestinians right to establish their state on their land."
Amman -Reuters - Palestinian Legislative Council member Tawfiq Abu Bakr announced that a number of prominent Arab dignitaries formed a committee to support the Arab Representative in the Israeli Knesset, Ahmad Al-Taibi, who is being tried by Israel for entering the Jenin Camp in the aftermath of the "Protective Wall" operation, without a prior permit.
The Public Relations and Information Department at the "Kingdom Withholding" Company reported that its Chairman of the Board, Saudi Arabian businessman Prince Al-Walid Bin Talal Bin Abdel Aziz Al Saud, visited the Rashid Center for Treatment and Care of Children in the Barshaa region in the Emirate of Dubai.
He said that "the Libyans have been very active in attempting to acquire missiles, and not only short-range missiles."
He was asked about the Libyan military capabilities and responded that such a country possesses equipment that is superior to Syria's equipment, indicating that she continued her efforts to develop short-range missiles.
After that, the American Assistant Secretary of State for Armament Affairs, John Bolton, visited Russia to confront the Russian officials with evidence on a possible North Korean program for enriching uranium. Moscow responded cautiously, saying that it wants to independently verify the information before taking any position.
He added that the American claims that Pyong Yang is developing a program for nuclear armament are baseless, explaining that "we made an unambiguous statement to the American president's envoy indicating that in the face of increasing American nuclear threat, we are forced to obtain not only nuclear weapons, but more powerful weapons to protect our sovereignty and our right to exist."
North Korean leader Kim Jung-Il had visited Russia last August for the second time within a year.
On the day after the conclusion of the Japanese-North Korean talks, which aimed at establishing normal relations between the two countries, and without reaching agreement on any of the two major issues, namely, the nuclear program of the Communist regime and the kidnapped Japanese in North Korea, Japanese delegation member Akitaka Saiki said he asked the North Korean delegation for details on eight Japanese who were kidnapped by North Korean spies decades ago.
Washington - AFP - The American Administration decided to launch a wide television campaign in the Islamic World to rectify the American society's image in these regions, which Washington considers "mistaken".
He indicated that these films aim at "discussing the American Moslems, their life styles in the United States, our society's values and more generally, introducing ourselves."
He said that "in the face of terrorism, which may harm the reputation of Islam by claims of serving it, explaining the deep nature of Islam, its aspirations to peace and its conciliatory desire must be pursued relentlessly."
Berlin - Reuters - A top Western intelligence official reported that Western spies monitored a return of intensive communications among Islamist activists that have not been monitored since the six months preceding the September 11 attacks.
He explained that "the problem that is still going on is that the target and the date are unknown."
The spokesman expected that the disarmament process will begin in Sholgara, which is reachable by car in two hours and is located southwest of the major city of Mazar El-Sherif in northern Afghanistan, where forces loyal to the Uzbek General Abdel Rasheed Dostum clashed with the forces of "The Islamic Society" leader, Tajik commander Mr. Atta Mohammad early in the week.
It followed a meeting of the American Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Zalmai Khalil Zadah, with both Dostum and Mohammad in Mazar El-Sherif during which the envoy expressed his government's concern about the fighting between the two factions.
Both Dostum and Mohammad are members in Karzai's coalition government, but they were apparently interested in expanding their provincial authority bases more than they were interested in helping the central government exercise control over the entire country.
In Kabul, the spokeswoman for the World Health Organization, Loretta Hieber Gerardet, said in a press conference that 61 children died in seven villages within four weeks in the Darwaz District in the Badkhshan Province.
She indicated that "there are 68 other children who suffer similar symptoms and those have received medical treatment."
Two of the three men were transported by air from Kabul to Kandahar, where the International Commission took them to their homes in the provinces of Helmand and Oruzgan.
Several explosions sounded yesterday at the house of an activist in the Islamic Resistance Movement "Hamas". Three persons, who apparently were making bombs, were killed.
Residents in the area said that the explosions took place at the house of "Hamas" member Salah Nassar, who is the brother of Wael Nassar, one of the top military leaders in the movement.
A witness said: "We heard two large explosions from the first floor of the building, followed by several explosions," and a fire erupted in the house.
Earlier, a Palestinian was killed in a gunfire exchange with an Israeli officer near Beit El settlement on the Ramallah perimeter in the West Bank.
He added that before his death, the Palestinian fired on an ambulance that was passing in the neighborhood.
An officer in the Palestinian Intelligence, Eid Mansour (37 years) was killed by Israeli soldiers' bullets Wednesday evening, under unknown circumstances near the city.
The army radio said that the soldiers arrested 22 wanted Palestinians in the West Bank Wednesday night.
On another front, the "Al-Risala" Newspaper, which is close to the "Hamas" Movement, resumed publication after it was closed by the Palestinian Security apparatus for more than a year for publishing "enticing articles."
Khartoum Representatives, "Popular Army" Start Looking into Sharing Wealth
He indicated that the government and insurgents delegations will discuss security arrangements after "the success" of negotiations on other issues.
Sudanese newspapers wrote today that Vice president Ali Othman Mohammad Taha completely rules out self-determination right for the three regions, calling the attention to the fact that they are part of the north, according to the south's borders which were settled in the year 1956.
Concerning that, the National Council approved a plan for the upcoming year that includes taking over the areas under the control of the insurgents and guaranteeing the security of the Sudanese territories and water resources by way of consolidating the armed forces.
Army's spokesman, General Mohammad Bashir Suleiman, denied the violation of the truce agreed upon with the insurgents in the southern part of the country, calling the situation there "quiet", but the "aggression supported by Eritrea is still going on in the East."
The leader of the Iraqi "Patriotic Union of Kurdistan", Jalal Talabani, expected an American offensive against Iraq after the month of Ramadan, which ends on the fifth of next December.
He added that "foreign countries, the United States and also the Arab and European countries can help us get rid of Saddam Hussein's regime, including military support."
Talabani met with the leader of the "Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution", Ayatollah Baqer Al-Hakeem, to prepare for a conference for the opposition that will be held from the 15th to the 22nd of November in Brussels.
In Baghdad, the information official at the Humanitarian Coordinator Office of the United Nations in Iraq, Ali Hamati, said that "the only problem, which is certainly very serious and causes us to ring the danger bell, is the progressive reduction in oil revenues."
The Sanctions Commission chose a formula for setting prices with a retroactive effect that calls for calculating the price of Iraqi oil according to the median of the oil prices in world markets in the previous month.

According to results announced officially for the Capital Governance, Candidate Saadi Abdullah, candidate of the "Islamic National Forum Society" ("Moslem Brothers"), was able to defeat independent candidate Adel Al-Asomi in the first district.
Islamic Reformist Movement's candidate, Ghanim Albuainain, advanced in the eighth district over independent Sunni businessman Ali Al-Mussalam, while Candidate Abdel Aziz Al-Mir, who is a businessman and member in the "Islamic National Forum Society", was able to advance over Islamic Reformist candidate Adel Bu Sandal.

He added that Iran is led by "a very small group of clergymen," and that women and young people do not approve of the way it is being run."
Rumsfeld's comments contradict a recent analysis by the American Central Intelligence Agency, "CIA", that pointed to "a slow change" in the Iranian society that is more than being a revolution.
He had joined Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar for breakfast in the morning, then attended a ceremony at the Al-Bardo Palace with King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia at the conclusion of a state visit that lasted three days.
Spanish newspapers criticized some protocol aspects of Khatami's visit that stemmed from Islamic traditions, such as not serving alcohol during official reception parties or refraining from shaking hands with women, especially the queen of Spain.
On another front, two Iranian Parliamentarians, Ali Redha Nouri and Masood Hashimedhi, were killed in a traffic accident.
Medical Investigations to Be Announced Today; Jakarta Pursues Suspect; Canberra Accuses "Al-Qaeda" of Bali Blast; Washington Expects Attacks in The Philippines; Australia; The Philippines

Last week, the American State Department recommended to American citizens to avoid certain regions in the Philippines.
Al-Hoss has not visited the Palace since he left office in the year 2000.
It headed down via Rizq Expressway to Al-Nasserah then Abdel Wahab Al-Inglizi and ended up at the Monastery of the Faithful Church, where internal security officers embarked on carrying the treasures on the shoulders to the church's proper.
Word diminished in Washington yesterday about reaching an agreement soon in the Security Council regarding disarming Iraq's weapons as the American President George Bush and his top administration staff re-iterated their running out of patience with regards to the continuation of opposition of France, Russia and China, besides other countries of the non-permanent members of the council, to an American-British draft resolution, and reiterating the readiness of the United States to lead an international coalition to strip Iraq of its alleged weapons.
They spoke of "superficial and partial softness" in the American administration's position "because it seeks to trade its ambiguous acceptance with our consent, which is comprised of two distinct phases of permanent and automatic authorization to strike Iraq.
One Hundred Lebanese Companies; 47 Countries at Baghdad International Expo
As part of this event, the Al-Arar Border Center between Iraq and Saudi Arabia was opened yesterday.
The head of the Saudi delegation, Chairman of the Board of the Saudi Export Development Center, "Saudi Export Development Center", and member of the Consultative Council, Abdel Rahman Al-Zamil, described the re-opening of the passageway between the two countries as the start of partnership, and that this step, which has been in planning for approximately a year, will ease the customs burdens off of Saudi companies since goods will be transported from and to the Kingdom and Iraq without going through a third party.
On another front, the Iraqi Housing and Construction Minister, Maan Sarsam, disclosed to "Al-Nahar" that Iraq has significant contracts with two of the largest Saudi companies in the field of building and erection of very big housing compounds, indicating that Baghdad will contract in the next phase of the Memorandum of Understanding with other Saudi companies.
It is clear, of course, that there is an opposing side and a loyal side, but this is the nature of things.
But I think that the government, to be consistent with itself, must not grant licenses to people thought to be affiliated with it. This is my opinion.
There is great trust in Lebanon abroad, by our Arab brothers and many countries. Let us, brothers and friends, trust, support and stand by our country until it passes its crisis.
The people's support and backing are critical to all the steps we undertake, and we ask God Almighty to avoid us away error and bring us closer to righteousness.
State Minister Pierre Helou contended "that the Christian faction was never as divided as it is today and that is the impending danger, indicating that "there is some balance missing internally."
He called attention to the fact that "there are certain things that call for some pessimism."
And so on. The "war that Henry Kissinger wanted, was transformed from a military war to an economic war."
I congratulate them for their uniting around their demands.
Suddenly, with the blink of an eye."
He discussed with Minister of Tourism Karam Karam the general conditions and the results of the Francophone Summit.
He conveyed to him "the positive impressions formed by the ministers and heads of delegations participating in the conference about Lebanon and President Lahoud's positions."
Khouri discussed with the president the work of the joint committees between the two countries, the issues that require follow-up, and handling the implementation of the Brotherhood, Cooperation and Coordination Treaty concluded between the two countries, including the bilateral agreements stemming out of it.
Following the visit, Representative Al-Baarini released a statement in which he said: "I assured his Excellency, the President, of our trust in his political style, his wisdom in situations and their handling, and in his hosting of our guests at the totally or partially French-Speaking Conference, where he projected with all who helped the right image of Lebanon.
West Bikaa - "Al-Nahar":
Arbash then delivered an address in which he said: "The nation is in danger and our solidarity is the answer. Mobilizing the youths in the context of national and domestic unity is the best solidarity with Al-Assad's Syria, as it is with every targeted sister country."
This Syrian stance in particular is the one that attempts to stop the plan to strike Iraq and control the sources of her wealth.
The Archbishop of Washington, Theodore Cardinal McCarrick, concludes today his visit to Lebanon that lasted four days.
President Lahoud completed during the meeting discussing the subjects that he had raised with the Archbishop of Washington during his visit with him on Tuesday and his meeting with the Christian and Moslem spiritual leaders at the president of the republic's dinner table.
He added: "We pray for peace in the world and in Lebanon, which suffers many problems caused by external crises."
He thought "that secular diversity in Lebanon is a blessing, not a curse."
Following short prayers at the Church of the Patriarchal Enclave, the American cardinal went with the bishops to the holy sites of Al-Wadi, where he reflected and prayed for more than a quarter of an hour opposite the Patriarchal Chair in the Holy Valley.
He returned in the evening to Bkarki and was planning to leave Lebanon today on his way back to the United States.
Attention was focused on the internal affairs of the country and the means of addressing the issue of internal unity and national solidarity, especially the issue of liberties and means to guarantee their preservation and consolidation, and resolving the issue of the M.T.V. television in a way that guarantees its re-opening after the tune of secular and religious convulsion, which does not serve the country nor building the country, exacerbated in an unprecedented manner.
On another front, the Executive Council thinks that in view of what the political front is witnessing that "demonstrating is a legitimate right for citizens, guaranteed by the Lebanese constitution which called for respecting the freedom of expression and belief, especially if the call to assemble and demonstrate follows the mechanics outlined by laws with proper procedures.
The League thinks that the Christian arena has become a prey for enticements that should not become a permanent reality, preserving the isolation and deepening the split.
* The Finance and Budget Committee also meets at eleven before noon next Monday to study the budgets of the president of the republic and the prime minister offices, including the two administrative budgets of the Economic and Social Council and the National Council for Scientific Research.

He added that "the talk of Al-Qornat in its statement on pursuing the issue of liberty, under the title, The Closure of the M.T.V. Television and Radio Mount Lebanon, affirms that it is still sticking to its style of creating doubts and
Formation of Rightist Government in Israel Increases Chances of Aggression
"Hezbollah" has not launched any attacks at Shabaa Farms in weeks, but it is possible that it could resume that at any time and breach the ceasefire that reportedly was arranged by American Secretary of State Colin Powell when his presence in the region coincided with the rising tone of military confrontation before his visit to Beirut last spring.
He called attention to that the current government crisis in Israel must not be underestimated, and that if Sharon was able to form a new government and appoint Shaol Mofaz as a defense minister, the danger would be bigger and the field more open to free Sharon's hand, not only against the Palestinians inside but against Lebanon, too.
The Russian envoy of the peace process in the Middle East, Andre Vidovin, twice evaded answering a question on the extent of the truth in Sharon's statements, the first being at Bustros Palace after his meeting with Foreign and Emigrants Minister Mahmoud Hammoudeh, and the second at Baabda Palace after his meeting with the President of the Republic Emile Lahoud.
He explained that Lebanon does not anticipate from Anan any answer for the report she sent to him, because Beirut considers that it did not require permission, neither from Anan nor from any other country, and certainly not from Israel, because the quantity that was decided to be pumped represents a sovereign right, according to more than one regulating international treaty for this type of pumping water that originates on its soil.
He called attention "that the whole world is watching and trusting us, and we must translate this trust into a trust in ourselves and in our country, and into a faith in God."
Regarding the steps the government is taking to stop the waste and corruption and to stimulate the public and private sectors, he said: "The responsibility of the state in relation to the private sector is to remove the obstacles in front of it, and despite the efforts that the government exerted in this area, there are still more obstacles that we are in the process of removing.

She added: "The banking reaction to this invitation was very satisfactory, whereas the number of attendees exceeded 100 people from 50 banks and representative office, in addition to five financial institutions.
65 employees, representing 30 banks, participated in it.  They are operation managers and officials from departments of information and internal oversight on information systems at banks.
The two exhibits do not bring anything new in style nor in visual meaning.
The title of Anita Toutikian's exhibit is "House of Virtue", which is what she named a sculpture based on the life of a generation of women who experienced the years of war.
The groundwork that Toutikian has accomplished calls for contemplation because it is contrary to what we encounter in paintings, where geometric lines drawn in tandem on a background stripped of any distinguishing marks reveal the extent of the artist's impression with what many artists painted in the stage that preceded World War II.
What Toutikian is missing in her paintings she finds in her sculpture experiments, hoping she will find a way of distinguishing if serious inquiries would help her.
The artist says in a note that accompanies his artistic biography "that some houses relate to the memory, and others deal with the present.
Mostly Regular Criminal and Civil, Information Center: Lawsuit Resolution Rate Rises
It is evident that in comparison with the same period that preceded it, extending from 1/1/2000 to 30/9/2001, the legal system resolved 120 thousand and 671 complaints against 145 thousand and 535 filed complaints.
Part of that is due to the shortage in the number of judges, and the other part to the fact that the filers of these lawsuits no longer pursue them due to their worthlessness as years passed since they were filed, noting that a significant percentage of these lawsuits are of the civil type.
As a last note, the inventory includes criminal and civil complaints, which are mostly regular in nature.
He ruled that they should be tried before the Criminal Court.
Since the defendant is Syrian, he kept going to Syria from time to time, during his employment period, to spend a few days with his family and cousins, and in order to secure his job at the building, he was covered during this period by his cousin and Syrian countryman, defendant Hisham S., who lives with Zahir in the room assigned to him in the building.  During his stay, the above-mentioned Hisham noted that the plaintiff is a materially well-off man and of an advanced age, so he went about looking for a way for him to benefit materially from him and an idea occurred to him for taking advantage of the plaintiff by tempting him by way of bringing a young woman, whom he would make a deal with for material benefit, and presented this idea to Zahir to work with him in carrying out this plan of taking advantage of the plaintiff materially.  However, the latter did not share his ideas at the time and hoped for an alternative plan.  It just happened at one time that the plaintiff asked Zahir to make additional copies of his office keys and gave him his office keys for this purpose.  So, Zahir went to one of the stores for this purpose then returned and handed over the original office keys and the copies back to the plaintiff's secretary, who noticed after trying the copied keys that they still needed some adjustments and handed the copied keys to the defendant, Hisham S., who, after making the adjustments, made copies of them which he kept after handing the copies back to the secretary.
"The Arabs at a Juncture" by Essam Nomaan
The Chairman of the Seminar, Dr. Essam Suleiman, spoke after him and said that Dr. Nomaan expresses in his book "a solid intellectual commitment at a time when the Arab situation keeps getting worse.
He distributed the book's contents under four headings: Terrorism and America; World Chaos and Disorder; Palestine and Martyred Missions; and Iraq and Arab Oil.
Colleague Helmi Moussa then spoke about "the courage of Dr. Nomaan in collecting these articles, and the fact is that most of the book's articles combine political thinking with political analysis in a brilliant way.
College of Sciences "Stables"!
Yet, this transformation did not improve its conditions except by converting it into lecture halls.
The cracked walls and the water seeping through them, despite the summer, and the sunlight in many places due to the scarcity of walls, in addition to engineering reports that compelled the president of the university to issue an evacuation order, all demonstrate the extent of the state officials' interest in
Then the president of the university brought with him to the seminar a decree for transferring the ownership of Tallet Al-Moon Michel from the ownership of the defense ministry to the ownership of the education ministry - the Lebanese University, hoping to start building the university city in the north.
First: Is it sensible that the university uses a building, whether owned by France or someone else, wears it out, refuses to restore it, and only to return it to its owners, perhaps destroyed.
Isn't the honorable stance better than many positions that bring nothing to its owners but resentment and curses.
Officials at the Botafogo Club had offered Galliano a financial reward for the amount of 5000 reals (1340 dollars) if he scored in the match.
Palmeiras, which missed the international goal keeper Marcos because of his injury, opened the scoring with two goals by its Colombian offense Hernan Dario Gomez in the first five minutes, while Carlos Alberto scored for Botafogo in the 19th minute.
Cruzeiro and Atletico Paranaense, the title holder, suffered two more losses and they fell lower on the list.

Therefore, the dialogue does not become right unless it follows these matters, the first of which is that each person acknowledge the other in accordance with what that other wants to be.
As for the "Al-Mayamer", plural for Maymar, it means a conversation, a study, a sermon, a defensive article or speech, and here it is a collection of spiritual commandments directed at the devout and discusses the satanic experiments a believer endures, and means to overcome them by pious exercise seeking the light of God's face.
Ghassan Al-Twaini (Introduction)
Edition No. 1
Man is "a called being": called to be, taking on himself to determine his fate in accordance with his freedom - which is the core of his being - and in accordance with his final call that is desired by God.
Human freedom is based on controlling choices.
The Dar Al-Mashreq published "The Spiritual Commandments Collection" by the spiritual Sheikh Johanna Al-Daliati, translated from Syriac and introduced by Jesuit Father Selim Dakkash, after "The Spiritual Messages Collection" was published for Al-Daliati himself, translated into Arabic and introduced by Father Dakkash in the year 1986.
The book has appendices of commandment manuscripts from the Vatican library and the Maronite Library of Aleppo.
Loving you sets me on an inflamed burning all the time.
The seller of pigeon chicks sacrifices his slaughtered pigeons.
The two together cannot rise.
Why do your eyes gaze into the sky like someone who does not feel his creator is on the inside of him?
Why do you drink a glass of our Savior's blood like someone who does not understand that his drink mixes with the secret of unity?
The recent security events in Kuwait and the attacks on American soldiers there dominated the address the Emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad, delivered to his countrymen yesterday, as per his custom during the last ten days of Ramadan, and he implicitly approached them from two fronts: the first being the assertion that the guarantee for the security of Kuwait is her approach of non-aggression "against anyone," and the second being the focus on protecting the youths from "distorted ideas" and from "the wolves" and directing them toward "straight thinking", in a clear reference to a number of them belonging to the "Al-Qaeda" Organization or others, and Kuwait's intention to lay a plan to absorb the phenomenon of radicalism, the most apparent sides of which is revising the religious academic curricula, especially the ones dealing with the meaning of Jihad.
The Kuwaiti Council of Ministers had recently approved the formation of a committee headed by the Director of National Security Apparatus, Sheikh Sabah Al-Khalid Al-Sabah, and the brother of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior, Sheikh Mohammad Al-Khalid Al-Sabah, with the task of putting together a long-term political-informative-educational strategy to bring up emerging generations away from radicalism.

3 events that happen before our eyes, linked together by the subject of Islam, which takes its place here haphazardly.
The question will certainly lead us to mine fields and killings.
We are puzzled here when we read that a golden era passed by this world and went with no return, leaving us a heritage that seems much more progressive than the ensuing backwardness.

History did not tell that the Umayyad Caliph shed the blood of Al-Akhttal.
* I am confident that the above-mentioned state of gloom was behind the vicious attack on colleague Abbas Saleh.
I do not do that. The uproar caused by television, and all that noise is nothing more than a background noise!" Well.
This title encompasses a great deal of irony, even if the author never put a question mark at the end.
If Woodward had concluded from overstating the expansion of America's role in fighting terrorism and tyranny, indicating that Bush stores a high degree of internal tension in his mind and his aides' minds, Bush never failed to infer it.
How is it possible to talk about even making alliances that will fight America's battles and wars?
And because he is the leader, he does not need more than this (!): "I have no need for explanation.
But he assures Woodward: I am not lowering my tone!
One of the Indian regions has become known as "Kidney City" because many of its residents sold their body parts to foreign patients to the point that some families sell the kidneys of their children as the patient pays a price of up to eight thousand sterling pounds for a kidney to avoid waiting for years for it to be made available by the National Health Service.
The residents of this region embarked on this "trade" more than ten years ago, which gave the suburb of Villivakkam its English-Tamil name, or Kidney Vakkam.
One of the brokers came and urged me to do it, so I was paid the sum of thirty-five thousand rupees, of which I paid eight thousand rupees to the broker.
A woman of fifty-two named Angeli Kazi, who looked older with her wrinkled face and grey hair, said: "I like to sell one of my kidneys because I am in dire need for money.
She added, "I am happy because I did that; I was in need of money and I got paid thirty-seven thousand rupees."
Some hospitals in India enjoy high medical and health standards, but since selling and buying human body parts are illegal, these "procedures are performed in total secrecy at low-standard hospitals where the death rate is high."
The decision, which was issued by the Jordanian Law Interpretation Court, headed by the Chief of the Appeal Court and two judges from the court, the Chief of the Legislation Court, and the Secretary-General of the Ministry of the Interior, as members, allows the government to disband these committees.
The societies appeared to be the spokesman for the Jordanian opposition.
Abu Al-Raghib said, during his meeting on Thursday with the chiefs of the societies, that the government "does not force anyone to normalize, just as it does not prevent anyone who wants to deal with any country with which we have bilateral relations."
At the time, Abu Al-Raghib accused the societies of "appointing themselves as a new authority within the state without any legal basis, and that they have gone as far as installing themselves as inspection courts and centers for issuing forgiveness documents" to whoever backs down from dealing with Israel.

Representative Mohammad Fnaish thought that "forcing the state to expedite the case of the cellular privatization led it to this format, which was questionable before," while Representative Ali Hassan Khalil contended that "the agreement of the President of the Republic Emile Lahoud and the Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri on this format serves the interests of the state and the treasury."
Therefore, we do not see in this format any guarantee to preserve this sum.
There is a question mark about this subject, which will be discussed in the Parliament where everything will be explained."
Does he see the decision as appropriate?
The more important thing than all of this is to adopt transparency, away from doubts in the matter of redistribution."
This deferral resulted from forcing the state compulsion to expedite privatization, and it is that direction is what led the state to this format and these results."
I think the adopted format is in the interest of the country.
The Information Office of President Al-Hoss issued the following statement:
In response to this overt deception, we must set things straight.
All hell broke loose in the face of our government through the media trumpets that are owned or controlled by the current Prime Minister, Mr. Rafiq Al-Hariri, alleging that what the government is warning about has the potential of harming the climates of investment in the country and turning off investors.
The decision was issued for revoking the arbitration clause in the cellular contract on 17/7/2001.
Then where were those who care about the investment environments in the country when the current government annulled two contracts before the end of their terms?
And it is wrong because it abandoned the principle of clearing what the states is owed by the companies and the compensations that they are due.
They also consulted each other on issues related to stimulating administrative work, in addition to subjects that will be put forward before the Parliament in  next week's session.
It also achieved a great success that we were all hoping for to demonstrate the international radiance that Lebanon and its capital have restored.
With my best wishes to your Excellency for health, happiness and success, I wish for your brotherly people welfare and prosperity under your wise leadership, with the highest tokens of my brotherly appreciation."
The anniversary of the Day of Independence calls for greatness and resistance for the dear Lebanese state. At this historical, fateful and delicate period the region is experiencing, it is the symbol of eternity and the fruit of determination for a resisting people for the sake of freedom, dignity, advancement and glory for the human society.
"Consultative Gathering of Religious Authorities" Calls For Liberating Jerusalem
- First: We offer Moslems in Lebanon and the world, especially in wounded Palestine, the warmest congratulations and blessings on the occasion of the impending blessed Eid Al-Fitr after the month of fasting and praying and asked the Lord to accept their deeds with our prayers that God Almighty may lift the oppression off of our people and brothers in Palestine so that they may attain their freedoms just like all of the peoples in the world.
It also deplores its re-siege of the Church of Nativity and violating its sanctity, as it did not too long ago, which affirms that this enemy does not respect the sanctity or stature of religious values, whether Christian or Islamic.
-Sixth: We salute the courageous positions of Presidents Lahoud and Al-Assad, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and the rest of the people of the region, and we call upon them to continue to support the Al-Aqsa Uprising so that righteousness and justice may prevail in the end.
They also consulted each other on issues related to stimulating administrative work, in addition to subjects that will be put forward before the Parliament in  next week's session.

After breakfast, Al-Hariri gave the following address: "We were used to meeting  in Ramadan at the Al-Maqasid Alumni Society's breakfast, and the meeting was always, and God willing, will always continue to be filled with love, brotherhood, openness and friendship.
Under the patronage of the Prime Minister, represented by the Minister of Economy and Trade, Basil Flaihan, the Chairman of the Board of the Lebanese-Canadian Bank, George Zard Abu Joudah, hosted a breakfast that was attended by representatives and activists.
The efforts of President Al-Hariri reached their potential in the solidarity of the ruling body and the follow-up by President Emile Lahoud.
Mansour Fears Impairing Presidency Role; Calls On Lahoud To Be Monitor, Not Partner
They intended through this atmosphere to sell the state's assets and pawning its resources quickly without discussion from anyone, under the pressure of collapse.
evidence on impairing the institutions is the meeting of the president of the republic and the prime minister for an hour and a half, while the ministers were awaiting its ratification...
He described the agreement that was concluded on the subject of the cellular as "a second scandal," because it infringes on the ruling of the State Consultative Council and the decision of the Accounting Office, through resorting to arbitration and blocking the possibility of pursuing all violations.
And after this swindling, then this came to tell the Lebanese: We drove you to collapse and we will force you to pay again, and you must tighten the belt to sell the state's assets and pawn its decisions.
The agreement that took place was giving in to the position of Rafiq Al-Hariri (...).
French President Jacque Chirac overlooked a lot of issues so that he can secure this cover and this support for Lebanon, therefore, this project cannot deviate from the right path, and consequently, all incoming money will be channeled to the Central Bank."
He contended "that the year 2004-2005 will be the zero year with regards to the budget deficit. The balance of payables is improving and the trade balance is shrinking relative to the deficit, and all these positive indications show that we are proceeding on the right path which will lead to political stability."
Astonished For Difference in Opinion Turning Into "Personal Dispute", "Tripoli Alliance" Calls For Return To Reason; Al-Safadi
However, since turning the discussion into a personal dispute harms the understanding of political action and the interests of the city, the Alliance  calls on everyone to return to the language of reason and dialogue so that we can achieve our objectives from the Tripoli Development Conference and put the issues that were included in the joint working paper up for discussion again, and seriously discuss with the government means for funding them, especially after the success of the Paris-2 Conference in securing development loans and in light of the prime minister's pledge to realize tangible results for Tripoli within six months.
He called for supporting the university "to return as it used to be; graduating the elite who built this country."
He hoped that "the second part of the Paris-2 contributions, in the amount of one billion and four-hundred million dollars and which has been allocated for investment projects, will be capable of turning the economic wheel so that the prospects for new job opportunities are open."
He called for "achieving that by the current government, or else, another government, capable of achieving this task, should emerge."
In view of the circumstances incited by the Council of Minister's resolution of the cellular telephone case, the Information Office of the Minister of Communications, Jean Lois Qardahi, issued the following statement, in response to the statement by the Secretary-General of the Supreme Privatization Council, Ghazi Yousef:
All documentation that the state presented to the Chamber aimed at reviewing the general status of the two contracts with the arbitrators without recognizing their authority to resolve the on-going dispute between the state and the two companies.
- Not adopting a proposal by one institution that called for freezing 25 percent of the total book values for risk allocation due to defects or deficiencies in the assets and other articles included in the two contracts.
- First: We respect the Lebanese Constitution, the judicial rulings and public code, whereas a legislation was issued that allowed the government to accept arbitration in contracts signed with others, and based on that, the adoption by the Supreme Privatization Council of an arbitration provision to resolve the disputes between the state and the operators of the two cellular telephone networks in the contract to be signed, and which deal with the transfer of all of the stocks of the two networks to the Lebanese government, was logical and provided a solution to a chronic problem, noting that this decision and through the arbitration provision, closed a chapter of disputes that lasted almost three years, during which the Lebanese government almost lost its credibility with investors.
After the Supreme Council had discussed the conditions, in the presence of the minister and with his acceptance, the conditions he now criticizes were adopted.
This international consulting firm, after assuring the Supreme Privatization Council that the results of arbitration will be in the state favor by a rate of 75 percent, turned around and abandoned the case due to the knowledge of the grave mistakes committed by the minister and his working team after the minister realized that his failure to pursue this case gave the two companies an almost favorable outcome to win the arbitrated conflict."
Al-Siniora gave a speech at dusk on Friday at the breakfast of the American University Alumni Association, Al-Bikaa Branch, at Park Hotel Chtoura, in which he summarized the repercussions of the war in Lebanon "where the total domestic product was reduced by two-thirds during the war years, and the public debt at the end of the year 1992 reached 3 billion dollars, the total state revenues did not exceed 350 million dollars, the deficit rate in its budget exceeded 50 percent of spending, the inflation rate was one hundred percent, and the interest rate was hovering between 30 to 70 percent. One of the results of this deterioration was the loss of confidence on the country and its future, internally and abroad (...)."
We did not ask for the impossible to get the possible but rather asked for the reasonable, and adopted the language of number, with all it carries in honesty and transparency, in reading reality and exploring the horizons of the future."
We see in it an embodiment for long-term efforts and sacrifices that we made, as a country and people, for the sake of boosting this trust in Lebanon, in the Lebanese and in the Lebanese economy.
Lets start from this simple popular proverb, "Necessity is the Mother of Invention", that was used as a rule a long time before the Galton studies (1869), which are considered among the first studies to "draw scientists' attention to geniuses" (1), and which made me pause for his extreme eloquence in expressing the fundamental core of the huge sum of cumulative assumptions over the course of more than a century on the subject of creativity, transcribing, or... renewal.
Armored vehicles were driving behind the demonstrators without interfering, and the troops were clearing the way for them.
Radio Baghdad announced the government's decision this morning to dissolve the five Iraqi parties, and they are: the Constitutional Union, the Popular Front, the National Democratic, the Independence and the Socialist Nation, and the banning of ten party and independent newspapers (...).
Nouri Al-Said's security was intensified, as reports received from the Police Directorate showed that there was a plot to assassinate him!
To whom does Camille Salama write his plays?
Camille Salama is stripping himself of the residues of age to remember what has been, with the wisdom of the kid that he was, so that he can repeat it, pure and good, and to use it to restore what indulgence and greed had spoiled by the triumph of good over evil.
They bring down the barriers between them and Luna, the life of the play with her charming laugh and her enthusiasm for "Ahh", the snowman she made and dressed with her cap and woolen scarf so it does not catch a cold from the outside.  Inside there is the flame of fire giving warmth, and "Ahh", the flame demon, does not get enough of the wood and wants to taste the curtains and the bedspreads.
Such a love is understood only by kids, since adults remember it, shed tears then forget it, "simply."
Directed By:
I rise to a bright sky, to the eyes of deer overflowing with flashes, to rainbows streaming in my soul.
When the eye is quenched over the fiery drink.
After peace gets together with dew drops and dates.
Or is it a kiss of a dove that brightened the soul, presenting gold to those who know.
The comers are like that summer which is yet to forget their shadows.
Flaunting your beads and the scented herbs.
Make me then walk on the day of torment to the wings of their twists; the edge is aging.
Help me with a kiss form the mouths of the sea to silence my collapse into the lap of the flame.
When the secretary general of the Iran Freedom Movement Ibraheem Yazdi returned to Iran after a medical trip that was extended by a court ruling to detain him in Tehran, many Iranians expected that he would not spend his first night in his home but rather in detention.
For the verbal pelting, exchange of accusations, and sharp statements represent the apparent face of these relations, while this issue moves in Iranian and American circles in an opposite direction, although it is still in the discussion phase without entering the stage of actual work.
And with whom is it being held in the United States?
As a result of that approval of his, he became a target for the arrows of the religious left and the extremist right at that time, which forced him to withdraw from any dialogue about the relationship with Washington, and particularly in the Khatami phase during which this issue became one of the tools of conflict and exchange of accusations between the reformists and the conservatives.
Mirdamadi emphasizes that such a dialogue can reduce the severity of tensions in the American-Iranian relationship.
The conference was attended by the head of the episcopal committee for media services Bishop Rolan Abu Juda, the head of the Christian education committee Bishop Francis Al-Beseir, the vice-president of the media committee Abbot Francois Eid, the manager of the Catholic media center Father Abdu Abu-Kasm, the administrator of the press branch Father Yusuf Munis, and a number of monks, nuns, and media people.
The message stopped at the positives of this new arena and its benefits with regard to culture in that "it is an open window on the world and presents marvelous opportunities for evangelism if used with efficiency and awareness of its strong and weak points."
Its broadcasting started a year ago and has distributed over 150 episodes annually, three times a week and over four years.
To him, a noun in the nominative case is in the accusative case, and what is in the accusative case is in the genitive, in addition to the hamzah, which was never in its right place, accordingto him and to other Egyptian literary figures.
When I asked one of the Egyptian colleagues at "Ash-Sharq Al-Awsat" about the reason he said: "by God I don't know.
And believe me if I tell you that I was "fired" from "Ash-Sharq Al-Awsat", where I was treated by those in charge of it with respect and love, because of my inability to go ahead with overlooking mistakes, which the Egyptians refuse to acknowledge, on the pretext that they are 60 million and they are free to do with the Arabic Language what they please!
He pointed out that the Municipal Council has not yet made a decision concerning naming the regions and streets due to the variance in points of view with regard to giving names, and that the work of the Municipality is focused on developing the region first.
* A source at the company explained that the conditions are set because the bill is considered personal, and no one but the owner of the line has the right to demand it.
One citizen asked advertising companies to refrain from pushing children into pamper commercials in the visual media, which damages pure Lebanese values, and must be stopped to protect the feelings of the Lebanese society.
Afterwards, Minister of Energy Muhammad Abd Al-Hamid Baidun told one of the journalists: "Our approach is for all means of transport in Lebanon to run on gas. I have sent a letter to the Standards and Specifications Organization in which I asked for specifications to be approved for car gas, so that there will be no violations of the Law.
With the onset of the Lebanese events, the Army took them over and based itself there. They became the headquarters for the Hasbiya Sector Command. Official organizations left them and were spread among private properties.
No sooner had the Council for the South completed a secondary school for the Hasbiya area in one of the neighboring pine forests than the students transferred to a new building and the buildings remained empty due to negligence, with no official interest, until the occupation of the area ended on the 24th of September 2000, when elements from State Security entered and took one of their wings as their security headquarters.

Paris-2
We do not know why some have chosen to link Paris-2 with the prevailing fashion in Lebanon these days, despite its misery and pettiness. In other words, "the Demonstration" and its prevention by threatening counter-demonstration; we turned into an example before "Paris-2 Demonstration."
It is not clear that the pleas launched by the prime minister the day before yesterday, which is not without a hidden hope, will find their way to the ears and minds while we are involved in divisions and conflicts, despite the general knowledge that it is not possible to help he who declines to help himself, and despite the fact that this simple intuitive logic poses true Lebanese questions stemming from Paris-2, including, for example:
Considering all of this, we are not exaggerating if we say that Al-Hariri seems as the Diogenes of his time but with two lanterns: a lantern for searching for support and backing to the "Paris-2 Demonstration", to try to save the international situation; and a lantern for betting on what's left of sense and sensibility internally in a way that "gives the country a chance" and affirms that we do have trust in ourselves, in our country and in our direction before we ask others to do the same.
He seemed, with a great deal of symbolism that is understood by the Lebanese, like the driver of an ambulance carrying the bleeding injured, which is the financial situation, and is trying to reach the hospital to save him, but it runs around amidst alleys and squares where shelling, sniper fire and ambushes never stop, as has been the case!
Then, the authority won, or so it believes.
This talk may be vague in a country that has gotten used to confusing the state and those holding on to it.
And if more than one question is posed on how were they assigned and who assigned them, they were not in any case commissioned to mismanage it.  Otherwise, they would have been suspected of abusing authority, which is a crime punishable by law.
The scenario is inspired directly by the experiences of totalitarianism around us: it starts by declaring martial laws on beliefs, which allows the making of a traitor out of anyone who thinks outside the flock, under the pretext that the region is going through a "critical period".  Then, it makes up non-present dangers, first, by attributing premeditated intentions to members of the opposition, and second, by instigating reactions to these presumed intentions by an outspoken minority for whom all platforms have been opened.
Perhaps then, the protective authority will be content with it as a permanent agent for it, and an easy tool for its wishes.
The civilization of the picture, this is what was said of the twentieth century, until we believed that the picture, whether it is photographic, cinematic or television, became stronger than the reality it reflects, or seeks inspiration from, or incites, or preserves in cans.
But the picture of what followed that moment disappeared.
It is wrong because what has been happening in the United States for a month now indicates that national mobilization, even nationalism, is capable of reaching a climax without being fed by scenes of the event that caused it.
This ethical trade rule is not the only factor behind the absence of pictures of the "World Trade Center" victims.
Because no one can follow this rule without withholding all the pictures, according to a number of journalists and European network officials.
No civilization and no picture.
It is a phenomenon that changes televisions into mere radios.
The chaos of news justifies the writing that is piling up on the screen?
The pictures are few and there is plenty of talk.
It agrees with it.
And so is the "Arab street" available for everybody.
A large delegation of Tripoli's Municipality workers, led by Syndicate President Sha'ban Khaddour visited "Tripoli Block" and were received by deputies Muhammad Al-Safadi and Muhammad Kabbara, as well as a representative of deputy Maurice Fadhel.

On 21 December serious charges of concealing funds and abuse of influence were brought against Marie-Danièle Faure, assistant to the former French Minister of the Interior Charles Pasqua, and Christiane, wife of MEP Jean-Charles Marchiani, on suspicion of conspiring to take possession of part of the supposed ransom.
The venue was kept secret at the request of both parties.
He added, "They are technical committees which will only discuss a ceasefire in the Nuba Mountains ... they are not peace talks."
Al-Atabani said that progress had been made on three of the points but that further discussion was required on some issues - a reference to the matter outstanding: avoiding bombing civilians in light of the recent breach of a commitment to maintain calm.
Danforth promised to include the comments of the Sudanese government in his report, which he will submit to the American administration following his visit to Sudan, which began last Saturday.
Two days after American Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs William Burns announced that no decision had been taken on Iraq by America, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said that Berlin would maintain "extreme caution" regarding the expansion of the American campaign against terrorism beyond Afghanistan because this would raise "serious questions" were it to include Iraq without there being evidence for Iraq's involvement in the 11 September attacks. Turkish Prime Minister Bolant Ajaweed is visiting Washington to discuss this and other issues.
He responded to the reports about the spread of the independence tendency in northern Iraq, saying, "We monitor all developments in the north of Iraq closely and take the measures necessary when the need arises."
Meanwhile, the Executive Director of the Oil for Food Program and Deputy UN Secretary-General Benon Sevan has began a three-week visit to Iraq - his first since August 2000.
Some believe that the accounts of these people could create tension in relations between Washington, where authorities have detained hundreds of Saudis for investigation, and Riyadh, which confirms that there is no evidence pointing to the involvement of its nationals, despite the belief that 15 of the 19 suicide attacks who carried out the attacks were from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
He added that his brother's wife and her brother were forced to kneel and restrained.
He said, "We must make a case and engage a lawyer."
It quoted sources in the Russian Defense Ministry, who said that the talks would continue for two days and would deal with strategic stability following the American decision on the 13th of last December to abandon the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty.
The three officers, General Boris Vadier, Commander Igor Tigonov and Colonel Mikhael Levchenko, who worked in the Ministry of the Interior, face a charge of "negligence resulting in death", the maximum sentence for which is five years.
It was the worst loss life of Russian forces in a single incident since the beginning of the Chechen conflict.
The failure of diplomatic efforts threatens to escalate the Colombian civil war, which has been on-going for 38 years.
LeMoyne told journalists before the meeting, "We believe that if we can make progress, the two sides can then resume talks very soon."
He told journalists in Los Buzas, "There is no magic solution to the present crisis."
New Delhi Confirms to Zu: Beijing Relations Unaffected by Beijing-Islamabad Co-operation
He added that India and China had made progress towards clarifying and confirming the actual monitoring line, which is tantamount to the ceasefire line that followed the war into which the two countries entered in 1962.
The two governments signed cooperation agreements between tourism officials in the two countries, to open a chain of hotels and to set up tourist offices.
The presence of 120 thousand exiled inhabitants of the Chinese region of Tibet in India represents a source of tension in relations between India and China.
Zu is to visit Bombay, India's financial capital, and Bangalor, its technological center, where numerous Chinese companies operate.
This document is included in a book entitled "The History of the Nobles who Ruled the Two Holy Places", which was written by Abdullah Muhammad Abd Al-Shakur, a Hijaz scholar, in the nineteenth century.
The newspaper took this to mean that "neither the Ottoman State nor Turkey had any connection of any kind to the Ajyad fortress, other that it came under Ottoman rule, as was the case with the other Arab areas and countries".
It is expected to be finished in 2005.
At present, markets are spread over 180 thousand square meters around the Mosque, whilst the Plan provides for the creation of commercial centres covering 660 thousand square meters.

Before leaving the White House, Bush, aged 55, assured journalists that he felt "great" and that his health was "very good".
He quoted him as saying that he believed he only lost consciousness for a few seconds because when he looked at his dogs, "They were in the same position.
Colonel Tubb clarified that the medical examination had demonstrated that Bush was well.
The cause of what Bush suffered was his body sending a signal to the heart via the lung nerves, causing the heart rate to slow and lose of consciousness.
Dough-based products are well known across the world, but they are usually sweet, not savory, and soft, not hard, like the biscuit that became caught in the American President's throat.
There he exchanged jokes with workers about his loss of consciousness and confirmed that he supported opening markets and creating new job opportunities.
Amman, Basil Rafayaah:
He said, "The most important foundation of the Government Program of Work is to bring about economic development," and called for it to confront the economic crisis from which the Kingdom has suffered for five years. "Let the provision of a respectable living for citizens be the first priority, and let probity and competency be the standard for taking public position, for there can be no place for corruption, favoritism and personal consideration in the progress of national work."
The new government included the former Director of Jordanian Intelligence, Mustafa Al-Qaisi, who is appointed Secretary Of State for the Prime Minster's Affairs; Chancellor of the Jordanian University Dr Walid Al-Maani, given the Higher Education and Scientific  Research Portfolio; former Minister of Tourism Muhammad Naash Al-Adwa, awarded the Information portfolio; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Secretary General Shaher Pak, who takes responsibility for Secretary of State for foreign Affairs; and the poet and writer Haidar Mahmoud, appointed Minister of Culture.
An Example from Pakistan
Yesterday, General Parvez himself, now Prime Minister and responsible for Pakistan's general policy, went to the people to offer the greatest concession to India: to commit himself to dismantling the military infrastructure of the Kashmiri resistance movements and prevent "cross-border operations".
The Musharraf of 1999 is the same as that of 2002.
The Lahud political and propaganda machine continues to present this event as evidence of the General's sound reading of the correct national posture. It has been employed elsewhere to settle political accounts with the former President of the Republic Ilyas Al-Harawi and Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri.
And there is a long time between May 2000 and September 2001: Lebanon's legal status has changed.
America is closer to Israel and is on the point of accusing us all of terrorism.
Following 11 September India, after half a century, has gained international support for labeling the Kashmiri resistance "cross-border terrorism".
Despite the fact that he knows that he may pay with his life for this spurt of rationality, rationality which Pakistan has lacked for a long time.
But here too the world is not the same.
Contacts are taking place away from the spotlights with the aim of sounding out views on the possibility of progressing negotiations on the Lebanese and Syrian tracts should talks continue to stumble on the Palestinian front as a result of the continued exchange of violence and the failure to reach agreement on a durable ceasefire.
At the same time, an agreement between Israel on the one hand, and Syria and Lebanon on the other, might give impetus to and speed up the agreement between Israel and Palestinian Authority to prevent the Authority from being the only party outside the peace process.
Resolving the Palestinian question is thus the key to resolving the other issues that make up the Middle East crisis, but solving all the other issues is not the key to resolving the Palestinian question, the solution of which would pave the way for a comprehensive peace.
But full peace in the region can only be achieved by agreement between all the parties, the Palestinian Authority, Syria and Lebanon in particular, and with such an agreement, the problem of Palestinian refugees would have been solved.
"The Electricity Utility is Bankrupt.
If the story of the "life-belt" represents a difficulty that has yet to be resolved, despite the sufferings faced by the people in the bleak midwinter, what about the problem of collection or that of securing the funds necessary for the fuel?
Of course, Kamal Al-Hayek and his colleagues in the new department deserve a chance to try to remedy the chronic semi-paralysis, but the costs of this opportunity are more than the financial capability of the state can bear and more than those people who pay the bills can imagine. They continue to pay, whilst others do not, causing the debts to rise, the burdens to accumulate and the impudent and sick state of bankruptcy to spread.
We do not know how to interpret the words of Deputy Qabbani when he says, "It is the duty of the Electricity Utility to collect and to improve collection by any means, and if there is a need to use force, then let it be so...the legal and security agencies can be called upon."
We do not know why people in Lebanon are waiting to organize themselves into a silent and civilized revolution, initially to stop paying electricity bills and the concession companies hanging on to the mother company, at least so that we can see what those who do not pay or those who squander the current by virtue of social standing, force, authority, revolt or indolence, will do!
It is not the content of what Rod-Larsen said, which is nothing new, that is worth noting - it has been stated on previous occasions and reiterated by UN officials more than once, and Syria knows the UN position and the legal reasons on which it is based - but given that Damascus had affirmed that the area is Lebanese territory, one would have assumed, at least, not a response to Rod-Larsen but confirmation that Syria stands firm in its position that the Shabaa Farms are Lebanese.
And the "prohibition" imposed on it has been lifted in order for it take up this seat, which it last occupied 30 years ago.
This Syrian refusal to discuss with Rod-Larsen this issue in public, according to what is known about his discussions with Syrian officials, has in turn led to  a Lebanese refusal to enter into a similar debate, bearing in mind that Rod-Larsen reiterated in Beirut that, from the perspective of the Security Council, the occupied Shabaa Farm land is Syria, and this did not provoke the rancor of those concerned as it used to do.
What was noticeable in the speech of the American President, and in the recent statements made by his National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, was their accusation against Iran and Hizbollah of involvement in the case of the ship smuggling weapons to the Palestinians and the accusation made against Iran of supporting terrorism without any reference or allusion to Syria, bearing in mind that both Iran and Syria remain on the American list of states supporting terrorism.
Damascus knows and has studied these changes more than most countries. The evidence lies in the many signs it has shown after the pressure to disband Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other Islamic organizations with a presence in Syria, for we can say that Damascus has not literally abided by them, but nor has it ignored them either.
The Lebanese may have grown used to this from their leaders, and may not expect anything better, but the image put out to the Arabs has inevitably lost much of its credibility,  if not become a laughing stock.
If this is true, then thank God and let us hope that Musa succeeds in resolving the intricacies caused by the previous position of the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, which have become problem in themselves.
Because the Arab summit is the best thing that could happen to a Lebanon fearful of pressures, even when the Syrian stances towards the summit topics, resistance and terrorism, are enough to dissipate, at very least, some of the Lebanese fear.
General Musharraf's Experience Infectious
The first was to resist and fail to respond to the Americans.
The second was to respond to the Americans and subsequently gain their varied support and guarantee their intervention at the appropriate moment to resolve the long-standing problems between India and Pakistan, or at least prevent it from escalating and developing into a full-scale war.
Certainly not. The deterioration that has brought India and Pakistan to the brink of a harsh conventional war, which could quickly develop into a non-conventional war if one or both of the two states found that their interest required this to avoid massive loss or defeat, has mobilized the streets of Pakistan for a nationalist goal after they had been mobilized over the past few years, in particular the last four months, in pursuit of an Islamist end. This has demonstrated that Islamic fundamentalists could lead Pakistan to disaster, which has allowed General Musharraf to carry out what he has clearly labeled a "revolution" against the situation which had prevailed in his country for many years and it will allow him to turn Pakistan into a moderate Islamic state, one with an essential role to play in the region and in confronting terrorism there.
A meeting of interests is closer to reality than the scenarios and conspiracies that are formulated and prepared in dark, closed rooms.
This is not easy because the conditions in one Islamic state differ from those in another and because reason dictates that Musharraf be given a reasonable amount of time to see whether his experiment will succeed.
The Lebanese can express their happiness and joy in the usual way; for example, by using the car horn in the streets and by setting off fireworks in residential areas.
And then the matter was decided and everything was put in place.
And who else but Beirut has this loud voice and this standing in the world?
And with confirmation, determination and decisiveness, Lebanese messengers are bearing to Kings, Presidents and Princes a rare Lebanese decision, the like of which they have not borne before.
And so they would sit so that we could stand nervously.
Scandal of Weapons Ship by President Salim Al-Hiss; Salim Al-Hiss.
America, as usual, rushes to justify Israeli savagery: Secretary of State Colin Powell declares that these Israeli attacks are no more than defensive measures.
What is the position of states overlooking the Red Sea, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Yemen and Jordan, towards this incident?
Is it not possible that this incident has been fabricated by Israel to condemn and embarrass the Palestinian Authority before international public opinion and make it responsible for challenging the American initiative to put an end to the violence in the Occupied Territories?
Notwithstanding the great gulf that separates the Palestinian position of resisting the occupation of its territory and the confiscation of its liberty from that of Israel, which deploys all these weapons to retain territory it has captured, put an end to Palestinian right to self-determination and finish off the Palestinian question, which is supposed to be the Arabs' central issue.
In any case, we believe that the Palestinian Intifada does not need weapons to achieve its aims.
The scene of the child Muhammad Durrah being martyred had greater impact in the world than any subsequent armed operation carried out by Palestinian resistance.
The Palestinian revolutions must, in other words, be the revolution of all Arabs.
Are not the savage Israeli operations against civilians, leaving dozens of Palestinian refugee families homeless, terrorist acts?
New Delhi Makes Withdrawal of Troops Conditional on Musharraf Translating Words into Action, Islamabad.
But he added that India was not looking at the present time to use force in the crisis, which began following the attacks on the Indian parliament on 13 December. New Delhi attributed the attacks to the two Kashmiri groups "Askar Tibah" and "Jaish Muhammad", which are based in Pakistan. He said, "We are not looking to use force and we are at present examining the possibility of resolving this crisis by diplomatic efforts."
But there was conflicting information about whether the source of shooting was separatists or Indian troops.
They said that Indian units had begun shelling at 17:45 (12:45 GMT) without provocation and had targeted the villages of Digwar, Shirikut and Sahrian in the region of Bag, in the south of Pakistani Kashmir.
The main separatist alliance in Indian Kashmir called on New Delhi to respond positively to Musharraf's proposal for a resumption of dialogue.
He was asked whether the campaign of suppression mounted against Islamic groups in Pakistan would affect the separatist movement in Indian Kashmir. He replied that the struggle for self-determination had begun before the intervention of foreign groups and activists.
He said that Powell, whose tour would include India, Japan and Kabul, would hold "bilateral talks" with Musharraf and Foreign Minister Abd Al-Sattar.
The Council of Ministers will discuss in its meeting the day after tomorrow (Thursday) an agenda comprising 21 items, the most important of which include a draft decree to establish a Union of Municipalities in the Ukkar district and a document setting out demands submitted by the Union of Independent Interests Syndicates and Public Institutions to the Ministry of Work.
3. Draft Law to annex services of employees in the Lebanese University, who were deemed to have resigned but subsequently returned to effective service (sent to ministers on 08/01/2002).
6. Draft Decree to amend Decree number 6698, dated 12/11/2001, exempting a stolen vehicle being returned to Sheikh Abd Al-Malik bin Kayid Al-Qasmi from customs duties.
9. Draft Decree to establish a Union of Municipalities in the Ukkar district, Governorate of Northern Lebanon.
13. Request by the Ministry of Social Affairs for approval of the signature of the optional protocol to the "Ending All Forms of Discrimination against Women" Agreement.
a) The first aims to oblige a company to estimate the value of compensation due following termination of the two cell phone contracts.
18. Request by the Ministry of the Interior and Municipalities for approval to secure the credit necessary and authorization to take all measures to conduct elections for members of rural councils deemed to have disbanded, to have lost one quarter of their members or to be newly-established.
Invitation to Participate in Media Conference in Tehran; Subhani Visits President of Editors Syndicate: Unity and Resistance are Lebanon's Guarantees.
Karam thanked Subhani for the invitation and said, "It is our pleasure to participate with our brothers in Iran in their constructive activities, which stem from the faith and stances adopted by Iran at difficult moments. Lebanon is indebted to Iran for many of its stances, which have helped it triumph and assisted it at the difficult times it has known.
Lebanon, Syria, Palestine and the remaining states of the region are thus coming under many pressures, but what is of most concern to us is to stress that submission to Israeli volition and provision of any concession to Israel cannot satisfy Israel's increasing desires and insatiable appetite. In fact, these concessions will encourage them to seek greater retreats and concessions, for which there are no limits.
Lebanon must use all its strength to work to maintain the hidden strength represented by the resistance.
The only logic it has is that of the military machine.
I have known Jan Ghanim since the beginning of the 1980s, if not before then, through friends and acquaintances in Hamana as "Jano", the name that stuck with him until his death,
He came to prominence in his parliamentary activities with the national defense and health committees.
From the security committee to the Brigade Headquarters, where he took part in the uprising of the "forces" on 12 March 1985 against Party leader at the time Aili Karamah, along side Habiqah and Jaajaa. From that time the Kataib and the "Forces" came to be on separate sides.
Jan Ghanim's heart stopped yesterday at the Heart of Jesus Hospital following a coma that had lasted for about two weeks as a result of a traffic accident in Al-Hazimiyyah.
He graduated as a doctor specializing in treating diabetes and glandular disorders in 1975 from Lyons University in France.
He called for the unity of Lebanon, an end to violence and war, and rejected sectarianism.
For more than 25 years he worked in humanitarian and health services at disability centers and clinics.
Ministerial sources have reported that Lebanon has rejected a proposal from Secretary-General of the Arab League Amr Musa to postpone what he has termed since his arrival at Beirut Airport on Sunday afternoon "confirmation of the Summit venue".
They said that as far as Qatar was concerned, the matter was not certain because the Embassy in Beirut had contacted an official to enquire about hotels and reservations from now for members of its delegation to the 14th regular Arab summit.
The statements issued by Lahud and Al-Hariri were judged to be an official public response to Musa and to Libya's attempts, which were based on a significant maneuver with a major Arab country, according to information available to officials about what Libyan agents at the Arab League were doing under the leadership of Abd Al-Munaim Al-Huni.
They believed that the Prime Minister had gone further than was necessary in his official statement, since Musa had not asked for Gaddafi to be named.
No one will be allowed to enter without official permission.
President of the Republic Emil Lahud has reviewed conditions in the country with Deputy Michel Al-Murr. During the meeting current developments and Lebanon's position towards them were assessed and a number of domestic political topics were put forward.
The President of the Republic met with the Minister for Young People and Sport, Sipoh Hufnaniyan, who reviewed with him the general conditions and the projects prepared by the Ministry in the area of organizing sport work.
In the evening Lahud met with Deputy Qablan Isa Al-Khuri, who provided him with an overview dealing with most of the topics of the moment.
"As you return to the land of the fraternal State of Kuwait, after recovering from the health indisposition from which you suffered, it is my pleasure, both in my name and that of the people of Lebanon, to congratulate your Highness on your full recovery and to congratulate the fraternal people of Kuwait on the return of its dearly beloved Amir, safe and well, to the homeland.
President Lahud reviewed with the Director of the Army Intelligence Services, Brigadier Rimon Azar, the security situation in the country.
The tour of Arab League Secretary-General Amr Musa yesterday to Emil Lahud, President of the Republic, Nabih Birri, Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Rafiq Al-Hariri, Prime Minister, and Mahmoud Hamud, Minister of Foreign Affairs, took on a dual importance in view, on the one hand, of the positions announced by these officials, which have crystallized into a consensus to hold the Arab Summit in Beirut on the date set and to unify the official message on the Summit, and on account of the Libyan position, which demands that the summit be moved from Beirut to Cairo, on the other.
President of Editors Syndicate Milham Karam yesterday met at the association's headquarters with Iranian Ambassador Muhammad Ali Subhani and First Advisor at the Embassy Abu Al-Hasan Zaafari in the presence of a number of members of the association's board.
Following the meeting Buiz said, "The visit was to exchange felicitations on the feasts with the Patriarch. Of course, it was an opportunity to discuss the matters from which the country suffers and complains, whether these be political or economic, or relate to the people's circumstances and services. I believe that the conclusion of the discussion was that we have arrived at a catastrophic economic situation in the country."
He was asked what they had discussed in the meeting.
President Bashir Al-Jamil, for whom Jan Ghanim was his right-hand man, called him "Jano". Former Minister Ilyas Habiq used to call him "Jano" from before the time he became leader of the Lebanese Forces and Dr Samir Jaajaa, despite the differences between them, also called him "Jano".
He came across as a senior official authority, giving reassurance that Lebanese American relations had not been affected by the differences in views on terrorism.
Following his meeting yesterday with Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri, Minister of the Economy Basil Falihan confirmed, "The Partnership Agreement with the European Union will strengthen economic relations with Europe and open its markets to Lebanese products."
He then met with Deputy Ayub Hamid, followed by Director General of State Security, Maj. Gen. (Staff) Edward Mansur and artist Mansur Al-Rahbani.
A number of agriculturalists from the same area brought the same complaint to Junbulat and told him that they could not face up to foreign products constantly sweeping the markets and damaging local agriculture.
Junbulat concluded his tour with a meeting held in the village of Al-Dabiyah, attended by Deputy Nabil Al-Bustani, and with a visit to the church of Jadra village, accompanied by head of the village council Father Joseph Al-Qazzi.
It indicated that Abu Asim was the most promising in view of his professional competence, especially after the proposal to appoint an alternative from outside the holders of Foreign Affairs positions was dropped.
Will Al-Sadr Return from Palestine or Libya?
This is the real problem facing the coming Arab summit, not that of Imam Al-Sadr.
The role of the Arab Summit to be held in Beirut (if that is what Israel wants!) is to incite the believers (as in the Al-Sadr speech) to the sanctity of the Palestinian cause and not to trade it, despite the fact that such "faith" has become a charge for which one can be detained in the world, including some of the Arab world.
Kuwait Embassy Responds to Iraqi Minister: His Country Feigns Ignorance of the Prisoner Resolutions
Al-Shawish says that the Kuwaiti statements are inaccurate when the issue of the prisoners is the one of most concern to Kuwait and at the top of its priorities. Iraq, meanwhile, ignores all the humanitarian calls for their fate to be revealed. It further ignores all international decisions and Security Council resolutions  concerning the prisoners, which stipulate that they be freed without restriction or condition (Resolution 686 (1991), paragraph (c); Resolution 687/1991, paragraph 30; and Resolution 1284/1999).
How can our statements be inaccurate when there is nothing dearer to us, the Kuwaitis, than to reach a realistic formula to end this humanitarian disaster, which has been on-going for 11 years and which has affected more than 600 Kuwaiti and Arab households?
How can the statements of Kuwaiti officials be inaccurate when a number of Arab officials have tried to involve themselves as mediators in this matter and were accepted, unfortunately with procrastination, postponement and falsification of the facts by the Iraqi side? Perhaps Syrian President Bashar Al-Asad and the former Secretary-General of the Arab League Ismat Abd Al-Majid know the truth of the matter.
The occupying forces (and the Iraqi regime in this instance) are responsible for the conditions, the inhabitants and the prisoners of war in the occupied territory.
Mr Al-Shuwaish says that Iraq took the initiative to effect a positive resolution of the issue under the aegis of the Arab League and under the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and that Iraq has 1137 files relating to the number of Iraqi prisoners in Kuwait.
What is striking is that the Iraqi regime should remember that it has 1137 missing Iraqis in Kuwait six years after Kuwait's liberation.
If Iraq is prepared to turn over this painful page from our history, why does it not cooperate with the tripartite committee, which was convened with the approval and participation of, and under the aegis of the United Nations pursuant to Security Council Resolutions 686 (1991) and 1284 (1998), and is permitted to investigate this humanitarian issue?
At the invitation of the Association of Al-Butrun Village Leaders ("Al-Nahar"), village leaders from the province met for dinner at the Samarna Restaurant in the town of Samar Jubail. Deputies Butrus Harb and Sayid Aql, Governor of the North Nasif Qalush, Head of the Maronite archdiocese of Al-Butrun Archbishop Bulus Emil Saada, Administrative Officer for Al-Butrun Ilham Al-Duwaihi Al-Hajj, and a number of officials from the Al-Butrun and Duma offices attended.
He promised, "The Association of Village Leaders will always work for the service of the public interest and would be one hand to assist the administration.
Governor Qalush spoke and congratulated the village leaders on the formation of their association. He covered the role of the village leader "who keeps in touch with the daily lives of the people and is with them from the cradle to the grave, with the people electing him and he organizing birth, marriage and death certificates, in addition to his administrative role".
The municipal police opened this link road to cars under the supervision of the Head of the Municipality Samir Shaarani after the Emergency Workshop repaired the fractured water main in cooperation with the Tripoli Water Department and prepared the road to reduce congestion.
* The Municipality of Al-Duwair (Al-Nabatiyyah) called inhabitants of the town who wished to surface their private roads, from which three or more homes would benefit within the jurisdiction of the municipality, to submit applications at the municipality headquarters for an inspection and subsequent surfacing.
"Despite one and a half years passing since the drawing of the international southern border, which was carried out by the United Nations, following the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon, and the establishment of the so-called "Blue Line", which was accompanied at the time by Lebanon expressing reservations about territory from which Israel had not withdrawn, in particular in the towns of Al-Adisah, Ramish and Al-Ghajar-Al-Abbasiyyah", a problem confronts the inhabitants of Al-Adisah: their inability to gain access to 3000 Dunums of their agricultural land due to the international force closing the areas and agricultural land which separates their town from the Israeli settlement of Maskafaam with barbed wire left behind by the Israelis. In addition, an iron gate has been set up across the road which links the town with the land referred to and surrounded by barbed wire and mine fields, thereby indirectly making it a buffer zone and line of defense for the Israeli settlement. Entry to this territory requires prior permission from the headquarters of the International Force in Al-Naqurah due to security concerns and on account of the mine fields.
Commenting on this, Deputy Qasim Hashim said, "...Since the United Nations declared the Blue Line following the withdrawal of Israeli forces, Lebanon has expressed reservations at this situation at more than one point, predominantly the Shabaa Farms and the Kafr Shuba hills, in addition to various areas of land along the Blue Line, notably that of the town of Al-Adisah..."
The Israelis occupied 1800 dunums in 1976 and reoccupied 1200 dunums in 1983.
The weather prevailing over Lebanon for the last three days has been cloudy at times, clear at others. The cold has been everywhere, whether ice in the peaks or very cold air on the coasts.
The total rainfall this year is 399 mm, which compares with 192 mm for this time last year.
It may continue or stop on account of the wind, which plays with the weather as it wishes.
It called on the Lebanese authorities and the security agencies "to stop these practices".
In the desolate area of Aliyyah and Al-Matan Al-Ala ("Al-Nahar") snow-ploughing and road-opening operations have continued, notably in Kafr Al-Salwan, Hamdun Al-Mahattah, Hamdun Al-Dayaah, Balshamaiya, Aliyyah and the villages of the "Hamdun-Al-Jard Al-Ala Union".
For this reason, most of the schools in Aliyyah and the area of Al-Jard and Al-Matan Al-Ala closed.
Pupils were unable to reach their schools in the morning out of fear of slipping.
One week after the snowstorm the opening of all mountain village roads in the area of Rashiya ("Al-Nahar) was completed; however, the accumulation of ice on most of them, has prevented citizens from moving about early in the day. School pupils only reached their schools at 10:00 am.
Following the National Anthem, Archbishop Saada gave a speech focusing on "the importance of the responsibility entrusted to the village leader
Elsewhere, the United Nations Media Office issued the following statement: "After a calm that has lasted 10 days, 9 Israeli military aircraft breached the Blue Line on three occasions on Sunday, the 13th of the present month of January.
Ukkar - "Al-Nahar"
Citizens from the Al-Makhul Street, in the Farah, Qansu and Abu Shaqra buildings, have complained about the power cuts, which continue for several hours, when the supply is available in neighboring streets. They have demanded that it be provided in theirs.
At this time, it also became apparent that the officer was absent and that the person charged with dealing with Division 19 complaints in the Company had been transferred to another, unspecified Directorate.
I repeatedly contacted those responsible at the Utility, but they have done nothing despite their promises to me.
He pointed out that, from the technical point of view, the water will not reach the point where the meter is presently installed, i.e. a high point in an agricultural building.
From Amin Muhammad Tabbarah
"With reference to my previous letter, I can now tell you that the Municipal Council of Beirut has recently begun to restore lighting in Al-Istiqlal and Al-Jazair streets and to repair the faults there.
Unusually, however, the Israeli tale of the operation to capture Karin A has not been woven well.
This haste to announce the arrests at the first sign of American pressure nullified all the arguments about the capability to acquire weapons from the Israelis themselves and the troubled relationship with Tehran, and put the Authority in the position of one found guilty of a crime that has been witnessed at first hand.
What Powell did not say was said by other American officials, who did not hesitate to stick the charge on the Authority, Iran and Hizbollah collectively without any evidence, as if they were preparing to target them with a single stone in order to save time and effort in a rapidly changing, take-away world.
And between Arafat's attempts to escape from the Israeli rock and his failure to comply fully with the American will, the Palestinians find themselves in an Arab climate very different to the reality of 1948.
Most countries suffer from judicial overload resulting from the accumulation of cases before the courts, the slow speed with which legal disputes are settled and the delays in issuing judgments. This gives rise to many problems, not least of which is the feeling of the litigators that slow justice is injustice or, at very least, that truth does not prevail. This has serious consequences to the extent of social instability, a feeling of insecurity and unease, a disturbance in transactions between citizens, the resort to illegal means, the hindering of desired progress and development, and, above all, trust is shaken in the judicial authority, giving rise to serious consequences for public order and the social hierarchy.
1. The article states, "But the Minister of the Economy at that time, who is our Minister of Finance today, has transformed Syria in seven years to a giant state of solid, strategic production," using sarcasm instead of purposeful scientific method. You should know that Dr Muhammad Al-Atrash was only Minister of the Economy for 1 year and 11 months and went by the title of Minister of the Economy and Foreign Trade pursuant to Decree 3 (14/01/1980). He remained in this position until 02/12/1981, when a new ministry was formed under Decree 747 (3/12/1981), of which he was not part.
Of course, Dr Muhammad Al-Atrash does not attribute this high rate to himself alone: it was the combined efforts of the government, institutions and individuals, in addition to other objective circumstances.
We ask you to look at and publish this clarification in your respected newspaper.
As many do not know the extent of the effect of changing petrol types on a vehicle, it may be useful to give a brief presentation on this important topic.
- There is no link between the use of lead-free petrol and engine problems, such as knocking or deficient burning of the petrol after ignition.
The use of lead-free petrol aims to improve the environment by limiting the emission of harmful gases from the exhausts of vehicles running on leaded petrol, which, in turn, limits the health problems linked to the use of leaded petrol.
- We can use lead-free petrol safely in small internal combustion engines, such as motorcycle engines provided that such engines are compatibles with lead-free petrol.
It was nominally closed at an average published price of 1507.50 lira, as it has been for more than 2 years and 4 months.
However, to date, this has not provoked a wave of speculation on an increase in European currencies, the Euro and Sterling in particular, notably following the study published yesterday by National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies, which indicated that industrial activity in the Euro region continued its fall last month. At the same time, it was apparent that the number of unemployed in Germany touched on 4 million for the same period and British industrial production fell by 0.3% in November and 4.8% annually.
- 1.4495 against Sterling, compared with 1.4480.
In line with this move, silver fell with one ounce closing at 4.62 dollars in London, compared to 4.6910 dollars last Friday in New York, after it had settled at 4.65 dollars in the afternoon.
Wall Street and Nasdaq continued their fall due to the impact of Greenspan's speech on the one hand and the fears linked to the seasonal results to be published this week for large companies, such as Intel, Microsoft, IB
The Tokyo exchange was closed due to an official holiday.
In his speech, Al-Qassar referred to the continuing contributions of the Arab Trade Funding Program to encourage trade exchange between Arab states "whether at the level of providing basic information about Arab trade, or at the level of providing the funding necessary for import and export operations". He believed that these contributions were in line with the Arab moves to establish a free Arab trade zone.
He believed that the permanent development of Arab economic labor organization in the manner seen with the Arab Trade Funding Program constitutes the cornerstone for the process of establishing integration on firm foundations to ensure the best for the Arab states.
He spoke about the signing of another agreement with the Lebanese-French Bank to a value of 12 million dollars, which will increase volume of cooperation and facilities provided by the Program to agencies and banks, in the service of the Lebanese economy.
In reply to a question about the Arab states benefiting from the Program, Al-Manai said that most countries of the region were benefiting from the contributions of the Program: "Five years ago, we were dealing with 18 agencies (or banks) and now we have 129 Arab banks, which confirms the comprehensive nature of the cover and that facilities are not limited to any one country".
He pointed out that the Arab Trade Funding Program had begun with capital of 500 million dollars, which had now risen to about 700 million, "bearing in mind that we are keen to distribute profits to shareholders regularly".
Following two weeks of improvement, ready liquidity in the lira fell by 10 billion from the week between 28 December and 3 January as a result of a fall in the volume of money in circulation and a reduction in deposits on demand.
1. Ready liquidity in lira (1) recorded a fall of 10 billion, as a result of a fall in the volume of money in circulation by 8 billion and a reduction in deposits on demand by 2 billion lira.
4. Development of the cash block in its wider sense (4) over the year reached 4.38%.
1 = cash in circulation + deposits on demand.
Cash rule = cash outside Bank of Lebanon + current banking deposits with Bank of Lebanon + term banking deposits with the Bank of Lebanon.
Egypt is thus required to make available 1.6 billion dollars annually to resolve its chronic unemployment problems given that the cost of one job opportunity is 50,000 pounds."
Kuwaiti Fund Delegation Visit Lahud and Birri; Al-Humaidi: New Loan Today to Complete Funding of Al-Laitani Project at Birri Birri.
Lahud was acquainted with the work of the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development and the projects that it funds but which are executed by government departments under the supervision of the Development and Construction Council by Al-Humaidi.
"I had the honor of meeting Speaker Nabih Birri. The aim of the visit was to inform His Excellency about the work of the Kuwait Fund.
And as we promised, the agreement, under which the Kuwait Fund will provide a loan of 20 million dinars to fund the project, in addition to other contributions from the Arab Fund, will be signed.
We note that the first operation under which it attacked Lebanon in 1978 was called Operation Al-Laitani.
In this context appears a new book by Abd Al-Qadir Al-Jannabi, who, in addition to being a poet, continues to follow his career along another path, which does not conflict with that of his innovation.
Al-Rumaihi says that his confidence in Prince Khalid is great on account of the latter's long experience in cultural work and describes the Institute as promising and embodying the meeting of Arab capital and Arab culture.
The poet says, "Even the colors of the painting, the blue of the virgin's dress, the natural emerald and the absolute redness of the Dracula red, replays the essential musical notes which are at the heart of our being human and our desire to escape everything that limits us...". Bonfoi asks whether, apart from our desires and outside reality and its conventional forms, there is anything beyond the Self, a Word or Divine existence?
We can say that it is a cloud that has been able to take different forms through history without change to its content, as happened, for example, in the children's story of Snow White, who slept for a hundred years in a miraculous wait for love and its appearance in the form of a brave knight on a white horse coming from a vivid red horizon.
The military court had issued a ruling last November declaring that it did not have the jurisdiction to continue to examine the case.
Whereas, on the basis of the provisions of Article 8 of the Law of Public Exemption number 84/91, from the date they were perpetrated, all crimes of assassination or attempted assassination of political leaders committed prior to 27/03/1991 are deemed to have been referred to the Council of Justice for judgment;
Therefore, we charge persons unknown as having perpetrated at the Mari Jirjis Monastery, Aukar, and on a date for which the period has not yet expired, an assassination attempt on the leader and members of the Lebanese Front, which included President Kamil Shamaun and other political leaders.
Palestinian Rima Salih Saad, aged 30, attempted to kill Laila Hasan al-Jardali, aged 37, wife of her employer, dentist Jamal Muhammad Rashid Salim Hamud, aged 46, in her home in the village of Al-Hilaliyyah, east of Sidon, by stabbing her repeatedly with a knife, before throwing her to the floor struggling in her blood.
Two months ago  she stole the keys to the dentist's home from his clinic and made a copy of the house key. On 10/01/2002, whilst the dentist and his family were away from home, she went there, stole the jewelry of his wife Laila. She then set fire to the house and sold the jewelry in the market to Husain Ali Gh.
To carry out her plan, after having learnt that Laila Al-Jardali was not at home, she asked the dentist to excuse her whilst she went home to change her clothes, which were covered in oil. He agreed and, carrying a stick and a knife, she hired a car to the dentist's home in Al-Hilaliyyah. She entered the house and waited for Laila's return. On her return she savagely attacked her and hit her repeatedly with the stick. She then tore her dress and stole three of her gold rings, one of which was inlaid with precious diamond stones. She then stabbed her with the knife as the victim begged for mercy and compassion, stabbing her six times. She then left the house after locking it with the key and threw away the knife, the stick and the keys in the public road.
They were arrested and the stolen jewelry was seized with them. They claimed that they had purchased the jewelry after the Palestinian Rima had claimed that she owned it and that she needed the  money.
they left their residence documents and Rima was remanded to trial on the charge of attempting to kill her employer's wife, set fire to the house and steal the jewelry. The crime confirms to provision 549 of the Punishments Law and the death penalty is prescribed.
The second individual assisted the first in stealing vehicle cassette players and other effects inside the vehicle. Both sold the effects and divided the money between them.
The Public Relations Department of the Internal Security Forces have distributed the following announcement: " The Directorate General of the Internal Security Forces, pursuant to the instruction of the Public Appeal Prosecutor in the south, Jamil Bairam, have made public the photograph of Muhammad Ali S.
Al-Hindi will be transported from his place of detention in the Rumiyyah Prison directly to the Sayyidat Al-Bisharah Church for a period of two hours, accompanied by members of the Internal Security Forces, in order to take part in the burial and final viewing of his mother, who died last Friday following a chronic illness.
On the reason for his rejecting the request made by the editor of Al-Hayat, detained colleague Habib Yunis on an earlier and similar occasion, he said, "The investigation with Yunis had not yet finished and the charge sheet in his file had not yet been issued".
It is understood that the investigation include the captain of the vessel, a Syrian who part owns the ship, and a Lebanese maritime agent, who obtained permission for the Bengali detainees from the General Security Department to bring them into Lebanon for 48 hours, provided that they leave Lebanese waters at the end of that period, after they have traveled from their country on the vessel on which they are now detained.
It is noted that a German security delegation had visited Adum before
He added, "When we draw up the draft Permanent Appointments Laws and it comes before the Chamber of Deputies, they strike once more.
He hope that those contracted would primarily concentrate on the Permanent Appointments Law, which would take its time in the Chamber of Deputies until the Civil Service Council set a date for the Permanent Appointments examinations.
He added, "The implementation workshop for school buildings, the corner-stone of which we have already laid, starts next March. We will meet with the Chairman of the Development Council soon to this end. We will have about 150 new schools in all areas."
Lebanon's Hotels: History, Nostalgia and Future.
"Lebanon's Hotels: History, Nostalgia and Future" is the second title, following on from "Lebanese Industry: History and Civilization", published by Capt. Joseph Al-Raidi in volumes by which he seeks to inform about "the long history of the economy and tourism in Lebanon and the extent of its worth, experience and excellence, which allow it to meet the challenges of the future".
But important historical stages have changed much in this industry and put it in front of new demands towards constant development...".
The first section, Back to Roots, returns to the time of Phoenicians and their accommodation and travels, continuing through the religious tourism seen by Lebanon in the first centuries AD when pilgrims traveled to the holy places, notably in Palestine, passing through Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and other countries.
The second section of the book, "A Trip through Memories", focuses on Beirut and the splendor and lights in Al-Burj Square before moving to the regions: The Mountain: Heart of Lebanon and the reminiscences associated with it; The Beqaa: Romance of the Plain; the North: Happy Nights; and the Dreamy South.
The book calls 1974 "The Year of the Summit and the Fall", and then begins to discuss the dusting off and the return of the dancer to light the nights of the East.
Perhaps some like the Weakest Link so much that they have exaggerated their praise for it, talk of its success and the manner in which it is presented, which those responsible for it have tried to make comparable to the similar original, which the Lebanese have been able to watch over the satellite, even to the extent of matching the haircut and spectacles of the presenter.
During the voting it is clear how the bigger players are able to push the smaller ones to adopt their way of voting, so that they burn each other up and leave only the bigger players at the end of the game, when the clock stops and the struggle comes to have no limits for them. This embodies the capitalist mentality of competitiveness where only the strong, and not just the good, survive. Strength does not require that one stand on the side of truth, but with the strength, on the basis of the saying that "Truth is Power".
This is similar to the situation of some developing countries, which strive to win a point here and a point there at the expense of the larger countries, which allows these countries to win some points in order that they be kept busy with one another and it remains on top of the struggle.
In this respect the weakest link is an exemplary program in expressing the reality of life in the world, and no one has the right to object to the attack to which one of the players is subject when they make a mistake, since there is no room for mistakes  in a game which is supposed to be played by adults, i.e. those with more knowledge and technology. Otherwise, they will end up like Afghanistan, when it decided to confront the United States.
The National Union of Private Associations contracted with the Ministry of Social Affairs has organized a protest movement at the failure to pay their salaries and financial dues for the months of November and December.
He added, "The problem of the Private Associations is this: 79% of the Ministry of Social Affairs' allocations have been withheld and how can this Ministry, which it was said would solve or help solve social and economic problems, work when 79 billion lira is today being withheld from it. Why this Ministry?
We hope to cover as soon as possible the urgent portion despite the difficult financial circumstances. But our aim and concern is to alleviate people's problems so that we, and not the people, bear them.
The delegation from the Private Associations then proceeded to the Ministry of Finance where they met Minister Fuad Al-Sinyurah, who promised to look into their demands.
Colleague Antwan Shidyaq, representing the Syndicate of Editors, spoke at the conference. He said that education in Lebanon was in need of patronage because it concerned the Lebanon of tomorrow and future generations.
Remember that the hourly contract rate at the secondary stage of education is 24,000 Lebanese lira; the rate for the primary stage is just 6,000 Lebanese lira, which clearly demonstrates the extent of the injustice and deprivation."
- The hourly rate shall be retrospectively increased for the years following the decision to increase the salaries of all government employees and teachers.
- The number of years of experience and university qualifications shall be taken into account."
Student Khalid Rammal Muhammad Al-Salah will debate his Masters thesis, which is entitled "Common Points of Doctrine in Judaism and Christianity and the Stance of Islam towards Them" at 9:30 am tomorrow morning (Wednesday) at the building of the Imam Al-Awzai Faculty of Islamic Studies, Al-Tariq Al-Jadidah.

What was the result of the meetings, which continued until 9 pm?
They informed them of the decision taken by the "Student Government" to suspend lessons.
The students distributed two statements; the first addressed the academic staff, accusing one of them of sowing discord.
In the second statement, which was addressed to the students, the student government covered some problems, saying, "Either we have freedom within ourselves or it will not exist, liberating and not restricting us.
People who work to put an end to us because we took part in the bread of true independence and rejected the bread of false independence among the columns of the university, and because we want a solution to the problem of the new Finance Law, bearing in mind that the suspension of the strike on Monday was conditional on implementation of these promises and a solution to the bus problem. The response, as if to put pressure on the students, was to pay a subscription allowance for the car park.
Our work today is to justify to the University our rejection of its unfair policy and that we, as students, will be one hand in confronting all the means of pressure imposed upon us. The closing of classes today (yesterday) is no more than an expression of our rejection of the status quo but without us closing the door to dialogue."

They pointed out that he was, for example, responsible for volunteers in Peshawar, Pakistan, and that he determined the missions that the volunteers would carry out abroad.

Egypt intends to buy 4 rapid patrol boats that can be used to fire anti-ship missiles and Phalanx artillery.
American aircraft carriers were the main base for American air attacks on Afghanistan. They reached their locations in the Gulf within just 5 days by passing through the Canal, as opposed to a further 20 days required for the journey around the Cape of Good Hope.
In an unprecedented step 15 reports on the strategic importance of the deal were submitted to Congress and the Senate.

Washington - Reuters - Sources in the Congress have reported that the former intelligence official Britt Snider is to head the investigation to be conducted by the two intelligence committees in the Congress and Senate into the reasons for the failure of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in predicting the 11 September attacks, despite some objection on the basis that he was very close to the agency, making it difficult for him to form independent views.
Following a closed session on Wednesday, the Congress Intelligence Committee approved the start of the investigation following discussion dominated by differences over Snider's neutrality.

We will continue our work with him. We will put pressure on him. We will ask him where Pearl is being held.
Bin Ladin Most Probably Alive, Possibly in Pakistan; Knowledge of Al-Qaeda members in Lebanon.
Sources reported that they had agreed that the threats were serious but this did not mean that Tehran and Baghdad would submit to them.

- Most probably he is still alive.
* How would you assess the work of the symposium?
They noted that European contact with the Israeli Prime Minister would not be beneficial because he was armed with absolute American support, which has made the Union and more than one European foreign ministers make stinging criticism of American bias, against the positions of George Bush in particular.
It quoted the spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Minister Hamid Rida Asfi, who is accompanying Minister Kamal Kharazi on his visit to Bangladesh, as saying that "this information is old, incorrect and inaccurate".

Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Perez confirmed yesterday, "The immediate declaration of a Palestinian State will get us past the impasse". He affirmed that he had failed to persuade the American administration of his point of view.
Then international support must be secured, but we see a difference between the United States and the European Union.
We inferred this in 1996.
It convinced the Palestinians that they are subservient and come under the State of Israel, as was the case in the past.
For this reason a path has been prepared to reach the final solution and will be implemented gradually, according to stages determined previously (...).
(The proposals) comprise the following stages...return to stability and establishment of a ceasefire, allowing progress on the political front.

Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Salih has recently spoken of the security forces pursuing three Yemenis thought to be members of Al-Qaeda.
The fact is that to deal with the dire economic, financial and living conditions requires difficult decisions, some of which will harm large sections of the people, whilst others will affect large merchants and owners of monopoly agencies, which causes the voices of protest to increase.
A review of the status of monopoly agencies undoubtedly provokes the anger of those who have benefited from them for 60 years, given that these agencies are limited to a small group of major merchants and importers, who represent economic and financial figures and prominent persons and who form one of the centers of power in the country, a center that is hard to touch.
The disturbances that are preceding the results of the implementation of value-added tax and the review of monopoly agencies are thus disturbances with political background or a background of self-interest.
Some of these measures concern maritime estates, the excess in government departments, a review of the status of the Chamber of Deputies, the Supreme Aid Authority and other organizations and councils that can be dropped in order to relieve the pressure on the Treasury and reduce spending. This is to stop the waste of public money as far as is possible in all its different forms, including the continuing corruption in some departments and organizations.
Emil Khuri
Chance would have it that most monopoly agencies are Christian and most petroleum agents are Muslim, and so the blessing of liberalization and the opening of the way to imports, replaces justice with oppression in balancing out the two monopolies and the people enjoy the blessing of moderate prices.
In the sense that optimism constitutes one sectarian affiliation and school of thought, whilst pessimism another.
As the recent crisis reflected the chronic split between the state and the people.
But this has been lost in the preparation, the resistance, the clamor, the suspicion and sectarianisation.
But there is one monopoly that dominates us: oppressive injustice and an overwhelming weight from above.
Arafat has been in the fiery swamp of the Ramallah siege for weeks, but his patience is waning thin and he wants to get out.
Of course, there is no need to answer.
Even were the above decisions merely a contrived exercise, can we begin to imagine the emotions of Palestinian and Arab public opinion no more than 48 hours later when the hear news of an armed incursion into the Gaza Strip resulting in six Palestinian dead and dozens wounded?
Of course not.
Recognition of 1967 Borders, Evacuation of Settlements and Return of Refugees.
It also accepted the evacuation of Jewish settlements in the Jordan plain and the Gaza Strip, provided that it would incorporate the major settlement blocks, which contain 80% of settlers.
The first concerned return to Israel, for which no numbers were agreed, but the unofficial paper speaks of 25,000 in the first three years of implementation of the plan, and a figure of 40,000 refugees annually for the first five years was mentioned verbally.
It also agreed to make Jerusalem an open city.
He quoted Advisor to Ehud Barak and the Director of his office at that time, Jalaad Shir, as saying that the document was just "scribble".
And there are serious doubts about whether the lessons of the present Intifada will allow the Governments of Israel to adopt these same positions."
Successive developments in the wake of approval of the draft general budget for 2002 by the Chamber of Deputies have released a range of very negative indicators, with the spat between the government and economic organizations over the abolishment of commercial monopoly agencies and liberalization of medicine imports forming only a small part.
Some confirm that the media campaigns against the Prime Minister would not have gone as far as they did unless they wanted to exploit the distance drawn by the President of the Republic.
In parallel, the government has been obstructed in carrying out what it had intended to be a moral step before being a practical one, irrespective of whether these steps were innocent or otherwise, for ultimately the abolishment of protection for monopoly agencies, as in the case of liberalization of medicine imports, may have a positive effect.
According to specialist observers, this indicates one of two things: Either there is a new policy on information technology or the payments budget has some negative aspects and the Bank of Lebanon does not wish to publish negative information, given that this would imply a difficulty in covering the commercial debt and the consequences this would have for the principle of transparency of information, given that much of the information at the present time is damaging and harmful and, as such, there is no need for it.
Amidst the glory of the chatter about exclusive rights, monopolies, agencies and trades, and a preoccupation with what comes next, there passed the furtive glance that Jacques Chirac set aside for Beirut.
And the tale of monopolies and the debate surrounding them occupied the whole country without exception.
The brothers took offence, and they had the right to!
And they left the door open for other measures, which may go so far as a withdrawal of ambassadors and unsheathing of swords.
So let's say that God is kind, that it was noticed and the new boycott will pass with apologies, smiles and embraces.
"Zayyan"
He said that the Court "believed in the first instance that the Investigating Magistrate had no right to consider himself as competent in respect of the crimes presented on the basis of a comprehensive jurisdiction that is not recognized by international law".
The legal advisor to the Belgium Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jan Daveddar, predicted that the ruling would encourage Belgium to drop the case against Sharon.
- The decision was a shock for international humanitarian law and a step backwards for the rejection of the immunity established by the international courts and competent authorities.
- The court in the Hague focused on the fact that immunity did not constitute a pardon and that following up the case was important, especially for people like Amosiron, who do not have immunity.

Of course, matters are always complicated in Lebanon where the arbitrariness of the ruling class must also corrupt the "perfection" of the class contradiction, not to mention the hidden intentions that quickly become semi-public in the name of "sectarianisation". Then everyone seeks the forgiveness of God at this metamorphosis as if it had just entered the life of the nation but without anyone daring to refute the sectarian dimension to which a modest reference was made.
Nor can the fury of the campaign be explained by some of the visual media, which is usually compelled to ruminate on the higher national interest on behalf of their exclusive agents, the lords of censorship and political security, finally finding an opportunity to express the oppression they feel.
But none of that should diminish the significance of the context against the government's proposal.
For the issue is not a battle between those who have monopolies and the deprived.
In this sense, a class-based analysis will only be correct if it also includes the "old" and "new" classes in Lebanon, but also the classes in control and those trying to gain control in countries that belong to the same geographical and economic area, but enjoying one "major benefit": they are not governed by laws as much as they are governed by customs and, sometimes, by the scales of pure power.
Or let us at least say that it may prevent the trade area from becoming a dedicated arena of secret wars, similar to the police stories in circulation in Lebanon and Syria, or indeed the Arabian peninsula, by virtue of the integration of interests, or the lack thereof, between the laws.
Hamadah said afterwards: "It was an extended business meeting, from which I will extract the following decisions: The Return File as stated in the National Accord Document at Taif continues to have the support and commitment of the Lebanese state at all levels, from the President of the Republic, whom I had the honor of meeting two days ago, to Prime Minister Al-Hariri, the Chamber of Deputies headed by Speaker Nabih Al-Birri and the Central Immigrants Fund, which has seen administrative changes recently, but will continue to perform its work in serving citizens  and by paying their compensation once Director Armuni has completed the current internal restructuring work.
Birri then met with Armuni along with members of the fund in a courtesy visit.
Former Deputy Habib Sadiq welcomed the plan to abolish monopoly agencies but he questioned "the competence of the government authorities, in both their visible and invisible wings, to bring about this required move".
But this does not, and should not, prevent clear and firm positions being adopted on the principal issue, the subject of this furious clamor.
Here the Lebanese, with the exception of those with an individual or group interest, join to welcome the lifting of every official order concerning monopoly agencies, in particular those that have a monopoly on the things which people cannot live without, such as food, medicine, clothing, educational items and housing.
Does the request for a tax on added value imply a change of method has taken place in the tools of government, one that aims for the good of the country and its servants, or is it a measure that will increase the severity of the present crisis and add to the misery of the wretched, who form the vast majority of the people?
The Defense, Interior and Municipal Councils Committee has unanimously approved the draft law for a security agreement between Lebanon and Armenia, but has postponed a decision of the draft law relating to organization of civil aviation in order to examine some of the observations made by Deputies.
We therefore discussed the draft at length without going into the details of the articles.
The Chairwoman of the Deputies Committee, Bahiyah Al-Hariri, stated, "This is the third meeting that we have allocated for this project, which requires more detailed examination in order to ascertain the real need for secondary teachers, to secure schools' requirements and thereby decide on the excess teachers. We have begun to draw up plans for the coming stage, to distribute teachers among schools according to requirements without resorting to contracts by opening the Faculty of Education in the manner specified by the Ministry.
In response to a question about the amendments made to the draft relating to secondary teachers, she said, "We incorporate precise amendments in order to maintain the level of teachers, specialization and competence, which make them suitable as secondary teachers. We also take into account social and educational circumstances."
She added, "The transfer of teachers from one school to another can no longer take place in the traditional way, as was prevalent. It now requires a Causal Decree issued by the Council of Ministers and on condition that transfers take place before the start of the academic year."
Health Investment: Our Salvation from Poverty.
The report, which is titled "Macroeconomics and Health: Investing in Health for Economic Development and Progress", stressed the urgent need to put people at the heart of the matter.
But we must be more determined to improve living conditions for hundreds of millions of poor who do not obtain a fair share of the world's wealth and opportunities.
Health directly contributes to human security.
Basic health services can be provided for 34 American dollars per person per annum.
Namely, an amount equivalent to one cent for every 10 dollars of the Gross National product of the wealthy countries of the world.
The key to lasting work and effective results certainly lies in health becoming a priority at the highest levels of political leadership.
The Commission recommends establishing macroeconomics and health commissions in each country, the task of which will be to determine the tangible steps necessary to support the health system and organize the known and effective methods of protection against the principal diseases of poverty.
The countries of the world have no interest in ignoring an opportunity like this to carry out effective work for the benefit of future generations and to preserve the health of the peoples and the earth.
Therefore, Friday the 10th of Dhu Al-Hijjah 1422 AH, which corresponds to 22nd February 2002, will be the first day of the blessed Al-Adha Feast.
Qabbani yesterday was patron of a celebration of the signing of an investment agreement between the Directorate General of Islamic Awqaf, represented by its Director General Asim Sanu, and the Hasan Abd Al-Karim Al-Qahtani Group in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, represented by Sheikh Adil Al-Dusri, to invest in property number 126, the Harbour, Fush Street in the commercial center of Beirut. In attendance were the Mufti of Mt Lebanon, Sheikh Muhammad Ali Al-Juzu, the Chairman of the Beirut Awqaf Board, Dr Khalid Qabbani, Head of Dr Muhammad Khalid Social Institutions Area, Ahmad Mukhtar Khalid, a group of social and religious figures and a delegation from the Solider company.
Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri yesterday issued an administrative memorandum requiring the closure of public departments and organizations and municipal councils on 22, 23 and 24 February on the occasion of the Al-Adha Feast.
Lahud met with Minister of Communications Jan Lui Qirdahi and discussed with him the Ministry's projects and the results of contacts about the cell phone.
"We praised the patriotic stances adopted by President Lahud, notably his firm defense of Lebanon's right to resist, to reclaim its occupied land and to liberate its prisoners from Israeli prisons.
And as we have become accustomed, the position of His Excellency was very positive as regards lifting this deprivation and improving the region, so as to make redundant the expression "marginal regions".
The President of Republic sent a telegram to Patriarch Aghnatiyos IV Hazim congratulating him on his recovery following the road accident in which he was involved whilst traveling from Lebanon to the Patriarchal Headquarters in Damascus.
It also approved opening of imports of petroleum and gas materials and their derivatives. The decision will take effect three months after the date it was issued.
Hamadah later said, "It was an extended working meeting, from which the following decisions emerged: First, the Returnees file remains as stated in the National Accord document at Al-Taif and continues to receive the support and commitment of the Lebanese State at all levels, from the President who
At the same time, he stressed "the right of the Lebanese people to strive to reclaim the rights of which they have been raped, to liberate their occupied territory, free those detained in prisons of the occupying powers and end the on-going Zionist violations and threats against Lebanon."
Prime Minister Al-Hariri responds to those who criticize his stance of monopoly agencies by asking, "Can I become Karl Marx?"
Al-Shuf - Al-Nahar
Elsewhere, Musa opened a workshop organized by the Lebanese Association for Environmental Protection in cooperation with the Friedrich-Eibert Institution, to draw up the working plan for 2002-2004 at 9 am this morning at the Bristol Hotel.
* The Committee for the Protection of the Ahdan Remote Area and Al-Mukmil Mountain urged officials to intervene to protect the woodland of Karam Sadhu Sabaal, Ibtu, Saraal, Al-Tuffah farm, Arabah Qazhiyah and the sacred Qadishah Valley against the dangers posed by the sandalwood worm.
In a statement issued by it, it outlined the reasons for postponing the departure for several days, hinting at the concerns of the relevant government agencies, starting with the internal security forces, which inspected Al-Kasarah and conducted the initial investigations, and continuing with the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of the Interior and the Municipalities.
On this basis, and under funding from the World Bank Mediterranean Technical Environment Assistance Program, a project was begun in March 2001 to manage harmful waste. The project is implemented by an Italian consultancy company with the support of a consultancy committee drawn from the Development and Construction Council, the Ministry of Trade, the Ministry of Public Health, the Ministry of Energy and Water, the Lebanese Industrialists Association and a number of representatives from three different industrial sectors.
3. Prepare a comprehensive national plan for the management of this waste and how to dispose of it in a sound environmental manner.
It will also organize discussion groups in all Lebanon's governorates on harmful waste and ways of managing it, ways to implement the relevant legislation, to include officials from the governorates, municipal council, private environmental organizations and industrial complexes.
A resident of Kafr Hura village in the district of Zaghrata has complained of the failure to repair the electricity network in the village, despite this having been done in all areas. The village requires a second electricity transformer.
"Following the inspection conducted by the Municipality Department of property numbers 964 and 3768 in Al-Ashrafiyyah, and following an examination pursuant to the documents, it became apparent that the settlement of the subject of the dispute between the owners of the aforementioned properties was the responsibility of the relevant authority."
* A source in the National Social Security Fund confirmed that the Fund only pays the cost of medicines registered with the Ministry of Health.
We submitted a complaint several years ago and the response was that the generators comply with the required specifications.
We are certain that the Sharia Law was not made for adults, but for sinners and reprobates, for the immoral and sinful, for those deem permissible and perpetrate those things that have been prohibited, for those who kill their mothers and fathers, for murderers and adulterers (...) for liars and those who break their word, for all those who break the sound teaching."
then the picture painted by Minister Faranjiyyah does not give much cause for optimism, especially after he noted that President Lahud tries to avoid talking about political matters and, instead, prefers to talks about swimming and diving, and to say that policy was undertaken by "others" outside the government and constitutional institutions.
This matter of the ten colleagues poses a fundamental question: Why were they detained?
Eid appears to be certain that I have rushed to interpret the expression attributed to President Al-Asad, and says, "It would have been better for Hadidi's reading for him to have waited and checked the sources for the evidence and the veracity of those sources."
My sources were (in addition to the Arab press and the news agencies, which I have no reason to accuse of deliberately and willfully distorting Al-Asad's words) the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), which I doubt is as reliable - at least in the official documentary sense - as "a Baathist friend allowed, to some extent, to know matters from the inside", whom Eid questioned about the veracity of the expression. The Baathist friend responded that "he had only heard it in the press comment, but had not seen it in official sources" and consequently "expressed his surprise".
And, secondly, I wrote the article in Al-Quds Al-Arabi not to commemorate the 20th anniversary (notwithstanding the fact that I believe this anniversary to be a fundamental break in the duty of commemorating recent and contemporary Syria memory, which is wholly at odd with the "picking the wound" story), but as a central part of the comment on the statements of the Syrian President in relation to terrorism, and to make clear the disastrous political, security, economic and social aspects of the "Syrian experiments" in combating terrorism.
And he will see that society is with him because our people are good and our nation as generous as the father who forgives the prodigal son."
Tripoli Port - Al-Nahar.
The vessel's arrival was accompanied by talk of several ports refusing to accept the sugar it was carrying because it was sub-standard.
We requested that an inspection be conducted at the Research Institute and that samples be taken from the load for analysis, to verify that it was safe, before we gave permission for it to be off-loaded."
Al-Nahar received reports suggesting that the vessel's cargo had been rejected by all Mediterranean basin states and a number of African states and that it had been at anchor for two months in Algeria (...) and sold to a Lebanese merchant at a reduced price.
The Greek vessel Alexis arrived at Tripoli port last Friday morning bearing a consignment of sugar for importer Mr. Zain Harb.
Economic Expert Kamal Hamdan yesterday gave a lecture at the headquarters of the Al-Maqasid Graduate Association on "The Economic Reality and Fiscal Policy in Lebanon".
He added, "What has been spent on construction and the pursuit of the policy of consolidating the divorce between industrial, agricultural and commercial sectors has not benefited the veins of the economy." He warned of the "danger of continuing with things as they were, with the deficit eating into resources, which could reach the point where the state is unable to meet its payments."
He responded to what has been said about cash fixing being in the service of the poor saying, "This fixing, which has helped to create the large public debt, impoverishes the middle classes and the poor, because financing and servicing the debt is done through taxes and from the pockets of the poor."
After they had waited for about an hour outside, the guards agreed to allow a group of demonstrators to enter the Palace to meet one of the officials.
Diab held a press conference at the same hotel to announce the workshop.
The Customs Department had not received the necessary documents and papers and did not allow it to dock until the morning of Monday, the 11th of this month.
At the invitation of the Association, in the presence of a number of prominent political, economic, commercial and syndicate figures.
He clarified, "The American pressure brought to bear on Lebanon, Iran and Syria will increase the scale of the grave economic problem."
About 70 citizens assembled at 8 pm yesterday evening in front of the entrance to Quraitim Palace, demanding to meet Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri who, at that time, was at the headquarters of the Council of Ministers in the museum.
At 9:15 the delegation came out announcing that they had formed a committee of 10 members and promised to resolve the issue within 10 days or they would return and sleep at the entrance to Quraitim with their children if their problem was not resolved.
Director of the Association for Vocational Information Jalal Fawwaz,  Honorary President Brigadier Sami Nasiri, Captain Muwwafaq Al-Yafi, Secretary-General of the Workshop Yusif Munsif, and  a number of interested persons attended.
Ghandour spoke first and noted, "The Saudi market is a market for Lebanese products given that the Kingdom is the biggest importer of Lebanese products. The North's share of the week and the accompanying activities in Riyadh is fair."
Tomorrow, when Lebanon joins the World Trade Organization, then competition between Lebanese merchants and everyone else will reach Lebanon itself.
He said, "Lebanon today stands at a crossroads: Either it must continue its efforts in all fields to achieve tangible development, control the budget deficit and deal with the public debt, or it must surrender to the present situation, submit to the conditions that limit economic development, make distinctions between Lebanese people and increase social contradictions.
And what these forces cannot resolve, the official department can resolve and, if necessary, legislation can deal with such matters."
He said, "I support the abolishment of protection for monopoly agencies if it will lead to a reduction in prices, maintain quality and protect the Lebanese market and foreign speculators.
The Syndicate of Medicine Importers and Warehouse Owners believed that monopoly agencies in the sphere of medicine had been lifted 20 years ago; the decision allowing parallel imports by importers other than agents had been in effect since 1992.
The final recommendations from the work of the Conference, which has held over two days at the Phoenicia Intercontinental Hotel and organized by the Economic and Business Group, were issued yesterday as follows:
- Urge government to formulate policies to provide services in remote and deprived areas, since private sector investments has shown notable success.
- Note the limited circulation of cell phones in the region, despite there being 20 million lines, which is no more than those of a major European capital, and the limited frequency space available to users in the region, given that the present total is about equal to that taken up by 512 individual connection cables in the United States.
Are medicine and treatment the right of every citizen, and should they be subject to controls so as to become available to all?
For example, imposition of control over the price of medicines and prohibition of monopolies would save the government a lot of money, which currently ends up in the pockets of the importers.
The large profit margin made by the monopoly agency and the failure of officials charged to check the accuracy of the recommended prices in the country of origin help to raise the prices of medicines when there is no competition to the monopoly on medicine. The Social Security Organization, it should be recalled, previously conducted a successful trial, in which it imported a selection of medicines being sold in pharmacies and from the same source and sold it to those covered by the security at half the price adopted by the pharmacies.
The government move to abolish the monopoly on medicine is good, provided that it does not hide a sharing of unrestricted profits and give an opportunity for new sharks to enter the market.
End of Dollar Rise; American Stock Markets Fall.
It was clear from trading that dealers were relaxed at the progress of the American economy. Yesterday it transpired that the number of people seeking unemployment benefit in the United States fell by 8,000 compared to the previous week, with a total of 373,000 at the end of the week. This is an indication, on the one hand, of new job opportunities in various productions sectors other than agriculture and, on the other, that factory stock fell last December for the eleventh consecutive month by 0.4%, compared with 1.2% in November, whilst sales of this stock settled. Such a development will pave the way for an increase in industrial production.

Imro and others.
This development took place when the American network revealed that Quest Communications had been forced to resort to lines of credit from the banks after it had been unable to resettle its bonds in the money markets.
Minister for Social Affairs Asaad Diab, in his capacity as President of the Lebanese Information Assembly, announced that a workshop would be held under the title "Information Technology in the Service of Tourism" in participation with the Joint European Commission.
Diab said, "Information technology is the third technological revolution in history. It recognizes no limits, neither in time, nor distance.
And so was a new industry born: Tourism Information Technology."
He noted, "This workshop will allow workers in the tourism sector, from public and private sectors, such as the Ministry of Tourism and hotel and travel agent representatives, to express their needs.
Lebanese Satellite Channel Joins Nilesat Group.
On the one hand, it is a firm step in the age of the "Arabisation" much cherished by Sheikh Bayyar Al-Dahir, who first pronounced the idea at the end of the last century by expressing his desire to enter "globalisation" from a common Arab gateway, even one that includes domestic competition, that would be capable of keeping pace with the American, Japanese and European West, with its aspirations to control the oriental media markets.
Lebanese Wind Quintet Evening: Lively Rise to Korsakov's "Bee".
Perhaps this music, as it was presented in the four selections, bore in its composition a geometric construction more than a literary value in which the ear would find expression and, on its wings, reach the peak of emotion.
Enjoyable expressions, easy to absorb, but what skill they required from the breathing of each player, a skill that was still apparent in the second half of the evening, with Kloghart's quintet, as was the harmony that we had noticed gracefully and sharply penetrating the nature and mood of the work.
The humming brought out from the instruments, from the lungs of the players, moving pictures that each instrument then colored according to its qualities and the vivacity and skill of each player.
Beirut Investigating Magistrate Riyadh Abu Ghida referred for trial before the Sole Criminal Judge in Beirut the two owners of an internet company and shop selling mobile phones on charges of conducting international calls on the mobile lines and selling them to third parties illegally without the calls being routed via the government's central exchange, a misdemeanor under paragraph 1 of Law 623/97.
In doing this, they intended to lease them for international calls via the internet or via an artificial "link" line. They also intended to continually change the lines they purchased after asking the mobile company to cancel and replace them. All of the above was to conceal their use of these lines for illegal international calls and avoid paying the fees due from them to the government, which has cost the Treasury million of Lebanese liras.
During 1995 Abu Muhjin, who was found guilty, charged two Usbat Al-Ansar members, Al-Shihabi and Al-Sharidi, to kidnap a female called Nisrin using weapons on the pretext that she was involved in prostitution. They agreed to his request and brought her to the center where she was detained for a period and then handed over to the Lebanese security authorities.

A security report states that a dispute over parking of vegetable carts that broke out in Mahallat Sabra in Beirut led to Fawzi Shahrur, aged 16, opening fire with a Kalashnikov automatic rifle and Syrian Yusif Adil Al-Sadia, aged 13, being hit by a bullet in the stomach, following which he was transferred to the Al-Rusul Al-Azam hospital.
A fight on Wednesday/Thursday night in Bait Lif between exiled Hussein Muhammad Hamid, Jihad Muhammad Hamid and Husain Ali Hamid on the one hand, and Rabi Muhammad Malak, Jihad Hidar Malak and Abbas Hussein Malak on the other, developed into an exchange of shots.
Minister of National Defense Khalil Al-Harawi, members of the Military Council and a number of judges and officers attended.
He concluded by stressing the need for "continued military justice, to accelerate cases of crimes perpetrated against the security of the state and against military figures, in addition to those perpetrated by the military", attributing this to "the continued Israeli threat to Lebanon, its security and stability".
You work in silence, remain awake without tiring or becoming bored for the security of citizens and the well being of the country. You remain steadfast in the face of self-interested conferences and stand against the treacherous Israeli enemy with honor, sacrifice and determination.
For it is from the glint in the blades of your swords that justice shines in Lebanon, that security is established that the citizens are reassured about today and tomorrow."
Attorneys Sulaiman Labbas and Richard Shamaun, on behalf of their clients, Director of Student Division of the "Lebanese Forces" Salman Samahah and Attorney Eli Kairuz, yesterday submitted a request to the Military Court of Cassation chaired by Justice Tarbiah Rahmah to set aside the ruling of the Permanent Military Court issued the day before yesterday. The ruling required that the formal defense submitted by their clients during the trial of the case involving the arrest of former political advisor to the "Forces" leader, Tawfiq Al-Hindi and media official Antwan Basil, be added to the fundaments of the case. This concerns the passage of 3 years since the crime attributed to Samahah and Kairuz for suppression of the information, their previously having been accused of the same crime and the initial investigations conducted with them being invalid.
The request dealt with what it viewed as an error in the application of Article 182 of the Punishments Law "which prohibits the pursuit of one act twice and we have established to the Military court that this act was pursued at the time, for the same crime, before another authority, namely Chief Investigating Magistrate in Mt Lebanon, against those bringing this appeal.
The appeal concluded by calling for "the case to be seen as falling outside the period and a ruling for the public right brought against Kairuz and Samahah to be set aside on account of the 3 year rule and on an account of the previous case involving the same incident, and for the investigation organized by the Intelligence officials with the clients to be ignored and removed from the file on account of it violating legal principles."
Afifah Karam was born on 26 July 1883 in the village of Amshit, which, at that time, prospered politically, socially and culturally.
She wrote books and stories, devoting herself to writing, which filled the gap caused by her longing for her hometown of Amshit, to which she never returned, and strengthened her, as she suffered from poor health and was deprived of children.
She was thus the first female journalist from Lebanon and the Arab World and was "a pioneer in the writing of the novel and the long story, which only a very limited number of Arab writers had dared to write".
She was helped in doing so by the liberated environment to which she moved.
She, who was forced to marry, bore the banner for the freedom of women to choose their marriage partners.
She wrote, "Father, is the suffering of your daughter equal to the satisfaction of the priest?
The author includes a number of articles by Karam, pictures of her with her family and quotes about her after her death.
The engine and the aircraft will be added to the laboratories at the Faculty of Engineering to help the practical training of mechanical engineering and aviation students on aviation systems, equipment and apparatus.

Ibrahim Jirjis, representing the Army commander, Secretary-General of the Maronite Association Dr Khalil Karam, Head of the Kasrawan-Al-Futuh Union of Municipalities Nihad Nofal, Director of the Al-Irfan Al-Tawhidiyyah schools Sheikh Ali Zain Al-Din, former Director of the Maronite Brotherhood of Mary Abbot Marcel Abi Khalil, Director General of the Maronite Lebanese Missionary Association Fr Khalil Ilwan, Sheikh Clauvis Al-Khazin, and a group of party, social and cultural notables.
He added, "Today some Lebanese Christians are anxious at the future as a result of the increase in Christian emigration from Lebanon. This emigration is not restricted to them: it includes both Muslims and Christians. Its cause is not religious persecution but a continuation of the path of our forefathers in leaving the country on account of the limited land available in Lebanon, and on account of the aspirations of the Lebanese and their success in countries abroad.
He stressed, "Democracy cannot be divided. Deterioration in the quality of Christian representation will lead to qualitative tyranny over quality for Muslim representation, which will certainly harm Muslims. This reality can be seen in Lebanon now and is growing year on year."
Defenders of classicism in art say that it remains fresh from one age to the next and that it cannot become "out of date" as in the case of fashion, where what is new cancels out what is old.
This also applies to our senior sculpture, Wajih Nahlah, whose seventieth birthday we celebrated yesterday (along with Valentine's day). He himself is a major lover: of the brush, of diligent work, of sublime human and artistic beauty.
Only a proficient exponent of classicism has the permanent basic tools for the most modern and most abstract expression, able to shine in either school, because he has his roots firmly embedded in the original capacity developed through the ages.
Today it applies to Lebanon.
This same activity was carried out by men of religion on an individual basis before the war among their flock in the poor areas.
The idea was also put forward at that time to boycott the elections in protest at the impossibility of effecting change by means of them, because they were tailored to fit the size of those in power and those who wanted them.
Two days ago a taxi driver said to me that the country was always demonstrating before the war for their living. But today they have tamed the people.
I told the driver, "The plays and songs of Ziad Al-Rahbani are an indicator of the economic and political situation of the people.
The most prominent recommendations include the following:
4- Speed up inventory processes for cultural possessions, both private and those in museums, stores or archaeological or historical sites, and consolidate unification of inventory processes.
8- Establish better co-operation between national and other administrative units with the aim of implementing local laws and agreements that protect cultural heritage.
The Poet Nakhlah.
Tarbih's poem runs thus:
Who sang to him and gave him the choicest wine to drink.
I recall your pastures infused by heaven's breath.
I recall your brightly woven cascade.
Enwrapped, you bear the poet's mace.
Here, son of sincerity, the swords of fidelity rusted.
They revive the memory of Abdallah bin Faraj.
Right hand - set the forest alight. But no.
Your free branches high among the years.
Your intelligence sheds light on the darkened tomes.
On the roads of a moist autumn.
Imam Ali's brother in the sky of degrees.

At a press conference the Secretary-General of the international organization said, "As far as I am concerned, the talks are taking place behind closed doors and these public statements do not necessarily reflect reality. The next time that a closed meeting is held (...) my aim is that Iraq should respect the resolutions of the United Nations. During our next meeting I will concentrate on what the Iraqi envoy says, and not on what I read in the press.
The Egyptian President also appeared to play down the reports of the Iraqi media.
American officials accepted in 1998 that they had planted spies among the inspectors.

The Scottish Appeals Court held in Camp Zeist in central Holland yesterday confirmed the guilt of Libyan Abdelbaset Al-Megrahi, aged 49, on the charge of mass murder in the case of the Pan American airline bombing above Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988, which left 270 dead. It upheld the sentence of life imprisonment given against him. This closes the door on a detective "story" and judicial investigation that have continued for about 13 years and increases pressure on the Libyan leader Col. Muammar Gaddafi to acknowledge the responsibility of his country for the incident and to pay compensation to victims' families.
A report by Newsweek magazine last month quoted the FBI as saying that Malaysia was one of the launch points for the 11 September attacks.
He was asked when Said, who is currently detained in Pakistan, will be transferred to the United States and answered, "We will work on this with the Pakistani authorities."

Following the reelection of President Mugabe in elections condemned by the international community for the flaws they involved, Zimbabwe's government is expected to face harsher international sanctions, especially given that the League of Commonwealth Nations has joined American and British criticisms of the violations and atmosphere in which the elections were conducted.
In a speech broadcast on his arrival in Harare yesterday, he said "those who doubt the election process in Zimbabwe" must "listen to what the Africans are saying".
In a statement he said, "The elections results allow Mr. Mugabe to claim victory but they do not allow him to claim that he has democratic legitimacy."
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Anan also stated that he was "worried" at the situation in Zimbabwe.
Khatami, who is currently visiting Greece, said in an interview with the "Kronan Tzaitong" newspaper that Tehran was prepared to hold talks with Washington if the United States showed good intent.

Lockerbie: Al-Megrahi's Life Sentence Confirmed; Tripoli Criticizes the Ruling, Views it as Political; Tripoli, Washington and London.
During a session lasting less than five minutes, Justice Lord McCullen, who heads the Appeals Court comprising five judges, said, "None of the pretexts on which the appeal is based are valid...Consequently the appeal is rejected."
The Court of First Instance found Al-Megrahi guilty on 31 January 2001 of mass murder after finding him guilty of having sent a suitcase containing a bomb from Malta airport to Frankfurt, where it was transferred to the Pan Am flight, which later landed in London before exploding 38 minutes after take-off from Heathrow Airport on its way to New York above the town of Lockerbie. The other accused in the same case, Libyan Al-Amin Khalifah Fahimah, was found not guilty because of insufficient evidence.
Cathleen Flynn, who lost her son shouted out, "Finally justice has been done."
It sought the release of its national and "the full and immediate lifting of the unjust sanctions imposed by the Security Council against the Jamahiriya by British and American pressures and that the Libyan people be compensated for the material and human damages suffered as a result thereof".
He told journalists some minutes after it had been announced that Al-Megrahi being found guilty did not compensate for the suffering of the victims' families but "I hope that it offers them some peace and consolation".
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee yesterday called for solidarity and peace following the sectarian violence that left more than 700 dead in the State of Gujarat at the end of February. The Indian authorities have sent more security reinforcements to the city of Ayodha on the eve of the date set by Hindu extremists for a religious festival banned by the High Court, near the site where they intend to build a temple to their High God Rama on the ruins of the Babri Mosque, which was destroyed by extremists from among their number ten years earlier, which led to disturbances in which three thousand died.
Police at crossroads stopped anyone not carrying a special permit.
A spokesman for the World Hindu Conference "Vishwa Hindu Parishad", Bravin Tughadya said that religious Hindus from all over India would visit temples and would come down into the streets at the same time to demand the construction of the temple.
Despite this peaceful call, the session was postponed after an opposition deputy blamed the Prime Minister for his support of the Hindus.
* In Washington, the American State Department warned its nationals against traveling to areas in India. Its statement said, "Non-essential American government trips to Gujarat have been postponed...American citizens must also avoid traveling to the area."
Arab and international reaction was yesterday united in welcoming Security Council Resolution 1397, which, for the first time, refers to the State of Palestine.
Jordanian Foreign Minister Marwan Al-Muashar welcomed the resolution, "the first on which the United States has voted for a long time (...) since it not only voted positively for it but even formulated the draft resolution which, in itself, is the start of a change in the American position towards the Palestinian problem."
Iranian President Muhammad Khatami supported the resolution which "opened new possibilities for solving the problem", describing events in Palestine as "unprecedented".
The Parisian press was skeptical about the implications of the resolution.
Draft Proposed by Syria Condemning the Attacks Withdrawn Following Arab Pressure; Resolution 1397: Security Basis for Saudi Ideas?
However, diplomatic information arriving in Beirut in the last few hours from sources that followed closely the discussions that accompanied the resolution talks about the motives in which the Syria reservation was concealed:
This position appears to have been a compromise, interpreted by diplomatic information as being neither a rejection of the Security Council resolution, nor an approval.
4 - The Security Resolution reflects the import of the Saudi Crown Prince's initiative, namely to create a security solution to the Palestinian question in return for what he viewed as full normalization.
But the official Lebanese position on the resolution is in line with the Syrian point of view, but due to its ambiguity and lack of clarity, Lebanon did not appear to be siding with a negative stance towards it when it is in the midst of preparations for an Arab summit at the end of this month.
And this, they add, is what was expressed by the other clauses in the resolution, of American origin, as equality between the two sides in calling for a ceasefire to be respected, and in terms of attacks and excesses.
Between the gradual withdrawal from Ramallah and the return to the ceasefire lines there is considerable distance, which will not be crossed easily.
It was clear yesterday that the presence of Israeli tanks at the entries to the Palestinians Presidential Compound was merely intended to bring out Sharon's "response" to Zinni's mission via the ceasefire, albeit within Al-Manarah Square and in the heart of Ramallah, in addition to portraying Sharon's "positive attitude" by means of his call for a gradual withdrawal from the town and redeployment at the entrances thereto.
In addition to this, reports talks of security measures and defensive arrangements, such as the digging of trenches and the erection of fences and control towers along 54 km from the north, east and south. This means that Jerusalem will have a reality imposed upon it, one that is sufficient to destroy any future talks dealing with the basic demand to make East Jerusalem the capital of the Palestinian state.
Of course, Bush denies this, as does Cheney. But the Arab region is lost in the maze, which makes the calls for peace no more than the drumbeats for war.
In a day, a month, a year...
In any case the ink in which these resolutions are written is indelible no matter how great the passage of time, because this ink is international, not made in China.
And now the ball, with all the rights and obligations this entails, is in the court of the Arab community and everyone, here, overseas and across the continents, is listening.
The details are not left in the hands of the devil this time, but are postponed until the fires have been put out, the wounds bandaged, the ruins rebuilt and the specter of death lifted from the skies above Gaza and the West Bank.
Palestinians yesterday succeeded in destroying three Israeli tanks. One was destroyed with an explosive charge set off in front of it in the Gaza Strip, which left three of the soldiers in its crew dead and two others wounded.
A spokesman for the American State Department, Richard Boucher, said that Washington "had taken note" of Israel's decision "to redeploy" its forces in Ramallah.
He stressed at the end that Washington "is still worried at the tragic human losses and the escalation of violence in recent days".
Commandos killed five Palestinians in Ramallah.
The Haartz newspaper quoted Israeli military sources as saying that in parallel with Palestinian steps to stop the violence, Israeli forces would freeze their operations in Palestinian areas, make symbolic withdrawals from the towns and refugee camps and remove check points. They would continue their operations to prevent the penetration of armed persons and the smuggling of weapons.
(WSF, Reuters, ASHA)
But one of the commanders of the northern area in Israel, Brigadier Meir Kalivi, said at a press conference in the border village of Biranit that Israeli soldiers had combed the borders after the attack and uncovered the point where the two fighters crossed the fence using a ladder, entering Israel at least one day prior to the attack.
Israeli security sources reported that the armed men had planned meticulously for the attack and had hidden in the middle of crops on a strategic hill, from where they opened fire on cars passing along the road, which is near to the borders between the Shalomi and Mistiba settlements, 4 km inside Israeli territory.
He added that Israel would try to bring to bear intensive international pressures on Syria to remind it that it was "playing with fire" and that if this method failed or Hizbollah carried out more cross-border attacks, the Hebrew state might give a military response.
* In Beirut, Hizbollah Secretary-General Mr. Hasan Nasrallah said on the occasion of the first nights of the month of Muharram, "Everything of which Israel accuses us, whether it is true or otherwise, whether it is proven or not, whether it is real or otherwise, everything of which it accuses us in supporting and standing beside our people in Palestine is a great honor for us, for Hizbollah and for everyone who stands beside Hizbollah. It is a great honor of which we are proud."
We are the children of this school, its courage and wisdom.
When the battle becomes one of defense for the basis of religion and for the basis of the existence of Islam, there is no need to look for the number of friends, the number of aides, what we have, what we don't have, or the like."
But one of the advisors to Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Salih said that Yemen had informed Cheney that it would oppose any American military action against Iraq, fearing that it would wreck regional stability.
He said, "The discussion dealt with many bilateral issues, including cooperation to counter terrorism, the Arab-Israeli conflict, the genocide to which the Palestinian people are subject at the hands of the Israeli government, the situation in Iraq and the implementation of the resolutions of international law."
Washington fears that Al-Qaeda fighters fleeing Afghanistan may head for the remote mountains of Yemen.
They believe it to be a personal matter, which they want to conduct by themselves."
He will continue his tour on Saturday, heading to Saudi Arabia.
Deputy Faris Buiz called on the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority, Yasir Arafat,  "not to leave Palestinian territory and the Intifada because Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon will not permit him to return".
This summit will, furthermore, take place at a time of battles and resistance mounted by the Intifada on the domestic front, which represents the fundamental turning point for the Arab - Israeli conflict.
Concerning the initiative made by Saudi Crown Prince Abdallah, he said, "There can be no doubting the patriotism, nationalism or Arabism of His Highness, Prince Abdallah, but they manner in which he expressed this proposal, in the media or the press, appears somewhat ambiguous.
I believe that any proposal on this matter must include clear expressions; for example, defining the extent of the Israeli withdrawal from the Golan to the 1976 borders. The process of putting forward this matter cannot ignore the Palestinian right of return, at least to their liberated homeland of Palestine.
Chairman of the Committee Deputy Abd Al-Latif Al-Zain noted that the draft proposal would have preference over other proposals.
There was agreement between all, government, deputies committee and organizations, that the organizations should submit within 15 days all their observations and views on these three drafts, to enable the committee and the government, following the summit conference, because this is the government's priority today, to begin studying these laws. The draft law amending the Audio-Visual will certainly take priority over the other proposals, to prevent interference between one law and another, especially given that the Advertising Law and the Media Law, albeit that the organizations all agree to the establishment of the Union for the organizations, contain slight differences on these issues. The committee will meet again after the organizations submit all their observations. What is important is that the atmosphere between the committee, the government, and the owners of the organizations is positive and that they have all expressed their views and observations and will submit them, as I mentioned, in writing to the committee."
For its part, the Administration and Justice Committee has continued to study the draft Communications Law. It has studied the articles relating to the promotion of communication services and license procedures and will continue studying this draft at 9:30 am next Monday.
Several years have passed since the review without a ruling being issued. Only two years remain for naturalized persons to acquire full political and civil rights.
The Council believes that it is a duty to preserve its independence, so that it will remain a refuge and authority for all citizens and anyone with a righteous demand.
Emigrants Abroad Association Calls On Officials to End Interference of Civil Servants in Its Affairs.
The legitimate leadership of the Association, elected during the Mexico conference held in May 2001, has translated this position with a series of visits to Lebanon and by contacts made during last summer. Statements and announcements made by the President of the Association, Basharah Basharah, confirm this commitment and the commitment to lasting open dialogue with the institutions of the Lebanese state. The leadership of the Association strongly rejects, however, the actions of some civil servants in the administration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, especially civil servant Haitham Jumaah, Director of the Emigrants Directorate, who has opened an illegal war on the Association by summoning emigrants and appointing them to non-existent responsibilities in the branches of the Association. He has tried to impose some officials on the Continental Council of the Association in Australia, an act that is rejected and not recognized.
2- The Continental Council for Australia and New Zealand is a fundamental part of the International Council of the Association. It undertakes to continue in the struggle for the Lebanese cause and for organizational solidarity with the decisions and recommendations of the Mexico conference. It is surprised by the actions of some officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in respect of the Association and the Australian Continental Council.
We call on all those loyal to take part in this conference in order to unite ranks, make progress and flourish."
Yesterday, commenting on events in Beirut on the anniversaries of 14 March, 14 July and 13 October, Aun said that this was the norm for all seasons; it was not seasonal.
The Lebanese should know that matters will not be put right today or tomorrow without a vision of political and social independence with free and unconditional decisions, not by subservience to Syria.
No one can suppress or silence the independence current.
The cabinet held its weekly meeting at 5 pm yesterday. The meeting was chaired by President of the Republic Emil Lahud and attended by Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri. Ministers absent included the following: Deputy Prime Minister Isam Faris, Secretary of State Talal Arslan, Minister of Transport and Public Work Najib Miqati and Minister of Health Sulaiman Faranjiyyah.
He noted, "The lack of clarity in international resolutions has, in the past, led to confusion in the interpretation and a debate that is still on-going. The new resolution will add to the debate because it can be interpreted in more than one way, and it does not distinguish between Israel the occupier and Israel the aggressor.
Former American President Bill Clinton stressed, "The establishment of Palestinian and Israeli states was necessary to bring about peace and guarantee security and prosperity in the region". He criticized the manner in which the American envoy to the Middle East, General Anthony Zinni was working and commended the initiative put forward by Saudi Crown Prince Abdallah to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict.
"Come on, get out Syria", "The only army we want in Lebanon is the Syrian Army", "Freedom, Sovereignty and Independence", "God, Lebanon and Aun - and no one else".
On the anniversary of the war of liberation on 14 March 1989, about two thousand students from the "Patriotic Free Current", the Free Patriots Party, the Brigades' Base and the "Lebanese Forces"  from different faculties at the Lebanese University, and Al-Hikmah, Sayyidah Luizah, the American-Lebanese, St Joseph universities and numerous secondary schools came onto the streets.
During the protest student Rami Saab from the Syrian National Socialist Party spoke. He believed that the choice made by those mounting resistance in Palestine was the choice of all free people in the Arab nation and Arab world, and that the future of students and young people depended on the future of Palestine and the removal of the racist Zionist entity."
It has been decided that he will meet Maronite Patriarch Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Butrus Safir in Bakarki this morning to communicate to him the concerns of the Palestinians and the state of churches in the Holy Land.
Dizzy Spell Causes Al-Jamil Head Wound; De Friege Welcomes Stance of "Students Freedoms Organization"; "Parties and Forces" Criticize Movements of Aunists.
In the evening President Al-Jamil's office issued a statement saying that Al-Jamil, "experienced (yesterday) afternoon an emergency health problem requiring that he be transferred to the Al-Hayek Hospital in Sinn Al-Fil, where some medical examinations were carried out. They were completed in the afternoon at the Mar Yusif hospital in Al-Dawrah.
In a statement yesterday he said, "The Organization has done well given that the defense of students rights and freedoms is not limited to this Organization.
They believed, "The renewed movement of the group of (Brigadier Michel) Aun to confuse Lebanese-Syrian relations does not serve Lebanese national interests."
The Council of Ministers has approved the draft law aiming to set up an account to manage, service and reduce the public debt.
"The Council of Ministers held its weekly meeting on 14/03/2002. The meeting was chaired by His Excellency President of the Republic and His Excellency Prime Minister. Ministers absent included the following: Deputy Prime Minister Isam Faris, Talal Arslan, Najib Miqati and Sulaiman Faranjiyyah.
On this occasion we renew our salute to the resistance, the south, its people and the Lebanese people, who have withstood all these years and have had their patience and efforts crowned with victory. We also salute the Intifada in Palestine, hoping that it, in turn, will force the implementation of international resolutions and establish the right of the Palestinian people in its land.
But we distinguish between the state finances and the economy of the country.
* Approval for draft law aiming to set up an account to manage, service and reduce the public debt.
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Immigrants Mahmoud Hamud met with the American Ambassador at 8:30 am yesterday and discussed with him the results of the meetings of the Ordinary Session of the Council of Arab Foreign Ministers in Cairo last week.
I heard from Minister Hamud the results of the conference of Arab Foreign Ministers held in Cairo.
General (Tony) Zinni is known to be arriving in the region. American Vice President Dick Cheney will continue his tour in the Arab world.
Following the meeting Echifari said, "I asked Minister Hamud for Lebanon to support Colombia and co-operate with it at this time when it is confronting terrorism and the drugs trade.
I believe that the co-operation of the Lebanese government to combat the terrorism in our country would be beneficial to the Lebanese working in Columbia."
They currently have more than 1000 hostages. The security authorities are continuing to search for the missing Lebanese (...)."
American Ambassador Hears Lebanon's Observations on Resolution 1397 at Foreign Affairs.
They noted that the "the situation between Iraq and Kuwait" was missing from the summit agenda, the headings of which were decided in Cairo last Monday. The agenda of the 117th meeting of Arab Foreign Ministers was also missing.
Patel asked about the circumstances surrounding the operation at the Shalomi settlement, in connection with which the Israeli forces are still trying to accuse Hizbollah of being responsible, either with the help of Palestinians with whom they trained or by using elements that succeeded in penetrating the international borders.
2 - It merely referred to Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, without affirming their implementation.
6 - The resolution dealt with the two states of Israel and Palestine and therefore was not comprehensive.
This means that the Resolution was cooked up outside the Council and was submitted only for approval, not debate.
...Qablan on the Anniversary of the Hijra and the Beginning of Ashura: The Year of the Intifada and Fidelity to the Arab Right.
This anniversary brings back to us the glories of Islam, the day when Imam Ali bin Abi Talib (a) confronted Marhaba the Jew and wrestled with him on the day Khaibar was conquered and the Jews were expelled from it.
This fraternity forms a sound basis and provides strong armor for confronting the challenges of economic, political and cultural globalization, and requires us to strengthen the spirit of citizenship in our Arab and Islamic countries, to develop the ties of Arab and Islamic solidarity, and to develop accommodating relations between the Arab and Islamic states, so that we will be one force to counter the projects of hegemony and control imposed upon us by the events of 11 September. The call of the Hijra invites us to unite, to demonstrate solidarity and to reject all forms of oppression and tyranny, to confront it with the self-sacrificing spirit of Hussein, one that accepts neither humiliation nor shame and draws its strength from the determination, patience and jihad of the Prophet of God (s) and his rejection of deals and concessions.
Given this, what is required is fidelity to the Arab right in Palestine and rejection of all formulations by which people want to promote a solution to the Palestinian issue, for it is not permissible to concede the right of the Palestinian people in their land, the land of Palestine, which includes Jerusalem, representing the capital of the Palestinian state, and which will be achieved by the return of Palestinian refugees to their homes and by the destruction of all Zionist colonies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
And for whose interest do you legislate?
We would like recall here, by way of example not exhaustively, that reclaiming the concession of the Beirut Electricity Company in 1954 required a struggle and popular movements, including demonstrations, detentions and non-payment, which was confronted by the government at that time, which issued a detention order against the popular Deputy of Beirut and member of the National Socialist Front, the late Abdallah Al-Hajj, on charges of inciting civil unrest, forcing him to live inside the Chamber of Deputies for at least one week, during which time the demonstrations increased, the government acquiesced and a decree was issued reclaiming the concession.
The people also have the right to ask: How did they agree, and in the Council of Ministers as well, to the draft rent law, which strips tenants of all his basic rights: the right to extend the rent contract and the right to obtain fair compensation to help him secure alternative accommodation.
And how?
The security organizations of whose excesses they complain will remain, as will the taxes of Al-Sinyurah to which there is no end and the debts of Al-Hariri which have now reached thirty billion American dollars. Some of them may return to the saying that was put forward before the events of 1975: "Security Before Bread". It is as if they have not yet learnt that when people's basic food supplies are threatened, there can be no security for anyone, not before nor afterwards.
Expanded Meeting to Tackle Problems of Al-Damur River; Junbalat: Remove Infringement to Use Clean Water; Junbalat.
He noted that studies and field surveys on the course of the river, which were discussed at a first meeting held last year, had shown that the most important problems affecting it were: pollution created by the waste of factories and instillations surrounding the course of the river, which included tourist installations, incinerators, stone factories, cement works, asphalt works, olive presses, chicken and bovine farms, abattoirs, rubble, agricultural pesticides and household refuse,
Deputy Junbalat then spoke, saying, "Today's meeting is further to the meeting held at the Al-Damur municipality with Mr. Antoine Ghafri (head of the municipality) some months ago, in order to resolve the problems of irrigation in Al-Damur and the problems of pollution along the course of the river, in addition to the items identified in the speech of Mr. Eli Aun, in the presence of prominent personalities, the District Governor and municipal heads. We will draw up the plan in the presence of representatives of the relevant ministries, the Ministry of the Environment in particular (Antoine Al-Gharib). The plan drawn up must be implemented in order that we can all have clean water and clean irrigation."
Regarding the company's decision, he said, "We are grateful for their decision. The issue is that the Ministry of the Environment and the United Nations should give us guarantees as to how to preserve this natural environment. If there is the potential for economic benefit, I have no idea about this."
French Ambassador Philippe Lecourtier spent the day yesterday at Baalbak and the surrounding area, during which he was familiarized with the educational, cultural, agricultural and economic conditions. He inspected agricultural projects that France is helping to develop, in particular grapevines, in preparation for a study that is to be drawn up about projects completed with French, Lebanese and European Common Market collaboration.
The French Ambassador and the delegation then traveled to the Maronite National School where he was met by the Archbishop of Baalbak and the Maronite Al-Ahmar Monastery, Bulus Munjid Al-Hashim, and members of the administrative, teaching and student staff. A female student welcomed the French delegation and Lecourtier shook her hand and kissed her. He then toured the school and playing fields, bearing in mind that they were the property of the French state before they were offered to the Maronite sect in 1946, and it became known as the Al-Matran school after having been accommodation for the French officers.
He added, "We have a cultural comment after having read and heard that some French schools have expelled female students on account of their wearing the veil, which detracts from this aspect. We know that France is a secular state and also that it was involved in Israel's celebrations of the fiftieth anniversary celebration of the establishment of its state, participating with its aircraft. It is a political matter but may affect France's reputation with the Arabs and Muslims."
He was familiarized with the agricultural of grapevines, which are now in the production stage, and with a small field in which saffron is being tried in Dir Al-Ahmar, and the potential for adopting agriculture, which provides money and profits. He then inspected the Ministry of Agriculture milk collection center in Mahallat Durs.
We are deploying our resources for the revival of this area, which, for a long time, has been isolated, since all eyes turned to the south for political reasons. The time has come for the balance to be reset between all areas. Our educational priorities include language and experiments with all Francophone requirements."
Al-Nabatiyyah and Al-Beqaa Security Committees Provide Security Measures for Ashura; Al-Beqaa Security.
At the end of the meeting, Governor Al-Muli gave the following statement: "A meeting of the security sub-committee was in held in the Governorate of Al-Nabatiyyah on 14 March, the date of the Israeli occupation of the south and the issuing of Resolution 425.
It will also lead to a meeting between the political forces to ensure coordination in the event that any measure or action is taken in the Governorate.
In response to a question he clarified, "Any security measures in the Beqaa for the holding of the Arab summit will be taken by a central decision issued by the Minister of the Interior and Municipalities, Ilyas Al-Murr."
Yesterday afternoon Chairman of the Development and Construction Council Jamal Aitani opened the Al-Kukudi transformer bridge, which links President Hafiz Al-Asad Street with the Beirut International Airport road and the Khaldah-Al-Kukudi dual carriageway within the Airport enclosure, in the presence of Deputy Basim Al-Sabaa, Governor of Al-Jabal Adnan Dumyati and the representative of the Kuwaiti Ambassador, Adil Al-Ayyar, who cut the tape.
The Syndicate distributed a précis of his life, which read as follows: "The deceased was born in 1930, graduated in Law and mastered the French, English and Latin languages.
He was a model of gentility and discipline, and constantly strove to improve the situation of the press in Lebanon.
Condolences will be accepted after the burial until 7 pm in the Church Hall.
Educational institutions yesterday witnessed protests and marches in solidarity with the Palestinian Intifada and in condemnation of the Israeli massacres.
In Sidon students from the Al-Iman schools, which come under the Al-Maqasid Islamic Charitable Association, performed prayers for the absent for the souls of Intifada martyrs.
Speeches were given condemning these practices and recommendations were issued calling for a demonstration on the eve of the Arab summit for continued contacts with international health and social institutions to urge them to condemn these practices.
It would have been better for you to write that as an environmentalist you had received this report with much happiness, had you bothered to examine the contract signed between Kasrawan Municipality and the tourist company.
This project is from national capital and those responsible for it are known for their patriotism and their capability in the tourism sector.
It will stop emigration, will strengthen environmental tourism and will make tourism part of the economy in addition to the current agricultural economy, from which the farmers of our town suffer.
Thank you to the President of the country for standing on the side of right.
I said to his Majesty, 'Is the King envious of the Vice Regent?'
This proposal was the racehorse in the consultative dialogue that took place yesterday between Prime Minister Rafiq Al-Hariri and the economic authorities, who always used to be the strategic ally of the government generally, and of Prime Minister Al-Hariri specifically.
Exceptional circumstances have prevented me from taking a seat among you and addressing you directly at your second Arab Conference of its kind since last December's conference, in which I participated with enthusiasm in defense of the Intifada and the resistance.
You know that they were defeated and stopped thinking about it.
The rich among them do not control their resources and cannot dispose of them in a way that is politically beneficial to the Arabs, if they should have the intent to do so. The poor among them need international assistance and are drowning in a sea of debts.

To what extent will the government commit itself to act on the slogans it has put out about investment in Lebanon?
The statement clarified, "The reason for the closure decision is the lack of clarity in the position of the official and political authorities towards the project, if not the complete absence of a position, despite successive reviews over one and a half years with the relevant authorities."
There was no change to the atmospherics of the Beirut discount market yesterday against the weak demand for the American dollar and the hesitation of traders to give it up except in rare cases.
In fact this development did hide the reduction in the number of people seeking unemployment benefit in the United State by 3000 last week, leaving a total of 377,000 at the end of the week. This suggests that there are new job opportunities being created as a result of a revival in economic activity. Moreover, the American Ministry of Trade announced that factory stocks did not rise in January more than 0.2% on December's levels. At the same time, sales of this stock jumped by 1.1% over the same period, reflecting an improvement in consumer spending, which is largely due to economic growth.

Economic Council Amends Security Structure; Proposal to Establish "Tax and Verification Agency".
A discussion about the identity of the National Social Security Fund took place, as to whether it was a public institution with a social characteristic, as the government suggested, or an independent institution?
Citing the reasons for such a step, Shaluq believed that the issue of tax and inspection represented a cornerstone of the Fund's work. "Experience has shown that the traditional method of managing this task has slipped up for several reasons, which had led to a reduction in collection and the continued silence of many organizations and individuals. This can be clearly seen by reading the data available for the number of registered persons, both organizations and individuals, and the amount of subscriptions."
The verification rates for social security are known to vary between 40 and 45% for well-known political, sectarian and administrative reasons.
- Article 2: The Agency, for the interest of the Fund, shall be responsible for collecting established subscriptions and for inspecting registered organizations and individuals and those who are not registered, for the purpose of legally registering them.
It was also learnt that the amendment has given to the supervisory committee of the Fund, which has become the supervisory department, additional powers.
The Deputy Governor of the Bank of Lebanon, Harutiyun Samuiliyan announced the convening of a conference on "The Management of Operating Risks in View of the New Perspective of the Bal Committee for Banking Supervision" on the 20th and 21st of this March in the new building of the Bank.
He noted, "The Bank of Lebanon is a legislative authority for the banks. The governing body consequently believes that one of our duties is to provide banks with sufficient opportunity to reach the criteria required by the Bal committee, which is working to draft the criteria, which are almost final.
He noted, "Operating risks are apparent internationally because conventional banking work, represented by deposits and lending, have started to be transformed into operating work as technology has created a different situation; for example, automated banking, electronic banking, telephone banking and other work of an executive nature that witnesses day-by-day development."
The speakers will include Secretary-General of the Banks Association Makram Sadir, Secretary-General of the Money-Laundering Investigation Authority, Dr Muhammad Baasiri, Mr. Charles Ceventa from the audit company, member of the Banks Supervisory Committee Amin Awad, and Director of Legal Affairs at the Bank of Lebanon Pierre Kanaan.

Murad met with a delegation from among them at his office in the Ministry of Education after they had protested outside the entrance to the Ministry at UNESCO. He listened to their demands. The lecturers stressed the importance of concluding their contracts, which total 582 contracts accumulated over 4 years. Students from the Faculty of Health demanded that lecturers be provided because they are only learning 20% of their program due to the missing contracted staff.
If governments have decided to give licenses to private universities, this is happening all over the world. In Syria, there this trend, in Jordan there are more than 42 private universities and in Sudan over 60, etc.
They also demanded that work be done in the Representative Councils.
He informed them that he would discuss this matter with the Council of Ministers.
His appearance remained grave, but his face opened up to another horizon, a broader horizon, as he spoke freely in elegant and stylish French in a patriotic, cultured preaching voice with an unusual admonishing echo.
Why?
Just for His Holiness, which delighted me, as I heard him talking about Lebanon at the Burj Vazlian evening. He smiled with the gravity of the old and said to them plainly, "What is there to be surprised at if this is the truth?"
He said, "There are no front lines between Lebanon and Armenia.
Every Armenian should be aware of Lebanon's particularities in his surroundings, culturally, historically, morally and spiritually. He should understand that the Armenians, following the massacre, achieved their renaissance in Lebanon and that they must carry Lebanon with them in their hearts wherever they settle, as a cultural bridge between Armenia and the countries of the Armenian Diaspora."
His Holiness concluded with a brilliant truth: "The heart of every Armenian strives to preserve the Lebanese nature of Lebanon, to be an Ambassador for the Lebanese nature of Lebanon in his heart.
Chapters from Lebanon's History in Book by Provincial Translator Francois Khuri, Lebanon's First Press Correspondent in France?
But I found the answer via Mrs. Françoise Khuri Al-Hashim in an old book entitled "The Memoirs of François Khuri, Former Provincial Translator to Mt Lebanon", beneath which in a thin font it said that he was the correspondent to the Al-Astrasiyun, Independence Pledge,  Journal de Caire, Havas Company in the Ottoman period.
To the conflicts in Mt Lebanon between the narrow party currents, which caused the country and people much trouble for no clear or obvious reason but were, in most cases, disputes between feudal leaders and families affecting their private interests under the cover of patriotic slogans or concerning the public interest.

In this connection I want to confirm to you that Lebanon is a safe, welcoming and cultured country.

Lucian George and George Farshakh, suggested that we put on this major national competition.

13 April and Its "Derivatives".
This tune relies deceitfully permitting what is taking place in Lebanon on the argument that European capitals are themselves witnessing an unprecedented expression of sympathy with the Palestinians.
The fact is that Aukar Square is now the third side of an open hole of explosion, or which will lead Lebanon to explode, amidst the frightening disdain shown towards the daily international warnings being directed against it.
And purely as a reminder at a time of remembrance: the 13 April disturbances could have been stopped in the act had the army immediately been given a free hand at that time to stop the destruction of he state.
Some of the "rejectionist" Palestinian leaders are running their operations in Lebanon from Damascus and are urging that the borders be opened.
Palestinian Complaint at Ambiguity of American Proposals; Arafat Refuses to Move to Gaza Because "He is Strong Despite the Siege".
Israeli press reports focused yesterday on two key topics: Powell's meetings with Israeli officials and his meeting yesterday with head of the Palestinian Authority Yasir Arafat; and the results of the battles that took place some days ago in Jenin Camp after the Israeli army allowed journalists to enter the camp.
He adds, "The Palestinian representatives complain that the American proposals for a ceasefire are ambiguous. The Palestinian demands are clearly formulated with a schedule whilst the American demands for Israel are always ambiguous and non-binding.
He continues, "The Palestinian leadership is searching for the idea proposed in one of the political meetings, which suggested that Arafat leave Ramallah for Gaza.
He thus no longer feels weak and banished. In fact his strength has increased.
Is it time to move on from "Besiege Your Siege" (Mahmoud Darwish made this expression famous when Beirut defeated Sharon in 1982) to the phase "Break the Siege"? The siege by which Sharon, the mad barbarian, has imprisoned Arafat, and imprisoned all of us with it, by lighting the fire around us and establishing the pillars of hatred as the Wailing Wall of a new Israel inhabited by fear, in an attempt to terrorize us.
The United States has given its strongest diplomatic references to its concern at the situation developing on the Lebanese/Israeli borders since the end of last March, with its Secretary of State, Colin Powell, deciding to undertake two quick visits to both Beirut and Damascus to discuss with Syrian and Lebanese officials how to contain the escalation on the borders.
Two days after his overthrow and detention following a failed military coup, President Hugo Chavez returned victorious to the presidency in Venezuela, raising his fist in greeting to his supporters following his return to the "Miraflores" Presidential Palace in the capital Caracas.
Twenty thousand Palestinians and Lebanese attended the "Besiege Your Siege" Festival.
The United States has given its strongest diplomatic indication of its concern at the situation developing on the Lebanese-Israeli borders since last March with its Secretary of State Colin Powell suddenly deciding today to mount two quick visits to both Beirut and Damascus to discuss with Lebanese and Syrian officials how to contain the escalation on the borders.
An official Lebanese source had previously announced that Powell would arrive in Lebanon on Monday and then travel to Syria, two countries that were not originally included on his regional tour.
The only official information available in this regard indicated that the visit to Beirut would not last more than three hours.
He visited Damascus where he met with Syrian President Bashar Al-Asad and Syrian Prime Minister Muhammad Mustafa Miro.
Official sources said yesterday evening that Powell's visit to Beirut had not been included on his tour schedule but had been incorporated in order to ascertain Lebanon's view on the developments taking place in the region, especially the situation in the south, notably in light of the official position expressed by the President of the Republic that Lebanon could not provide security guarantees for northern Israel other than as part of a just and comprehensive peace. The Israeli withdrawal from the south was only part of the problem. The most important part - the matter of Palestinian refugees - was still suspended.
Leader of the Progressive Socialist Party Deputy Walid Junbalat believed "the curse of the Palestinian blood that has been shed in Jenin, Nablus and the West Bank will fall on all those who do not answer the Arab cause, from the Occupied Territories to some Arab or non-Arab rulers".
Junbalat answered: "When we made this visit to see Hasbiya, and I wish to see you always, it was first of all a political visit, during which we addressed a message to Druze patriots in Palestine, some of whom have answered whilst others have failed to do so.
Let us look to the future because history is not merciful and because peoples do not forget, albeit that they do occasionally turn a blind eye in specific difficult conditions when there may be a feeling that the peoples will be defeated. But peoples are not defeated. The Palestinian people will not forget who stood alongside the Palestinian issue at home (Palestine) and those who did not do so."
Written by Khalil Falihan:
They said that Powell had decided to withdraw from his position and to visit Beirut and Damascus in an attempt by him to prevent further escalation of the situation that had flared up, following the talks undertaken by Powell last Friday with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and after he inspected the borders with Lebanon with to see what was happening his own eyes.
The sources confirmed that Powell's visit to Beirut would be an opportunity to give the Arab peace initiative, which was approved by the Arab summit by consensus and supported by Washington, a push. It will be a priority on the agenda of the talks to be held by the person behind it, Saudi Crown Prince Abdallah bin Abd Al-Aziz, who is to visit Washington on the 25th of this month, with President George Bush.
Powell's office then contacted Al-Hariri's home and was told that he was in Damascus. He was contacted at his home in Damascus but was in a meeting with Syrian Prime Minister Mustafa Miro. A message was left saying that Powell hoped that he could delay his visit to Washington a view hours because he wanted to meet with him in Beirut and that he was waiting for a response after he had finished his meeting with the head of the Palestinian Authority, Yasir Arafat in Ramallah. Before Al-Hariri met with Syrian President Bashar Al-Asad he informed Powell's office that he had agreed to delay his trip to Washington to today, instead of yesterday.
According to an American diplomatic source yesterday evening, Powell will arrive at Beirut airport from Israel at 8:30 am. He will be met at the airport by Minister of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants Mahmoud Hamoud, who will accompany him to the Republican Palace, where we will hold a meeting with President Lahud for 90 minutes. Prime Minister Al-Hariri and Minister Hamoud will attend.
It has been decided that Powell will travel to Damascus after Beirut. From there it will be decided whether to return to Jerusalem or Washington in light of discussions undertaken by the team accompanying him, which has remained in Israel.
He called the Palestinian Authority "to trust its people, their resistance and great gifts, so that it will be worthy at this stage to represent hopes and aspirations because it relies on genuine strength provided by the Palestinian people. These sacrifices can only confront Israeli arrogance. We also appreciate the pressures applied by America, Israel and the arrogant states for concession and the effacement of the vestiges of these sacrifices". He stressed, "With a little patience, forbearance and confidence in this noble people, Palestinian hopes will be realized and Israel will not be able to achieve what it wants."
During a meeting of solidarity with the Palestinian people organized by the Hizbollah women's authorities in the Hussein building of Imam Al-Khomeini in Baalbak he said, "What is demanded of the Palestinians today is that they collect arms, guarantee Israeli security, detain the fighters, condemn suicide attacks and control the streets in return for a promise to complete the negotiating process at war, without the strength or determination to ensure right prevails. Sharon, meanwhile, explicitly expressed his ideas to solve the Palestinian issue, namely that he does not want to break up the settlement, but look for alternatives to the present Palestinian Authority, establish four Palestinian living areas, expel a large number of Palestinians and not give up Jerusalem."
"Palestine Day" in Sport City; 20 Thousand Gather; Darwish, Al-Rumi and Qaabur: Our Pains Great, Our Hopes Greater; Darwish.
As Ahmad Qaabur called out, "I call on you, I grasp you hands more tightly", and at the songs of Marcel Khalifah and Al-Sheikh Imam, the public entered the stadium with the flags. Those of the Progressive Socialists dominated.
Near here, Yasir Arafat was asked: Where are you going?
Now we are all Palestinians (...) the land is the body, the body is the land and the road to Palestine only passes through Palestine.
Our pain is great but our hopes are greater (...) we will love life because we are children of life."
"What is taking place today in Palestine is a crime against humanity and I have come to declare my final and eternal rejection of the occupation of Palestine."
From this spot we say today: We do not commit suicide for the love of it, but we sacrifice ourselves as martyrs in love for life".
Sport City Becomes "Palestine" City.
It opened its arm to embrace the Palestinian cause and to recall, with its people, bitter, sad and black memories.
Sport City yesterday was not just an open playing field for 50 thousand people, nor just a place for a massive celebration. The choice of the location, as the organizers said, and as those who attended, took part and undertook this act of solidarity felt, was first and foremost linked to memory.
And the place became piles of rubble from which the smell of gunpowder and death rose.
This is how Sport City cut short the distance of time once more.
The Palestinian people fight on their land, land that is in the body and the body the land.
It is no small detail that we should commemorate Palestine in Beirut today under the slogan "Besiege Your Siege".
Their signs indicated who they were. Supporters of the Lebanese parties did not hesitate to climb the electricity pylons from which to hang their flags, so that they might fly high, as part of a competitiveness the Lebanese cannot hide no matter what the occasion, bearing in mind that it was the Day of Palestine and only the Palestinian flag should have been flying. Public auctions will take place on other occasions.
Mahmoud Darwish's calm, loud and warm voice united the echo and put Palestine back where it belong, in the hearts and minds of all Arabs: "Now every Arab bears a Palestinian heart.
Pictures from Jenin.
But it is certain that the pictures that Powell would have seen in Jenin Camp would have changed the effect of the scenes he saw onboard his military transporter of the effects of the attack mounted by a Palestinian girl on a bus station in Jerusalem. It would also have changed the reverberations of the bombing exchange between Hizbollah and the Israeli army,
And perhaps if the American Secretary of State wanted to settle the debate surrounding the "missing corpses", he could have read the ruling issued by the Israeli High Court of Justice, which allows the Israeli army to remove the corpses of Palestinians killed in Jenin Camp despite the objections of human rights organizations.
Only women and children remain in the camp.
But what is the use of such delusional achievements and long meetings when Colin Powell is unable to force Sharon to commit to a clear schedule to end military operations against the Palestinians. Foreign Minister Shimon Perez talks about the need for a week or more to end the operation, but Israeli military commanders are talking of much longer, more than several weeks.
The book "Contemporary Lovers", recently published by historian Claudine Montai, expounds Chaplin's life from London to his Swiss exile in Vivai, passing through the Hollywood studios and the Charlie's great love for Oona.
Charlie Chaplin married three times before meeting Oona O'Neil, daughter of novelist Eugene O'Neil, to become his eternal partner and provide him with the psychological support over seventeen years.
My mother used to see films at home. My brother Michel used to cry when he saw Charlo eating his shoes.
She has supported her statements with rapid examples in a lively style that reflects her personality.
Chaplin played the film "The Baby" in 1919 following the death of his three-day old son.
Chaplin felt attracted to and enmity towards Hitler at the same time.
My father was conservative.
Oona could not accept her husband's death on the 25th of December 19777 and did not forgive him for his death - "How did he dare to do something like that?". She tried in vain to overcome her grief and search for new love, until she found that love in July 1991.
During his contribution, Fr Naji Adalbi spoke about "eastern interpretations of the patriarchal texts" under the spiritual and intellectual authority of the fathers of the Church in our Arab society, and of "their conspicuous attempts to bring the concepts of Christianity closer to the language of the Arabs, for example in explaining the meaning of the Trinity".
In the fifth session, which was led by Fr Bulus Ruhana, Archbishop Kirllis Bustrus spoke about "the theology of Jesus Christ in Christian-Islamic dialogue". He noted the "priority of examining the fortunate points held in common by and the differences in the Christian and Islamic views of the person of Jesus Christ". Sheikh Muhammad Al-Hajj (Director of the Oriental Institute for Philosophical and Religious Studies) then spoke about "Christian Theology: An Islamic Perspective", in which he dealt with the "the paradox of religious doctrinal dialogue being the most truthful dialogue when its characteristics and mechanisms become clear, far from the position that claims it to be impossible".

A statement issued by the rights organization, a copy of which was received by France Press, said, "The old guard in the Syrian government is fully aware that relaxation is contrary to their interests, as is the opening of the files on corruption and suppression, and that they may be called to account by the Syrian people. For this reason they have fabricated charges against tens of oppositionists" the most prominent of which are Riyadh Saif, Mamun Al-Humusi, Riyadh Al-Turk, Arif Dalilah, Habib Isa and Habib Salih. It said, "At a time when the Arab peoples need sincere persons from among them to confront the massacres experienced by the Palestinian people (...) the Syrian authorities reward the activists by extending their detention for an eighth month in succession." It noted that the detentions were "a punishment against them for their attempt to activate the role of Syrian civil society, which has been maltreated for thirty years. Everyone rejoiced when President Bashar Al-Asad came in view of his reformist program and attempt to create a formula by which civil society could be re-activated."
With the exception of the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) correspondent journalists and diplomats were not allowed to attend the session.
The Court has set the 12th of June as the date for the next session for Al-Buni's trial and the 19th of June for that of Isa.
The network explained that the driver of the truck and the passenger accompanying him, both of whom are Israeli nationals, confirmed that they were transporting pieces of furniture.
The authorities in Washington refused to comment on the subject.
France Press quoted an American official, who asked to remain anonymous, as saying that the American intelligence agencies had become aware of an "unconfirmed" threat that might target a nuclear plant on the 4th of July.

He added, "We have many appropriate and safe dedicated reception centers."
The Deputy Speaker in the Italian Senate Roberto Caldiroli, executive member of the Confederation, said, "I strongly oppose the idea of receiving even one of those Palestinians."
Referring to the smart hotel overlooking the sea, British tourist George Dodd said, "We know that they are staying at that hotel and I cannot say that we feel relaxed at their presence and all this number of policemen around us."
Talking to the guards stationed on the roof of the hotel, German tourist Paul Hoffman said, "I think it strange to surround the place with all these security procedures.
A British tourist laying her towel on the beach meters from the hotel entrance said, "Had I known that they were coming here I would have gone to Pavos (...) Do you think I like everyone watching me?
The representative of the Palestinian Authority in Cyprus, Samir Abu Ghazalah, sent food to the exiles, including stuffed vine leaves, milk and cakes.
There is no need for us, against the background of this political chaff from the Ocean to the Gulf, to form demonstrations, make speeches and issue statements. For 54 years we have been reaping defeats and disasters and mastering the art of demonstrations, speeches and statements.
It may be too early to seek mercy for Ariel Sharon following the return of the wolf, Benyamin Netanyahu, to the surface. But we must at least consider the words of King Abdallah, who said that the Sharm Al-Sheikh meeting discussed a mechanism for providing security to Israel in return for providing an independent state to the Palestinians. What security are we discussing when we face the impossibility of a Palestinian state?!
* Fourthly, we must recall the Israeli atmospherics that preceded the holding of the Madrid conference and which accompanied its workings 11 years ago. "Joy and satisfaction" were the main features of Israeli feeling at the time because the Arabs had "finally" shown a desire to make peace with Israel and give it Middle Eastern legitimacy. But we must note that the mere acceptance by Israel of the idea of peace now is not only a cause of joy and satisfaction from the Ocean to the Gulf but is one of the primary Arab aspirations. If this is not the case then why do the Arab states continue to express affection, good intent and peace initiatives whilst the Israelis are hung up on policies of aggression, expansion and violence?
Only God knows!
Sharon Reassures Americans: Policy Unchanged; Highlights "Advanced Weapon" Deployed by Hizbollah.
Within a short time of coming to power he signed the Wye Agreement. His government also ordered the evacuation of parts of Hebron.
Today, because he sits in the Prime Minister's chair and bears responsibilities, he uses a different, more ambiguous language.
When the time is right and the Palestinians come to the negotiating table, there is a suspicion that the head of the government in Israel may not, like those before him, try to reach an agreement with them, including the establishment of a state."
He confirmed that there would be no elections before the 28th of October 2003.
He added, "We see increasing Iranian activity among the Arabs of Israel."
Let us sit and think for once, and make some simple comparisons:
* Secondly, Yasir Arafat revealed nothing when he said that the Likud decision constituted the demolition of the Oslo Accord. He was preceded by Israeli ministers and analysts who mounted a strong campaign against this decision. He did, however, reveal a new facet of the concessions when he told the "..." television station to the letter: "We hope to see an independent Palestinian state alongside a Jewish Israeli state".
* Fifthly, the Jordanian monarch says that he bore an urgent (note the word urgent) message to Washington saying that the region was in need of foreign intervention to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian dispute and that Washington must replace its policy of "managing the dispute" to one of "ending the dispute"... This urgent message calls us to recall the time when the Arabs opposed any American intervention in the dispute out of the fear of bias towards Israel, as if that bias has now ended!
Of course, there is no need for any of us to scream: where were we and where are we now, because where we were has led us to where we are.
Researchers at the National Institute for Health conducted experiments on mice in an area of the brain known as the dentate gyrus, which produces new nerve cells throughout life and helps in the processes of learning and memory.
The analysis of data collected on these rodents showed that the consumption of nicotine reduced production of nerve cells.
It should be noted that research demonstrating the existence of a negative effect for nicotine on the brain is small. Some even speak of nicotine having a positive effect on the nerves and consequently on nerve cells.
We hoped that His Excellency the Speaker would take into consideration the recommendation of the free professions syndicates, given the interests incorporated therein for the Exchequer, the State and citizens, and the commitment of all to the Law.
The Settlements Law was incomplete and imposed unreasonable settlements on those who had not made a statement. It was not appropriate for the financial and economic situation in which citizens generally, and practitioners of free professions specifically, find themselves. The amendments are in the hands of Speaker Birri."
We also discussed the issue of production costs, specifically the cost of electricity in Lebanon, which is the highest in industrial terms in the world. His Excellency the Speaker promised to tackle the matter, especially during the night period."
Al-Hariri explained that following the meeting, which lasted an hour, he and Lahud discussed various domestic issues. "There was an agreement of opinion that it was important to make administrative work more effective and speed up the start of privatization."
Al-Hariri met at the Saraya with Deputies Qablan Isa Al-Khuri and Jibran Tuq in the presence of former head of the Lawyers Syndicate Michel Khattar and attorney for the Bishri municipality Hani Rahmah, then with Deputy Wajih Al-Bairini.
He also met a delegation from the Lebanon Ambassadors Forum headed by former Ambassador Fuad Al-Turk, who gave the following speech: "In the name of my fellow ambassadors, I thank you for welcoming us despite your many preoccupations and concerns, especially at present.
However, the Forum's aims in the first instance were to put the experience of its members at the disposal of Lebanon's interests, without charge, given their awareness of the necessity of mobilizing all Lebanese moral, intellectual and scientific powers and capacities in the march towards renaissance, salvation and development.
Lahud Discusses Domestic Conditions with Four Ministers and Archbishop Bisharah.
Salamah clarified that he had also discussed with Lahud the necessary preparations to be taken in preparation for holding the Francophone Conference next October.
Lahud also informed Minister of Labor Ali Qansu of the results of the meeting of the Board of Directors of the Arab Labor Organization held in Cairo. Lebanon, represented by Minister Qansu, was elected Chairman of the Board of Directors for one year by consensus.
According to official information, President Lahud discussed with him political conditions and stances.
Safir: We Hope For an End to Many Interactions, Economic Situation Contemptible But We Haven't Lost Hope.
The economic situation is continually deteriorating and we no longer see a future in this country. The horizons are blocked and the living conditions are very difficult, to the extent that our hope in the nation's resurrection is almost lost, especially when the continuous disputes among the pillars of the government cause institutional paralysis and loss of confidence in the country.
The Patriarch responded, "We share with you your concerns, and you referred to the political and economic situation and to the situation of Engineer Airani.
The economic situation is contemptible. This is no secret. All the people complain.
The Patriarch had met with Professor Dominic Chauvilet from the Sorbonne University, followed by Sheikh Wadi Al-Khazin, the Director General of the Maronite Brothers of Mary, Abbot Francois Aid, who sought permission to travel to Rome and Paris, and attorney Bahiyyah Abu Hamad.
The deadline for withdrawing municipal candidacies officially closed at midnight Monday evening/Tuesday with four withdrawals in the town of Bishri, leaving a final total of 30 candidates competing for 18 seats.
But the problem does not lie in this increase, but in the number of families putting forward more representatives that "custom" allows whilst representatives from other families want to tackle the deficit, bearing in mind that the internal regulations allow for the candidacy deadline to be extended until next Friday for families who have not yet completed their candidacy, i.e. 48 hours before the elections take place..
(i.e. an excess of two because custom gives them the right to six).

He confirmed that all bills due for the year 2001 would be paid within ten days of receiving them from the Ministry of Health. This will be followed by payment of the bills for this year, which will lighten the severity of the financial crisis experienced by the hospital over about 8 months.
Baalbak - "Al-Nahar":
At the height of the cell phone battle, citizens ask: Where has the matter of violations against maritime public property gone, or the violations against the mountains of Lebanon, which the machines are tearing to pieces, in order to sell their sand and stones for dollars, whilst the state does not benefit from these two items with one white piastre in these dark and gloomy times?
On the 14th of May this year the Iranians celebrated the 110th anniversary of Al-Mirza Al-Shirazi, the strongest religious authority in Iran at that time, issuing his famous fatwa prohibiting the use of tobacco. The people obeyed and threw the water pipes off the roofs of their buildings into the streets, in what was known as the "tobacco uprising", thereby causing the British authorities to submit to the volition of the Iranians.
There are many studies and views in the history of contemporary Iran that analyze the phenomenon of the men of religion and their place in Iranian society, and whether they constitute a social class or not.
In the Safavid period their political strength grew after they grew closer to the Safavid "Shahs", who relied on the scholars as one of the pillars of their rule. But many of them removed themselves from government and turned to the teaching of the religious sciences alone.
The clerics would walk in the streets and the people would bow before them putting their right hand on their chest in respect, as is the social custom in Iran.
And many Iranian clerics have confessed to making mistakes when they came to official positions.
However, what was on offer was tiny outside the framework of the Bank of Lebanon, which by retaining its margin of intervention as it was, between 1501.00 lira (buy) and 1514.00 lira (sell), caused it to close nominally as normal since 9 September 1999 at a declared average price of 1507.50 lira.
All these facts have worked together on both sides of the Atlantic to give the dollar a new impetus, such that it closed in London with a further increase against the other principal currencies as follows:
128.65 Japanese yen against 127.85.
European Stock Markets have continued their upward progress following the example of Wall Street and Nasdaq after the publication of retail sales figures in the United States which stimulated hopes once more of a continuation of growth in the American economy at a good level, reflecting positively on the economies of its European partners.

Tomorrow, departure.
They wake up a girl swallowed by smooth rocks.
Like the white scattered across the sky and in dust.
This is the full autumn.
I dissolve, under the rain.
One god is not enough.
Take your stick and your veils and leave.
My mother tears apart the chains from the moment the word began.
With another face, another heart.

Prepare me the way to the beginning.
When I am with you and think of nothing but the butterflies.
The petition read: "Despite the widespread international condemnation of the violent policy of the Israeli government towards the Palestinian people in the Occupied Territories, it appears to be unconcerned by the moral calls addressed to it by world leaders.
When will we examine the Israeli war crimes perpetrated on a daily and regular basis as more than an isolated act, but as a national political issue?
We note that in light of the opposition of some academics and cultural elite in Israel to the Israeli government, with the participation of others in Israeli-Palestinian research projects, the vast majority of them have offered support for the wicked attack of the Israeli army on the Palestinians, or have failed to make their opposition effective or have any impact.
As happened in the days of the boycott of the policy of racial discrimination in South Africa, what is required now is a rapid international move to stop the massacres against the Palestinian people."
He spoke of the efforts of the security services, which had led to "the arrest of more than 1500 persons accused of dealing in and promoting drugs in 2001, in addition to operations to destroy fields in which poppies are grown, which have continued since last month, especially in the Beqaa Plain."
He believed that the study "constituted a pioneering example of interaction between the efforts of the security services and the efforts of relevant ministries and non-governmental private associations". He confirmed, "The efforts to deal with the problem will not achieve success unless they focus on reducing supply and reducing demand."
He added that the United Nations Program is about to announce a new program in this area and discussion had started with donor countries providing finance.
The study included a sample of students in the secondary departments of schools and universities. It said, "The comparative percentage of drug taking between secondary school pupils and university students has doubled from 1991 to 1999 at least." The study also revealed,  "The average age for starting use varies from 14 to 17 years."
The International Osteoporosis Federation has opened its conference, attended by more than 6 thousand doctors from numerous countries, at the Conference Palace in Lisbon, the Portuguese capital.
For the younger of them it impedes daily activity and prevents productivity. For the older it hinders their life to a much greater extent, especially given that the costs of health care and treatment are high (...).
Assistance must also come from the patient and those who help him. There are today 139 national associations in 71 countries who are members of the International Osteoporosis Federation. They spread knowledge, change health legislation, provide material support and educate the community."
During the conference there was a round table for women chaired by Queen Rania and managed by a member of the European Parliament, Mel Reed. She started by presenting a commemorative placard to Mrs. Nazik Al-Hariri, following her appointment as first ambassador for the International Osteoporosis Federation out of regard for her efforts in Club 206, which now has 30 members who are working to assist in combating osteoporosis.
This is out of my belief that what man does in this area and in other charitable areas he will do for God's pleasure, without seeking thanks or recognition.
Two doctors, Ghassan Maaluf and Basil Al-Masri, spoke about osteoporosis in the Middle East.

President of the International Football Federation (FIFA) Joseph Sepp Blatter has denied in a press conference held yesterday morning in Zurich all the illegal activities attributed to him. He expressed confidence that he would be re-elected for a second four-year term at the Federation Conference in Seoul on Wednesday, the 29th of May.
In a report to the executive committee of the international Federation, Zen Ruffinen had claimed that Blatter had paid the sum of 25 thousand dollars to Nigerian referee Lucien Bouchardeau from the funds of the Federation for information about the President of the Somali Football Federation and the Vice President of the African Football Federation "CAF", Farah Addo, who accused the President of "FIFA" of buying votes to guarantee his success in the 1998 election, when he defeated the President of the European Football Federation "UEFA", Swede Lennart Johansson.
The Nigerian referee previously revealed yesterday in a press interview that he had asked the help of the "FIFA" President to confront personal problems. He had responded and written him a cheque from his personal account. As far as the 100 thousand dollar payment to Koloskov was concerned, he confirmed that he should not have allowed it to be paid without the knowledge of the Finance Committee of the international federation.
It should be mentioned that the English federation voted for Blatter in the previous elections in place of Johansson, as part of his campaign to host the 2006 World Cup finals, which Germany has won.
This will be the first visit by members of the Japanese imperial family to South Korea since the end of the Second World War, with the exception of two visits in 1970 and 1989 to attend the funerals of two members of the former Korean royal family.
The Japanese public NHK network also reported that they would lay flowers on the tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
In the first exercise 25 out of an original group of 29 players took part. Four were missing for legal reasons.
Kiefer led 2-0 in the first set, but Kuerten, who is taking part in his third competition since having surgery on his thigh last February, won four games in succession and won the first set.
Crowning a packed European season, Spanish team Real Madrid and German side Bayer Leverkusen will meet at 9:45 pm tonight at "Hampden Park" in Glasgow (Scotland) in the final game of the 47th round of the European Champions Football League (previously the European Club Champions Cup).
Islamabad announced yesterday that it had withdrawn its battleships from the Arabian Sea five days after New Delhi took a similar step as part of the framework of initiatives undertaken to reduce tension between the two countries. This follows its affirmation of a reduction in penetration by Islamists across the Monitoring Line in Kashmir, which continues to witness an exchange of artillery shelling between the Indian and Pakistan forces, which yesterday left six dead and ten wounded in spite of American calls for calm.
Since last week, indications of calm began to appear with Islamabad's undertaking to Washington to stop Islamists penetrating the Monitoring Line to Indian Kashmir. New Delhi responded with positive initiatives, including raising the embargo on Pakistani aircraft crossing Indian airspace and withdrawing its battleships from the Arabian Sea.
Regarding Rumsfeld's suggestion to deploy a monitoring system along the Truce Line to monitor penetration by Islamists, he said, "We discussed this proposal but no decision in this regard has yet been taken." He added, "Officials at the Indian Ministry of Defense and the government of the United States will discuss the relevant technical articles."
Batankar, responsible for security in the Kashmir valley, especially along the Monitoring Line, said "it was possible" that members from "Al-Qaeda" were active in the region.
In Pakistan, the government news agency reported that six civilians, including three children, were killed and eight others wounded by Indian shelling of the Nikyal strip, 120 km south of Muzaffarabad.
Security of Unplanned Settlements in Bank Causes Problem Between Army and Settlers.
Following this meeting, Idyal Mintis, who administers the Council, stated that he had met with Israeli Chief of Staff General Shaul Mofaz and had asked him for an increase in soldiers charged with protecting the settlements, including the unplanned settlement points recently established without government approval and which are, even in the eyes of Israelis, illegal.
These points are isolated and exposed to attacks, and most are built without licenses.
Head of the Beit Eil Municipality Israel Rozenburg, who continues to put pressure on the Israeli army to retain regular or reservists soldiers to protect the settlers, expresses anxiety. However, for the time being the settlers will have to look after their security themselves.
The prevailing opinion in the Israeli Ministry of Defense is to issue orders to dismantle the most isolated unplanned settlements.
Instead of trying to expel the residents of these settlements, it would be better to combat the Palestinian terrorist infrastructure."
Islamabad announced yesterday that it had withdrawn its battleships from the Arabian Sea five days after New Delhi took a similar step as part of the framework of initiatives undertaken to reduce tension between the two countries. This follows its affirmation of a reduction in penetration by Islamists across the Monitoring Line in Kashmir, which continues to witness an exchange of artillery shelling between the Indian and Pakistan forces, which yesterday left six dead and ten wounded in spite of American calls for calm.
American Catholic Bishops, who, since Thursday, have been holding an historic meeting in Dallas aimed specifically at discussing ways of dealing with the child sex abuse scandal that has shaken the American Catholic Church since last January, yesterday proposed a policy requiring that a principle of zero tolerance be applied ( ) to those priests proven to have been involved in sexual exploitation. However, officials at the Vatican said it was unlikely that a policy such as this would obtain the agreement of the Apostolic Chair.
An Israeli military spokesman reported that a Palestinian was killed when he attacked an Israeli settler with a knife near the Qadumim settlement in the northern West Bank.
He warned that the image of Palestinians should not be tainted with terrorism.
He said, "We have to put an end to all the militias.
At a meeting of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, he said, "This man washes Arafat's hands. I do not believe that he will control terrorism and combat it."
The visit of the Syrian military official will last three days, during which he will sign a number of agreements of a technical and training nature with the Chiefs of Staff of the Turkish Army between the military institutions of the two countries.
He said, "The President believes that this is one of the hardest issues and one that most breaks hearts (...) in which two parents fight for the custody of a child.

However, officials at the Vatican said it was unlikely that a policy such as this would obtain the agreement of the Apostolic Chair.
The head of the assembly of American Catholic Bishops in the United States, Bishop Wilton Gregory, affirmed on Thursday that men of religion had in some cases failed to report to the authorities accusations such as these.
They then held closed sessions during which they discussed the proposals that aim to reform the mechanisms adopted by the government to deal with accusations of sexual exploitation against members of the priesthood.
Raids in Islamist Ranks in Belgium; One Hundred Maoists Killed in Nepal; Referendum on Socialism in Cuba; Calm in Brazzaville After Confrontations.
The Public Prosecutor in Brussels refused to make any comment.
The local press in Nepal reported yesterday that more than one hundred Maoist rebels were killed in confrontations with soldiers over the last few days, following an attack mounted by about one thousand rebels in the west of the country.
Cuban leader Fidel Castro urged his citizens on Thursday to vote in the referendum that will run from today to Tuesday on the proposed amendment to the Constitution to approve socialism as an "irrevocable" system.
He believed that the referendum would, like the demonstrations on Thursday, in which millions of Cubans had taken part, be a "major response" to American President George Bush, who supports the continuation of the policy of sanctions against Cuba.
A military source announced, however, that eight rebels had been killed and one hundred others detained, without referring to the losses suffered by the government army.
Paris - from George Sasin:
It is likely that the "Union for a Presidential Majority" will win 384 of the 414 seats and the "Union for French Democracy" between 24 and 30 seats.
According to a poll conducted by "EFOP", 56% will choose a candidate from the right and 44% a candidate from the left in the event of a two-way contest between them.
His electoral tour in Toul represented a major challenge to the Secretary General of the Socialist Party, Francois Holland, who is the candidate for this city, in view of the fact that Rafaran has moved the battle to his backyard with the blessing of First Lady Bernadette Chirac.
The difference is that this phase of co-existence was considered "an obstacle to work" whilst a number of politicians believed that it was "a balancing factor".
Witnesses told that an armed group of three men attacked at 10 pm last night (21:00 GMT) residents in the Al-Maqam district of the small town of Al-Duwairah, twenty km south west of Algiers. Six people were killed, including two women and two children aged three and four. Two others were wounded.
It should be mentioned that 11 people were killed and nine others wounded on Tuesday in an attack by an armed group on a bus in Al-Madiyyah, 80 km south of Algiers.
Since the start of June, more than 45 people have been killed in violence in Algeria, relying on official statistics and figures published in the press. Acts of violence have left more than 670 dead this year.
United Nations Housing Expert: Building of Settlements Constitutes War Crime.
He believed that the building of new settlements was "provocative and created discord" and the settlers were "free to throw themselves into violence and confiscate territory".
He criticized the destruction of homes during Israeli incursions as happened in the battle for Jenin Camp, believing that this aimed to "create the maximum physical and moral suffering".
The "Associated Press" Agency quoted the Israeli representative to the United Nations headquarters in Geneva, Ya'akov Levy, as saying that Kothari's "accusations" were "one-sided".
It is noted that since 1967 Israel has built more than one hundred settlements, giving refuge to about 200 thousand people.
A Palestinian was shot dead by Israeli soldiers guarding the Qadumim settlement in the West Bank. The Israeli Army detained three people in Hebron and entered the town of Bir Zeit near Ramallah.
Soldiers who were guarding the settlement also opened fire on the Palestinian.
The three women were taken to the hospital in the town.
The Israeli authorities are accusing the three persons of participating in attacks on Israel.
Amnesty International Organization, which has its headquarters in London, has called upon the Palestinian Authority to release the Secretary General of the People's Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Ahmad Saadat, "immediately", and has also called upon Israel not to threaten his life if he leaves prison.
It has also urged Israel to "guarantee that it will not subject Ahmad Saadat to extra-judicial measures,  in particular his assassination."
Arafat's advisor, Nabil Abu Radinah, announced that the Israeli policy of segregation and the establishment of segregated areas "will not have any value."
He explained that the way to security and peace would come "through Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian territory, cessation of aggression in all its forms and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state."

The United States signed this treaty with the Former Soviet Union in 1972.
They may also threaten our allies and friends across the world. We must work together to defend against them. This is a major task that the ABM treaty was impeding."
There is therefore no justification for talk about revenge measures."
Elsewhere, a successful test was conducted over the Pacific Ocean of a missile fired from the sea to bring down medium-range warheads.

On Thursday he won the right to defend himself in the court and paved the way for a dramatic end to the session with repeated pleas to give him "ten minutes, five minutes, two minutes" to explain why "the court would be forced to withdraw the case today".
He did not mention any information possessed by the United State and how it could establish his innocence.
However, she said that the defense team would continue now to help him.
I understand this.
Coalition Aircraft Bomb Iraqi Locations: Bush "Will Take Care" of Saddam "With All Means"; Bush and Howard; Baghdad.
The raid targeted the Al-Amarah location, 265 km southeast of Baghdad.
In Washington, following their meeting, American President George Bush and Australian Prime Minister John Howard expressed the conformity of their perspectives on the Iraqi file.
"But I have not changed my opinion on Saddam Hussein (...) he is a person who has poisoned the Iraqis with gas and possesses weapons of mass destruction.
It said, "It is enough for Britain to have killed the people of Iraq and plundered its national resources in the age of colonization. Its government should amend its policy towards it instead of vulgar subordination to American policy, because it is Britain itself that loses out as a result of the hate that it creates for itself in the Arab and Islamic environment."
Washington Demands Damascus Take Action Against Terrorism.
Chapter Seven gives the Security Council the authority to impose sanctions on Member States who do not comply with its resolutions and to issue an order to mount military action if the sanctions are insufficient.
He added that Syria, which was elected to the membership of the Council, would not "stoop to this low level of diplomacy".
He said that Syria had allowed "terrorist" organizations, such as "Islamic Jihad" to adopt Damascus as their headquarters, had occupied Lebanon and feigned forgetfulness of the "mass killing" of its people in 1982 when its forces bombed the town of Hamah.
In a report recently prepared at the request of the "International and Strategic Studies Center" (  ) in Washington, former American diplomat and noted expert on Middle East affairs, Anthony Cordesman, warns of the risks of stereotyping the problems that may face the United States in its rapprochement with the Middle East region, at the level of both its relations there and its war on "terror".
All these countries are viewed as backward in terms of international development, including the more well-off oil states, because oil is not an alternative to a balanced and diverse economy.
Cordesman expands his description of the region, saying, "All these countries have witnessed fundamental social changes by virtue of their transformation from societies based on agriculture to urban-based societies.
Most inhabitants of the Middle East states are young: for every ten people, four have an average age of 14 or below.
Emigration is rife. Statistics indicate that the percentage of young people wanting to migrate to the West touches on 70%."
Even the Iranian revolution, which started as a symbol of the struggle between the people of the region and totalitarian regimes supported by the United States, has ended with a popular contradiction, embodied in the election of President Muhammad Khatimi, and delayed the state on account of the struggle between the reformist and conservative sides.
On political Islam, Cordesman says, "The pressures arising from religious tensions in a number of states, such as those of North Africa, Bahrain, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, have increased dramatically."
These factors explain the beginning of the move in a number of areas to religion, in search of security and hope.
It must deal with each state in the region on an individual basis.
Supreme Organizing Committee Begins Preparations for Francophone Summit; 55 Countries Participate, Costs Estimated at 9 Million Dollars.
The Supreme Organizing Committee expects the number of delegations participating in the summit to reach 55, including about ten delegations that do not speak French well and require the provision of interpreters from French to their own language.
Heads of delegations will arrive on the 17th of October, one day before the beginning of the summit.
It should be mentioned that the Beirut Arab summit recorded 16 thousand and 400 nights in hotel accommodation.
The Organizing Committee faces difficulties in contacting embassies and obtaining the necessary information in view of the fact that there are only 16 embassies of Francophone states in Lebanon from a total of 55 countries, which requires that the Committee conducts its contacts with the embassies of these states outside Lebanon.
On arriving at the Airport, the delegations will follow the same route used by delegations to the Beirut Arab summit.
The government also hopes that the end of the current year will record a number of economic, financial and developmental successes and that this summer will see a successful season and the privatization of some utilities and the arrival of international companies to participate therein, securing good revenues for the exchequer, in addition to the success of the Francophone summit following the success of the Arab summit. It is hopes that no local or regional incident will disturb this and that Lebanon will be able to welcome the New Year with great hope and greater confidence.
"The regional conference, reforms, Yasir Arafat - topics that attract the attention of public opinion and the media at a time when the northern front is boiling from within.
In return they continue their strategic cooperation with Iran, which, for its part, continues its frightening efforts to obtain nuclear weapons.
What is meant here is an unofficial and non-binding dialogue, which may, on some occasions, turn into a means for communicating messages from one capital to another.
The escalation on the northern borders and the encouragement for terrorism will lead to a harsh strike, the end of which no one can predict.
All the evidence indicates that the law stopping gas oil vehicles will enter into force today as was decided, in spite of the fuss the country has experienced in recent days, leaving both political and syndic consequences.
At the same time, President of the Federation Abd Al-Amir Najdah called for the release of more than 20 drivers who were arrested during the movement yesterday.
However the Minister of Finance, Fuad Al-Sinyurah, pre-empted the discussion of the matter of petrol and deemed recourse to the "support" resolution unlikely, stating that "they had not been successful" previously.
This issue will exert pressure on many drivers, who obtain their livelihood from day to day, and any stoppage will put them in need.
The challenge comes in the wake of the announcement by the Seles Company that it is about to have recourse to the International Arbitration Tribunal "to refute the injustice it has sustained as a result of the discretionary violations that will rob the company of its ownership."
Washington responded by closing its embassy in Islamabad and all its consulates in Pakistan. American President George Bush announced that the perpetrators were "fanatical murderers" and insisted that they would not frighten the United States.
The explosion destroyed tens of vehicles, caused a gap three meters wide in the wall of the consulate and threw rubble a distance of one kilometer.
It added that among the victims there were four policemen, one passer-by and two unknown women.

He concluded that he shared the grief of the victims' families.
Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh said, "The incident is very unfortunate and we strongly condemn it (...) I feel great pain that another attack has occurred in Karachi." This was a reference to the attack that had previously targeted the French work team.
Khalil Falihan wrote:
They noted that the initial indicators showed the existence of a difference regarding the means of handling the Arab-Israeli dispute and determining the mechanism appropriate for stopping violence and resuming political negotiations.
The other incident arising from Bush is his lack of enthusiasm for the international conference, in that from the beginning he wanted it to be a meeting in respect of the labeling of which he differed with Powell.
They stated that Bush was speaking about "a vision" for the state, which will give the Palestinians a greater right and for a longer period, whereas in a "temporary" state the rights are fewer and the period shorter.
This will become clear in the coming meeting of the international Group of Four.

The Sacred Assembly concluded the business of its 35th Ordinary Meeting yesterday, issuing the following concluding statement:
Following discussion the Assembly gave its blessing to the people of the diocese for their desire to have their diocese acknowledged as autonomous.
It is expected to hold its first meeting at the beginning of next autumn.
The fathers expressed great fear at the plans for the future of Jerusalem.
Circumstances in Lebanon were the subject of special concern on the part of the Assembly. The fathers expressed their anxiety at the economic and social difficulties from which the people of Lebanon are suffering.

Lahud then received Deputy Qablan Isa Al-Khuri, who explained that he had discussed with President Lahud the prevailing political conditions over the last two weeks, alluding to the position adopted by the President of the Republic in "his adherence to the application of the law". He called on all "to learn from what had taken place and to maintain the supreme national interest above all else, to gather around the symbol of the country's unity, who has opened the doors of Baabda Palace to all for a national dialogue that will consolidate national truths and options, strengthen our popular accord and establish our unity in confronting the major developments awaiting us, the precursors of which appear day by day."
Lahud met with Deputy Jubran Tuq and discussed with him the political and economic conditions.

He then received the Director General of the Internal Security Force Staff Major General Marwan Zain, and discussed with him the security conditions in the country and the conditions of the Internal Security Force organization.

The Supreme Council of the Free Patriots Party demanded that those in power derive benefit "from the Al-Matan by-elections by adopting the principle of neutral government to supervise the elections and draft an election law that provides the requirements for common life".
We believe that the regional conditions and the socio-economic crises must encourage all to commit to frank and serious dialogue, and avoid categorizing citizens into groups and levels, and the attempts at openness and containment on a seasonal basis.
Elsewhere, we are surprised how the government can mobilize its agencies to work for the success of the summer season when we see its gross inability to provide an electrical supply and put an end to the law making.
Acknowledgement of the other is a right for which there can be no exception. The respecting of an opposing view is a sacred duty, especially in pluralist societies. We recall that the dark ages have gone never to return, and with them the inspection courts and the fatwas of death, blasphemy and oppression.
President Emile Lahoud of Lebanon welcomed to Ba'abda Palace yesterday the State Minister for Administrative Reforms Fuad Al-Sa'ad, who briefed him on the results of a seminar held in Beirut on the "republic mediator" issue. Republic mediators from more than eighteen Arab, European, and American states attended the seminar. Al Sa'ad gave the President the primary copy of the annual report of the Ministry of Administrative Reforms. The copy includes the ministry's most significant administrative achievements and the training courses it organized, particularly those involving the relationship between the state's authority and citizens.

Salama Holds Press Conference Today to Highlight Tal Irqa's Archeological Significance
The event brought to Irqa for the first time the importance it deserves in official sources of information and to archeological expeditions. It is hoped that this attention continues to grow, in order to reveal the site's outstanding archeological and cultural heritage and to bring about its historical and archeological importance.
Deputy Prime Minister Essam Faris held a banquet in the Jannat Irqa hotel in honor of participants. The manager of PM's office in the north, Brigadier William Mujalli, attended the banquet. He conveyed greetings and welcome messages from the Deputy Prime Minister to the archeological expedition members in Akar, in general, and in Tal Irqa, in particular. "Tal Irqa is considered a historical and cultural beacon for the peoples and civilizations that crossed the area four thousand years ago and left valuable signs that, we hope, will be discovered by the archeological researchers."

However, the deterioration of the situation in the West Bank and Gaza to a point that is likely to ignite a full-scale regional confrontation forced Bush to intervene further, especially in view of Sharon's failure to stop Palestinian resistance to his repeated incursions in the West Bank and Gaza.
However, the mere American tendency to mention a political return for the Palestinians within the framework of solving the conflict scared Sharon, who does not wish to get involved in any political process with the Palestinians. Sharon fears that his "Likud" rival Benjamin Netanyahu, who is opposing him in the upcoming general elections, will use that against him to strip him of the support he enjoys among Israeli electors.
When Sharon realized that the conference would give the peace process a new push, regardless of the level of participating delegations, he asked the U.S. to postpone it.
In this regard, the administration partially agreed to the Israeli request when Secretary of State Colin Powell announced that he recommends the establishment of a temporary Palestinian state.
Overall, Bush is avoiding confrontation with Sharon. His major task now is to talk to moderate Arab states, particularly Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan, to convince them that Washington is seriously pursuing a solution in the Middle East. In reality, the U.S. is not taking any steps toward a serious solution, which should start with exercising pressure on Israel to withdraw from the occupied lands in return for peace.
Before heading for Washington, Egyptian President Husni Mubarak was keen to win support for his initiative by contacting countries involved in the Middle East peace process and providing them the details of his political vision for settling the conflict.
To avoid embarrassing President George Bush, he drafted his initiative in consultation with the U.S. State Department, which in turn approved the 1967 borders as a basis for negotiations.
The 35th anniversary of the 1967 war, or what has become known as the day of relapse, produces a large number of questions in the Arab world. The questions are not related to reasons behind losing that war-much has been said about that. The questions actually wonder why Arabs have been standing by helplessly against recovering the minimum of their rights lost in the 1967 war: Security Council Resolution 242, regarding the withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces from occupied territories.
"But in spite of the attempts to split these forces, especially the Kataib Party and Lebanese forces, into opposition and pro-ruling, and the readiness of these forces to split and scatter in the framework of the opposition section of these forces, within and beyond the 'Qirna Shahwan meeting,' the Matn elections demonstrated the solidarity of that section and included it in the 'Sectarian system'. . ."
First, what happened to Archbishop Haddad clearly reveals the emergence of dormant fundamentalist Christian movements. There are other indications of this conclusion. They have started to express themselves in many practices that  Lebanese society, particularly the Christian community, has not known before. Those practices appear as prayers, worship, demonstrations, processions, and so on.
Third, what is the benefit of religious media? That is despite objections to such projects raised here and there. There is no doubt that harm resulting from such media organizations is much greater than benefits-if there is any kind of benefit, especially in a diverse society such as Lebanese society, which has been witnessing overwhelming, increasing sectarian emotion and affiliation.
Fifth, the danger of all forms of fundamentalism and consequently demagoguery, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, is the threat facing Lebanese civil society. No matter how patriotic, noble, and sublime are the motives behind a fundamentalist movement, it cannot protect society from further rupture. The damage will be huge then.
It is useful to know that the goals of the campaign against Archbishop Haddad at that time were not to push him against the church, but were goals that were less modest and more "local."
During yesterday's invitation of the Union of Chambers, he spoke about the integration of the private sector into the global trade system. Chairman of the Union Adnan Al-Qassar, a large number of chiefs and members of economic and trade organizations, businessmen, and other interested parties attended the invitation.
"In our view, it is no longer possible to achieve sustained economic growth within a single state or a single area without a wider economic domain, in a time where barriers are being lifted to guarantee the flow of commodities, services, and capital. It drives the economic departments to respond to and coordinate with such freedom."

Total Deficit 41.43%
As to implementation of the budget, its deficit until the end of last May was 1020 billion, i.e., a deficit rate of 33.3%, compared to a reported deficit of 1134 billion for this period the previous year, at a rate of 19.3%.
On the other hand, the summarized financial position shows a 30 billion pound decrease in non-tax revenues. The majority of this is due to the continued drop in the transfer of the communications budget reserve at an amount of 16 billion until the end of the current month of June, compared to what was the total until the end of May of the previous year.
President Emile Lahud received a delegation from the European Investment Bank yesterday, including its President Francis Mayer, Head of the Mediterranean and Balkan Loan Operations Antonio Buglizi, and the Chief Officer of Loan Operations for Lebanon and Jordan Rene Perez Diaz. The meeting was also attended by Chairman of the Construction and Development Council Jamal Itani and Secretary General of the Council Ghazi Haddad.
President Lahud expressed his thanks to Mayer for the support Lebanon gets from the European Investment Bank.
The discussions included developing relations between Lebanon and the European Bank, especially after signing the Partnership Agreement next Monday, "which makes it imperative for Lebanon to increase its industrial competitiveness and to generally improve its technological abilities, as the European Partnership Agreement will encourage foreign investment in the industrial and service sectors. The Agreement is also to open markets for Lebanese products all over Europe with no customs or other obstacles."
On this occasion, Miqati delivered a speech in which he expressed determination for developing the Port of Tripoli to prepare it for the expected trade movement, and so that the Port of Beirut becomes another gateway to the eastern Arab homeland.

The First Forum for Supporting Industry and Capability: Enforcing Competition and Doubling Exports.
Al-Sa'ad was speaking yesterday as a representative of President Brigadier Emile Lahud in the High Business Institute, where the first forum for presidents and executive managers was inaugurated under the title "Supporting the Lebanese Industry and Building Competitive Abilities."

Member of Damascus Chamber of Industry Board of Directors Jamal Qanbiriyah delivered a speech afterwards.
The fifth session was titled "Media and Advertising Serve Competitive Abilities" and was chaired by Ramzi An-Najjar, President of the Sachi and Sachi firm. Speakers in the session were Philip Skaf, Antonio Vincenti, and Charles Irbeed.
El-Senyora was speaking in a press conference he held yesterday before noon, during which he announced the agreement. The conference was attended by the  Ministry's General Manager Alan Pifani, Value Added Tax Team Leader Shawqi Hamad, the company's representative Larsen Linde, and its manager in Lebanon Khalil Al-Ashqar.
The company is operational in about thirty-one countries around the world and executes more than 10 million transactions annually. It also deals with 190,000 organizations, with annual turnover exceeding 425 million Euros.

He indicated that funds can be received in cash from the company's office, or if the amount is more than 500 dollars, it will be transferred directly to the buyer's account abroad.
Governor Riyad Salama sounded optimistic about several recent measures, particularly the marketing of Euro bonds, "which has attracted big demand in all banks." He also sounded optimistic about the balance of payments, which achieved a surplus 220 million dollars in March, and he expected it to increase in June.
The monthly meeting of the Governor of the Bank of Lebanon with the Bank Society delegation was held yesterday at noon in the Bank and chaired by Salama.
During his talk about development in the financial and banking sectors, the Governor mentioned the positive climates that were prevalent in the parts market during the past few weeks and the Bank of Lebanon's intervention in U.S. dollar purchasing.
"As to priorities in this regard, they will be based on the offers submitted to the state and might include more than one type of these inputs."
The meeting raised one of the agenda issues regarding internal supervision systems. Bank Society Chairman Joseph Tarbiya mentioned the immense effort made by the banking sector in this regard. Moreover, he clarified the continuous efforts to pave the way for banks, in preparation for the adaptation of internal supervision systems and their common systems, particularly those being developed by the Society.
The Society finally presented the proposed bill. A copy was sent to the Minister of Finance and to the Bank of Lebanon.
His fingers barely touch the piano.
The father and son intended that the break time be filled with birdsong.
The performance was full of life, simple, and compliant with the touch of the notes, making the melody warm in its core, emerging from the serenity of the hands and indifferent to the inner self.
He is a romanticist even when his fingers play the impressionistic music of Rafael, who himself has been liberated from the past's melodies into a more transparent and personal freedom in his compositions.
In every piece played is a tragic memory, melancholy and dark.
Al-Basha knows the way to it. He is farsighted. He gets to the essence of things by breaking through the exteriors.
The "Funeral March" from Chopin's Sonata No. 2 was part of the evening program. Abdel Rahman Al-Basha had chosen gray and black colors as a theme for the evening, along with some divergences, like the one he played accompanied by his son and dedicated to Oxilia's childhood and to all who long for the age of spontaneous innocence.
Keep the Memory Without Mourning
The events of September 11 broke all barriers that block information and provided a good opportunity for officials to tell the international public and media about everything related to people who committed such crimes.
The judiciary did not want the event to be devoted to blaming a certain person or party. The Chairman of Supreme Judiciary Council, Nasri Lahud, emphasized this approach and was determined that the memorial ceremonies should reflect the event's significance.
A slap in the face? Two slaps in the face like bullets . . . and Bishop Gregoire Haddad falls to the ground amid overwhelming astonishment.
He was quiet and sad.
The Public Relations Branch of the Internal Security Forces released the following statement: "At 8:00 p.m. on the 14th of this month, three young men arrived at the entrance of the Tele Lemiar television station building before the arrival of Bishop Gregoire Haddad, who was expected to be interviewed by Tele Lemiar. Father Sami Mihanna, one of the officials of the station, was waiting for him in front of the building."
"An investigation was started under the supervision of Jabal Libnan, Prosecutor General of Appeals Jean Fahd and Attorney General Elias Eid."
It is of utmost concern to Al-Nahar to assure readers that it did not mean any offence to Deir Al-Ahmar or its people. This information was based on relevant church circles and was published literally.
A Mercedes 280 public vehicle with license plates 190887 caught fire inside the Firdan parking lot opposite Sayyar Al-Dark at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. The cause of the fire remains unknown.
"The defendant Awad Umar Ibrahim was brought before this court, son of a woman named Um Kulthum, born in 1966; he is a Sudanese by nationality. He was arrested on 6/14/2001, put in jail on 6/18/2001 until this day. Moreover, two defendants were brought before this court."
The audience felt as though they were falling with the Bishop, then rising with him, stunned by the incident. It is terrorism. It is a copy of the cold-blooded mass killing taking place in some Arab cities. It is the violence that denies the right of others to speak and to live freely.
Bishop Gregoire Haddad is used to confronting "people of darkness" and combating them within their shelters, without fear of the consequences, whatever they might be. Thus, he is now asked to resume his open dialog with believers and non-believers, as he used to do in his articles and with his brilliant ideas.
Perhaps the assault against the Bishop will provide an example that must be learned by all those who resemble that reckless boy, and all those who stand behind him. An example of tolerance, but the tolerance of the strong, the sensible, and the educated. The tolerance of Gregoire Haddad, the bishop who will continue to carry the torch in the midst of the darkness that threatens us.
Unburied
Thoughts of passion
And the child awaits the impossible
To the carriers of swords
Wearing the clouds of the sky
Hailing the homes
A thousand thousand shames
Destruction and extinction.
Pass by the crucified homeland
And victory is a song
In morning and evening
And the sounds of wind
They say:
The scent of the country
Where are the poems
Pass above the minarets and churches
Coming as a bride comes
"Going Back To Roots" by Amaal Malik; A Lebanese Lost Between Home and Abroad by Matar Jum'a
"Undoubtedly, the book raises several challenges, such as the new world that inspires new aspirations in pupils and students, which can lead to conflict between their Lebanese identity and the other nationality they acquired abroad."
"What is this returning Lebanese woman?"
"The advice and suggestions given by Mrs. Malik in her book, particularly on page 272, are useful, valuable, and worthwhile."
Educational Reform Conference Inaugurated: The Pupil is the Only Cornerstone, Sa'ada Yusif Murad Said
"The Ministry of Finance is continuing to put obstacles before paying retired teachers' salaries. It also hinders procedures for promoting teachers to high school professors. These are major demands by government teachers and solving them will give positive support to the image of government education."
"No doubt you all know that the Teachers Association in Lebanon, as any other professional association, is affiliated with the Ministry of Labor."
"This duplication has frequently caused the Association much confusion."
On his part, Rasheed Yusif, the Chairman of the League of Graduates of Administration Institute and the Bureau of Coordination Between Teachers and Public Sector Employees, called for support of the Lebanese University and for enabling it to activate its role in educational planning, cultural development, and communication with the market and developing needs for professional excellence.
"The essential elements of the educational process are objectives, content, teaching methods, and evaluation. Each of these essential elements needs improvement, and there is no one who can assume and perform this role better than you, the education professionals."
The Minister inspected examination center rooms in the Raml Al-Zarif secondary school of Beirut (Rene Muawwad). The Minister was accompanied by the Head of Beirut Educational Administration Wael Al-Tanneer, Director of Exams Department Hassan Malik, and his office manager Hisham Tubbara.
After the tour, Murad stated, "These exams are being held for the last time on the old curricula basis. They combine two types of students; the first group consists of students who failed last year, and the second group consists of students who left school years ago."
"We look forward to good results. We applied the idea this year considering that every person and every citizen is entitled to apply for a baccalaureate regardless of his/her age, provided he/she is more than 20 years old, while those who apply for the intermediary exam must be more than 17 years old."
He was asked what the gain would be for someone who takes the exam but does not write a single word, and he replied, "Perhaps some people thought it would be a walk in the park and they could pass easily, but that is a misconception."
"We don't intend to intimidate or frighten; giving marks will be a fair process. Every student will receive his/her mark against what he/she wrote. We will not make up marks."
Minister Murad also visited the Zok Misbah public intermediary school and toured the handicraft, scientific, and artistic exhibition that was organized by pupils. Present were the school director Samira Al-Debs, members of the educational staff, Public School Friends Secretary General Suhail Matar, Deputy Director of the Zok Misbah municipality George Mughamis, Zok secondary school director Makhayel Eili Khalil, and a group of parents.

Deaf, dumb, and blind, Helen Keller represents a story of challenge, a poem of hope, and a song of "Yes" for life.
At the age of eighteen months, she became blind, deaf, and dumb.
"The world is paradise," she used to repeat.
She used to say, "I love it."
"That is why I say that 'I see' and 'I hear,' because I understand as well as others do."
Helen Keller wrote 25 books, each of which was a message of hope.
Let Helen Keller be a lesson for those who have the power of sight but cannot see anything, for those who have sound ears but cannot hear anything, and those who can speak but do not say a word.
Director of the Centre culturel français in Tripoli, Philippe Ardoine, delivered a speech in which he said, "Mrs. Bushra Adra deserved recognition for her diligence, energetic drive, and success in establishing several organizations relevant to culture and spreading the French language in the North and in Lebanon."
French cultural attaché Alain Fuque spoke on behalf of the French government  about the award recipient since she graduated from the Orthodox school in Tripoli, and about her interest in teaching the French language and educating people. He hailed her teaching experience in the Akar group of villages, along with her "understanding of the negative impact of poor French on children's educational achievements."
"Mrs. Bushra Adra has an extremely lovable presence, is tactful when she speaks, objective when she complains, erudite when she lectures, and persuasive when she discusses. That is why her success and recognition are not a surprise. Perhaps she should have been honored earlier."
The International Federation released a statement saying, "Having seen the videotape recording of the match between Brazil and Costa Rica held on June 13 in Suwon, FIFA's Technical Study Group decided to assign Brazil's first goal scored in the tenth minute of the match to Ronaldo."

He said, "I do not understand why a Bedouin Arab or a Circassian1 community gathering in one place is considered legitimate, but when a Jewish community does the same thing, it is considered racist."
Critics described the bill, which was proposed by the Religious National Party Mifdal, as racist.

"We are a democratic, European Union-member state (...) Accordingly, we will let some time pass and then analyze the possibility of no response" from Morocco, she added.
Yesterday, a source in the port of Ceuta reported that Madrid has sent a frigate to reinforce its naval fleet off the two pockets.
Officially unconfirmed information suggests that Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Isnar held an emergency meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and Minister of Defense Federico Trio-Vigerua.
It expressed the opinion that "the presence of civilians and Moroccan authority on the island of Laila has continued for 45 years."
It said that it is appropriate in the meantime, "to distinguish between the status of the island of Laila and the case of the last Spanish-occupied Moroccan strongholds."
*In Cairo, the Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa was informed by Moroccan Foreign Minister Muhammad ibn Eissa of the latest developments on the Moroccan island.
The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) shot two Palestinians dead, one in the West Bank and another in Gaza. An F-16 fighter launched an air raid on the house of a prominent Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip. The leader survived the attack because he had left the house seconds before the bombing. Israel announced that it detained a Palestinian who was on his way to blow himself up in Israel.
A security source confirmed, "An Israeli tank stormed into citizens' properties in the town of Beit Lahia this (yesterday) afternoon and opened fire on houses in the area, injuring Al-Amoudi."
Israeli security sources stated that the strike targeted an explosives factory belonging to a Hamas activist.
Israel announced that its forces captured a Palestinian who was on his way to blow himself up.
Newly appointed Israeli Chief of Staff General Mushe Yalon expressed his view that Israel's victory over Palestinian attacks will be achieved "by degrees."

Indian Foreign Minister Jasuant Singh said, "It is obvious that this attack was inspired by Pakistan." Known as a hard-liner, Edvani will inform Prime Minister Atal Pihari Vagbani and senior ministers of his mission's results.
According to the police, the attack's death toll rose to 27, including 13 women and a 3-year-old child, and 35 others were injured.
It also called on "the government of India to end its suppression in Jamo and Kashmir, and to adopt reason, justice, and dialog as a means of settling the Kashmir dispute according to the aspirations of the Kashmiri people."
Kashmiri Prime Minister Faruk Abd-Allah said, "Until the superpowers, the U.S.A. and others, understand that as long as terrorism is based in Pakistan, this type of violent operation will continue."
Intensive diplomatic efforts succeeded in limiting the crisis in early June, and Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf vowed to "permanently" stop the violation of borders.
It explained that the exercises will last for ten days. Navy, air force, and land forces units will participate. The location for the exercises has not yet been chosen.
Deputy Inspector General of the Pakistani Abotabad region, Rao Amin Hashem, stated yesterday that police want to interrogate a tour guide of a group of German and foreign tourists who were injured in a blast that took place while they were inspecting an ancient cultural site in Mansehra, around 70 kilometers north of Islamabad.
"Then I saw blood and two people lying on the floor. I asked what happened."
Television media reported yesterday that the authorities arrested 16 people in order to interrogate them for possible connection to the attack.
Sheik Umar Said, who is a London-born son of a Pakistani cloth merchant, faces possible extradition to the U.S.A., even if he is acquitted.
The "Babel" daily newspaper, supervised by the Iraqi President's eldest son Uday Saddam Hussein, was the sole newspaper to publish a photograph of former Crown Prince of Jordan Hassan ibn Talal attending the London conference. The Prince is the uncle of King Abd-Allah II of Jordan.
Three kings reigned in Iraq from 1921 until the 14th of July Revolution, namely King Faisal I, King Ghazi, and King Faisal II.
He added, "There are plans to invade Iraq from the south (Kuwait), west (Jordan), and north (Turkey)."
Concerning the London conference, General Najeeb Al-Salihi, a former leader of the Iraqi Republican Guard and member of the joint staff before fleeing Iraq in 1995, stated the U.S. will discover that launching a military offensive against Iraq to topple Saddam will be much easier than they thought, foreseeing an immediate collapse of the Iraqi army once an American attack is launched.
He dismissed American concerns about the possibility that Saddam's regime is producing chemical or biological weapons, saying the Iraqi President does not have means to use such weapons.
He expressed an opinion that the diplomatic path is the only option "and if that fails, then the other option would be intelligence operations aimed solely at overthrowing the regime."
Washington Rejects Afghan Supervision on Military Operations and Kabul Remains Silent Regarding Southern Governors Action; United Nations
Deputy Governor Muhammad Shuayb Wafa confirmed that "one or two governors" arrived Saturday in Kabul and held an informal working session.
Commenting on Gol Agha's suggestion, a spokesman of the American Central Command in Tampa, Florida, Major Ralf Mills, said that Washington will continue to work closely with the Afghan government but will not allow the Afghans to manage military operations.
It quoted an Afghan army officer as saying that the attack took place in a desert area on soldiers who were patrolling the area, searching for suspected smugglers.
He also explained that the interim government needs 397 million dollars in the next three months to fund its aid programs.

This retreat can be seen in the political discourse of the two victorious partners of the 2000 elections, Prime Minister Rafeek Al-Hariri and Deputy Walid Junbulat, which has started to be influenced by the emotional effect on the Los Angeles Conference. It demonstrates a tone and concepts that place the two owners of that discourse in a position totally contradictory to the condition that carried them to election victory two years ago.
In the current political climate after the secondary elections in AL-Matn and the Los Angeles Conference, those are below the Syrian red lines even if Junbulat does not admit that publicly.
Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri's claim could be understood; he is attempting to protect himself before anything else, as numerous political fronts are opening their doors before him.
Is Lebanon facing a new hard-line phase launched by talks with the Syrian president that returned us to linking Lebanese-Syrian relations to Lebanese- Lebanese relations? This has brought back a cold war of coups to internal politics, bringing everything back to zero.
I swear! It seems that someone developed this invention by expanding the database that contains blacklists of actors, directors, and films to include live performances and singers. Moreover, he found a way to feed the database continuously so that if a mistake is committed, "The Monitor" records the offender's name and marks him/her with a black mark. His file is then distributed to all boards, conferences, links, and clubs that are against cultural invasion, so that they take action at the first opportunity and so no one escapes punishment.
Two months ago there was a hue and cry in Palestine, but surprisingly our nation can sleep peacefully.
Maybe Khalid made a mistake, or let us say it is indeed a mistake.
If only those campaigners had asked Simon Shahin, Khalid's partner in today's concert.
But performing in those two concerts is at least a statement to those against naturalization, saying that the world is not black and white. If only they paid attention.
Let them be a minority at Beiteddine tonight.
Police said the assailant, Maxim Bronri (25 years old), has a criminal record, indeed, and he is a mentally unstable "right-wing extremist."
four days have passed since the incident with no arrest of the suspect, Badi' Waleed Hamada, alias "Abu-Ubayda," in the army.
Before traveling to New York. Mahir said, "President Bush will discuss the latest developments of the situation with the Arab ministers. In particular, we are aiming at putting an end to the deteriorated situation, achieving Israeli withdrawal, and providing political assistance in establishing the Palestinian state."
General Tawfiq Yasiri, who was elected as a spokesman of the council, stated in a press conference, "The major task"
It quoted security sources as saying that this operation was carried out by a "terrorist group." It took place Saturday evening in Milyana, a suburb of the city of Ayn EL-Dafla, 70 kilometers southwest of the capital.
Concerns about deterioration of resolve were raised because of the blurred position of Palestinian factions, on one hand, and the lack of any practical steps to arrest the murderer, on the other hand.
Although Al-Miqdah mentioned that 100 Palestinians were in the custody of the camp's security committee "in pursuit of the criminal and attempting to detain and hand him over to the army," all communications and efforts failed to detain and hand him over.
On the other hand, it is obvious that measures taken around the camp are likely to be intensified until the man accused of killing the three soldiers is turned in.
On another issue, the decision to prohibit the use of diesel-fuelled vans will be enforced as of today.
Former Iraqi officers and representatives of the opposing Iraqi National Conference ended a meeting in London yesterday. They elected a military council to represent them in attempts to overthrow President Saddam Hussein and work towards initiating civil rule. They called on the Iraqi army to join them.
Among members of the Council are General Najeeb Al-Salihi, who commanded a mechanical army division, and General Saad aL-Ubeidi, who was in charge of psychological warfare before fleeing in 1986.
The officers, like other opposition groups, believe that Iraqis are yearning for the fall of the regime but are afraid to join any new uprising without guaranteed military support from the U.S.
He said the Iraqi President "poses threats that we cannot live with indefinitely."
Meanwhile, in a press conference he held in Damascus, Iranian Chief Judge Ayutallah Mahmoud Hashimi Shahrudi warned the Iraqi opposition of the consequences of falling into the "American trap." He said the U.S. wants to use this opposition for "its own interests in the region."

Before traveling to New York he said, "President Bush will discuss the latest developments with the Arab ministers. In particular, we are aiming at putting an end to the deteriorating situation, achieving Israeli withdrawal, and assisting the establishment of the Palestinian state."
During a meeting at the Arab League headquarters in Cairo, the nine members of the Arab Peace Plan Monitoring Committee confirmed that the Arab triplet delegation will inform the quadrilateral committee of its commitment to that plan.
In Jerusalem, Sharon's office mentioned that the prime minister approved the new meetings between Perez and Palestinian officials.
He said that the meeting between Perez and Muhammad Rasheed, Financial and Economic Advisor to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, was held with prior approval from Sharon.
It considered that the priority is to "stop Zionist aggression and appropriation and to stop the blood shed in Palestinian territories," and that not doing so "will remain a type of futility, a maneuver, a waste of time, and going around the peace process and emptying it of its content. It will represent a collusion and will contribute to the elongation of suffering and extension of the conflict, occupation, and aggression."
Prime Minister Rafeek Al-Hariri telephoned French President Jacques Chirac last night, congratulating him on the anniversary of French National Day and for surviving the assassination attempt on his life during the July 14 celebrations in Paris.
After the one-hour meeting, Junbulat said, "There is no doubt that the incident that took place in Sayda is really disturbing, and we must take care of it. National and faithful factions inside the camp must hand over the murderers because the Lebanese state will not, and may not, neglect this issue. However, this matter must not be an incentive or a pretext for some organizations to say that there are unsecured pockets."
"Dialog is not just for the sake of dialog; it is intended to generate results. The result, as I mentioned before the politically and religiously united France rejected Le Pin, is what we have seen happen there today, when a right-wing individual tried to assassinate Chirac. Right-wing extremism is extremely dangerous, and that is why we all have to reject any type of extremism."
The same sources said that the group chose three members from three countries represented in the Initiative Committee-Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan-and will invite their foreign ministers. It named two of the three, the Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmad Maher and Jordanian Foreign Minister Marawan Al-Miashar, to meet Quartet representatives in New York tomorrow at a dinner banquet. Also, a meeting with American Secretary of State Colin Powell is to be held on Thursday in Washington and will be attended by Maher, Miashar, and Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal, because Al-Faisal is unable to participate in the New York meeting due to prior engagements.
The sources expressed surprise that these states accept blocking the Arab Peace Initiative until the Palestinian issue is finalized, which might last until Spring of 2003.
In light of the New York meeting with Maher and Ma'ashar, the international Quartet, particularly the U.S., will assign Egypt and Jordan to the task of negotiating on behalf of the Palestinian party. Both states maintain full diplomatic relations with Israel and can open direct lines with the Hebrew state. If such authorization is given, it may be lead to further Arab repulsion instead of solidarity.
The three ministers will work effectively to defend the Palestinian issue and for the implementation of the Arab Peace Initiative. In fact, it was Saudi Arabia who launched the initiative. They hope that the New York and Washington meetings will pave the way for a meeting between the Quartet and all members of the Arab Initiative Committee soon to develop a comprehensive working mechanism for all Peace Process tracks, and for adopting the Arab Initiative, which includes a comprehensive resolution mechanism that is the first of its kind.
The reception started with a military exhibition, after which Ambassador Le Cortier promoted some military personnel before placing a wreath on the shrine of martyrs.
He referred to the French support of Lebanon, quoting French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin on France's efforts toward Lebanon's independence, sovereignty, and prosperity.
"It also has to include a solution for the Palestinian refugees issue that should take the interests of Lebanon into consideration."
He renewed his confidence in the Lebanese determination to double their efforts in the area of economic reform and development, stating his delight that "Lebanon has signed partnership agreements with the European group, which opens new horizons for it, not only economic but also political and cultural."
"It will also emphasize the important position that Lebanon occupies among countries, and lastly, it allows for initiating an international meeting for cultural dialog, a dialog that has become necessary since September 11."

President Amin Al-Jumayil announced, "We will continue to confront all conspiracies aimed at devastating the Lebanese case and destroying the body, sovereignty, and dignity of the Lebanese people."
Karama then spoke and said, "We are in dire need these days of a leadership of love, dynamism, patriotism, and freedom, a leadership that believes in deed more than words. The dispensary whose opening we are celebrating today is an image of the Phalanges that was always the party of laborers and strugglers, a people's party in the true sense of the word. It was not a party for cadres comprised of scores of people who make groundless, inapplicable decisions.
"The current stage is extremely crucial, and Lebanon is a focal point. In face of all these dangers, the entire Lebanese people miss the Phalanges Party that they knew throughout the dangerous and difficult phases of Lebanese history since 1943. The Lebanese people miss that pioneer institution and the Phalanges youth who inscribed the history of Lebanon with their blood."
Junbulat Receives Palestinian Delegation Condemning Sayda Incident and Accepts Rule of Lebanese Law
"In the meeting we confirmed the historic relation that links us as Palestinian people with the late Kamal Junbulat, and today with His Excellency. We also emphasized the substantial relations that link people in the occupied territories with the Druze Initiative Committee. Such meetings have a deep effect on the general situation in the occupied lands."
"We hope this individual incident will not lead to an attitude against all Palestinians, because the Palestinian refugee camps are an environment of struggle, resistance, and uprising for the right of return and an independent Palestinian state. They are not islands of outlawed people or terrorism centers. All Palestinian factions stood firm in that the cause should be dealt with according to Lebanese law. In this context, we hope to start a Lebanese-Palestinian dialog to regulate the fraternal relationships on the basis of respecting Lebanese sovereignty and law, to unite the joint efforts to confront the threats of resettling and dispersing Palestinians. We have to develop a joint plan to initiate the Palestinian refugees' right to return, according to U.N. Resolution 194."
Junbulat also reviewed development and service issues with a number of delegations, municipality directors, and mayors of several villages.
He called for increased attention to the architectural designs of projects, so that they may acquire a heritage resemblance to the houses in the area, particularly some houses in the town of Batloun, and to the preservation of environment and heritage.
Baalbak - "Al-Nahar":
The visit had a family atmosphere.
In response to another question he said: "The media must be truthful and transparent. Recently, we realized a painful fact that we are absolutely absent from the international arena. For many years we have dissipated our energies, potential, and money in local media, which aims at interfering with Arab disagreements through stirring up or polishing for the benefit of one party or another, without protecting ourselves at the international level. That is why we are latecomers, but that does not mean we should feel hopeless. In fact, we want to be hopeful and erase the past stages from our minds. We want a fresh, faithful start to present true media views objectively and transparently. In this manner, we will present ourselves (Arabs) and issues to every international forum forcefully and successfully."
Syrian President Bashar El-Assad received Deputy Prime Minister Essam Fares yesterday afternoon in the Asl-Shaab Palace in Damascus.
"And why do people get killed there?"
He expressed his point of view, saying, "If this hand commits a crime, that is because the person it belongs to wants it to commit that crime."
Maronite Patriarch Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Boutros Sfair stated, "The government's tolerance toward criminals by not arresting them and bringing them to justice is a serious example that encouraged those other criminals who committed the awful crime of Sayda, in which three Lebanese soldiers were killed."
Former PMs Hussein Al-Husseini and Rasheed Al-Sulh; Ministers Fuad Al-Saad, Marawan Hamada, Fuad EL-Senyora, and Asaad Diyab; MPs Nabeel Al-Bustani, Naseeb Lahud, and Nim'mat-Allah Abi Nasr; former MP Kameel Ziyada; former Ministers Fuad Boutros, Michal Eddah, and Essam Nu'man; Bishops Rolan Abu-Juda, Boulos Matar, and Elias Ouda; ambassadors and diplomats; the President's Media Advisor Rafeek Shalala; Sheikh Wadee' Al-Khazin; and other figures also attended the event.
Last Saturday afternoon, Umran visited the artist Abd al-Haleem Karkala in his traditional Arab tent inside his new country house on the northeastern outskirts of Baalbak. Chief Editor Rafeek Khouri of "al-Anwar" newspaper and Umar Karkala attended the meeting.

Unlicensed Radio Stations Suggest Technical Solution; Qublan Meets Iranian Chief Judge in Damascus
He proposed that "to prevent interference, stations be required to operate from a single location, and that the transmission center should be owned by the government." He also suggested that "adopting this modern technical solution will enable the government to increase revenues and save employees from losing their jobs because cutting off livelihoods is like cutting throats."
Qublan delivered a speech, saying, "We in Lebanon are with the (Iranian) Republic, with all its noble, truthful, and straightforward aims. We also consider Syria to be a center for noble endeavors and for supporting revolution and resistance."
Minister of Health Suleiman Franjieh criticized "the unresponsiveness of the ruling government regarding projects in the Zagrata - Ehden area." He described it as "the rule we thought had arrived with wealth (...) We cannot say more."
The national anthem opened the event.
Director of the Hospital Dr. Joseph Franjieh delivered a speech and explained the phases of obtaining, repairing, preparing, equipping, and recruiting for the building.
"The confidence that Zagarta had given us throughout our lives is, of course, much more than any material project, hospital, or ministry."
"After four years, we are now doing what we should have finished four years ago."
"The interest of Lebanon and the region is what joins me to people who are cooperating with me and my brothers, the leaders of Zagarta. No one wishes to hamper any project."
Then Minister Franjieh cut the ribbon and inspected the hospital's sections and departments with attendees.
There are hopes to provide the hospital with a surgical operating room and a recovery room.
It seems the pledge of Municipality Director Usta Abu-Rejeili when he assumed office in 1998 is bringing positive results. In 1998, Abu-Rejeili pledged that he would "work to bring it back to its normal position as a summer capital and a favored location for Arab summer visitors by rebuilding it and rehabilitating its infrastructure to restore its busy past." This town has become a model for many towns and villages in the area that enjoy the same Bahamdoon Station features. Its commercial market and fresh air are positive factors in restoring our basic "industry," i.e., tourism.
Commercial shops that were inactive last summer are receiving customers this year.
He added, "Anyone who passes by Bahamdoon today notices the difference. It is an unequalled upswing, just as Solidaire's previous upswing. But Bahamdoon remains a wonder, because tens of design engineers worked for Solidaire, and millions of dollars were spent. Conversely, Bahamdoon Station was set before a municipality director within a difficult outlook, but he worked for it with full confidence. The work has produced tangible results, especially the commercial market packed with shops. If we had more shops, they would also be fully occupied by customers."
He noted that "speeding up the work can destroy everything, particularly from a city-planning perspective. That is exactly what happened in Beirut (...) Bahamdoon Station needs a high percentage of visitors, and this has not happened yet. However, I believe all factors notwithstanding, it is now experiencing the start of a golden age for a summer season that was preceded by Prime Minister Rafeek al-Hariri's announcement that he expects hundreds of thousands of immigrants and Arab summer visitors in Lebanon."
"It is well-known that summer visitors spend money in restaurants, cafeterias, and shops. As such, they do not come to Lebanon to buy cars or air conditioners."
Qassim: Accusations Against "Hezbollah" Meant to Ruin its Ability to Confront Israel; Seminar Commemorating Haffez Assad's Shebl Eissa El-Khuri's Anniversary
Israel is not confident that it will achieve any possible results if it launches any new attacks against Lebanon. The Zionist enemy must defend its position, because they are the aggressors who are fervently trying to manipulate us with unprecedented American support to legitimize the occupation and to make the most of the aggression on Lebanon and Palestine."
MPs Robert Ghanem, Muhammad Ali Al-Meis, and Faisal Al-Dawod, Metropolite  Esperedon Khuri, Colonel Fayez Amhaz was a representative of Army Commander Brigadier Michel Sulayman, Military Intelligence Deputy Director Colonel Ali Samili, Biqaa State Security Director Colonel Charles Atta, Colonel Abd-Allah Al-Hariri on behalf of the Security and Reconnaissance Branch of the Syrian forces operating in Lebanon, and several party, political, and social figures, attended the event.
Eli Al-Farazli expressed his view that Haffez Assad "Was the only Syrian president since the Sikes Pico agreement to talk about Lebanon as a state."
After reading from the Bible, Bishop al-Besri gave a sermon in which he talked about "The meaning of martyrdom in the Christian church and the renaissance after death."
"Lebanon was victorious, and Palestine restored its presence. That is why we find the discourse of (George) Bush and his attack against Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine, and the attempt to form an authority.
Nabatiya - "Al-Nahar":
Khreis said, "Lebanon is experiencing a state of security and political pressure that is meant to disturb internal stability and destroy all the achievements that have been made since the agreement of Al-Taif, in light of the internal peaceful state witnessed by Lebanon consequent to that agreement, as well as the comprehensive national development state and the liberation that was accomplished two years ago."
"From the Arab age we live under today and the Israeli age that we fought with all our abilities."
Explosives were attached to the foundations of the hote,l then detonated around half past eleven. Prior to that, security forces had blocked all roads to the location.
Perhaps this is what its Municipality Director Usta Abu-Rejeili referred to when he assumed office in 1998, that he "will take it quickly back to its natural position as a summer capital and a preferred location for Arab summer visitors by rebuilding it and revamping its infrastructure so that it is restored to its past status." Perhaps all of that places this town on the right path as an exemplary model for many towns and villages that enjoy the same features of Bahamdoon Station. Its commercial market and fresh air are factors for reviving our basic "industry," i.e., tourism.
Municipal work is new to Talabbas. The first municipal council was established there in 1998 and consisted of 12 members presided over by Tony Hanna, who noted, "The conditions of deprivation experienced by the villages and towns of Akkar largely apply to Telabbas, which has suffered a lot at the level of services and infrastructure development projects, such as electricity, water, roads, telephone, potable water networks, and sewerage, in addition to the basic problems related to the basic agricultural return."
So what happened?
Yes. Let the Hilton that is one of the symbols of the war be demolished, and let it return quickly as one of the symbols of life and the future. But before this and that, let us teach our children that Lebanon is for all Lebanese, Muslims and Christians. None of us has an advantage over the other, except by virtue of what he gives his homeland and country. Let us all stand united against anyone who lets out the ignorant cry of war or advocates disintegration or division. The homeland is big enough for everyone, provided we keep away from it the traders of religion, the world, and politics. That is the lesson for the new generations. Let those who have eyes see, and let those who have ears hear.
The culprits declared that they "are proud to be Muslims, and that they raped non-Muslim girls."
The culprits were all born in Lebanon or are the children of Lebanese emigrants who fled the civil war in the 1980s.
Angry reactions kindled hostile emotions against Muslims and increased the conservative government's stringency towards emigrants in general, and asylum seekers from Muslim countries in particular.
Religious leader Sheikh Khaleel Al-Shami strongly criticized Lebanese families, which he accused of isolating their children from Australian society and of not promoting harmony between various sects.
Among 25 filed complaints, 18 Lebanese young men were accused of committing 380 violations of the law against 11 women.
New Political Status Quo
Signed agreements, on the other hand, are now void of any significance or true value; a new political status quo is developing under ceased negotiations and continuous hostilities.
True enough, the Israeli prime minister is still far from keeping his promise of restoring security to the lives of Israelis. In spite of the Israeli re-occupation of the West Bank, the Palestinian operations, albeit seriously reduced, have not stopped. There is also no guarantee that Palestinian suicidal operations, which may target Israeli soldiers instead of being carried out in Israel itself, will not recur.
Criticism of his policy in the press has abated, and there is no fear that his government might collapse soon. It will most probably remain solid until it is time for the general elections in 2003. His popularity among Israelis also remains large and firm, and his leadership of his Likud party is now more deeply entrenched.
And there is another point. Anyone who believes that the Palestinians' political loss will currently be restricted to them alone is mistaken. It is also a loss for Syria, who is still waiting for an opportunity to liberate the Jolan Heights of Israeli occupation.
On the Eve of Telecom Law Discussion, Ojero Employees: We Want Equality
"Members of the Parliament, tomorrow you will have the Telecommunications Law in your hands. Let your sole reference be your consciences."
"In its new tenth article, Law 161 shows how to calculate the end of service compensation:"
"It was signed for initial approval by Minister of Telecommunications Jean Louis Qirdahi on the April 6, 2001."
"So, can there be a simultaneous combination of summer and winter?"
"The Association Council has made intensive contacts and consultations with a number of members of the telecommunications and administration and justice committees, judges, and lawyers, each of whom gave responses contradictory to the others'. This has led to the open strike called for by the General Assembly on Friday 7/12/2002."
Shuayb mentioned, "The company succeeded recently in reducing legacy debts from 40 million dollars to approximately 22 million, taking into consideration the Bank of Lebanon debt exchange with real estate transaction, which was approved by the bank's Central Council and its implementation is pending some procedural details."
Bint Jubayl - "Al-Nahar":
In its Saturday statement, the Electricity Organization of Lebanon announced that it "was obliged to stop steam group number 3 in Al-Zouk station to perform necessary maintenance operations on it. Completion of the work and resumption of operation is expected within three days, which affects the supply negatively in some areas in Jabal Lebnan."
Minister of Economy and Commerce Bassil Filayjan inaugurated the Second Shopping Festival in the city of Bint Jubayl on Saturday evening on behalf of Prime Minister Rafeek Al-Hariri. Attendees included MP Muhammad Fineish, Bint Jubayl Municipality Director Fayyad Sharara, members of the Municipal Council, members of the Commercial Enterprise Owners Association, association members from southern villages, a delegation from the International Forces, and regional association, security, and religious figures.
He also thanked the supporters, Parliament Chairman Nabeeh Birri in particular.
He demanded completion of the government house and criticized the absence of some ministers from the area. He also emphasized the necessity of compensating the owners of demolished houses and implementation of the potable water project.
Then there was a cocktail party in the city plaza, along with fireworks, athletic shows, and distribution of flyers about the festival, locations of participating shops, and the types of prizes and lots.
The mind, usually affected by words, pictures, and ideas, mixes them together to form a poem; the same thing happens when someone sees a movie.

Out of 20 Arab countries and 1500 TV and radio producers, Egypt (the host) won the most prizes. This year a new phenomenon surfaced: the appearance on stage of the sons and daughters of Egyptian artists. Kuwait surprised everybody by coming in second in the number of awards earned. Lebanon came in third, thanks to the exceptional contribution of Al-Manar Television, which won two gold and two bronze medals, and Al-Noor Radio, which won six gold and three silver. In a phenomenon recurring each year since these two media started participating in the festival, the thing that made people wonder was the absence of the other Lebanese TV and radio stations from this Arabic festival. In particular, our competing local stations allege that they enjoy the biggest audience among Arab viewers. Have they realized how shallow their programs are? And how unqualified their programs are for competition?
I have talked to you before about "The Monitor," this wonderful invention that allows any viewer who owns a computer and cares for the national interest to face successfully the waves of cultural invasion and globalization brought through satellite dishes.
I swear! It is really an honor to have unknown soldiers taking care of monitoring concerts around the world, watching for suspicious events of normalization (with Israel).
But those against naturalization are still telling the same old story. They do not like the idea that an Arab singer justifies his/her participation in a concert with an Israeli singer in the presence of representatives of the Palestinian authority by helping revive the notion of peace, as Israel seeks to bury it.
Is it worth jeopardizing an art festival that is considered one of the few noble events in Lebanon's cultural life?
This doesn't mean that the Palestinian lute and violin player by himself is enough to grant innocence to a "suspected" colleague.
But if "refusing naturalization" has become an art for the sake of art, then its followers will be happy to learn that they are a minority.
*How did you find your way to the top?
She also worked with Pierre Romain and with Francis Huster, who was a tutor at Florent Institute.
"When I remember that fact, I realize playing a role like that in my twenties was an act of defiance."

"The old mistress of John-Claude Romain wears fur ..."
"I tried hard to imitate her."
"We had to go deep inside that man."
"But the truth is I want to do everything. I would like to act in a comedy."

Teachers' and professors' associations are organizing a solidarity meeting under the title "In Solidarity with Public Education and Support of Professors' and Teachers' Rights" at eleven o'clock this morning on the premises of the League of Public Secondary Education Teachers, Onesco.
They called on representatives of educational organizations to "participate intensely."
1- It is now known to all that merging the financial allowance does not impose any financial burdens, so why hasn't the government promptly approved the bill proposed by the Ministry of Education seven months ago to merge the financial allowance into the basic salary?
Having discussed the situation and reviewed supporting positions of youth and student organizations, people, powers, and political and association figures in supporting action and rights, the conferees decided the following:
Fourth: Adopting a series of solidarity pressure-escalating steps during the following (current) week.
They deemed "the authority responsible for the situation resulting from boycotting the correction of public exam contests due to its failure to perform its duties in implementing laws and meeting the legitimate demands of teachers."

The Forum also announced that arrival of Arab youths participating in the Twelfth Arab National Youth Camp will start on July 30th and 31st. The Camp will be held in Sayda from the August 1-15.
The national anthem and then an introduction by Abd-Allah Nasser El-Deen were followed by speeches by El-Hermel Municipality Director Ibraheem Shaheen, and MP Muhhamad Baghi, who said, "Balanced development is yet to be achieved. At a time when billions of dollars' worth of loans and grants are flowing for reconstruction, they would mostly stop at the entrances of our area."
"The construction area of this secondary school is approximately 8000 square meters, with a capacity of 1400 pupils. The construction cost is approximately 2 million U.S. dollars, and execution will be completed within 18 months as of the date of work commencement, which we expect within this year after offering the project for bidding."
He added, "No one is answering me as to why the teachers under contract have not been paid yet."
The celebration was ended with setting the secondary school's cornerstone.
The celebration was attended by Educational Center of Research and Development Director Dr. Laila Mileiha Fayyad, North Educational Administration Director Fawzi Nima, Secretary General of Orthodox Schools in Lebanon Shafeek Haydar, former Engineers Association Chairman Atta Jadour, the secondary school's Trustees Council Secretary General Elias Bushaheen, members of the Council, members of the Parents Council, directors of a number of schools, and parents.
"For knowledge to be effective and creative today, it must be accompanied by freedom so that it develops a critical mind that never accepts the easy answers. That only is the creative mind."
In her speech, Dr. Fayyad referred to the curriculum evaluation workshop in the Educational Center, now applied for four years. She said, "These curricula that were published in 1997 formed a pivotal element in the history of educational renewal in Lebanon and achieved a categorical shift. However, the general economic situation in Lebanon prevented the application of the curricula according to the plan that was developed for them. It also partially or fully prevented provision of the supplies necessary for teaching essential procedural subjects such as Information and Technology, Translation and Arabization, and the second foreign language."
The ceremony was attended by MPs Wajeeh Al-Ba'reeni, Muhammad Yahia, and Jamal Ismail, and Al-Hedaya Model Schools Secretary General Sheikh Abd El-Razzak Al-Zubi, who delivered a speech in which he mentioned "a number of activities that Al-Hedaya Schools try to carry out at the educational level, such as inauguration of the Al-Hedaya General Technical Center for next year, holding of the summer club with the Lebanese Canadian Educational Center, holding a qualification course for teachers of the first, second, and third rounds on the teaching methods and approaches according to the new curricula."
Entry of the graduates parade was followed by the national anthem, and then prayers by Priest Ameen Awad. After that, Academic Affairs Vice-President Dr. Nabeel Haydar delivered a speech in which he said, "There are two reasons for the success of the Lebanese American University graduates, the first being the type of qualification provided by the university and the second being the spirituality that drives its graduates."
"Continuous training, in addition to these professors' devotion, is what leads to the production of graduates who benefited from the wisdom of the wise and the experience of the experts."
The ceremony keynote speaker, American University in Greece President Dr. John Paili, then delivered a speech in which he lauded the scientific and cultural standard achieved by the Lebanese American University, emphasizing that it is very important for the university to continue disseminating knowledge to the generations. He said, "All what this university has offered is the result of what many people diligently offered. Many of those were graduates such as yourselves. Give back what you can to it so that the generations after you can enjoy the privileges you enjoyed."
My first poem to be printed in a newspaper was of the colloquial rhyme (zajal) type.
"Well, pay close attention to what I will tell you: every piece we write with our pen is part of our conscience."
Since that time, I try to follow my father's example, always remembering his advice, because things that are beautiful and noble must be given out to everybody, not kept inside chests and hearts.
Antalyas, the fragrance of your breeze
Intoxicated in the arms of the moon
As our love for beauty
The similarity of the two drawings amazed me
And nothing remained to be added to my drawing
Moaning, not for what our fingertips wrote
He was the poet whom money could not humiliate:
Teachers' and professors' associations are organizing a solidarity meeting under the title "In Solidarity with Public Education and Support of Professors' and Teachers' Rights" at eleven o'clock this morning on the premises of the League of Public Secondary Education Teachers, Onesco.
from the Lebanese Baccalaureate Certificate under its four branches in a celebration it held in our schoolyard under the sponsorship of Patriarch Agnatius IV Hazeem on behalf of the Bishop of Tripoli, Kora, and Surroundings, Metropolite Elias Qurban.
Before he arrived, some of the attendees kept saying, "A minister will fly."
Entry of the graduates parade was followed by the national anthem, then prayers by Priest Ameen Awad. After that, Academic Affairs Vice-President Dr. Nabeel Haydar delivered a speech in which he said, "There are two reasons for the success of the Lebanese American University graduates, the first being the type of qualification provided by the university and the second being the spirituality that drives its graduates."
Under the sponsorship of General Religious Representative of Imam Khamini in Lebanon, Hezbollah Secretary General Mr. Hassan Nasr-Allah, represented by his deputy Sheikh Naim Qassin, Hawzit Al-Imam Al-Sadiq organized its first conference on development of Hawza curricula, under the title "Religious Studies in Shiite Institutes, Curricula and Problems" in the Fatima Al-Zahraa compound of Sayda.
Mrs. Lahud awarded the Red Cross medal to Dr. Baseel as a token of gratitude and acknowledgment.
Religious Studies Conference in Shiite Institutes; Qassim: Arms Replaced With Westernization and Ideas Transferred Through Blind Imitation
Sheikh Qassim then talked about religious scholars between the religious and the political. He said: "With the recession of Islamic presence due to arrogant domination, and with the fall of the Ottoman state as the last stronghold of Islamic rule, regardless of the detailed view of that, a general atmosphere of frustration and retardation prevailed. Westernization replaced Islamization, and western ideas moved to our countries through blind imitation that lacks the minimal steps of objective comparison between two disparate fields and two divine messages that differ from one another."
On the second day, the conference resumed its proceedings, where two sessions were held. The first was presided by Senior Scholar Al-Nabulsi, and Mr. Muhammad Al-Farwi lectured in it about the Hawza books and experimentation of alternatives.
Sexual disorders are as common a disease in the Arab world as in Western countries.
The conference lasted three days and was sponsored by Jordanian Minister of Health Falih Al-Nassir and presided by Dr. Mamoun Al-Zabda, Renal, Urinary Tract, and Genital Surgery Consultant and Chairman of the Mediterranean Sexual Disorders Society.
He added that the "Uprima" medication developed by Abbott Labs in Saudi Arabia proved to be effective in treating men's weak erection problems, taking into consideration that this medication stimulates the brain to excrete Dubamin, which affects the central nervous system.
When Herbert von Karajan released the complete orchestrated Beethoven collection, the "New York Times" wrote that if "Beethoven was able to hear his works played in a concert led by von Karajan, he would have loved them more."
What is the value of the singing of a nightingale alone in an arid, secluded place? It has no meaning unless someone is sitting under a tree in the splendor of a meadow, enjoying it.
That is why great poets (such as Ahmed Shawky) asked others to read their poetry for them before large audiences.
Maybe not many poets (who do not have the gift of perfect stage performance) wish that Aziz Khyoun, or another gifted Aziz Khyoun, would interpret their poems.
British driver Colin Makri broke a new world record in a Ford Fox car yesterday, when he won the 50th Kenya Safari, the eighth round of the Rally World Championship. His total now is 25 victories, as opposed to 24 each for Spanish Ford Fox driver Carlos Sayenz and Finnish Subaru Impreza driver Tommy Maccinin, both of whom withdrew on Saturday, as did Finnish Peugeot 206 driver Marcos Grunholm on Friday, although he remained on top of the general driver rankings.

Musharraf rejected Kashmir's elections planned by the New Delhi government, describing Kashmir as "occupied." In contrast, the Indian President confirmed that Kashmir is an "indivisible part of India" and that it is not an international issue.
Musharraf said that the attacks are in the interest of Pakistan's enemies and are carried out by "a minority that has taken the entire country hostage."
"Those criminals and terrorists have strayed, and their leaders have the nerve to believe that their actions will take them to Paradise."
He warned, "Pakistan faces multiple challenges, some of which carry opportunities while others bear invisible dangers."
He rejected the elections that New Delhi intends to hold in Kashmir in July because their aim is to legitimize the "illegitimate occupation," as "the Indian government previously organized similar, corrupt elections and was boycotted by the people of Kashmir."
He added that it is "not an international issue."
Indian police reinforced security measures in New Delhi after receiving "reliable intelligence information" that the "Askar Tayyebah" and "Jeish Muhammad" groups, who are fighting for Kashmir's independence, are preparing attacks on Indian politicians during Independence celebrations.
Pakistani cabinet official Elias Khan announced that the 11 French marine engineers killed in the explosion of a booby-trapped car in Karachi last May were granted the Pakistan Star medal, the country's second most important medal.
When Suarish heard the verdict, which is considered the first in a series of trials for former Indonesian officials on charges of committing crimes against humanity, he brandished his fist and said, "They made me a scapegoat (...) How can a single person like me disband a militia armed with spears, axes, and rifles?"
Activists have repeatedly claimed that Jakarta is incapable of bringing to justice the people who were responsible for the bloodshed in East Timor.
She added, "The letter demonstrates a spirit of reconciliation, which could have been buried in the case of a severe sentence."
The violence ended when Australian-led peacekeeping forces arrived in the country in September 1999.
A spokesman for South Korea's government stated that progress achieved could strengthen the possibilities of dialog between North Korea and the U.S., South Korea's major ally.
South Korean officials admitted that the Northern version of the statement indicates that both parties "recommended" the military talks.
Several plans were accomplished before the deterioration of relations last year, but new initiatives were few.
He added, "The two Koreas agreed to hold military talks as soon as possible. We have also agreed that each party should take military steps to help build the railway that links the two countries."
Red Cross officials will meet in early September to discuss the details and to prepare family lists.
The Northern Korean Central News Agency quoted another similar statement released by the Japanese foreign ministry saying, "Talks will deal with issues related to the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries and other important issues of mutual concern."
Freshman students of the University of North Carolina will discuss a book entitled "Approaching the Koran: Primitive Inspirations" by Michael Sales. However, state legislators and members of conservative political groups are still trying to stop that from happening, fearing that some students would be influenced by the book and would embrace Islam.
Sales explained that the book does not mention verses that criticize Jews and non-Muslims, considering those to be too complicated for an introduction to Islam and could confuse people who know little about this religion and the history of the Middle East.
Islamic affairs professor at the university Karl Ernest proposed discussion of the book in hopes of helping students understand the religion that bewilders many Americans.
On Tuesday the state senate approved a draft budget that allocates less funds for the project unless equal time is dedicated to each religion. This is a symbolic step, because the program does not cost much money, and it is unlikely that the senate will approve the budget in its final form for several weeks.
President Joe Gloffer of the Family Policy Network, which filed the lawsuit against the university, also said, "It is ridiculous that such a number of people adopt Islam and call it the religion of peace (...) It means peace through submission to God and death for any non-Muslim."
It also mentioned that the aircraft crew of two was taken to Bagram airbase north of Kabul, where they received treatment for slight injuries.
He said, "Dr. Khaleel Zadah is holding consultations with President Karzay, senior Afghan officials, and U.N. officials on the situation in Afghanistan and our continuous efforts to assist Afghanistan in its progress toward security and economic reconstruction."
The "Hayat Nu" newspaper reported that Iran offered Afghan officials a rapid plan for reconstructing damaged factories.
Only one newspaper dealt with the strategic aspect of Khatami's visit to a country in which the U.S. administration had installed a government like its own.
"We also do not know who did it."
*In Peshawar, Afghan Consulate spokesman Ahmad Saidi stated that Kabul promised to release an unspecified number of Pakistanis detained since the fall of the Taliban.
New Formula for Co-existence with Palestinian Arms
As to the Lebanese state, it remains beyond "internal disagreements," as stated by Lebanese Minister of Defense when asked about the nature of the armed conflict that took place during the past two days.
And in it the elements of cooling are manifested.
Rather, our objective is to say that the Palestinian situation in Lebanon cannot be based on broad talk that is repeated on all occasions, and which confirms respect for Lebanese laws while reality testifies to the exact opposite.
The Lebanese cannot be asked to submit voluntarily to the state if it wastes its minimal duties and rights.
It is also time for pressure on the Lebanese government and president to devise a new formula for the Palestinian armed presence on the basis of control and restriction to the narrowest possible range.
Former US President Harry Truman could have looked at George Bush slyly and asked him: What are you doing?
When the Iraqi opposition delegation arrived in Washington, they were surprised twice: First when the discovered that the American administration still has an extremely negative view of the scattered aspect of this opposition, and then when the delegation members expressed surprise at "the seriousness of the American administration" with regards to ousting the Iraqi regime. Maybe they were under the impression that Washington is joking or boasting with Baghdad.
Along with Al-Bayati stood representatives of the "Constitutional Royal Movement", "National Accord Movement", Kurdish Democratic Party", "Kurdish National Union", and "Iraqi National Conference".
Even the "Washington Post" did not hesitate to raise what seems to be ridicule last Saturday when it said that the delegation members "want to appear as a united front, and this was demonstrated for only five minutes after the meeting."
But even Riva Levenson, manager of the PR bureau (Borson Marstler) that provides its services to the "Iraqi National Conference" wondered: "How many are there"?

His view was that the USA is preparing for the operation, and is still determined to make it a harsh operation in spite of international protest.
At the Palestinian level, "Ha'arts" commentator Zaif Shif expressed concern with the current internal Palestinian debate with regards to stopping suicidal operations and declaring a unilateral cease-fire.
With that they mean citizens within the borders of the green line.
And if he does not want that, they will not be held.
It also does not seem that the economic-social situation, which is the basic factor of his decline, will change in the months to come.
The writer adds, "Sharon is using elections as a threat- only a threat to intimidate, because he knows that some will be intimidated."
"Therefore, it is most likely that Sharon will calm down and sit with them both and with the minister of finance to reach agreements allowing the Labor and Shas parties to vote for the budget in the first reading - and maintain the safety of the coalition until it is time for the next crisis."
As much as the Ein El-Helwa Camp incidents as broadcast by Arab and foreign satellite television stations, and the exchange of fire between disputing parties in it, seemed damaging to Lebanon's image abroad during the peak of its publicity campaign for tourism and investment, there was also justification strongly emphasized in these pictures for Lebanon to finalize the abnormal situation in the camp, as well the impossibility of leaving it without remedy.
The final question stems from the essence of assertions made by security officials that the negotiations which led to the handing in of the accused Badee' Hamada to the Lebanese state early this August were under direct support from Syria, and had it not been for the pressure Damascus exercised in the camp that had direct effect on them, things would never have turned out the way they did.
Rather, what is happening basically in the camps today, according to these sources, can be considered a local card in the full sense of the word.
The state now fears, despite its well-known intelligence infiltration in the camp, that the camps in their current state may form a trigger for a situation similar to the one before and during the war, which is totally refused.
The interest of Lebanon and Syria joins the interest of the Unites States in putting a limit to the growth of radical Islamic fundamentalism, which poses a threat to internal situations in Lebanon and Syria much more than it poses to America. Threats in the camp have reached the extent that the Lebanese state may no longer remain a spectator without abandoning its usual policy towards Palestinian camps.
Today, the parliament summer leave also starts, and will last for a full month to September 15th.
By approving the electricity privatization law, the parliament has approved in a matter of few months the third law for privatization of the sectors listed for this schedule, following the mobile phone and telecommunication laws.
The parliament also approved a proposed law to prevent the use of 24-passenger diesel-powered vans as of 31/10/2003, giving their owners additional incentives, including exemption from importation charges and increased financial compensation depending on the car model.
The appointments included Fadi Samaha as Ministry of Industry General Manager, Fadi Makki as Ministry of Economy and Commerce General Manager, Ali Fakeeh as Research and Guidance Department General Manager at Central Inspection, Waleed Safi as South Council Financial Controller, Fadia Budagher as Dental Medicine College Dean, Eli Assaf as Public Administration Institute Chairman, and Antoine Massara, Hashim El-Husseini, Bassem Tarbah, Abbass Halabi, and Robert Fadil as members.
Lahud added: "The cabinet previously approved a re-draft of the appointment mechanism law, taking the Constitutional Council's remarks into consideration, and assigned the task of drafting the amendment to Minister Baheej Tayyarah.
"Al-Nahar" learned that the president was informed by the prime minister of his remarks on a diplomatic formation proposal that includes 20 ambassadors and was proposed by Foreign Minister Mahmoud Hammoud to Al-Haritit two days ago.
If nothing obstructs the proposed formation, it will most probably be approved in the first ordinary cabinet session after the budget approval session.
In another precautionary measure, Israel's Ministry of Defense announced that it will distribute to all Israelis tablet medications that give limited protection from effects of radiation.
He said that, on the contrary, in doing so Germany adopts a full partner position in a right that it acquired through its participation in the NATO strikes on Yugoslavia in the spring of 1999, which was the first external military intervention for Germany since World War II, and also through supporting the USA in the war against terrorism.
In Amman ("Al-Nahar"), Russian Ambassador to Jordan Alexander Shein reiterated his country's refusal of American plans that aim at striking against Iraq, expressing lack of conviction with the seriousness of "speculations about the inevitability of striking against that country despite the escalated American threatening tone, and that the international community does not accept the use of force as a solution to the Iraqi problem."
He told the "Al-Jazeerah" satellite channel of Qatar that the statements attributed to him by American television network CNN in this regard are "inaccurate."
He added, "The stance of the Kurdish National Union, as part of the Iraqi opposition, is clear. The mission of change is an Iraqi mission assumed by Iraqi opposition forces for a complete democratic change (...) However, these forces would not mind receiving international assistance, including America, to accomplish this mission."
Yesterday, on the eve of the start of the second round of talks between the Sudanese government and the "Sudan People's Liberation  Movement" in Kenya, Egypt managed to draw parties concerned with the peace process in Sudan, in which they signed the Machacus agreement protocol that grants the south autonomy for six years followed by a self-determination referendum. This raised concerns in Cairo regarding potential separation of south Sudan from the largest African country.
He added,"The US position is that normal relations (with Sudan) are dependent upon peace and upon cooperation in the area of combating terrorism and the free movement of humanity (organizations) in combat zones."
These peace talks are being held under the sponsorship of the Governmental Agency for Development and Combating Drought and Desertification in East Africa and the African Horn "EGAD", and mediated by the USA, the UK, Norway, and Italy.
He also welcomed Ottawa's appointment of Senator Mobina Jaffer, a special Canadian envoy to Sudan.
He said: "We have objectives in common with Egypt in connection to unity... I appeal to Egypt to do what it can to guarantee the unity of Sudan in this agreement."
Part of a statement signed by Union Party Secretary General Sayyid Ahmad Al-Hussein read, "The policies of the system and party are known for their lack of credibility and their conspiracy aiming at fragmenting the unity of political parties."
Iran Islamic Republic's Guide Ayatollah Ali Khameini accused the USA of endeavoring to impose its hegemony on the world, comparing the language used by US President George Bush with that of Adolph Hitler.
He added: "Iran does not wish to engage in war."
Iranian television described US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's accusations that Iran is harboring individuals from Al-Qaeda as being "illogical."
Rumsfeld had said on Tuesday: "With regard to terrorists (...) they definitely (the Iranians) will not extradite anyone to us."
He also accused the Iranian regime of producing and storing amounts of chemical and germ substances as part of an "alarming WMD program."
First: Minister Franjiya gave the audience the impression that MP Naila Muawwad belonged to his political line then left it in order to damage him, and that she turned against Al-Taif, which brought Muawwad Rene forth as president.
Does he know that the four fundamentals represent an indivisible whole, which means that disturbing any of them is considered a grave diversion that endangers Al-Taif settlement?
Did he read the Al-Taif document well enough?
Second: Minister Franjiya repetitively suggested that those who demand sovereignty want to replace Syrian power with American power.
The struggle in Lebanon is not, as Minister Franjiya and other interested beneficiaries want to picture it, between an Arab line and a "Zionized" American line, but between a corrupt, suppressive, and exploitive authority that takes Arabism as a disguise and a sovereignty, reform, and salvation opposition that believes in true Arabism.
So how can Minister Franjiya allow himself to picture the Syrian presence in Lebanon as protecting one sect from the other?
For the second day, official, political party, media, and social figures headed for the Editors Association building in Al-Ashrafiyyah to congratulate Association Chairman Milham Karam and the members of the Association Council for winning the recent elections unanimously.
True Chairman Malham Karam won by unanimous recommendation, translating the support of all his colleagues for him and the efforts he exerted over decades.
*President Krami: "We wish Chairman Karam success and may he remain a pioneer and a protector of freedoms in Lebanon."
"Freedom means media and the press."
"When I see these roses in this hall, I feel as if we are in a wedding, and the Chairman is the groom."

Once and sometimes twice a week we would sit in the ground floor of his house in Baabda for hours on end, isolated from the world, reminiscing on the past and living the present.
A group of Antonine Sisters running the convent served at the mass, which was attended by a large congregation as well as the Mother Superior of Maronites Antonine Sisters, Mother Judith Haroun.
Rita Sharara wrote:
They announced "formation of a legal committee to study decisions and laws issued by the government (regarding religious media)," emphasizing "monitoring the file with accuracy, care, and resolve."
They charge a 10% interest rate from customers every night, which caused an official reference to demand expedited privatization of that facility in order to put an end to that abnormal situation.
On Assumption Day, Cardinal Mar Nasrallah Boutros Sfair, Patriarch of the Maronite Church, headed yesterday a celebratory Mass at the bishopric's monumental seat church in Kanouin, as is traditional every year. He was assisted by Reverend Francis Al-Bissary, Monsieur Fouad Barbour, and Al-Khoury Habib Saab.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by chants. The nuns greeted him standing at the church's door, where he headed a Mass during which he preached about the meaning of the celebration of Assumption Day, the annual visit tradition, "and how it indicates a necessary return to spiritual roots to face the crisis of this era and its different problems."
After the Mass, chief mother thanked the Patriarch for his visit. After returning to Al-Diman, Patriarch Sfeir headed the monthly meeting of his general deputies Reverend Francis Al-Bissary, Reverend Guy Boulos Najeem, and Reverend Samir Mazloum. He discussed issues related to the church, congregation, and national matters.
The huge "Al-Shaheed Al-Sheikh Raghib Harb" hospital, has 240 beds and various types of medically and technologically advanced equipment that will facilitate the provision of services required in the future."
An Al-Nahar reporter in Sayda reported that Muhammad Ali Sibhani also visited Islamic Law Judge Sayda Al-Sheikh Ahmad Al-Zein in the presence of a number of city officials, led by the "Nassiri Popular Organization" president Ussama Saad and Al-Sheikh Maher Humoud.
She also called upon all "To work towards deepening this relationship in minds and hearts."
Criticizing the "repulsive dispersion between members of the governmental team," it also expressed a view that "the authority resorts to temporary resolutions in economic and social files."
"The successive authorities for the past decade, and the current one in particular, may not evade the consequences of letting repercussions accumulate, conditions aggravate, and crimes become more unmanageable, while making excuses, devising camouflages, searching for histrionic scenarios to distract from the bitter reality, explaining to people that expected aid has not arrived, and luring them with promises that are never kept. They find no way to distract other than attempts to lash liberties one after another and to bombard national media with accusations, as is the case in the news about the Lebanese Broadcast Corporation and the claims against Al-Mur Television in a manner that is unacceptable and contradicts proper principles."
It referred to the economic and social files, indicating, "The basic sectors in the country are witnessing severe strikes and threats of alarming negative steps, such as the strike of teachers and professors, and the strike of the Ojero employees and the workers of the Lebanon Electricity Organization, who have warned that they would stop maintenance operations and production. An authority who fails to cure at the right time and is unable to perceive will find no way other than submitting and yielding to justified demands in a fashion of temporary settlements, while losing more dignity, credibility, and resources every time. That is in addition to the files of privatization, cell phone, indebtedness, liabilities, and scandals at the ministry, council, department, and institutional levels."
The Convention announced its following meeting at 11:00 am on Wednesday, the 21st of this month to approve the declaration it will release on the anniversary of its establishment at a lunch banquet to be held by Edmond Rizk, "Honoring the National Accord Generation" on Sunday, August 25. Participants of the Al-Taif Conference and members of the media were invited.
The Council had held a meeting two days ago, headed by Director Abd al-Munim al-Arees, and issued a statement saying it discussed "the increasing problems caused by motorbikes, such as traffic violations and serious accidents. In addition, such motorbikes are used for robberies."
The Council also approved the municipality's 2001 financial statement; a cash advance to purchase and maintain electrical appliances for the municipal playground; construction of a metal fence for playgrounds in the Beirut Forest; a cash advance to buy rat control materials; and an offer to kill and transfer street dogs.
He welcomed all attendees, assuring them that "Hamana welcomes His Excellency the Minister, who has purchased a house in the town." He expressed hopes that other Kuwaiti officials would do so, as well.
"Filing a penal lawsuit against the minister of finance because his interference with money of the Municipality Independent Fund prevented payments due to municipalities and divided due amounts into parts, actions which are considered violations of law."
Municipality Director Mustafa Najm explained, "The road is approximately six kilometers in length, and its width varies between five and six meters. The works performed on it included construction of retention walls on its sides and water draining channels."
This expression, which matches to some extent the situation in the camp yesterday, does not fully match the difficult and complicated living standards inside the camp for the past ten years, specifically since the Oslo agreement. It also does not match the consequences of the events that took place two days ago between members of the al-Daniya Group, its Islamic affiliated militias from inside and outside the camp, and members of the Fatah movement, the backbone of PLO factions that are directly affiliated with President Yasir Arafat of the Palestinian Authority.
There is a tendency not to use force to resolve the issue of al-Daniya members, while emphasizing that "everyone must bear their responsibilities in finding a suitable solution for this problem."
Only media people and photographers were wandering in the camp in search of an interview with an official, but efforts to do so failed. Some meetings were held, the most important of which was the Fatah and PLO Military Committee meeting. It was held under media blackout. Reporters knew about it by chance.
At six o'clock, a verbal clash took place between a member of Fatah and an Usba member, and the latter started firing in the lower street near the emergency area. Armed men from both sides interfered.
"Disarm the camp."
"We call upon the masses of our people in the camp not to listen to rumors and to work together to get rid of any internal conflicts that serve the enemy."

The Council had held a meeting two days ago headed by Director Abd al-Munim al-Arees and issued a statement, saying it discussed "the increasing problems caused by motorbikes, such as traffic violations and serious accidents. In addition, such motorbikes are used for robberies."
The Minister of Education Abd El-Raheem Murad attended the event as a representative of President Emil Lahud, while Ali Bazzi represented the Chairman of Parliament, and Minister Bishara Mirhaj represented the Prime Minister. Former Prime Ministers Rasheed al-Sulh and Seleem al-Huss and other figures attended the celebration.
He added, "Beirut has sacrificed itself for the sake of the Arab nation when it stood up against the Israeli enemy in 1982, challenging its might, its American weapons, and the will of invasion with all its strength. Beirut was burned down but never raised a white flag."
Why should the average citizen remain prey to bureaucracy in most governmental agencies and nearly have his head explode before receiving his rights?
"Another day of fires and more vigorous efforts by those heroes who are in charge of fire-extinguishing in all Lebanese lands."
"Third: Purchase one or more aircraft to extinguish difficult fires by modern methods. This can be done through donations by Lebanese, inside and outside Lebanon. This will not be impossible, because preserving Lebanon's beauty, greenery, and environment means a lot to the Lebanese people, especially the immigrant Lebanese."
Basaleem Municipality asserted that it cares a lot for environmental safety and for relieving the complainants of their worries by inspecting the pen and requiring its owners to comply with legal and health regulations.
From a citizen:
A Beirut Water official said that the cost of installing the water meter is paid only once, and that it was determined with approval of the ministers of finance and energy and water. The subscription fee is paid annually at a rate of 225,000 liras, at a monthly rate of 15,000 liras. It has to be noted that there is a big difference between the electricity bill and the water subscription fee.
But it is easy to realize that in the long run, extreme Islamism does not form a realistic alternative as a ruling ideology for the world communities.

Palestinian national and Islamic factions in the Gaza Strip managed, after intensive and continuous efforts, to draft a political working paper-a document that specifies the strategy of Palestinian policy in the current stage and the views of these factions regarding Palestinian objectives and the measures required to achieve these objectives. The document identifies the current strategic objectives as follows:
This document also identifies necessary measures to accomplish these objectives, as follows:
The document calls for forming a unified national leadership in which all factions would participate, in order to manifest national unity, collective leadership, and participation in the Palestinian national decision-making process. This leadership should bear the responsibility of driving the national Palestinian policy for an interim period until a democratic election is held for the PLO institutions, Palestinian Authority institutions, and social institutions. It also calls for comprehensive reform of the internal Palestinian situation; building social institutions, on a democratic basis, that ensure justice, equality, and political multiplicity; securing public liberties; confirming the principles of visibility, liability, protection of public property, and holding officials who misuse their positions responsible for their wrongdoings.
Reliable sources in the High Monitoring Committee in the Gaza Strip said that there was disagreement within the leadership of the movement regarding this document. Some demands were made while others found it necessary to approve it as is.

After Completion of al-Hazimiya-Sofer Road, Works and Construction Director Honored; Saudi and Kuwaiti Roles Lauded; Shuhayb Eitani
Naseeb al-Rayyis delivered a speech in which he lauded the excellent cooperation with the Council Director and his team "in connection with executing and paving the al-Hazimiya-Sofer road, which resulted in completion of 30 kilometers in 24 days, including excavation, transport of 500,000 cubic meters of asphalt, paving 70,000 meters with 7 kilometers of reinforced concrete barriers, painting white and yellow stripes to mark lanes in both directions, and posting directions and signs. This is considered a milestone of project execution in Lebanon."
He expressed a view that "generous initiatives help in solving problems and contribute to filling the gap."
Eitani responded with a speech in which he thanked al-Rayyis for "his initiative and his excellent execution of the project, which we launched with the help of the Saudi government and the Saudi Fund specifically."
He explained, "This project is one of many projects for the area."
Then dinner was served in tribute to the guest of honor and the attendees.
He explained the agreement stipulates that payment starts as of August 1, and that the administration will try to secure within ten days the retroactive amount from the beginning of the year. "If that is not possible, it may be agreed to pay that in installments, because the matter has been finalized and cannot be reversed."
"Implementation of the decree will start with payment of the transport allowance with the salaries of August 2002."

It welcomed the securing of rights of Lebanon Electricity workers, but it was not satisfied with the disagreement regarding the physician-employment system, saying that "such a system must not destroy the Union's major achievement of covering dentistry costs." It called on the government to preserve the social contract by reviving trilateral meetings to eliminate the heavy burdens facing the people's livelihood.
It also expressed its absolute rejection of the economic organizations' decision that was issued yesterday (Tuesday), which is to not burden the private sector with education allowances and to postpone transporting allowances, "particularly since this decision contradicts the positive approach announced yesterday (Tuesday) by the Industrialists Association Chairman to the Minister of Labor."
It assured that it will not accept anything less than "direct penalties that must be enforced on violating organizations."
With regard to the privatization issue, the Union emphasized that it is totally against it "because its major target is the laborers, and the target has always been to guarantee permanent jobs in order to protect the working class from any social problems that may weaken it."
In connection with the new medication list, it demanded that the covered patient must not be held responsible for a wrong medical prescription, instead of the insurance-contracted physician.

"Article 4: All provisions disagreeing with this decision's content, particularly resolution number 367/1 of 12/18/1973, are considered void. This resolution is valid from the date of issuance."
"However, facts are different. The director, deputy, and secretary general of the union have reported the results of privatization in each sector independently, without any relevant decision from the administration or the executive board and without a vision or plan for confrontation."
"It is not acceptable that the General Union does not stand for returning the profits of that sector-estimated at millions-to the state treasury. As such, it had to defend the President's point of view of dedicating all the sector's revenues to the state."
"It is also necessary that laborers' representatives should be appointed to the boards of directors of those funds."

He was thirty-nine years old when he was hired by the French state in 1937 to design a bust for the republic's icon Marianne. Sculptor Paul Belmondo, born in Algeria in 1898, was living at that time in Paris and was not yet the obscure father of Jean Paul Belmondo, a bright star in the universal world of theatre and cinema. He was just a young sculptor, attractive and composed. He was known for his professionalism founded on common academic and classic atelier standards. Moreover, he had a zeal, persuasive and vital in the artistic community in a city (Paris) that was going through the strongest clash ever, even under the same headline as is the case among those who follow the school of expressionism in sculpture initiated by master Rodin, who was sincere to the conservative values of beauty that started to shine again in the hands of master Bordile, then Charles Despiau, and then Paul Belmondo, after subsiding for awhile facing the currents of modernization.
Until today, no noticeable improvement has taken place in the rank of this current of neo-classic artists, including Paul Belmondo, in the memory of sculpture of the 20th century arts in France.

Is it required of the Lebanese media to change its face, so that it becomes more harmonious with its environment, developing the habit of meeting injustice with silence, ignoring disasters, giving cold shoulders to suppression, forgetting liberties, forsaking sovereignty, cheering economic collapse, and promoting arbitrary decisions even if they are wrong?
That day, the President promised to ensure freedom of the press.

Israel generally avoided talking too much about the issue of Iraq, leaving it to its powerful ally, the United States, which argues that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is developing or is trying to obtain weapons of mass destruction (WMD).
Later, Perez informed reporters at the White House that Israel is committed to the U.S.-led war against terrorism, warning that the Middle East will be "either peaceful or nuclear" within five to ten years.
China and Russia are permanent Security Council members and enjoy the right of veto, which makes their support essential for adopting any "extreme resolution" wanted by the U.S. against Iraq.
At his end, Tang supported a "political solution for the Iraqi issue," emphasizing the "important role" that the U.N. can assume to call on Iraq to implement the international organization's decisions with "accuracy and goodwill."
Al-Sabah welcomed the dialog between the U.N. and Iraq regarding disarmament.
Now that U.S. President George Bush has delivered his speech before the U.N. General Assembly, the U.S. has caused another rift among the Arab effort to reject  the war on Iraq.
In that regard, French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin's clarifications of the French position is a sign that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein must read very carefully.
This is because the Egyptian President knows better than anyone else that the U.S. is "going to Baghdad" with an international decision or without.
Hence, we would like to ask the Iraqi brothers to make, at least for once, a decision with a higher content of cautious and foresighted policy than that of the abyss edge policy, if not the abyss policy itself.

An authorized Arab diplomat in Paris told me that he heard from several Western diplomatic circles in Paris of negotiations currently underway regarding the Iraqi President's destiny.
But what is more important is that all indicators suggest that America is "going to Baghdad," and that Iraq might still be in possession of one last card it could throw in the face of American "warlords": accepting the return of inspectors.
This is expressed in the approach that the authority has started to take in handling the problem, first, by isolating the station-closing incident from its chronic political disagreement with the opposition. Second, it is emphasizing that it does not consider the Qirnat Shahwan Meeting to be a target within the confrontation except to the extent of cohesion between the Meeting and the station and its defense thereof as a political problem that is greater than the magnitude of the legal violation problem into which MTV fell and is now in the hands of the judiciary.
At the end, the court will have its say with no intervention from the President or any other official.
On the other hand, Lahud was not confused as much as he reinforced his authority when Marunite Bishop Mar Nasrallah Boutros Safeer emphasized that he still believes in continuing dialog with the President.
Accordingly, discontinuing the dialog with the President, regardless of its reasons and motives, will lead to closing all open issues at once, leaving the country in the predicament of confrontation between authority and opposition.
While the Festival aimed primarily at exceeding the essence of the occasion toward organizing a well-planned campaign against the opposition, it also reflected the state's ability to present major evidence, which is its control over the street through all these forces it mustered, as much as it controls by military and security means.
However, the President's desire to separate public opinion and the opposition also indicates his concern with promoting political dialog with all opponents, including the Qirnat Shahwan Meeting as long as this does not affect public opinion, according to same sources.

In the light of a number of American messages to the Israeli government, it seems that Sharon has stopped threatening. His sources informed the "Ma'arif" newspaper two days ago that he did not say the phrase "reason for war."
Can we assume that Lebanon has conclusively won the battle of getting part of its water rights, and the chapter of Israeli threats has ended?
To Sharon, striking Iraq is a "lifetime chance" in order to achieve his colonial and aggressive plans. His plans obviously include Lebanon and Palestine.
Two research teams at the Royal University of London and Hammersmith Hospital believe it will be possible in the future to develop medications limiting the effects of Ghrelin as a treatment for obesity and to help prevent the development of type 2 diabetes. Those two diseases have come to be most prevalent in urban regions in the developing world and the advanced world alike, and they have made obvious the pressing need for new medications.
An English-American team recently discovered how the Leptin hormone, which is made in fat-storing cells, can control weight.
Today, easy access to unhealthy foods, in addition to the life of laziness we live, have overloaded the control mechanisms in our bodies, which have not become accustomed to the modern way of life. It is merely beyond the capacity of our ability.
Dr. Rain asked volunteers to fast for a certain period of time before he offered them a regular meal containing a specific number of calories.
It is quite obvious that a medication that might reduce the substantial effects of Ghrelin will have an enormous impact on obesity and probably on type 2 diabetes.
Because it is possible to synthesize quite easily the Ghrelin molecule, which is relatively small in size, it will be tested soon as an appetite stimulator for people who need it badly.
Finally, it might be possible to provide normal quantities of food and mechanisms for weight control. Currently, those are mostly inaccurate, particularly since new medications depend on discovering the roles of Ghrelin and Leptin. Accordingly, it will be possible to control the contemporary growth of the two diseases of obesity and type 2 diabetes.
French President Jacques Chirac reconfirmed yesterday his participation in the Beirut Froncophonic Summit next month.
U.S. units, assisted by Pakistani forces, detained last Wednesday in Karachi two members of the al-Qaeda fundamentalist organization.

However, he was unable to enter U.S. territory because he did not obtain an entry visa.

He expressed his belief that "Jamal Mubarak will be elected head of a new committee called the Policy Committee. It will enjoy wide authority to develop the party, draft general policies, and prepare legislative bills before referring them to the government."
"As to the secretary general and assistants, they used to be appointed."
But his view is that "something new is happening inside the party," noting that "the evidence which proves that is the massive attention that the conference preparations have attracted for the first time."
Abd al-Majeed said, "In the absence of political reform, there will be no hope of renewal but rather a balance of power between the old guard and the fresh bloods, whose ideas form a different political environment because they act as though they come from states that enjoy modern election laws and party programs governing voting processes."
Al-Wafd Opposition Party Assistant Secretary General Ibraheem Desouki Abadha's view is, "Experience has proven that any party that wants to stay alive must derive its power from the people, not from the government or the head of the state. Parties that are born on top of a ruling palace must end with absolute failure."

"If we are witnessing here young boys and girls becoming interested in ministerial life and priesthood, and believers frequenting churches and places of worship more and more, and many among them rushing to get the blessing from Mother Teresa's relics while she is visiting Lebanon these days and asking for her intercession for blessings, it is because the wars that have made us suffer and our martyrs who have died earned us the blessing of our solid faith and trust in God, despite the difficulties and hardships that we face."
"A true Christian believer endorses both the Cross with Christ."

Inaugurated a Dispensary and Sponsored a Tourism Survey; Hamada: Reinforcing Our Internal Unity; Tourism Survey Announced
After a welcome by the ceremony presenter Manal Ewidat, speeches were delivered by Mustafa al-Hallaq, Salam Saad on behalf of the Municipality of Berja, and Abd Elhassan Qassim, chairman of the National Social Organization, who supervises the dispensary.
In addition, Hamada sponsored the announcement of results of the tourism and environmental survey for villages of al-Shouf al-A'la area in a celebration held by the Ministry of Immigration, the U.N. program supporting return of immigrants, and the College of Tourism
Hamada then spoke: "Reinforcing the status quo of areas to which immigrants will return is a fundamental prerequisite of any plan to make that return successful." He emphasized the need to "consider the issues of tourism and environment as a common and interactive element of tourist attraction and as a source of job opportunities for the people of the area, as well as a link and effective developmental means of communication between municipalities and organizations, whether governmental or non-governmental."
"This is particularly true in view of our desire to provide elements of economic, social, and livelihood stability for every remaining resident and every returning immigrant."
On this occasion, a mass will be held in the Mar Antonios church of al-Fawwara in the presence of a representative of Cardinal Patriarch Mar Nasralla Boutros Safeer and Sayda Marunite Parish Patron Bishop Tanius al-Khuri. Representatives of the President, Chairman of the Parliament, the Prime Minister, ministers, Social Progressive Party Leader Waleed Junbulat, MPs, and spiritual and contemporary figures will also attend the event.
The town of al-Fawwara is surrounded by Barieh to the east and Wadi al-Sitt to the west.
The Municipality Director considers that one of the most significant achievements after the war is the rebuilding of Mar Antonios Church, which is constructed on  approximately 4200 square meters in its new location. It is now considered one of the biggest and most beautiful churches in the area. Beautiful Maronite-styled architecture distinguishes the building from its surroundings. The church contains two large halls, the priest's two-story house, and a large yard of more than 2500 meters for festivals.
Cardinal George will begin his rally today from the Maronite Diocese, visiting the Mukhtara Palace before reaching al-Fawwara, where a morning meeting will be held with Cardinal George, Patriarch Khuri, and a number of figures. Al-Fawwara Municipality Director Yusif Elia and members of the municipal council will also attend the meeting.
Al-Fawwara earned its name because of its abundant water and many springs. Some people say that the name originally means "grape mill" in the Armenian language. It is 50 kilometers from Beirut. Approximately 1200 people inhabit the town and belong to the families of Elia, Tanius, Abi-Habeeb, Toma, Ra's, Mansour, Najjar, Eid, Shukr-Allah, Bishara, Fadl-Allah, Kamil, and Yusif.

The Guidance Administration of the Army Command released the following statement, "The Army Command informs citizens that army units in conjunction with Syrian naval units will hold joint drills on the Silata-Shaka shore from 9/15/2002 to 9/17/2002."
The board staff and consulting committee positions will be assigned at a later time.
The official National Media Agency reported that six members of the municipal council in Bajja held a meeting in Jubeil District President Khaleel Nasr al-Deen's office and withdrew confidence from current Municipality Director Saeed Abi-Akl, who did not attend the meeting. The six members unanimously elected Muawwad al-Khuri as the new director.
He inaugurated yesterday the Modern Management seminar organized by the Minister of State for Administrative Development Affairs in cooperation with the Civil Service Council. The seminar was held in the Royal Park hotel in Ein Sa'ada. It was directed toward senior first- and second-class administrators. It was funded by a European Union program dedicated to supporting the process of qualifying Lebanese management groups.
He also said, "It is true that changing needs is a life situation. However, our era has witnessed rapid changes that people have never imagined, and has forced people to develop new skills in order to cope with the new era, according to Toffler's hypothesis in his book 'Future Shock.' The most important skills needed are creative leadership skills to bridle and manage such changes to people's benefit."
Al- Saad added, "It is a new and continuously changing administrative environment in which economic, social, political, and technological factors and effects interlace to govern the performance and growth of societies and apply to all sectors of those societies, including the private, public, and popular sectors." (...)
"A plan to improve performance in the following ministries and organizations: finance, environment, customs, the National Employment Organization, Beirut Water Authority..."
He also said, "You are required to build the administration of the future. Those who refuse to change will go with the wind."
Lebanon's Memo to Annan; Mahmoud Hammoud
"Lebanon is keen on clarifying this issue."
"The quantity of water that Lebanon uses since the liberation is approximately 7 million cubic meters annually. This is an extremely inadequate quantity and does not meet the normal needs of the area's inhabitants, according to international laws and customs and the provisions of the Agreement on Utilization of International Waterways for Non-Navigational Purposes, which gave Lebanon the right to secure the social and economic needs of the inhabitants of the al-Hasibani and al-Wazzani River valleys."
"The statements of Israeli officials to launch war against Lebanon threaten  international peace and security. The aftermath of this situation will be the responsibility of Israel, who never stops pushing the situation toward increasing tension, ignoring Lebanon's determined wish to maintain peace, calm, and stability, while continuously demanding the liberation of the rest of its occupied lands."
"Al-Diyar" Resumes Publication on Tuesday; Al-Ereidi Expresses Hope in Government's Attempts: TV Stations Paid 60% of the Charges
"I used all the time given in order to submit a comprehensive and detailed report."
"For that, we asked every organization to send us a letter containing their remarks. It appeared from the figures set by the National Media Council for the charges that there were some errors."
"On the other hand, some of them have different circumstances."
Yesterday, the relics of St. Teresa Jesus the Child entered the North from the coast that opened the gates, passing by Maniea and Tripoli, to arrive at Kobayat, which was waiting anxiously for the caravan; a public reception took place at the town plaza. The Caravan then advanced to Mar Doumit Monastery for Carmelite Fathers, which shall host the mortal remains until next Thursday.
He said: "As I know, Al-Karmel monastery is one of the fortified Carmelite monasteries, where the person who enters can never go out, and meeting others or outsiders is done behind the speaker bars."
He added: "If we want to give meaning to the anniversary of the Cross, we would find that it lies in the profound love of Christ for human beings, and that is what the great St. Teresa Jesus the Child has told when she found that the real meaning of her life lies in love and true love, sincere, away from all exaggeration, and that there is a simple way to sainthood, which is great love, when she said: 'My call is love, and in the heart of my mother the church, I will be love.'"
"And you are invited to scream to the rest of the youth: man is loved by God."

"If all newspapers close down, it will be a very valuable present to the rulers to mix up the case and pass their requirements."
"Whenever we talk about dialog, they try to shoot it down and make some believe that there are battles to win ground and points."
He noted, "Due to concerns that the MTV issue might be blurred,"
Now that it has become imperative for hundreds of administrative officials to prove the integrity of their financial books, we can start expecting more sound accounts in the future.
"While the revenues of our transmission section are declining, we have exerted all possible efforts to reap every dollar we can from transmission hours that the mother company stole from the public."
"At the television level, we managed to flood the market with more ridiculous ancient programs."
"We have reduced the number of producers and researchers, as well as those who still yearn to practice true journalism."
"we guarantee them the freedom of choice"
"In this context, we are wondering if we can convince some stars to assume temporary surnames when we are about to launch a new movie. You cannot imagine how large a profit we can make if we manage to make a deal with Julia 'Marlboro' Roberts, for example!"
"On the Internet, we endeavored to compensate partially for the low revenues by filling people's screens with surprise commercials and other abominable pictures."
"It would be better to improve the commercial budget for Tom Clancy's next book (or whoever he hires to write 'his new book' for him) than placing any bets on valuable literary books written by totally obscure authors."
"As we proceed toward a new and daring world of media, we are confident that the best awaits tomorrow."
"Fortunately for us, the 'Federal Collusion Gang' answers all our requests positively nowadays."
Moreover, these "emergencies" often result from continuous deterioration in social and economic situations, as well as general irresponsibility and lack of discipline (what we usually call the human factor).

Fifty Years After Dividing Palestine (1947-1997)
In fact, one might need a fly's brain or less to deny that some people in the West deliberately distort the image of Arabs and Muslims.
The draft, which stipulates payment of 3 billion and 450 million Deutsche Marks- worth of manufactured products to Israel, was initialed in The Hague today.
The Front also considers that the act of dismissing the prime minister then appointing ministers without the head of state making any consultations and without the ministers themselves knowing, followed by the announcement that this government is only a transitory one that will rule temporarily in isolation from the Parliament, whose agenda might be altered as long as this government exists, is a constitutional transgression and a violation of parliamentary traditions by the President, as well as a reduction of the powers of the legislative authority, which exclusively represents the people's sovereignty.
In fact, one might need a fly's brain or less to deny that some people in the West deliberately distort the image of Arabs and Muslims.
But this is not indicated in their numerous articles, which are loaded with suggestions to boycott the world that "only bears enmity for us."
Mrs. Valace took a view of the terrorists of al-Qaeda and some fundamentalist groups as explicit representatives of what is going on in the Arab and Islamic societies. She made many final judgments on these societies. However, this did not prevent those criticizing Arab writers from attributing her grudged judgments to the West and its racism, and taking her opinions as outweighing evidence that  Westerners hate us. In doing so, they ignored the objections with which Mrs. Valace's opinions were met among large sectors of people of western culture. As such, they (the Arab writers) and Valace seemed to belong to the same school of thought, which takes societies as a single whole, with every speaking person representing the spirit of the entire nation.
But apart from Dr. Barakat and other Arab figures who are able to differentiate between Zionism and Judaism and insist on the political aspect of the Arab-Israeli conflict, an organization such as Mimri, which was established especially to distort the image of Arabs and Muslims and emphasize the Zionist view of the Arab- Israeli conflict as based on Muslim hatred rather than on political aspects such as occupation of land, does not find itself frequently obliged to repeat what it did with Dr. Barakat, namely corruption. This is because it has an abundance of available Arab articles that do not stop at confusing Zionism and Judaism, but also refer to many non-Semitic myths, with which we find neither a link to the existing conflict nor any relevance that might serve the cause by mentioning and repeating them.
According to the importance of the two events, we present them successively, starting with the encounter or confrontation between Matisse (1869-1954) and Picasso (1881-1973), as the gallery includes about 160 works of art from both of them.
His portrait "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon" (1907) marks his start of cubism, which he developed with the close participation of Braque.
In 1937, he painted "Guernica" after the destruction of the small village in Basque by German air force bombardment during the Spanish civil war.
Throughout the twentieth century, he left his mark in the arts.
His interests focused on neo-impressionism, and that is clear in his portrait "Luxury, Tranquility and Delight" (1904), where his colors became brighter.
He searched for a way to express space, as in his portrait "Lesson in Music" (1916).
It is worth mentioning that a museum named after him was inaugurated in his hometown Le Cateau and another in Cimiez.

He prepared the morning coffee for himself and his wife, leaving on her skin a "look of life" that was a bit overdue.
She closed her book quickly with fear.
She saw the girl returning to her bed.
He was late.
Their little girl was running like a rabbit whose mother has not taught it yet how to jump and leap.
We went away from him.
She ran to him, and he put in her palm a fig: "It is for your mom."
They continued; and he walked behind them, his steps burdened with the past and future consequences. Three of his sons intend to travel abroad.
They went away.
He spent the night and the day.
"Search for me in the game of life and across time."
She left her grief to be treated by songs of a long trip.
Three U.S. military bases were attacked with missiles in east Afghanistan last weekend. The U.N. moved its planes from the capital Kabul to U.S. military command headquarters at Bagram air base due to security threats. The move took place on the same day the Afghan authorities had reopened the airport for air traffic after closing it last Saturday for security reasons.
Although Azhar was defeated in the elections, his party won 77 out of 272 seats in the National Assembly.
After the army of Cote d'Ivoire had failed to recapture the city of Bouake last week and after the fall of the "Cocoa Capital" Daloa to the rebels, they (the rebels) are now taking control politically and militarily and have stopped negotiations aimed at reaching a cease fire. Moreover, they are repeating their demands for President Laurent Gbagbo to resign his post, and they have threatened to seize the commercial capital, Abidjan.
Yesterday morning, inhabitants mentioned intensive exchange of gunfire in the southern outskirts of Daloa city. One of them mentioned heavy artillery battles in the south, as well as the continuous sound of gunfire.

Israeli Minister of Defense Benjamin Ben-Eliezir warned yesterday that a large-scale operation in the Gaza Strip could turn into a "hell."
Washington had accused Kuchma in late September of personally approving the sale of four "Kolchuga" radar units to Iraq for a hundred million dollars, violating U.N.-imposed sanctions on Iraq.
Minister of Information Muhammad Affash recently stated that Arab army units will participate in the exercises, including units from Jordan and United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.).
London Suspends Parliament and Government Functions In Northern Ireland; for the Fourth Time
He announced the appointment of two British Labor Party MPs in his cabinet, Angela Smith and Ian Pearson, to assume responsibility for the Northern Ireland bodies formed according to the peace pact.
British and Irish Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern said they were "extremely affected" by this step. However, they confirmed in a joint statement that the decision protected the coalition government from inevitable collapse.
It is noteworthy that there are four people, among whom is a senior assistant to one of the Sinn Fein MPs, behind bars waiting to be tried on charges of espionage and stealing files from Reed's office. The files are said to have contained details of potential I.R.A. targets, as well as recordings of conversations between the British and Northern Ireland parties.
The rebels told the International Radio of France that they achieved a massive victory by seizing Daloa, which is known for cultivating cocoa. All cocoa shipments to Abidjan have to pass through Daloa to be prepared for export. They also confirmed that they are now in a position allowing them to march toward Abidjan.
The tension affected international cocoa prices. The price per ton for next March delivery went up to 2340 Euros. That is the highest rate in 22 years.
He repeated demands for Gbagbo's unconditional resignation.
He revealed that he had warned France of the growing influence of the Burkina Faso government on some Cote d'Ivoire soldiers, but his warnings were not taken seriously at that time.
Moussa: Not a Single Arab Soldier will Participate in an American Military Action Against Iraq; Kuwait, Syria, and Egypt
He explained, "Arab diplomacy and the Arab League played a decisive role in Iraq's acceptance of the return of international inspectors," believing that "this is considered an achievement and a huge contribution that has led to many consequences so far."
Doha had previously announced that it will take into consideration an American request to use al-Udaid military air base, where 2000 U.S. soldiers are currently stationed, and more reinforcements are expected.
It added that the expected war in Iraq "is a war for oil and cheap energy supplies. The Americans are keen to establish a foothold in Iraq, which possesses the largest oil reserve in the world."
About one thousand students of Islamic tendency demonstrated inside the Ain Shams University campus in protest against the American policy toward Iraq.
Yemeni Foreign Minister Abu-Bakr al-Qurbi said, "This summit was dedicated to supporting regional security, particularly the tension that looms over the relations of the three states with Eritrea. (...) However, this summit is not intended to be against Eritrea, rather it is aimed at easing tensions and reinforcing the region's security and stability."
Al-Basheer and Zeinawi will head today to Kenya to participate in a conference on Somali reconciliation under the sponsorship of EIGAD, which includes Sudan, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, and Uganda.
A regional observer, who spoke under condition of anonymity, expressed his view that there are three promising factors that were not present before: "First, Kenya is assuming a neutral position regarding Somalia," in reference to Djibouti's support for one of the factions and Ethiopia's support for the Somali Council for Reconciliation and Construction.
Sudan Liberation People's Army spokesman Samson Kuaji stated, "The signing was delayed due to the background of the truce's wording."

We are not dealing in illusions here. The Francophone summit will not succeed in what the U.N., the Security Council, and nearly all the countries of the world have failed to do, which is rationalize the American impulsiveness to establish the empire of military and economic power, which at the end will be equivalent to the "Empire of Absolute Evil."
Even if the summit does not utter a single political word, its convention under the political line being drawn by Paris in the international relations board, particularly within the framework of legitimacy as represented by the U.N., represents a political attestation for the age and how it should be.
The summit is also being held at an extremely crucial spot of the regional geographical domain that is represented as "terrorism" combating the military operations field in American statements and plans.
If the Middle East and Arab Gulf area represents the American battlefield that is currently being heated up for launching an attack on Iraq, which will be the start of an earthquake of unpredictable consequences, then, on the other hand, holding the Francophone summit in Baghdad on a background of explicit and full opposition to such an American strike and on a background of the most explicit and strict French objection that has reached the point of talking about using the "veto" right in the Security Council to prevent the United States from obtaining a resolution giving it an automatic right to attack Iraq, in itself acquires historical significance, even if Washington pays no attention (and it will not pay any attention) to the content of the forthcoming Francophone "Beirut Declaration."
Israeli press highlighted yesterday Ariel Sharon's expected visit to Washington and  talks he is to hold with U.S. President George Bush.
Bush will show a U.S. understanding "of the internal Israeli public opinion pressures, but he will explain to Sharon the importance of Israeli self-control."
"In return, Sharon is demanding a formula that would approve Israeli self-defense if attacked and give it the freedom to act."
"The ministry also believes the Israeli Hits missile network is the ideal response to Iraqi missiles, and there is no need to deploy American Patriot missile batteries, as was done in the 1991 Gulf War. (...) Senior U.S. officials informed their Israeli counterparts last week that they intend to occupy Iraq for a long period of time, and that changing the regime in Baghdad will omit one enemy from Israel's list of enemies, but other enemies could be provoked by the idea that they might be the next target. According to what they say, the issue will open the door for new possibilities."
However, it has been clear for a month that there is a failure in preparations for the Paris 2 conference, which was due to be held last year. Al-Hariri is dedicating a lot of his time and effort to prepare the proper atmosphere for holding the conference during the current year.
The Lebanese prime minister has been performing his role on the same front.
He also visited a number of economically influential countries to convince them to respond to Lebanese needs.
It seems from the communications and meetings he conducted recently that his success in making Paris 2 an occasion to announce the results hoped from it might not be too far away.
The first obstacle is the United States waging a war against President Saddam Hussein's Iraq before the end of the current year.
All of them agree that it is impossible for U.S. President George Bush to start the war against Iraq before the Congressional elections early next November are finished, in order to avoid being accused by his people of utilizing it to the benefit of his Republican party.
This must be respected to avoid provoking Muslims, who are already provoked because of the Palestinian issue, and because of what Muslims consider to be an American war against them, regardless whether they are right or not.
And also because Syria, the most influential country in Lebanon, sees no alternative to al-Hariri at the moment and considers that his leaving office and the ensuing economic crisis will cause extensive damage and that it might be targeted by them.
A Shrill Francophone Voice
However, the summit will remain in the dictionary of international politics a unique occasion for the voice of reason against madness. It is also the summit of logic against rashness, the summit of adherence to international laws against the one magnet world, and the summit preserving the values of justice, participation, and responsibility at the edge of exclusivity that imposes upon all others the principle of voluntary or involuntary affiliation with the "Empire."
To elaborate further, the summit is being held at the crossroads of a new American strategy that does not only attempt to sketch a new world, but also very nearly to  announce that it wants that world annexed to it as an obedient ally, a subdued enemy, or a mercenary carrying out orders.
That is the slogan that opens the door to the establishment of the "American Empire."
Undoubtedly, the Francophone states group's voice will rise from Beirut in parallel with the Arab States group's voice to call for giving international legitimacy, through the inspection team, the right to handle the issue of Iraqi arms, and for urging a return to negotiations to find a solution for the Palestinian issue in such a way as to stop Ariel Sharon's continuous investment of America beating on the drums of war against "terrorism" to the benefit of the open massacre he is carrying out against the Palestinians... and against the American interests in the region!
The five-page statement dated October 12 did not include direct claim of responsibility for the two attacks that it said had come with the start of American strikes against Afghanistan. It represents a clear "and strong message to all enemies and friends alike that the mujahideen have not been discouraged, weakened, or subdued, because of what they have suffered for the sake of Allah (GOD)."
It mentioned, "The political bureau [of al-Qaeda] will issue two separate statements for the two operations and their indications."
It also noted that "U.S. invading forces in Afghanistan are now starting to sink in the Afghani marsh... and that the consequences of the American occupation of Afghanistan will not be any better than those faced by the Soviet occupation."
Gunshots targeted the U.S. forces in Kuwait yesterday. It was the second armed attack of its kind within a week in the Emirate of Kuwait. A few days ago the tiny Arab Emirate dismantled an extreme cell affiliated with the al-Qaeda organization, following the killing of an American Marine on the island of Failaka last Tuesday.
However, an American official who refused to mention his name responded that the concerned U.S. forces have "no doubts" that the shots were targeting them.
The Kuwaiti Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Army, in cooperation with the Ministry of Interior, are investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident.
U.S. forces are currently conducting joint maneuvers under the name "Spring Desert" with the Kuwaiti army in the northern desert of Kuwait. In spite of last week's incidents, a U.S. military spokesman said that U.S. forces still feel comfortable in the Emirate and denied that they are close to feeling they have become targets for attacks.
The "New York Times" newspaper quoted last week that the Head of Information Department in the Ministry of Justice and Islamic Affairs Muhammad al-Mileifi expressed his sympathy with the September 11 attacks against the United States, and he described himself as "close to al-Qaeda beliefs." Al-Mileifi was accused of working against Kuwaiti interests.
Summit Preparatory Meetings Launched, Francophone Council Discusses Agenda
After praising once again the "excellent" preparations for the Beirut Summit, which he described as "one of the most successful so far," he said that Lebanon, by hosting this event and the Arab Summit before it, is being resurrected from the ashes like a phoenix."
"An agreement was made regarding procedures that will be required of the Francophone Organization to contribute to settling the aggravated disagreement."
"- It has been decided to participate in the 2004 celebrations for the 200th independence anniversary of Haiti, which was the first Black republic."
Ghali did not wish to give further details on the decisions to be made in the coming meetings, because the recommendations that were submitted yesterday are likely to change in the ministerial meeting or the presidential summit.
He said, "Only ten years ago, Switzerland became a member of the Francophone Organization, because the major language in this country is German, not French."
Paris - "Al-Nahar:"
"We believe in international cultural values that Francophonism is spreading in the world, and we consider them to be a motive for peoples of Francophone states to live under freedom, justice, equality, democracy, and development. In Lebanon, we are proud of these values, but at the same time we are concerned that the authority hosting the Summit in Beirut may attempt to impose its own values on the conferees. Such values do not agree with the Francophone."
"Fourth: There is no freedom of press or speech in Lebanon, in spite of some signs of resistance against tyranny and injustice. Violent suppression of peaceful demonstrations is the norm. Closing media stations and brandishing the threat of closure at the rest of the media is a policy used by the authority and the Syrians to repress the Lebanese."
"Seventh: The Lebanese system of accord between its multicultural communities, which was described by the Pope as the example, the model, and the mission, is gradually disappearing in favor of the single party system and of eliminating co-existence with no respect for the rights of groups. Stalin-like suppression has become extremely obvious, and you have the documents. (...)"
In addition, he announced the idea of holding "a conference for the Christians in the Arab world to defend Iraq."
"On one hand, the American preparations to attack Iraq make Washington exercise political pressure on Israel to avoid opening a front with Lebanon. On the other hand, the existing Palestinian front inside Israel prevents the Israeli army from opening another front."
He also said, "Muslims have started to send messages of anger through violent operations all around the world."
He said, "The greatest danger does not lie in military war, but rather in the religious war that the United States is being dragged into by adopting the Israeli view, which wants to transform the war against terrorism into a war against Islam. This leads to a rift between the Christian West and the Islamic Orient that will mark human development in the third millennium."
Paris Mass Commemorates October 13
Said told the attendees, "Big projects require tears and sacrifices and even dying for them. The project of the salvation of mankind leads our God to exaltation and the Cross; the salvation of Lebanon our homeland and the people will require self-sacrifice. It will result in leaving one's homeland and loss of one's freedom."
"We won't be less determined or less patriotic in defending our homeland, which has existed since the dawn of recorded history and has made well-known achievements across civilizations, starting with the alphabet to the anchors of civilization, to the greatest leader known to history-Hannibal, son of our land, to Fakhr al-Deen our compatriot and founder of our state and our guide to freedom and national unity for which he died (...) In this day that has witnessed a great number of martyrs and misfortune to our nation and was a reason to continue exalting, I can only praise the willfulness of our heroes and express our heartfelt hopes that a new dawn of freedom is coming soon, and I will say these verses:"
"When the chains have broken"
Lahud Welcomes al-Mur, Hoffnanian, and Bahia al-Hareeri; Saudi Arabia Backs the Nomination of Karam for WHO Presidency
Karam said that he "found all of them very supportive of nominating Lebanon."
"However, Arab unanimity in supporting Lebanon's nomination will have maximum effect in international political circles."
Al-Hareeri said, "Delivery of such a message will have a great impact on the discussions of the Women's Summit. It will also reflect the concerns of the Summit President with Arab women's role through their dealing with public affairs."
During the meeting, the recent developments related to the issue of al-Wazzani spring water were discussed.
The President informed the international delegate "that Lebanon places extreme importance on the efforts exerted by the U.N. to prove its right to use part of its share of al-Wazzani waters."
After the meeting, Rod-Larsen spoke to reporters and said, "I have just met with my dear friend, President Emil Lahud."
"At this time, I have no comments."
"I have just met with my friend, Prime Minister al-Hareeri. We discussed general issues related to the Middle East and particularly the situations looming over the area that are not specifically relevant to Lebanon."
The international delegate also visited Parliament Chairman Nabeeh Berri in the Parliament.
"I will go to New York to meet with the Secretary General, and I will also meet with others in the areas that are involved with this issue to discuss it."
He said that this policy "explicitly means that the U.S. President sees through his mirror the people he wants or does not want, and this applies to President Saddam Hussein."
"Resorting to military force to achieve a certain goal is unacceptable."
With regard to the Syrian presence in Lebanon, the parliament chairman emphasized, "the role performed by the Syrian army in Lebanon was necessary," indicating that "such presence comes under the framework of Lebanese strategic benefit."
Mentioning the issue of al-Wazzani water, Berri emphasized that "beginning to pump al-Wazzani water will practically and officially start as scheduled. Lebanon will never change that timing." He denied that Lebanon chose that date to coincide with French President Jacque Chirac's visit and the start of the Francophonic Summit.
He also formed a Lebanese-Senegal parliamentary friendship committee.
The visit of French President Jacque Chirac the day after tomorrow bears particular significance, as it comes among crucial and sensitive circumstances at the internal and regional levels.
He will then launch the INA as he previously launched the ISA (Higher Business School) in 1998. Those two institutions are important for young Lebanese men and women to receive higher education in Lebanon, instead of going to France.
2 - Al-Wazzani water and Chirac's personal intervention in supporting Lebanon's natural right to benefit from the spring's water and his condemning of Israeli threats.
They also mentioned that Chirac is exerting diplomatic pressure to prevent Israel from attacking the new facilities in any way on the pretext that Lebanon has no right to utilize them. Military reports received in the Elysée Palace regarding the Israeli muscle-flexing in southern Lebanon and particularly above the new al-Wazzani facilities raise concern, although the Lebanese workshop was not affected by the intimidation desired by Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his military leadership over Lebanon to stop the workshop. U.S. diplomacy had tried to persuade Lebanese officials to do so, to no avail.
4- The Palestinian-Israeli situation and its gravity in view of the failure of international efforts to stop the killings and resistance operations, the continued Israeli siege, the silence regarding Israel's assassination of resistance movement officials including civilians among whom are children and women, and the destruction of houses and property.
They expected that U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan would assign to Rod-Larsen the task of shuttling between Lebanon and Israel to settle the dispute over al-Wazzani water and to return to New York to agree with Annan on the suggestions and required steps to move toward Lebanon.
Giving congratulations for "holding the Francophone Summit in an Arab country for the first time," it expressed hope that the summit will not only represent a guarantee for Lebanese authorities, who are criticized for their measures and practices in the area of human rights.
He stressed, "It is necessary for the Summit to make tangible decisions with regard to the serious and collective violations of human rights or the banning of democracy and threats of banning it, such as what is happening in Cote d'Ivoire or in the Great Lakes area, in addition to strict positions with regard to the Near East and Iraq."
She also mentioned the martial courts, "the presence of which is unjustifiable in a democratic country,"
He directed an acknowledgement of gratitude to the organizations "defending human rights, liberties, and democracy at the expense of their own freedom and the safety of their members."
Al-Diman-"Al-Nahar":
After reading the Bible, the Archbishop preached, calling to strengthen the faith and encouraging the practice clerics to plant the seeds of faith, fear of God, and virtue in the hearts of people around them, and said: "It is a great joy today in the region, our beloved region, as four young men continue today to devote themselves to serve the Lord Jesus in serving people."
"It saw off a good plowman who devoted himself to cultivate the land of the region, and seed the good in its fertile soil, then beautiful plantings grew and embellished the church, Church of Lebanon, and the Church of Overseas with wheat grains gathered on time, ground, kneaded, and of which Hosts are made and offered on God's Altar for the salvation of the believers."
"It was an extraordinary event and a huge continuous manifestation in each city and village, as she, upon visiting, blessed our region and families for the region to remain the land of sainthood and families to be centers and schools for faith, and for always giving us a mission such as the ones we are sanctifying today."
Minister of Culture Ghassan Salama welcomed them.
"Several Francophone summits have been held previously, but I am expecting many important things from the summit that will be held in Lebanon, particularly since the Secretary General of the Francophone Organization, Dr. Boutros Ghali, has supervised several summits, and today he came ahead of us to Lebanon after visiting the offices of the Francophone Organization in Monaco."
Prime Minister Bumaya said, "As you know, Rwanda is a prominent Francophone member and had a distinguished and vital role in the previous summits. We respect and appreciate the Francophone family, and today we see that Lebanon is a distinguished Arab country to host this summit. We will cooperate culturally to intensify the dialog of civilizations, and we will endeavor to have this summit radiate Lebanon's prominent role in civilization."
Canadian Francophone Affairs Minister Denis Paradie was accompanied by the Cultural Attaché.
Honorary Consul in Lebanon Ara Fanilian received them.
Honorary Consul in Lebanon George Fernini received him.
Cape Verde Foreign Ministry First Undersecretary Mrs. Fatima Veiga was accompanied by the Cape Verde President's advisor. Cape Verde Consul General Boulos Tayi and Dr. George Brax received them.

After the meeting, Galloway emphasized the Lebanese people's right to complete the liberation of what remains of their land and to protect their water resources and said, "It was obvious that Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1978 aimed at stealing Al-Litani water," indicating, "Lebanon will meet any Israeli attack against its water resources with resistance."
Galloway then visited Al-Rashidia camp, where he met PLO and "Fatah" Movement Factions Secretary Sultan Abul-Enein.
"Every day, I enter the room and see what some have written"
"Sykes-Picot was a true disaster for the Arabs. Palestine was torn up into four directions in the world. They made Israel an international super power. A century of indignity has passed. The question to Arabs is: Will you accept a second Sykes-Picot?"
"If their absence continues, they will face a new threat."
Abul-Enein then spoke and thanked Galloway "The great friend of Palestine and its cause" and said, "We are in need of this strong voice from a friend of the Palestinian people. As I told my friend a moment ago, we are people filled with sorrow because we saw in your country 500 thousand demonstrators in solidarity with Palestine and Iraq, while the Arab street is in a coma."
Akar-"al-Nahar":
Members of the civil defense, army, and internal security forces are making immense efforts in a desperate attempt to control the fire, while clouds of thick smoke cover the region's skies.
While commending the efforts of army, internal security forces, and civil defense personnel, the crowds appealed to the ministries of interior and defense to send additional reinforcements to the area, particularly helicopters and personnel to expedite combating the fire in the rarest forest in Lebanon, where some of the trees are 500 years old.
It also extended to minefields, where 40 landmines detonated.
Crisis of Reducing UNRWA's Services Looms
They blamed the Agency Director in Lebanon, Alferio Metthio, for the aggravated situations of refugees due to the policy of injustice and neglect he has followed since he assumed office.
Elham's problem is identical to that of Subhia Jabir al-Tahhan, who was also stripped of her ration card. She says, "My children are orphans and cannot benefit from anything. They also dare not move from one area to another and are banned from work."
Amal Zubayda talked about her children's suffering in education and health. "Until now, my children have no books or stationery."
"I hold Metthio fully responsible for the deterioration of our condition."
"We are dying and cannot do anything."
al-Wazzani-"al-Nahar":
Qublan then presented medals to "everyone who worked to make the dream come true."
Regarding cost, he said: "It is priceless."
Russian Ambassador Boris Bolotine inspected the spring basin and the facilities constructed around it. He was accompanied by the designer of the project, engineer Mazin Ramadan, and a security escort.
He then made the following statement: "It is important to us to form an accurate perception of this problem. As it is known, Russia is exerting efforts with other international parties in order to contribute to finding a solution for the water issue in this area."
And does his country support Lebanon in implementing this project?
Concurrent with the visit, five Israeli military vehicles were standing by in the street overlooking the spring from the occupied Syrian town of al-Ghajar to observe what was happening. Five Israeli officers were seen carrying maps and pointing with their hands towards the al-Wazzani basin.
The spring was also inspected by European Union water expert Walter Maziti, who took photographs of the spring and the newly constructed facilities.
It is still too early to judge the results of Prime Minister Rafeek Al-Hareeri's visits to Malaysia and Japan as part of the tour he intends to make in Asia, Europe, and the Gulf area to invite donor states to participate in the Paris 2 conference, on the premise that these visits are part of preparations for the conference and to explain Lebanon's reasons for inviting these states to participate and to request them in particular to support Lebanon's efforts to solve the problem of growing general debts and deficit. This will be based on a detailed presentation prepared by the Ministry of Finance, which the prime minister uses to explain the government's policy at the economic and financial levels, and the procedures it will carry out or has carried out so far to reduce the deficit and amortize part of the debt service.
What reinforces the positive impression with which Al-Hareeri returned from his visit to Japan and Malaysia, and which he was keen to report to the president and the chairman of parliament before returning to Beirut, according to governmental circles, is a number of indications the prime minister had gathered during the trip and through its preceding communications with a number of officials and appointed ambassadors in Lebanon as a part of conference preparations. Those indicators reinforce the chance of his success unless a pressing development takes place, such as the American strike against Iraq. Those indications can be summarized as follows:
- Undeclared U.S. support for the conference that was observed in lateral communications by high-ranking officials in the U.S. administration with the Japanese prime minister before Al-Hareeri's arrival in Tokyo to promote Lebanese efforts exerted to make the conference successful.
The government reinforced its view with a detailed representation of the country's economic and financial situations and the financial results that will be achieved by the aid. This was presented to the donor states, along with an overview of the options that specify the type of aid, which was determined according to each country's particulars and was divided into three categories: deposits, facilitated loans, or Treasury bond subscriptions. Also presented was an enumeration of incentives and benefits to be reaped by these countries through their assistance to Lebanon, particularly in terms of the profits applicable in Lebanon compared to international rates.
The Lebanese Industrialists Society launched yesterday a media and advertising campaign in cooperation with the Ministry of Industry, carried out by "/" company, aimed at gaining consumer confidence in Lebanese products, building long-term loyalty for them, and sending a message that the products are competitive in terms of quality and variety and that Lebanese exports will contribute to the progress of national economy and will make new job opportunities available.
"1- Gaining consumer confidence in Lebanese products."
"Following that, there will be a second campaign that will address emotion and reason to encourage the Lebanese consumer to buy Lebanese products, then a third campaign that will focus on the issue of the environment and its importance. This will be an awareness campaign to encourage recycling under the slogan 'productive industry for a better environment.'"
The campaign film was shown on a large screen, along with broadcasting a radio advertisement for the campaign. Also presented were advertising posters that will be widely posted in streets and that have the following titles: "Our Lebanese Industries Are Quality Imported Worldwide," "Exports of Our Lebanese Industry Improve Trade Balance," and "Lebanese Exports Spread around the World."
This event comes under the slogan of the "Overlapping Views Beirut - Paris" exhibitions organized by the French Cultural Center and the Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts (ALBA).
The High National Institute in Lui Lumiere developed the photographic copies.
From these considerations and based on these archaeological sites and the findings therein, in addition to other areas, all of which are anchored in historical, social, ethnic, religious, cultural, and art sources, the students compiled the unique of the successive civilizations to present them as photographic reporting that highlights Beirut's historical, geographical, and archaeological role in the area.
The photographic approach is multifaceted and complimentary.
Between the bank and El-Saraya roads lie the Roman baths that go back to a hundred years B.C. They were photographed by Reema Hishaim, Nimat Khair-Allah, Darine Zeidan, and Danial Khattar.
Various elements, of which the most seductive are the musical accompaniment to the dance, are seductive in the show titled "Awaiting the other" (*), leaving behind a long strong impact, upon the end of the last scene, in the eyes of the audience who experienced, during the fifty-minute show performed by the team of the French choreographer Michel Halette Ygayane in Abdel Kader School in Beirut, progressive feelings: partiality, concentration, delight, to some wondering, confusion, and boredom, then a kind of unconditional conciliation with Yetsashoy's audio-visual developments while performing attractive and restless rhythms.
Number of volumes: 1
A historical and artistic event covering the life in Lebanon from the political, literary, architectural, artistic, athletic, and social aspects over a hundred years of constant events, year after year, in more than 1500 pictures with labels in both Arabic and French.
All of them took the traditional photos during a period between February and April 2002, and collected the necessary documents, wrote the texts, and selected the best shots.
Within this framework, the selected subjects had an important cultural significance, especially since the excavations taking place downtown were very rich for whoever desired to show the civilization's wealth characterizing our capital, which witnessed successive historical periods.
The boy has two curls to which all the story was related as he is blond with a dirty face and uncircumcised (was not circumcised as in the Muslim tradition).
"Awaiting the Other" is a title inspired by the discussion of the Mediterranean cultures from which Michel Halette Ygyanne has been quoting since long ago, the topics he discussed in collusion with artists from countries of which memory is confused in this wide, colored, black-white civilization, i.e., in the Mediterranean Sea.
The dancers' performance acquires a double expressive elegance at the moment when this performance meets the spoken vocabulary flying in the space of the place and seem to grant the bodies' obedience and other features as coquetry, flexibility, femininity, and that lightness showing the moves of the four female dancers like a wheat spike touched by the breeze.
The links between the performers is restricted to similar moves and steps, probably according to the choreographer's wish to give a strong inspiration through the absolute adhesion between Gilgamesh, who is seeking, for his affection to Ankido, a human fate similar to that of Ankido, who is dying.
The music starts to play as waterfalls sound, then the rhythms go higher with folkloric resources and current changes as a result of continuous experiments realized by Jean Christophe Desire and Serge Folly.
The costumes match the bodies' flexibility, particularly the women's, and responding to the meanings of the events, which are horizontally told and vertically inspired and do not repeat as a summary.
One Drowned and One Strangled; Addoum Circular For Completing Assignment Coordinates; Consideration Of Oun's Lawsuit Vs. Al-Herawi Postponed; Madi Completes MTV File Investigations, Justice Palace Delegate, and MTV Assault in Suburb Against Electricity Employees; Common Transport Buses Burning Attempt; Various Incidents in Ein Al-Helwa
Part of the circular read:
Beirut Senior Magistrate Hatem Madi finalized his investigations into the public prosecution against the MTV television station, the editor of the "Poll" program, Ziyad Naheim, and the station officer in charge of the program.
He declined to attend to other witnesses who were guests or contacted the program by telephone during its broadcast.
Clarification was due.
He reported that the car that was passing through the area and threw the bottles after igniting them was a green Mercedes 230.
But Beirut Attorney General Afeef Al-Hakim recommended keeping Ali detained for investigation until today.
Adham S. J.
It expressed regret for "the continuation of the official Lebanese approach, which is always trying to deny the presence of Lebanese detainees in Syrian prisons, in spite of all the proofs and evidence, and even of confessions."
"Syrian authorities have also not contacted the families committee to verify the submitted information."
"Such positions do not help solve the issue."
"The awkwardness sensed by Lebanese authorities toward Syrian authorities with regard to the detainees issue is much less than the awkwardness toward the unhealed wound that causes hundreds of Lebanese families severe heartache."
The current problem is to secure 14,000 U.S. dollars required to cover the two surgeries.
Some of the demonstrators say, "A number of hospitals refused to admit Muhammad Ali before securing money."
"But he is in danger and needs two surgeries to treat his fractures."
"But we are not in a position to provide financial coverage for such health emergencies."
"We are currently awaiting a response regarding available means of aid in this case."
She responded, "I hope he does not die."
"In case the Commissioner's Office does not respond to our legitimate request, it will bear full legal, moral, and humanitarian responsibility for the health condition of our son, Assad."
"Examination revealed that he suffered a skull fracture and brain hemorrhage, as well as a fracture in the right thigh bone."
"He has started to regain consciousness without the need for the artificial respiration system."
Honor Celebrations for Pupils in Districts; Fattoush: Lebanon is Suffering Political Malaria; Al-Awzai
The honored pupils' speech was delivered by pupil Muhammad Ayyoub of Al-Imam Al-Hassan Secondary school, while the parents councils' speech was delivered by Zaynab Bakr.
He wondered, "How can this government ask employees and teachers to work afternoons, while it is complaining of the surplus?"
The Islamic Business Administration College-Akkar Branch affiliated with Al-Imam Al-Awzai University celebrated the graduation of the first wave of its Bachelors students in Northern Lebanon. It was a gathering with the graduates and their families in the plaza of the University branch in Akkar and was attended by its staff.
The board of delegates of the League of Lebanese University Full-Time Professors rejected parts of the budget bill and emphasized the legitimacy of their demands to restore the authority of the University Council and to legitimize representative councils.
"2- Absolute refusal of rescinding the University Professors' Cooperative Fund through the cooperative funds recommendation project in various sectors and refusal of the proposed reduction in the fund's budget."
"The board of directors asserted the priority of accomplishing reform in the university at various levels."
"2- Develop a new law for full-time employment that will take the university out of the current law with all its confusion and infringements."
"c- Authorization of the executive board:"
With the criticisms of Turkish Foreign Minister Sina Gorel, whose term in office has expired, by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's plan to unify Cyprus, basically aimed at "pushing toward application" of the European Union's scheme to admit the island to its membership, Turkish army Chief of Staff General Helmi Uzkok warned the European organization that a unilateral decision regarding admission of Cyprus to the Union might raise a regional crisis.
The European Union says that it prefers to admit a unified island. However, it announced that it might agree to admit the southern half if no settlement is made.
He noted that the U.N. scheme "imposes a final period of time to allow Cyprus (which is internationally recognized and represented by Greek Cypriots) to join the European Union without trouble, but it does not solve the existing problems."
He said, "It is not yet time to set a time to start membership negotiations."
"Terrorism must be condemned regardless of its source."
Afghani police opened fire Monday evening and Tuesday morning at thousands of demonstrators who gathered in protest of their poor studying conditions in the university campus, where they said there has been no electricity or heat for days.
Afghan President Hamid Karzai expressed his "sorrow" for this tragedy and criticized the police for firing at the students. He demanded an inquiry to determine who was responsible.
It explained, "Representatives of the organization spoke to witnesses who said that the police beat the students in the university housing and threatened at the hospital some of those who were injured." Reporters were denied access to Kabul Hospital, where those are being treated.
Milak lies between Baluchestan and the Afghan state of Nimruz, where there are confrontations between local Afghan leaders. It is one of two border passage points between the two countries.
Dogharun has been open since the fall of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan in 2001. It is the major passage for the return of Afghan refugees and also for trade exchange between both countries.
The same diplomatic sources say that implementation of Resolution 1441 is limited to removal of WMDs in Iraq, whereas President Bush's administration wants, in addition to that, to overthrow Saddam Hussein's regime, which will not be achieved through implementation of the mentioned resolution.
On the other hand, Arab states will stand against an unjustified strike launched by the U.S. against Iraq. In fact, such a strike will embarrass friendly Arab states, because they approved Resolution 1441 to spare Iraq a destructive war, not to expose it to the danger of such a war despite approval of that resolution and facilitating its implementation procedures.
British journalist Patrick Seal said in an interview that "U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell scored a remarkable victory within President Bush's administration over the neo-conservative wing and the Zionist extremists, who have an unrealistic geopolitical imagination."
From the information provided by the same sources, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell reassured his French counterpart De Villepin that Washington will allow a true Security Council discussion if International Chief Inspector Hans Blix reports to the Security Council an Iraqi challenge or deceptive attempt, and that President Chirac informed President Bush that if the Iraqi president defies the U.N., then France will be willing to consider overthrowing him.
Had this paper been written in Arabic, it would most probably have differed substantially in many of its items and concepts.
The good thing about this paper is that it unleashes imagination.
Somehow, it is a successor of "Al-Taif ideology" and also of applied diplomatic patterns and methods in formulating international decisions.
The pressing need for financial aid made that mind "glorify" external support in an official governmental document that should be maximally conservative in touching on any external matter.
Therefore, the government senses exceptional superiority in its autumn years, to the extent of feeling no anxiety in pronouncing glorification for such support, even if it is using it as a passage to states to urge them to lend a helping hand.
Is it truly the audacity of revealing facts, or is it that the government confiscates opposition discourse to contain the opposition internally while soliciting support from abroad?
However, if it is only valid on the basis of partial criteria of this hypothetical plan, then the paper heading for Paris will, regardless of its yield, be transformed into a ministerial statement preceding the formation of his fifth government. Most probably, the Lebanized interpretation of the paper at that time will ascribe to the required external financial support the attribute of "necessary and temporal."
Ha'arts published an editorial yesterday under the title "Searching For a Way And Searching For a Leader," in which it summarized the current picture inside Likud and Labor: "Two political events took place simultaneously the day before yesterday and gave a good synopsis of the start of the Knesset election battle."
"The impression was that this support was maintained after the speeches were delivered."
"He seemed to rely as of now on unprecedented coordination between the Israeli government and the U.S. administration and was capable of allowing himself to mock slogans and magical solutions."
"His popularity revealed by polls as a new figure with no link to politics might transform with the continued battle into a burden when he is required to deal with the complex and intricate political status quo."
Amid the rumbling quake at the edge of the Middle East and the Gulf, and at a time when the world from end to end seems obsessed by the Iraqi issue and the consequences it might leave behind affecting the regional situation and international balances, it seems interesting, nay captivating, that the superiors should open parentheses of attention for Lebanon.
It is now confirmed that 17 countries, among which are major states, and eight financial institutions of international weight are going to the French capital to participate in Lebanon's support conference. This in itself is sufficient to give the event special significance. It might be important for us to recall another current fact at this point, which is that George Bush has not managed so far to gather 17 countries behind him to establish a coalition to wage war against Iraq.
Additionally, it must provide political "advice" based on principles of reinforcing cooperation, rather than struggles, between states and the expansion of supportive friendship horizons instead of releasing winds of hatred and hostility.
The conference will undoubtedly score financial success, otherwise Jacques Chirac would not have personally sponsored that demonstration, and a number of countries including the U.S. would not have agreed to participate in it.
Rajih Al-Khuri
Minister Al-Shar' is undoubtedly performing magnificently in this regard, at least within the limits allowed by the programmed ambiguity of Syrian policy.
No wonder, as Lebanese consumption talk is at a standard between two standards.
In the first place, there is no room for releasing any purposeful and clear "external" talk from Lebanon, as long as the "Lebanese arena" remains the preferred location for Syrian ambiguity.
For example, it is a characteristic of Lebanese consumption that Lebanon is most probably the only country in the world where Syrian talk about not participating in "a U.S.-led international coalition to attack Iraq beyond the U.N. framework" bears any meaning.
On the contrary, as long as the United States prefers to keep away from the Lebanese headache, it will not hesitate to reward Syria if necessary.
Here, undoubtedly, will be the biggest test for Lebanese consumption talk. It is thus not surprising that Minister Al-Shar' should start practicing it while waiting for the return.
While the cabinet was absent in its ordinary session yesterday from the conference rounds with its members' working paper published before holding the conference, the electricity issue was present in the Higher Privatization Council that was held after the cabinet.
The technical report, which is being handled by an engineering firm.
Baydhon dismissed the possibility of raising the 40% share, which is currently offered for tender.
Establishment of the two companies is planned for the first quarter of 2003 and after the government sells 40% of the first company's shares to a private partner before mid-2003.
In parallel with the working line of the Paris 2 conference on the 23rd of this month, the governmental workshop continues to achieve the internal pledges committed by Lebanon before the external world to obtain its aid for the government's program for financial correction, privatization, and structural reform.
Of these reports, he specified three: the financial report, which is being prepared by the auditor.
He added, "If any delay is caused by the accounting audit, it will not exceed one month, and then privatization of electricity can be started in January 2003."
Chinese Prseident Jiang Zemin stepped aside from the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party at the end of its sixteenth General Conference. His deputy, Hu Jintao, is expected to be elected as his successor today.
Maronite Patriarch to Rome on Sunday; Patriarch Council Re-elects Father Nasr General Preacher for Prisons
With regard to the Council's meetings yesterday, the following information was released:  At nine o'clock this session was started with morning prayers, and its proceedings were coordinated by Bishop Gi Boulos Najeem, where the outcomes of the four discussion forums of yesterday's topic "Universities in Lebanon and Higher Education" were reviewed, and the conferees discussed the practical suggestions in this regard.
Bishop Kameel Zeidan then highlighted a number of aspects of the relationship between private schools and state institutions through laws, decrees, decisions, and ministerial circulars. He recalled the initiatives taken by the Catholic Schools Secretariat for cooperation and participation with the state in the education policy at the administration and curriculum levels.
He also talked about the Union of Higher Education Institutions in Lebanon.
MP Faris Buwez expressed a view that "the importance of Resolution 1441 lies in blocking the way of American unilateral action and its postponement of a previously made war decision and preparations that had advanced far ahead."
"The importance of this resolution also lies in the fact that it postponed a war decision that was previously made and preparations that had advanced far ahead."
"With the intelligence of its position, Syria has also contributed to the prevention of establishing a principle suggesting that war can be waged in isolation of international legitimacy."
"For Paris 2, we have to secure a political truce that will induce internationally required confidence to make it as successful as possible."
Fadl-Allah was speaking during a fast-breaking banquet held by the Islamic Religious Education Society in Al-Batoul Secondary School in Bi'r Hassan.
He added: "Why were we confused when the cultural and media attack was launched on the issue of the terrorism of Islam, or what is called fundamentalism and so forth?"
"The only result is more taxes, more debts and financial encumbrances, poverty, and the results of poverty."
He noted, "The people cannot endure any new taxes. Any official who says that the people can endure that is asked to kindly present the figures he has."
* In a fast-breaking banquet held in the Marriott hotel in Al-Jinah, MP Nazim Khuri said, "Lebanon is an exceptionally constitutional country based on accord, consultation, and wisdom."
* Al-Imam Al-Sadr Foundations held a fast-breaking banquet for ladies in the Venecia hotel. Among the attendees were Mrs. Muna Al-Herawi and the wives of ministers and MPs, and women figures.
Minister of Public Works and Transport Najeeb Miqati praised Kuwait's "standing as Emir and government by Lebanon at all times, particularly in difficult phases, reconstruction, rebuilding, and economic revival."
An agreement was then made to resume discussions during the visit to be made by Miqati to Kuwait next January.
The discussions dealt with the importance of expediting ratification of the air and sea transport agreement signed between the two countries, because of its positive ramifications on the economic movement.
He also met with a delegation from the Steelyard Merchants Association of Lebanon presided over by Association Chairman Arsilan Sno.
Miqati delivered a speech in which he stressed the importance of cooperation between the Ministry of Public Works and Transport and the Ministry of Preparation and Housing in France. He emphasized commitment to the conference recommendations with a view to making maintenance more effective and developing its performance.
On the opposition front, and specifically Qirnat Shahwan, the internal media mud-slinging between its seniors and the withdrawal of its national bloc leader Carlos Idda from it have not cleared its general skepticism that the authority's war against it continues.
It is also their view that continuity of its statements' high ceiling did not hide its experienced state of confusion, with which it needs to draft a new policy based on profit and loss assessment of the past few months and on setting a new working strategy for the future.
1- Halting campaigns between Qirna members through the media.
The Qirna is currently absent from all active issues, and it would be useful, according to those, for it "to regain its role on the opposing political level with a new strategy based on comprehensive calculations."
It is their view that "these three major stations will be open for dealing by political rivals except the Qirna, which has isolated itself from any internal entitlement."
"Anything else will not exceed the limits of casual meetings bearing no practical interpretation."
Lahud was speaking yesterday morning upon receiving Beirut Attorneys Association Chairman Rimon Shedid and Antoine Akl, the new International Attorneys Union,  on the occasion of his election at the conference held in Sydney on the Union's diamond jubilee.
"We celebrated its diamond jubilee in Sydney (Australia)."
Shedid mentioned that Akl raised in his speech the issue of dangers threatening humanity and said: "The United Nations and its Security Council are paralyzed. Their decisions are enforced on some and are not applied to others. The same crimes against humanity are penalized for some and permissible for others. Identical war crimes are cruelly penalized for some, while disgraceful silence is exercised in their regard for others. States that have lifted the torch of liberty and justice high are setting legislation that are fatal to public liberties and human rights."
Within an hour, the cabinet restricted its discussion to an agenda out of which it approved 24 of 27 original items. They did not touch on the Lebanese work paper to the Paris-2 conference, which was distributed to the ministers for review, nor on the issue of the diesel-powered van owners' picketing, or to any other political issue, which made a number of ministers raise various remarks.

Parliamentary figures are of the opinion that the proposed exemption from payment of electricity and water bills will encourage nonpayment in hope of further exemption.
The Agency started operation on May 1, 1950.
And today, UNRWA is considered the major source of basic services in the areas of education, health, social services, and relief for Palestinian refugees registered with the agency in the Middle East.
The refugee camps are the pivot of the agency's operations in its operating areas.
In addition to that, seldom do the voluntary contributions that fund the agency's programs match the increasing needs of the Palestinian people.
Vocational centers provide youth refugees with skills required by the market, while the teachers house trains teachers qualified to teach in the agency's schools.
It also provides some assistance in secondary healthcare, particularly in emergencies, through a contract with non-governmental and private hospitals or though partial payment of medication costs.
In the recent years, UNRWA has faced an increasing deficit in its budget, and its resources have constricted.
UNRWA head offices are in Gaza and Amman.
Those who exploit existing disagreements are the enemies of Lebanon and are planting dissension and rifts internally and externally.
3- As to national unity, you can speak as much as you wish of the "state of institutions," starting with the honorable ministers who yell at one another and publicly exchange serious accusations, occasionally more than once a week. The only thing they have in common is the spirit of sacrifice to remain in the ruling paradise to serve public interests.
Dialog?
The hopes of political tradesmen who are accustomed to seeing transgression without blinking in continuing to enjoy the delights of their proceeds are the same as the hopes of barren land for rain, a sterile woman for offspring, and a seriously ill person for recovery.
On the bridge known as Chevrolet Bridge, connecting Al-Hazimia Quarantine, which passes over Al-Maklas road, the lower front layer is sheared and the front collapsed on what was underneath it. (...) Considerable time has passed with this condition without action from the concerned authorities to repair the damage.
Is the road passing under the bridge elevated above its level due to repetitively paved layers of asphalt, which affected in turn the elevation of the bridge above the surface of the earth?
After the relics went inside the Monastery's church, believers hurried to get their blessings and for prayers.
Ramiz Ismail, "Al-Nahar" correspondent in Baalbak, wrote that the relics traveled Wednesday-Thursday nights in Christian villages in Baalbak's provinces and especially Marunite ones after a wait for about 5 to 8 hours, during which people of all ages were waiting for her outside their homes to receive her and get their blessings from her.
All apologies.
Finally he said, "Restoration of the South from the grip of Israeli occupation is restoration of the Arab dignity."
The sales price of state property totaled tens of billions of dollars, but instead of fulfilling its external debts, these debts were multiplied by a factor of sixteen. This is because corruption and bribery among the political layer and the administration absorbed those billions, and the state was on the verge of bankruptcy, thus losing its assets and multiplying its debts, while the middle class was eradicated and poverty prevailed.

Iraqi "Oppositions" and Resolution 1441: Cautious Welcome
"Or as a second option, the tyrant of Baghdad can continue with his illusions and calculations and obstruct the inspections teams, thus causing more Iraqi innocents to be exposed to death."
As to whether compliance with the resolution would dismiss the war phantom, Talibani says, "It dismisses war but does not strike it out, because Saddam is obliged to change the regime according to a law issued by the Congress during the term of President Bill Clinton."
The Iraqi Turkmenistan organization Islamic Union of Iraqi Turkmenistan, which represents Shiite Turkmenistan Iraqis, commented on Resolution 1441 by saying that this resolution is booby-trapped in each one of its lines and does not prevent a war or a U.S. military attack against the regime.

In a short speech, Tarbiya confirmed that the Arab Banks Union, the headquarters  of which is in Lebanon, is closely and with deep concern monitoring the events and development, "as Lebanon will host this year the two most important conferences in the area, those being the Arab Summit and the Francophone States Summit, and the most important international financial conference will be held for it in Paris."
"Were it not for your endurance, Lebanon would never have arrived at the Paris 2 conference that it deserved." He emphasized that the support that will be authorized by Paris 2 for Lebanon is neither charity nor aid, "but rather a fundamental investment in regional peace and security for an influential country in the Middle East area that deserves attention and care from the international community."

She shows, as she really is, the perfect creature ever.
When the angel appeared to the Nazareth Virgin and said to her unfamiliar words, this ideal agreed and said: "Cheer, O Woman Full Of Grace."
Acknowledging that the Virgin Mary is the one upon whom an endless grace is headed means that the ideal of which she has been known is not a goal she reached by her hard work and persistence but accepted it from God and has totally adhered to.
She is a chosen creature, free from any sin and full of grace, according to what the Angel Gabriel said.
No wonder, then, to see our mother the sacred church surrounded, since the day Christianity was founded, by a halo of respect, estimation, and honor.
A Yemeni official confirmed yesterday that Sana'a received the shipment of 15 Northern Korean Scud missiles, which was intercepted then released by the United States at sea. In addition, Yemeni President Ali Abd-Allah Saleh starts on Monday an official visit to Moscow on invitation from his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to hold talks on bilateral relations, the Palestinian issue, and the situation in Iraq.
According to military sources in Aden, the Yemeni army possesses "20 Scud missile launching pads provided by the former Soviet Union in the early eighties."
It was then found that the missiles were being sent to Yemen.
Sana'a is trying to clear itself of its image as a safe haven for extremist Islamists and had detained ten suspected of being members of the Al-Qaeda organization in a huge campaign, as part of the U.S.-led war on "terrorism."
In June, Yemen received the first batch of MIG 29 aircraft from Russia.
The Two Koreas Clear Mines to Facilitate Ground Transportation; Pyongyang Bears "Deep Hatred" Toward Washington, Getting Ready for Confrontation, and Fighting a "Deadly and Challenging" Battle; Deep Hatred; Mine Clearing
He said, "We believe it is important that we all tell North Korea that it cannot hope to develop its relations with the rest of the world unless it eliminates these programs that aim at proliferation of nuclear arms in the Korean peninsula."
In the light of American threats, a comment made by the ruling party in Pyongyang and published in the "Rudong Sinmon" newspaper stated, "The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is not disturbed, because it made full preparations for confrontation and combat with the Americans."
Clearing mines to construct railways and freeways in two passages in the demilitarized zone is one of several projects between the two Korean divisions.

Akbar said that Karzai "will emphasize the need for more aid, particularly with regard to reconstruction."
He said that this force, which will take the province of Paktia in the country's south- east as its base, will be the first Afghan force to participate directly in the campaign that is led by the United States against "terrorism."
Karzai says that constructing a national army is a basic priority to assist Kabul in tightening its grip on the area beyond control of the central government.
Included in the statement was that two aircraft of the Harrier type belonging to the Marines were sent from the Bagram base north of Kabul to secure aerial support, but it was not possible to find the attackers.
The source did not reveal the specific role of the international organization in the process.
His name was mentioned in a list of 150 terrorists pursued by the Egyptian authorities, published in early 2001.
It said that he lost one of his two legs and two eyes in a mine explosion during his participation in a "military operation," without specifying the place of this operation and its time or its nature.
Tehran Repeats Invitation to Nuclear Agency to Visit the Two Sites of Natanz And Araq
He said that Tehran itself reported in September about the building of facilities and issued the invitation to visit them.
He scoffed at the American accusations and said that it is not appropriate to talk about "a new discovery" in the issue of Araq and Natanz, emphasizing that Iran entered talks with the International Nuclear Energy Agency in this regard and that "all Iranian nuclear activities are subject to the observation of the International Nuclear Energy Agency."
Iranian newspapers saw in the issue an attempt by Washington to divert American public opinion from internal problems and international public opinion from the "massacres against the Palestinians" and the failure in the campaign to combat terrorism.
Delegates of the permanent NATO council ratified Friday night, at the end of a long day of discussions, an agreement regarding establishment of permanent relations between the European Union and NATO that the Europeans were pursuing for years.
He welcomed this as a "vital event in the history of relations between the Union and NATO."
The agreement between NATO and the European Union was suspended recently due to the objection of Turkey, a NATO member-state and Union non-member, after Ankara demanded guarantees that the European rapid response force will not move against its interests in Cyprus and the Aegean Sea.
Robertson said, "The possibility of the European Union using NATO means in planning for military missions presided by the European Union have become ensured as of this moment."
He said in a press conference held before delivering his speech in the Royal Edinburgh Society in Scotland that "more special forces are definitely necessary."
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez announced that he is willing to use foreign oil workers in an attempt to end a strike that was started by the opposition 12 days ago and resulted in paralyzing Venezuela's oil exports.
He said after meeting with the leaders of the government and the opposition, "We believe that if this crisis does not find a quick solution, then we will be on the verge of chaos."
He told reporters, "I know nothing about any statement and therefore cannot give an opinion."
He said, "Nothing and no one can hinder the current boom in our oil industry."
They say that they will not return to work except after the President's resignation.
Pollution of Egyptian Water by Israel Stirs Storm In Cairo
The issue had exploded after statements made by North Sinai Governor General Ahmad Abd Al-Hameed late last week; he revealed in them the aggravation of the problem of polluting the coasts and water of the sea opposite the Egyptian city of Rafah because for more than a year the Israeli side deliberately discharged tons of sewerage wastes of Gaza Strip settlements along the coasts of the Egyptian city. This obliged the governorate authorities to restrict fishing in the area completely because of severe pollution that seriously affected the fish and marine life.
As to those who stayed, symptoms have started to appear on many of them of different diseases, such as intestinal infections, rashes, acute dermatitis, eye inflammation, respiratory difficulties, and others.
Al-Chalabi (57 years old), descending from an affluent family of bank owners, managed in spite of his conviction on a charge of embezzlement in Jordan to become one of the most prominent Iraqi opposition figures known in Washington, to the point of assuming the post of president of the Iraqi National Conference participating in the opposition meeting in London.
In spite of that, his efforts were what led in 1992 to the joining of several opposition movements, particularly of the Shiite and also of the Sunnis and among them the Kurds, to the the Iraqi National Conference.
However, Al-Chalabi's relationships and contacts contributed to make changing the regime in Iraq among the objectives of the Democratic government presided over by Bill Clinton in 1998, despite the reluctance of this administration to interfere in Iraq.
But Al-Chalabi asserted that he was the victim of a conspiracy plotted by Saddam Hussein who was then on good terms with the Jordanian regime, and Muhammad Saeed Al-Nabulsi who was governor of the Jordanian Central Bank.
One of his most prominent supporters is Richard Pearl, member of former President Ronald Reagan's administration, and who is close to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.
Media in the 15 member-states of the European Union unanimously hailed yesterday a new European Union consisting of 25 states, expressing at the same time their concern about the challenges that will be created by this expansion process, while the newspapers of the potential member-states expressed their enthusiasm to join.

This blast focused light on the instability in the province, which is being administered by the United Nations since1999 after the air war that was waged by NATO to stop the Serbian repression of the province's inhabitants, most of whom are of Albanian origin.
The Child and the Emperor
And from this advice is generated the ability to differ even with Heneidi herself.
Because the start is with the innocent minds, before their pages are filled with the ink of hypocrisy.
Starting with "a hand you cannot bite, kiss and pray that it be broken" to "a door that brings you wind, close and relax," passing by "lying is the adornment of men" in conjunction with "fleeing is two-thirds of manhood," appended to "a clever person dies not," all the way to "an adventurer is never praised even if he comes out safely."
- As to the saying of the poet, "And aspirations are not obtained with wishes," it does not mean in this world of ours diligence and perseverance on the straight path.
The story of the child and emperor, if we retell it, becomes as follows:
After Becoming Two Partners and the Government Converted to Fuel for Their Relationship, the Cabinet Flotation Embarrasses Lahud and Targets Al-Hareeri
The cabinet did not succeed over the past two years to assume the safety valve role in the vacillating relations between the two presidents to an extent that it became a captive of political and personal temperaments.
1- That the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister agreed more than a year and a half ago following the last vote in the cabinet on the "Solidaire" project, to "regulate" their management of the cabinet's operations in isolation from it, and this is what was expressed by their agreement not to include any item on the agenda that they have not approved.
2- Despite the lessons of democracy inspired by the government composition after the 2000 elections being a government representing in fact the political balances that emerged from those elections, and hence expresses the force of the majority that succeeded in controlling the parliament.
It might also be necessary to remind, at least in the secondary elections in Al-Matn, of the necessity of confrontation between both presidents by mediation through their ministers, the most prominent of whom is Minister of Interior Elias Almur.
3- There is something that falls under the necessity of what is not necessary to reconfirm, which is that the President of the Republic who is keen on attending all sessions of the cabinet and presiding over them-and that is his constitutional right- deals with the role of the cabinet as an actual partner in it more than an arbitrating president.
Whether Hans Blix agrees or refuses, the tasks of his team operating in Iraq will turn from inspection for chemical and germ weapons to searching for asylum seekers who usually envisage the "American dream."
And if the previous statements set the bet on some scientists whispering in the ears of Blix and his group, Lugar went directly to the "target": providing safe haven for the Iraqi scientists and their families in return for disclosing the secrets of Saddam Hussein's arms programs.
And it is no secret that Condoleezza Rice is personally presiding over a team working to develop a plan to access the Iraqi experts who can lead the inspectors to the sites of weapons.
In any case, the American response to the "Iraqi report" that Washington is moving toward convicting Saddam because of several missing links in the report, is a conviction that needs the testimony of scientists and reports by witnesses for it to be conclusive and to help Bush in drawing the reluctant into war.
No one needed to wait for the American reactions to the "Iraqi report" to discover that matter, because it was absolutely clear even before the arrival of the inspectors in Baghdad that the basic bet is not based on the element of searching for the "needle" of weapons of mass destruction in a huge stack of Iraqi geographic "hay," but rather on the element of exploring for the secrets in the chests of Iraqis, who can lead the inspectors to those weapons if they exist and reveal to them the secrets and information they know about them.
To that end, Blix announced that he does not want to turn into an official in charge of an "asylum agency" that attracts Iraqi scientists, because basically he leads a team searching for prohibited weapons and not for scientists who want to exit the "Garden of Eden."
Information leaked out of the American administration last Thursday, confirming a name list of 500 experts from among approximately 20,000 scientists, engineers, and technicians who previously participated in manufacturing the restricted Iraqi weapons.

The Secretary-General of the High Council for Privatization Ghazi Yusuf reported to "Al-Nahar" last night that "the next stage after signing the ownership contract was delayed because of the developments in the negotiations between the Minister of Telecommunications and the two companies Celles and Lebancell.
Amman-"Al-Nahar":
He stressed in an interview with the "Neue Zuricher Zeitung" that "we are negotiating with the European Union with regard to an agreement on the taxes that the Union is trying to impose on saving in Switzerland and not about banking confidentiality, which is not negotiable."
It is planned to resume negotiations next January.
Palestinian President Yassir Arafat was asked about these statements, and he replied that he informed the international parties and particularly the U.S. administration ...
And now what, after the transfer of the sector ownership to the state?
He mentioned that "the previous preparatory announcement for bidding attracted 19 expressions of interest from Arab and international companies."
After the Chairman of the Company Salah Bu Raad announced, after the signing in front of reporters, that the collection document that was issued by the state previously and not executed will be referred to international arbitration to the time of issuing the arbitration award and implementing it, he added that an agreement has been made to "include that in a letter that was attached to the contract and signed by both parties."
Amman Detains Two Accused of Assassinating Foley and Confirms Their Confession of Their Affiliation With Al-Qaeda; Israeli Concern
The Minister of State for Political Affairs, Minister of Information, the official spokesman in the name of the government Dr. Muhammad Affasg Al-Adwan reported in an official statement transmitted by the Jordanian News Agency Petra that "General Intelligence had arrived at information leads about the organization that stands behind the crime and refrained from revealing them early for intelligence and technical considerations related to completion of investigations and revealing the links of planning and execution."
The Minister mentioned that Al-Khalayla "provided them with machine-guns, a silencer gun, grenades, and cylinders of teargas that were smuggled into the Kingdom illegally and stored in a house rented for this purpose in the city of Al-Reseifa near Amman (...) and that arrangements were also made to attempt to smuggle a number of rockets into the Kingdom and provide them with an amount of 18,000 dollars out of an original 50,000 allocated for the execution of the mentioned program of missions and terrorist operations."
He emphasized that the two accused will be tried before the Jordanian judiciary, because "the crime occurred on Jordanian territory."
He stressed the pressing necessity of establishing greater "international cooperation" to confront the danger that is represented by the networks that are led by Usama bin Laden.
He explained during the opening of the fifth session of the workplace to activate the actions of non-governmental organizations in the center of the "social movement" in Pedaro yesterday, in the presence of deputy Ghassan Mkheiber and some representatives of non-governmental bodies and organizations.

Saadeh preached and talked about Hardini's life, which was spent in fasting, prayer, and meditation.

It was a good occasion for the classic music to accompany the first poem "Gharib" by Nadia Tueini, as an opera composed by Dr. Hotaf Khoury, performed by the Italian soprano Lara Mitilini, and played by the pianist Tatiana Berihak Khoury.
What a beautiful occupation, what a sweet compulsory union between the word, the melody, and the inattentive ear when the angelic singing surprises it, holding the message and calling to come into the conscience/emotional areas and make  "Al Ghareeb" (The Stranger) close and familiar; this stranger is the poetic "me" and "me" is whoever suffered and is suffering war, disasters, poverty, immigration problems, or deracination.
In fact, we have to point to the skills of the soprano Lara Martilini as she could, in a short time, memorize the poem and sing it while it is composed by a composer whose music is known at least as "not easy" and renewed with a writing style,  harmonic colors, and continuous moving between levels and degrees.
Might the singer be able to make all the Lebanese, Arab, and world listen to it so they would share our honor and joy?
Numan: Three Defects in Cellular Contract and Alternative is Managing not Privatizing Sector
"The first defect is that there is ambiguity and mystery surrounding the arbitration conditions in terms of the right of the state to demand all rights and indemnities rising from the violations committed by the two cellular companies since the start of executing the contract and specified by the Auditing Authority in its first report dated 6/21/1999 and its report addendum dated 7/19/2000 and which the two companies continued to commit to 8/31/2002, knowing that the rights and indemnities due in this regard are approximately one billion, 200 million U.S. dollars."
He said: "We appeal to the President of the country to adhere to his policy aimed at the conservation of public property by preventing the selling of the cellular to the private sector and replacing that with conducting a tender to select two new companies to manage the two cellular networks on behalf of the state in return for a fee."
Vice Chairman of Parliament Eli Farazly pointed out, The attempt to strip Bakraki of its political character at the current stage is even more damaging to the situation of Christians and the state. He also expressed his belief that Bakraki is the alternative to Christian extremism.
Regarding his relationship with President Emil Lahud, Al-Farazly said, I deal with President Lahud through the institutions. I also deal with everyone according to the Lebanese constitution. I call for constitutional preservation. I urge President Lahud to fulfill his oath of office.
In his opinion, the Syrian presence in Lebanon, is related to the development of the Middle East settlement. It has regional consequences. Hence, it is not in our favor as Lebanese people that the Syrians move out of Lebanon. The issue will involve different security aspects if peace is settled in terms of fundamentalism, extremism, and the conflict with Israel.
He also emphasized that it is necessary that Bakraki continue to assume such a national role.
"It is extremely regretful that the Canadian ambassador committed such a grave mistake when he attempted to clarify the background of his governments decision. He argued that the decision is based on a statement made by the Secretary General (of Hezbollah, Al-Sayyed Hassan Nasr-Allah) on the al-Quds Day anniversary, in which he allegedly supported what the ambassador described as terror attacks not only in Israel but in other countries, too."
"'It is a political party known for that in Lebanon, and it is an organization struggling to liberate the Lebanese lands, particularly the Shebaa Farms region.'"
The General Secretariat of the Arab National Conference, the National-Islamic Conference Monitoring Committee, and the General Secretariat of the Arab Parties Conference issued a statement in Beirut describing the decision as clear bias toward the  American-Zionist alliance against Arabs and Muslims and the Nations right of self-defense and resistance to the occupation, which is a right granted by all international charters and resolutions.
He called upon all parties, powers, figures, and institutions of the civil community to express their resentment against any oppression or intolerance against Hezbollah and its firm commitment to resistance.
He called on young people not to yield to the logic of depression, because they are the hope of the future and will play a major role in it.
"This does not mean that someone who leads a certain operation or is active belongs to a certain group, while others are neglected."
He added: This is a point I would like to mention. In spite of all that is said about the situation and problems in Lebanon, these practices represent a sort of pressure on us as young people, in the context of our daily activities inside or outside the university. I do not encourage anyone to surrender to the logic of depression or to the status quo; in fact, I reject any such surrender that is due to a simplistic reason or that is far from reasonable consideration."
Replying to a question, Al-Aridi asserted that previously there was an Armenian bloc in the parliament, but today the Armenian bloc no longer exists. However, they are putting great efforts toward keeping up their demands for Armenian rights since our law allows that."
"I foresaw two serious issues: The first is political; what happened is unacceptable. The second is social; many families have lost their income, regardless of the mistakes made by MTV."

Notwithstanding our respect and fondness for you and Miss Khalifah, and our constant delight at the unique and distinguished media message carried by your newspaper, making it a pioneer in communicating the truth and reality, we have been forced to record some observations in response to errors contained in the investigation either in the words of Mr. Jadd Risha or in the way that the writer of the investigation broke up various responses that we had given, separating what we said from its context.
2- Risha's statement that "President Al-Jamil did not put forward a different political proposal in his statements, but his message was similar to that of the party, and from here we can see that the state of division was no more than a game of personal interests (...), which is evidence either of ignorance in the political reading or of no political reading whatsoever.
Our presence together in the arena of struggle for more than a year, and in a coordination committee that brings us together with the Free Patriots and the Free Nation Current, results in national awareness and kinship, which paves the way for the establishment of a united and strong society, one that those who like to play with strings and wires cannot deceive.
